Will .
I. Am is at it again , evangelizing Obama with another star - studded cast of Hollywood - types , showing off their love of the Democrat presidential candidate .
Included amongst the many performers on this video are Jessica Alba , Ryan Phillippe , George Lopez , John Leguizamo , Luis Guzman , and Macy Gray .
The last time he posted a video , it broke all records in terms of viral video growth , having over 10 million views in a single weekend .
This video , a direct sequel to the original , and filmed in the same style , is expected to reach similar proportions .
This one was released under will .i.am's new artist promotions site , DipDive , which he described as a project he 's working on to take advantage of viral promotion for new and old musicians alike , similar in the style of Radiohead 's breakout success , independent of major label promotion .
This is the third Obama - related project that will .i.am has undertaken ( the first , of course , being the " Yes , We Can " video ) , and the second being a video remix of the project called " HopeActChange .
" On a political note , this video , like the last one , tends to emphasize the more feel - good aspects of the Obama campaign , and is very light on any sort of communication in terms of what sort of policies Obama intends to affect should he be elected .
Several tech and political bloggers have noted that this may end up backfiring for the Obama campaign , as it promotes him as a candidate of nothing but feel - good language , as opposed to one of actual substance .
Still , to paraphrase the candidate himself , you can't really argue with the message of hope .
It is a strategy that appears to be working for him , and for will .i.am as well .
I had a chance to speak with will .i.am shortly after the launch of his first video on Mashable Conversations .

Wow , in a move that totally shocks me , the owners of the Million Dollar Wiki , one of the first money making Wiki sites , that even John Chow promoted is for sale .
The site has grossed over $ 100,000 , and has had thousands of pages added to it for $ 100 USD per page .
The owners are no handing it over to someone else because they can’t figure out a new way to market it to the masses , and continue to accrue their fortune .
This whole thing makes me a little sad , as a change of ownership almost always means a decrease in popularity , traffic and the other positive factors created by the original owners .
And despite the sellers saying that the site must remain live until 2022 , I doubt the new owners will necessarily honour everything the previous owners put forth .
Currently , the bid sites at $ 10,000 , and has ceased to continue to climb , after an initial rush of bids .
I am one of the many people that own a page on the Million Dollar Wiki , and earlier in its higher popularity days , it drove a fair bit of traffic to this site , now it gives me nothing , and with this sale , I wish I could just get my $ 100 investment back .
Update : See what I would do with the Million Dollar Wiki .
Scientists have known for more than 70 years that the one surefire way to extend the lives of animals was to cut calories by an average of 30 to 40 percent .
The question was : Why ?
Now a new study begins to unravel the mystery and the mechanism by which reducing food intake protects cells against aging and age - related diseases .
Researchers report in the journal Cell that the phenomenon is likely linked to two enzymes — SIRT3 and SIRT4 — in mitochondria ( the cell 's powerhouse that , among other tasks , converts nutrients to energy ) .
They found that a cascade of reactions triggered by lower caloric intake raises the levels of these enzymes , leading to an increase in the strength and efficiency of the cellular batteries .
By invigorating the mitochondria , SIRT3 and SIRT4 extend the life of cells , by preventing flagging mitochondria from developing tiny holes ( or pores ) in their membranes that allow proteins that trigger apoptosis , or cell death , to seep out into the rest of the cell .
" We did n't expect that the most important part of this pathway was in the mitochondria , " says David Sinclair , an assistant professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and a study co-author .
" We think that we 've possibly found regulators of aging . "
In 2003 Sinclair 's lab published a paper in Nature that described the discovery of a gene that switched on in the yeast cell in response to calorie restriction , which Sinclair calls a " master regulator in aging . "
Since then , his team has been searching for an analogous gene that plays a similar role in the mammalian cell .
The researchers determined from cultures of human embryonic kidney cells that lower caloric intake sends a signal that activates a gene inside cells that codes for the enzyme NAMPT ( nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase ) .
The two - to four - fold surge in NAMPT in turn triggers the production of a molecule called NAD ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) , which plays a key role in cellular metabolism and signaling .
The uptick in NAD levels activates the SIRT3 and SIRT4 genes , increasing levels of their corresponding SIRT3 and SIRT4 enzymes , which then flood the interior of the mitochondria .
Sinclair says he's not sure exactly how SIRT3 and SIRT4 beef up the mitochondria 's energy output , but that events leading to cell death are at the very least delayed when there are vast quantities of the enzymes .
SIRT3 and SIRT4 are part of a family called sirtuins .
( SIRT1 , which helps extend cell life by modulating the number of repair proteins fixing DNA damage both inside and outside the cell 's nucleus is also a member . )
SIRT is short for sir - 2 homologue — a well - studied protein that is known to extend yeast cell longevity .
According to Sinclair , all of the mammalian SIRT genes ( and their proteins ) are possible drug targets for therapies aimed at extending life , as well as staving off age - related illnesses , such as Alzheimer 's disease , cancers and metabolic disorders , like diabetes .
" I think SIRT3 is the next most interesting sirtuin from a drug development standpoint , " Sinclair says .
" It does protect cells , but there 's growing evidence that it may mediate the benefits of exercise as well . "
Sinclair 's lab is now working on developing what he calls a possible " supermouse " with elevated levels of NAMPT to see if it lives longer and is more disease - resistant than normal mice .
Matt Kaeberlein , a pathologist at the University of Washington in Seattle , says that Sinclair 's team has an interesting hypothesis connecting the mitochondria to longevity , but that it needs to be more directly tested in the context of dietary restriction .
" If the NAMPT - overexpressing mice are long - lived and disease resistant , that will provide more support for this idea . "
For his part , Sinclair is eager to see the results of his experiments with the supermouse .
" Depending on how this mouse turns out , " he says , " we may put NAMPT on the list of drug targets , as well . "
According to a new report , Nintendo of Japan is planning on withdrawing forthcoming television advertisements following continued mass supply shortages of the Wii , as it raises yearly worldwide shipping estimates to 17.5 million .
The Times Online report quotes a spokesman for the company saying continued demand " has been unprecedented and higher than Nintendo could ever have anticipated . "
As such , the spokesman says the company will be " looking at moving some advertising on some products into early 2008 " as it wants to " act responsibly .
"
The Times report also notes that Nintendo now says it will ship 17.5 million units of the console worldwide this year , up from prior estimates of 14 million noted in Screen Digest research
As of this October , the Wii found itself back on top of U.S. hardware sales with some 519,000 consoles sold , as Wii Fit raises weekly console sales in Japan .
BY THE NUMBERS 74,000 Number of employees offered buyouts - all of GM's U.S. hourly workers represented by UAW .
$ 62,500 Incentive offered to skilled workers who agree to retire .
$ 45,000 Incentive offered to production employees who agree to retire .
$ 140,000 Cash payout offered to employees with 10 + years of service who agree to quit and cut all ties to GM .
$ 78.21 Hourly labor costs , including benefits , for current GM workers .
$ 26.65 Hourly labor costs for new GM hires .
Sources : GM , Center for Automotive Research
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In an effort to shave ongoing losses , General Motors offered lucrative buyouts Tuesday to 74,000 employees - its entire U.S. hourly workforce .
The nation 's largest automaker announced the latest round of buyouts as it reported another loss on its core auto operations in the fourth quarter , which combined with charges taken earlier in the year left GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) with a company - record $ 38.7 billion net loss for 2007 .
To try to stem automotive losses that have dogged the company since 2005 , the company is making a range of offers , up to cash payments of $ 140,000 to the remaining 74,000 GM workers represented by the United Auto Workers union .
The goal is not to reduce headcount but rather to bring in new workers at a lower cost .
About 46,000 of the GM employees are eligible to retire today and they can take pension incentives worth between $ 45,000 to $ 62,500 to retire .
In addition there are inducements for those who are within five years of retirement to leave early and receive benefits .
Those who leave and agree to sever all ties with the company - including giving up lucrative pension and health care coverage - will receive a lump sum of $ 140,000 if they have 10 years of service .
They will receive $ 70,000 if they have less than 10 years of service .
" We 've worked with our UAW partners to ensure our employees have a variety of attractive options to consider , " GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner said in a statement .
" The special attrition program is an important initiative that will help us transform the workforce . "
The savings GM is likely to see with this offer are substantial .
The Center for Automotive Research estimates that by 2011 GM 's hourly workforce will be only 8 % smaller than current levels - but more than four out 10 of those workers will be new hires being paid a lower wage rate .
The current veteran UAW member at GM today has an average base wage of $ 28.12 an hour , but the cost of benefits , including pension and future retiree health care costs , nearly triples the cost to GM to $ 78.21 , according to the Center for Automotive Research .
By comparison , new hires will be paid between $ 14 and $ 16.23 an hour .
And even as they start to accumulate raises tied to seniority , the far less lucrative benefit package will limit GM 's cost for those employees to $ 25.65 an hour .
Lucrative buyout packages are not new at GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and rival U.S. automakers Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC .
GM offered similar deals to all its U.S. workers in 2006 .
That package helped it pare U.S. hourly employment by nearly 40,000 in the past two years .
Ford and Chrysler also have the provision in their new contracts to pay new hires less in salary and benefits .
But their workforces are not nearly as old as the UAW membership at GM , so they may end up seeing less turnover in their hourly staff .
Ford has its own buyout offer out to all its remaining 54,000 hourly U.S. workers .
The proposal was announced last month when the company reported a fourth - quarter loss .
Privately owned Chrysler has offered buyout packages to hourly employees at targeted plants , but has not make a companywide offer .
Fourth - quarter results
GM unveiled its latest cost - cutting moves as it reported a narrow profit of $ 46 million , or 8 cents a share , excluding special items , in the fourth quarter .
The adjusted earnings were far better than the loss of 54 cents a share that analysts surveyed by earnings tracker Thomson First Call had forecast , but worse than the year - ago result of a $ 180 million profit , or 32 cents a share .
But the profit in the most recent quarter was due primarily to a $ 1.6 billion tax benefit .
GM would have otherwise lost about $ 2.75 a share in the period excluding items , although First Call and analysts are not likely to exclude that gain when comparing results to forecasts .
Including special items , the company reported a quarterly net loss of $ 722 million , or $ 1.28 a share .
That compares to net income of $ 950 million , or $ 1.68 a share , it posted in the year - ago period .
Concerns by traders that the company 's actual performance was worse than it seemed at first blush sent shares down 1.7 % in pre-market trading .
But shares swung to a gain of 1.5 % in late - morning trading after the company 's call discussing its results and outlook in more detail .
The company saw strong vehicle sales , as automotive revenue hit a record $ 46.7 billion , easily topping forecasts of $ 44.4 billion .
But the company 's automotive profit - loss performance took a step backwards most of its regions around the globe .
The company posted a $ 803 million fourth quarter pretax loss in its auto unit , compared to a narrow $ 8 million profit on that basis a year earlier .
The worsening performance was due to its core North American operations , where industrywide sales were weak in the period .
North American plants lost $ 1.06 billion in the period on that basis , compared to only a $ 129 million loss a year earlier .
The company also saw pretax losses grow in its European operations and profits decline in the Asia - Pacific region that has become increasingly important for the company 's fortunes .
But improved pretax profits in GM's Latin America - Africa - Middle East region more than balanced out the worsening performance in the other overseas regions .
MOSCOW  Garry Kasparov , the opposition leader and former chess champion , said Wednesday that he had been forced to withdraw his candidacy for president of Russia because his political movement had been unable to rent a hall in Moscow for a nominating convention , a requirement under Russian law .
A spokeswoman for Mr. Kasparov said the Kremlin had pressed landlords to refuse to rent to his organization , Other Russia , a problem his campaign confronted before when it tried to hold political meetings .
Mr. Kasparov , who retired from professional chess in 2005 , accuses the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of undermining the democratic institutions established after the Soviet Union ’s collapse .
From early on , his campaign encountered many problems .
He was denied access to state news media ; one of his political organizers was forcibly committed to an insane asylum ; and Mr. Kasparov and dozens of his followers were arrested during street protests during the spring .
Conceptual Chunking in Perl
...
Typically , Perl programmers feel that they can write code that is more readable in Perl than in other languages , because they have freedom of choice in how to " chunk " the problem ( to borrow a term from cognitive science ) .
you have posted on this topic extensively , and i think there is much to discuss in there .
but i find this little bit bewildering : what on earth are you talking about ?
does [ eg ] python offer less " freedom of choice " to " chunk " a problem ?
how so ?
Okay , people have asked for such examples before , and I have n't responded , because the idea of chunking is pervasive in Perl and I could n't figure out where to start . :-)
But here goes ...
Psychologically speaking , " chunking " is the ability to reduce the complexity of a problem by making foreground / background or inside / outside distinctions and concentrate on one or the other .
As such , the main enabler is the ability to define and recognize boundaries between foreground and background , between inside and outside .
Classically , languages provide relatively few ways to make boundaries , ranging from the highly abstract object , down through modules and functions , clear down to loop abstractions , formatting conventions , statement delimitation , parenthesizing and quoting .
Perl is roughly equivalent to Python on more abstract levels , with some differences .
Perl provides closures , while Python goes more deeply into some of the metaclass stuff ( both of which I think are benign but relatively useless to mere mortals ) .
I think the Perl module mechanism is a little more flexible than Python 's - - it 's sufficiently general that I also use it for the pragma mechanism , because the semantics of importation are under the module 's control , and the normal importation is merely a matter of reusing the standard export implementation .
The user has a lot of flexibility in deciding which parts of a module 's definitions should be defined how ( in C or Perl ) and when ( immediately or lazily ) .
There 's flexibility in choosing between lexical and dynamic scoping .
There 's flexibility in choosing early or late binding .
You can change inheritance on the fly , if you like .
You can use objects where they make sense , and avoid them where they do n't .
All of this affects how you decompose your problem , and that in turn gives you flexibility in chunking .
On a less abstract level , Perl lets you choose the psychological boundaries of loops , for instance .
You can name a loop according to what it is processing .
A name is a high - powered way of hiding an abstraction , mentally speaking :
LINE : while ( <>) { next LINE if /^#/ ; # Discard comments .
print ; }
In my mind , I can now pigeonhole that as the LINE loop , and reduce it to a single little lump of cybercrud , even if the loop is 582 lines long .
Alternately , you can go with a more customary loop , which gives a different psychological " feel " :
while ( <>) { next if /^#/; # Discard comments .
print ; }
Since it 's an anonymous loop , I now rely psychologically more on how it looks on the screen visually .
It has an easily seen beginning and end .
Things do n't just " peter out " as they do in languages that use indentation as syntax .
( Editorial opinion : the indentation scheme of Python is okay in small examples , but does n't scale very well .
It rapidly breaks down , visually and psychologically , as soon as you get any construct larger than a screen .
It 's all very well to argue , as some have argued , that you should never write a construct larger than a screen in Python , but then I 'll respond that my point about flexibility in chunking is thereby proven .
What if the user wants a chunk that is larger than the screen ?
Dangling , open - ended syntax is pretty useless at the discourse level .
I 'll go with Aristotle on that one . )
You can reduce a loop to one line to reduce its " significance " even further :
while ( <>) { print unless /^#/ }
You can even pretend there is n't a loop there :
print grep !/^#/ , <>;
You can delegate the loop to someone else :
print `grep - v '^ #'` ;
Well , that 's probably enough about " while " loops , though we could certainly go into the psychological difference between " while " loops , C - style " for " loops and " foreach " loops .
Linguistically , a foreach loop is functioning as a topicalizer for the interior of the loop .
foreach $ line ( @lines ) { print ; }
For mental flexibility , Perl gives you an anonymous form :
foreach ( @line ) { print }
Since " for " is a synonym for " foreach " in Perl , you sometimes even see it used strictly as a topicalizer for a single value !
for ( $ slurped_file ) {
s/5/6/g ; s/4/5/g ; s/3/4/g ; s/2/3/g ; s/1/2/g ; tr [ abc ] [ xyz ] ; print ; }
Moving on down the abstraction level , there is psychological value in having a single way to delimit statements , and making all whitespace equivalent .
This gives the user freedom in how to line things up vertically within a statement to enhance readability .
The notion of statement modifiers allows people to relegate unwanted psychological facts to the right side of the screen where they can be ignored .
Within statements , the whole notion of context in Perl is built around the concept that various operations are semantically " governed " by their surroundings .
The choice of whether to parenthesize says a lot about how the programmer thinks of it .
If the programmer wants to use the rest of the line as the scope , so to speak , you might see
return print reverse sort bynum values %hash ;
Someone who does n't like line scopes might write something more like
return print ( reverse ( sort bynum values ( %hash ) ) ) ;
Again , this is psychological flexibility .
Another person will choose the ( presumably ) equivalent
return print sort { $b < => $ a} values ( %hash ) ;
To this person , the sort subroutine is n't even a subroutine .
Interpolative contexts are important in Perl .
List operators do automatic list interpolation on their arguments .
Double - quoted strings ( and related contexts ) provide a very convenient chunking mechanism for hiding a lot of concatenation .
Variables in this context look just the same as they do in the rest of Perl - - that 's one reason I put $ and @ on variables in the first place .
( The other is that noun markers like $ and @ allow quick visual figure / ground distinctions , enhancing readability .
A Perl variable is also a kind of " chunk " . )
One could also write reams about the different ways to write a pattern match in Perl .
What other languages let you break up your regular expression chunks with both horizontal and vertical whitespace , and even comment each chunk , if you so desire ?
Or you can do as is traditionally done and visually encapsulate the whole unspeakable mess on a single line .
Finally , quote delimiters .
Forcing people to use just a few quote characters forces a lot of noise into a lot of programming languages .
Many UNIX languages suffer from backslashitis and leaning - toothpick syndrome .
Letting people pick their quote characters makes things a little harder for emacs , to be sure , but lets people encapsulate things visually the way they may be used to .
Why force someone to say
tr ( " abcdef\ " " , " ABCDEF ' " ) ;
when
tr [ abcdef " ] [ ABCDEF ' ] ;
is clearer , or even
tr [ abcdef " ] [ ABCDEF ' ] ;
And note how this interplays well with the free statement formatting .
On multi-line quotes , why force someone to use triple quote ( ugh ) ?
Why not make it easier for the person and harder for the computer , and let the user pick the trailing delimiter ?
At least the shell 's got this right .
Here 's a convenient mental trick .
If I know that the text I 'm dealing with contains no blank lines , I often use a blank line as my final delimiter .
So instead of saying
Hillary Clinton Bitches About Getting the First Question at the Debates
At last night ’s debate Hillary Clinton was asked the first question of the night , to which she responded :
“ Can I just point out in the last several debates , I seem to get the first question all the time , and I do n’t mind , I ’ll be happy to field them .
I just find it curious that I keep getting the first question on all the issues . ”
In other words - WWWWAAAAHHHHH , WWWWAAAAAHHHHHH , WWWWWAAAAAAHHHHH .
The Clinton campaign is in it ’s final throws , to quote Donald Rumsfeld on another issue , and this is what she has been reduced to , bitching about getting asked the first question too often .
It turns out that in the last ten debates she was asked the first question six times to Obama ’s four .
If my math is correct that would be 60 % of the time .
Hardly a significant number .
Is there a more perfect example of how Hillary reacts when things do n’t go her way ?
Last week we heard her scolding Barack Obama like a child who did a poopy in his pants with her “ shame on you ” quote , and now this week she whines like a little school girl because she was asked the first question .
Can we really trust this woman as commader - in - chief ?
This is a woman that is so used to getting her way that she does n’t know how to handle adversity and it has really been evident in the last two weeks .
This woman has shown that she is actually not mature enough to handle adverse situations .
And we know the upcoming years will be filled with many adverse situations .
As Hillary Clinton ’s campaign is crashing and burning I can’t help but smile , perhaps that says something about my maturity .
But I do n’t care , I ’m not running for office .
The Unintended Consequences of Foreign Aid : Theodore Dalrymple explains how Western policies have poisoned the water supplies of 70 million in Bangladesh
Posted by Theodore Dalrymple
Well - intentioned policies can have disastrous outcomes .
Theodore Dalrymple explains how philanthropic Western policies have poisoned the water supplies of up to 70 million in Bangladesh .
The home page of my internet service provider carries news stories .
The other day , I noticed two that were next to one another .
The first reported that there were record numbers of passes at high grades in the GCSEs , and the other reported that British employers were complaining that young Britons lacked basic skills such as the ability to read and add up .
Could these two phenomena be related in some way , I wondered ?
Reader , I think that possibly they could be related : indeed , the relationship is so obvious that it hardly needs elaboration .
The juxtaposition of stories is often interesting and instructive .
For example , in The Lancet for 11th August 2007 , there was a laudatory profile of Joseph Graziano , a pharmacologist and dean of research at Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health .
Professor Graziano heads a team that is trying to tackle arsenic poisoning from the consumption of well - water in Bangladesh .
His work , he said , was his life , and I am sure he was not exaggerating .
Such dedication is indeed beyond praise .
Six pages away from the profile was another item about the arsenic - poisoning in Bangladesh .
It carries a picture of a Bangladeshi man holding up his hands displaying " the characteristic blackening " of arsenic poisoning .
Two of the fingers of his right hand have been amputated because of arsenic - induced gangrene .
The text of the article begins with these words :
More than 70 million people in Bangladesh are estimated to be exposed to toxic levels of arsenic from their drinking water in what WHO has called the " largest mass poisoning of a population in history " .
The symptoms of long - term exposure ot arsenic begin with the blackening of the hands and feet , progressing to nodular growths , and later to open sores and gangrene .
Eventually , it can lead to cardiovascular and reproductive damage and to virulent cancers of the bladder , skin , lungs and liver .
In children , the exposure is also thought to lead to learning difficulties and other neurological effects .
Researchers � say that the arsenic poisoning could double Bangladesh 's cancer mortality rate within two decades .
Once people have been exposed for several years , conservatively estimated at a decade , the DNA damage almost guarantees that cancer is imminent .
You can't just make this a natural history of arsenic poisoning .
The sad irony is that the problem is the unintended consequence of a campaign in the 1970s and 1980s by international development organisations , including UNICEF , to get villagers to stop drinking dirty surface water .
For such a massive disaster , the response by international aid agencies has been small , especially since researchers estimate that substantial mitigation could be achieved for less than US $ 100 million .
The challenge now is to try to influence policies in Bangladesh , but very cautiously .
We do n't want to be a bunch of white guys going in and saying , " we know what to do " - the way the international agencies that promoted the original well - digging programme did .
one of the most wonderful experiences of my life ,
It all makes work for the working man to do .
Here are the effects :
And one of those researchers is reported as having said that :
What caused the largest mass poisoning of a population in history ?
After all , the people of East Bengal have not always suffered from arsenic poisoning .
Professor Graziano is reported as having remarked : No , indeed not - for , as we are told , relatively sotto voce as it were :
It was they who advised and paid for the wells that seem to have poisoned up to half the population of the country .
Let us perform a small thought experiment .
Let us suppose that a commercial mining company had , in the course of its operations , poisoned the water supply of 70,000,000 people in this quite specific way .
Would that have been regarded as " a sad irony " , an unintended consequence of its search for profit , or perhaps as something rather more sinister and indeed typical of the way such companies operate ?
Would there not have been large demonstrations , probably turning soon to violence , against that company by those in the developed world who habitually express their solidarity with the impoverished victims of exploitation by their own nations ' multinationals ?
It is unlikely that we would ever hear the end of the matter - in such a case , quite rightly .
When people buy their UNICEF Christmas cards , how many of them know what the organisation , and others like it , have wrought in Bangladesh ?
It is n't even as if such organisations feel any institutional guilt - The Lancet reports that :
In a way this is understandable .
As Professor Graziano puts it : As it happens , I do n't really believe that the situation in Bangladesh is a sad irony at all , though of course I do n't go as far as to say that it was wished by anybody .
I worked for a number of years in another country , Tanzania , in which foreign aid did , or at least permitted and actually paid for , a great deal of harm to be done .
It was foreign aid , and foreign aid alone , that enabled the government to remove a very high percentage of the rural population from where it was living and dump it in collectivised villages , as well as to destroy the viable commercial farming sector , thus condemning the country and its inhabitants , apart from senior members of the ruling party , to many years of quite unnecessary pauperdom .
As I quickly discovered in Tanzania and elsewhere , foreign aid offers a lucrative career in good working conditions to middle class people of the developed world who want a little adventure in their lives , and who would once have been colonial officers ; and it offers tempting opportunities for malversation of funds to their bureaucratic counterparts in the Third World .
This symbiosis is the natural consequence of asking precisely the wrong question : not where wealth comes from , but where poverty comes from .
As far as I am aware , not a single country has ever been lifted from poverty to prosperity by foreign aid , though no doubt many individuals have been so lifted .
I do not mean any personal asperity when I remark that , when Professor Graziano told The Lancet that working with the multidisciplinary team which is trying to solve the arsenic poisoning of Bangladesh wasI could not help but think of that line from the old Flanders and Swann song to the effect thatis a writer and worked for many years as an inner city and prison doctor .
That satellite that was shot down last night was bad news , even before it got off the ground .
The failed orbiter , USA - 193 , is widely believed to be part of a classified surveillance in space program known as Future Imagery Architecture , or FIA .
And FIA is known as one of the biggest defense - technology boondoggles in recent history – " perhaps the most spectacular and expensive failure in the 50 - year history of American spy satellite projects , " * The New York Times * once wrote .
FIA
was originally supposed to be a constellation of satellites using electro- optical and radar sensors to " gather clearer and more - frequent images – even at night and when there is a cloud cover – of enemy military activity than current satellites can , ”
the Los Angeles Times notes .
Initially scheduled to launch in 2005 , FIA looked like it might become the “ most expensive program in the history of the intelligence community , ”
according to Globalsecurity.org .
When Boeing won the FIA contract , back in 1999 , it was something of a coup .
Lockheed was the country 's big satellite builder , not Boeing .
As the Los Angeles Times
observes , the company " had little experience manufacturing satellites with optical lenses that can take close - up pictures from space of objects on the ground . ”
So it 's not surprising that Boeing 's technology just plain did n't work .
" Boeing ’s initial design for the optical system that was the heart of one of the two new satellite systems was so elaborate that optical engineers working on the project said it could not be built , " * The New York Times * writes .
" Engineers constructing a radar - imaging unit at the core of the other satellite could not initially produce the unusually strong radar signal that was planned . "
A torrent of defective parts , like gyroscopes and electric cables , repeatedly stalled work .
Even an elementary rule of spacecraft construction — never use tin because it deforms in space and can short - circuit electronic components — was violated by parts suppliers ...
“ The F.I.A. contract was technically flawed and unexecutable the day it was signed , ” said Robert J. Hermann , who ran the National
Reconnaissance Office from 1979 to 1981 and in 1996 led the panel that first recommended creation of a new satellite system .

Here 's Feingold 's statement :
I will vote against the nomination of Judge Mukasey to be the next Attorney General .
This was a difficult decision , as Judge Mukasey has many impressive qualities .
He is intelligent and experienced and appears to understand the need to depoliticize the Department of Justice and restore its credibility and reputation .
At this point in our history , however , the country also needs an Attorney General who will tell the President that he cannot ignore the laws passed by Congress .
Unfortunately , Judge Mukasey was unwilling to reject the extreme and dangerous theories of executive power that this administration has put forward .
The nation 's top law enforcement officer must be able to stand up to a chief executive who thinks he is above the law .
The rule of law is too important to our country 's history and to its future to compromise on that bedrock principle .
The survey was conducted in 1992 , when the disease was much less treatable than it is today .
Francis first looked to see if there was a positive correlation between having a friend with AIDS and expressing a preference for homosexual sex .
As he expected , there was .
" After all , people pick their friends , " he says , " and homosexuals are more likely to have other homosexuals as friends . "
But you do n't get to pick your family .
So Francis next looked for a correlation between having a relative with AIDS and expressing a homosexual preference .
This time , for men , the correlation was negative .
This did n't seem to make sense .
Many scientists believe that a person 's sexual orientation is determined before birth , a function of genetic fate .
If anything , people in the same family should be more likely to share the same orientation .
" Then I realized , Oh , my God , they were scared of AIDS , " Francis says .
Francis zeroed in on this subset of about 150 survey respondents who had a relative with AIDS .
Because the survey compiled these respondents ' sexual histories as well as their current answers about sex , it allowed Francis to measure , albeit crudely , how their lives may have changed as a result of having seen up close the costly horrors of AIDS .
Here 's what he found :
Not a single man in the survey who had a relative with AIDS said he had had sex with a man in the previous five years ; not a single man in that group declared himself to be attracted to men or to consider himself homosexual .
Women in that group also shunned sex with men .
For them , rates of recent sex with women and of declaring homosexual identity and attraction were more than twice as high as those who did not have a relative with AIDS .
Because the sample size was so small -- simple chance suggests that no more than a handful of men in a group that size would be attracted to men -- it is hard to reach definitive conclusions from the survey data .
( Obviously , not every single man changes his sexual behavior or identity when a relative contracts AIDS . )
But taken as a whole , the numbers in Francis 's study suggest that there may be a causal effect here -- that having a relative with AIDS may change not just sexual behavior but also self - reported identity and desire .
In other words , sexual preference , while perhaps largely predetermined , may also be subject to the forces more typically associated with economics than biology .
If this turns out to be true , it would change the way that everyone -- scientists , politicians , theologians -- thinks about sexuality .
But it probably wo n't much change the way economists think .
To them , it has always been clear : whether we like it or not , everything has its price .

SOUTH BEND , Ind . ( AP ) --
It 's over .
After 44 years and three overtimes .
Navy finally beat Notre Dame 46 - 44 in triple overtime on Saturday , ending the Fighting Irish 's NCAA - record winning streak against the Midshipmen at 43 games .
Navy scored a 46 - 44 3OT victory over Notre Dame to snap the Fighting Irish 's 43 - game winning streak against the Midshipmen , the most consecutives victories over one major opponent in NCAA history .

" It 's a big win for our program .
It 's a big win for the academy , " Navy coach Paul Johnson said .
" I 'm happy I do n't have to answer anything else about the streak every time we play . "
Roger Staubach was quarterback for the Midshipmen in 1963 when they beat Notre Dame 35 - 14 .
Since then , the Irish have had their way -- that is until Saturday .
Seven times during the streak the Midshipmen had chances to win in the fourth quarter only to be thwarted by bad luck , questionable calls or big plays by the Irish .
A few times Saturday it looked as though the win would elude them again .
But this time it was the Midshipmen who managed to make the decisive plays .
Kaipo - Noa Kaheaku - Enhada threw a 25 - yard TD pass to Reggie Campbell on the first play of the third overtime , then found him again for the 2 - point conversion .
Notre Dame ( 1 - 8 ) cut the lead to two on a 5 - yard TD run by Travis Thomas .
But after a pass interference call gave Notre Dame a second chance at the 2 - point conversion , defensive lineman Michael Walsh and linebacker Irv Spencer tackled Thomas well short of the end zone on the final play .
" Honestly , this win has n't even hit me yet , " linebacker Matt Wimsatt said .
" I can't wait to talk to everybody back home .
This is definitely bigger than just one football game . "
For Notre Dame , it was its school - record fifth straight home loss , another low point in a season of lows .
Weis said the 43 - game winning streak had no meaning to him or the team .
" They 're worried about here and now .
These kids are 17 .
You think they 're worrying about 43 years ? " he said .
" To be honest , I do n't even know what the streak was at before it ended , " linebacker Joe Brockington said .
Weis said the home losing streak was much more important to the players .
It also is the first time the Irish have lost five at home in one season .
Notre Dame did have its best game offensively , rushing for 235 yards , nearly doubling their season output , and James Aldridge ran for 125 yards .
It was n't enough .
The Irish , who did little to slow Navy 's option offense , held the Midshipmen to three - and - out late in the fourth quarter with the score tied at 28 .
Greg Veteto had the first punt of the game , and Tom Zbikowski returned it 32 yards to the Navy 38 .
The Irish drove to the 24 , but on fourth - and - 8 Weis decided to go for it rather than attempt a field goal .
Chris Kuhar - Pitters , who earlier returned a fumble 16 yards for a touchdown , sacked Evan Sharpley with 45 seconds left .
It was the fourth sack for Navy , which entered the game with five .
Notre Dame , which had n't scored more than 20 points this season , led 21 - 14 at halftime , the first halftime lead for the Irish .
The two teams traded touchdowns most of the day and had just traded missed field goals when Kuhar - Pitters came up with his big play early in the fourth quarter .
Sharpley dropped back to pass and was wrapped up by nose guard Nate Frazier and defensive end Michael Walsh knocked the ball loose .
Kuhar - Pitters scooped up the loose ball and rumbled into the end zone .
Kaheaku - Enhada ran in the 2 - point conversion to give the Midshipmen a 28 - 21 lead .
The Irish responded , though , with a touchdown of their own as Thomas went in from 3 yards out with 3:25 remaining to tie it .
In the first overtime , Navy 's Eric Kettani scored from a yard out and Notre Dame tied it with Duval Kamara 's 8 - yard touchdown catch .
The teams traded field goals in the second OT .
Weis was asked whether the game , following a 38 - 0 loss to USC , was a low point for the Irish .
" A low point is when you get beat 38 - 0 .
That 's a low point , " he said . " A low point is when the game is going OK and one team is pulling away from you and making plays when you 're not making plays .
The low point for me is we did n't win the game . "
Robert Hughes , whose brother Tony was fatally shot on Tuesday , scored Notre Dame 's first touchdown on a 3 - yard run .
Irish players , some of whom attended the funeral Friday , swarmed Hughes .
He ran over to the sideline and got a hug from Weis .
Weis said the biggest disappointment for him is the Irish could n't win the game for Hughes and his family .
" I wanted Robert Hughes standing up on the chair singing the fight song in the locker room , " he said .
" You want to know what 's important to me ?
That 's what 's important to me . "
Before the game , a moment of silence was held for Hughes ' brother and the death of Ryan Shay , a former Notre Dame runner who died Saturday during the U.S. men 's marathon Olympic trials .
So you 're about to be laid off by your megacorporation that thoroughly mismanaged its position in the market and is giving you the shaft because of it .
What 's a CompUSA employee to do ?
We 'd say adding your own photos to LCD product shots on the online store is as good a way as any .

Developers are working to create experimental open - source operating systems with modular microkernels using the C# programming language .
The SharpOS and Cosmos projects both announced their first major milestone releases last month , demonstrating the technical viability of the concept .
Although some previous research has been conducted in the area of VM - based operating systems , the Cosmos and SharpOS projects break a lot of new ground .
One particularly notable prior effort in this field is Microsoft 's Singularity experiment , a research project that began in 2003 with the intent of creating a managed code operating system that uses the Barktok compiler and leverages static analysis and programmatic verifiability to ensure high dependability .
Unlike Singularity , which includes a hardware abstraction layer coded in C++ and some other components written in assembly , the Cosmos and SharpOS projects seek to use standard C# pervasively throughout as much of the system as possible and also eschew the kind of specialized C# language extensions ( like the DbC syntax of Spec# ) that are used broadly in Singularity .
Although the developers plan to use C# , it is worth noting that practically any language that conforms to the Common Language Infrastructure specification could theoretically be used for kernel development in both Cosmos and SharpOS .
The Cosmos compiler , which is called IL2CPU and is written in C# , converts Intermediate Language code into assembly , which is then processed by NASM to generate native x86 code .
The developers say that IL2CPU will eventually be able to generate native code code directly without needing NASM and will also support native code generation for multiple architectures .
In an interview published on the Obsethryl 's Lab blog , Cosmos developer Scott Balmos explains how the operating system works .
" As with all VM - based operating systems , the first step after being handed boot control by the boot loader is a precompiled image — a native blob , if you will .
Its purpose is to initialize the platform - specific hardware with sane defaults ( e.g. load temporary ISRs , set up memory and other defaults ) , prepare the JIT compiler for the runtime , and do other native housekeeping tasks , " Balmos said .
" Afterwards , the rest of the kernel is loaded from its bytecode file , and the JIT compiler starts its job .
At this point , the rest of the kernel , through normal bytecode and unsafe pointer memory access , performs the rest of the system initialization , loads device drivers , and gets things going from a userspace standpoint .
It 's a gross simplification , but the main idea is that , like all other VM OSs , we have a very small native code nanokernel , if you will , which initializes just enough of the system in order to load the kernel proper , which is in platform - independent VM bytecode form . "
Cosmos running a shell demo in QEMU
Cosmos comes with a UserKit , which enables developers to create their own custom Cosmos distributions with specialized behavior .
The UserKit can generate QEMU images or bootable ISOs , and there are also instructions that explain how to make a USB boot image .
The UserKit will eventually supply what the developers describe as an " operating system Lego set " that will allow programmers to combine various components in order to create custom operating systems .
Several demos are available , including a basic shell with Ext2 filesystem support .
Although the Cosmos developers say that they have undertaken the project primarily for their own pleasure , they note that there are numerous contexts in which their operating system could have practical value .
One might someday be able to use Cosmos to rapidly develop specialized operating systems for embedded devices .
Cosmos also provides a rich canvas for operating system design experimentation .
For instance , Balmos notes that using a TCP / IP - based remoting protocol between the AppDomains would bring transparent distributed capabilities to Cosmos similar to those of Bell Labs ' Plan9 operating system .
A Snake game running on SharpOS in QEMU
Another prominent C# - based operating system project is SharpOS , which announced its first milestone release early last month .
Unlike Cosmos , the SharpOS project does n't depend on any proprietary tools .
The kernel can be compiled using either open - source Mono or Microsoft 's .
NET .
There are several demos on the project 's web site , including a playable Snake game implemented under SharpOS .
Both projects are distributed under open - source licenses .
SharpOS uses the General Public License with the Classpath linking exception , and Cosmos uses the BSD license .
Those of you who are interested in the concept of VM - based operating systems might also want to have a look at the JNode project , which seeks to create an open - source operating system written primarily in Java .
Although SharpOS and Cosmos are still largely experimental and are n't really intended for use on regular desktop systems , they provide some insight into the kind of innovations that would be made possible if next - generation operating system kernels were designed to use managed code .
The theoretical implications of these projects are very intriguing and will likely spur a lot of discussion in the operating system design community .

FERNDALE , MI —
If police hoped to quiet Monday afternoons at Nine Mile and Woodward by arresting war protester Victor Kittila last week and charging him with disorderly conduct — they failed .
Several hundred people clustered there Monday and filled every side of the intersection holding signs and banners protesting George W. Bush and the Iraq War .
Before the arrest , 20 - 30 protesters usually showed up .
" We ’re in support of fighting that arrest , " said Phyllis Livermore of Birmingham .
" It was outrageous . "
Many said it was their first time at the anti-war event , which started four years ago and happens around 4:45 - 5:45 p.m. every Monday .
" In a way , this was a good thing , " Livermore said .
" This many people are never here . "
Last Monday Kittila , 55 , was arrested in front of his wife and their 13 - year - old daughter and threatened with a Taser if he resisted .
Police Chief Michael Kitchen said he was arrested for holding a sign that inspired drivers to honk their horns .
Ferndale city code says it ’s illegal to " incite people to sound their horn when not reasonably necessary . "
Police said they had warned protesters about the signs several weeks ago because it disturbed other drivers on the busy thoroughfare .
Nine Mile and Woodward is the hub of downtown Ferndale , an area with no homes , but many restaurants , bars and retail shops .
" They were warned a couple of weeks ago , they decided to test it , evidently , " Kitchen said last week .
Protesters took a different view .
" I had to ask ‘ Is this America ? ’ " said Mary Johnston of Farmington Hills .
Kittila said he had changed his sign to say ‘ Ferndale police say do n’t honk if you want Bush out ’ " after the warning , but people still responded by honking .
Kittila ’s wife had to pay $ 500 bail to get him out of jail after his arrest ; a court date has not been set .
But his arrest failed to deter a group of teens from Grosse Pointe who held up signs urging drivers to honk against the war .
" I ’m not afraid , " said Michael Fenton , 18 , of Grosse Pointe .
" No one told me specifically I could not hold this sign . "
Kittila walked through the crowd , accepting pats on the back and meeting old friends , and he said that he was afraid for the people thumbing their noses at the law .
" I ’m happy and surprised that this many people are here , " he said while holding a sign that said ‘ no blood for oil ’ .
" But we do n’t want to cause trouble .
I think Ferndale supports us , they know what we ’re doing out here . "
Not long ago , I popped into a big Sainsbury 's near the office for lunch .
There , almost the first thing I encountered were three shelves of prepacked fruit salad .
You can have Fresh Classic Fruit ( melon , apple , pineapple , kiwi and blueberries ) ; Fresh Pineapple Chunks ; or Fresh Mango Chunks .
The use - by date on the Fresh Melon Selection , " ideal as a refreshing snack " , proclaimed that it had another two days of viability , but already the cubes of watermelon were blurring .
Apples , as Eve might have said , have to be the original convenience food - pick , wash ( or rub briskly along the leg of your jeans ) , eat .
No need to peel , no mess .
So , strangest of all were the little pillows of vacuum - packed apple slices , thin wedges of Pink Lady at 59 p for 80g , or £ 7.38 per kg - nearly three - and - a - half times more than it would cost to pick up an intact Pink Lady , a few aisles down .
And yet , increasingly , we do n't seem to mind .
The idea of fruit being a shortcut to health has taken such a hold on our imaginations that the European market for what the industry calls " fresh , valued - added produce products " , almost negligible a decade ago , is now worth € 3bn ( £ 2.2bn ) .
Much of that is accounted for by packaged salads , but packaged fruit is quickly catching up .
According to the market research company TNS , sales of chilled , prepared fruit in the UK have increased by 80.6 % in the past two years ( this does n't include fruit packs not taken home , eg those eaten at work ) .
" Along with organics and fair - trade , fresh - cut is probably one of the most exciting parts of the fresh produce trade at the moment , " says Mike Knowles , editor of Eurofruit magazine , adding , somewhat superfluously , " it 's enabling retailers to add value and increase their sales . "
But is the fruit boom really so good for our health ?
There can be few of us who have n't clocked , at some level , that the government wants us to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day , and " a lot of the fresh produce suppliers to retailers in the UK have become aware of the growing demand and are really starting to invest in the machinery to cut fruit and prepare it , " says Knowles .
" Fresh produce tends to be seen as quite a mundane product category , not an exciting or sophisticated market , but in the past few years the kind of value that suppliers can add has made it more exciting for the trade and , I would also say , for the consumer . "
Surprisingly , quite a few nutritionists seem to agree , with caveats .
Obviously , the ideal is that we buy whole fruit , but , as Richard Faulks , of the Institute of Food Research , argues , packaging fruit salads might entice people actually to eat the fruit they buy .
" Certainly in the past , fruit was seen as a necessary purchase , but not as a necessary food item , " he says .
" It goes in the fruit bowl and [ often ] sits there until it gets thrown away .
Given the option of a plate of meat , potato and two veg , the instruction has always been to eat up your meat , because that 's the expensive item .
You 'd never get , ' Eat up your vegetables , because those will do you good and wo n't make you fat . '
It was n't seen as providing energy in value - for - money terms by a lot of people - particularly people at lower socioeconomic levels , who can't afford a lot .
You go for energy because that 's what makes you survive .
It 's seen as OK to buy a cabbage and then throw it away , or a lettuce and throw it away , but you 'd never do that with a joint of beef . "
Making fruit more expensive , more of an event , the theory goes , makes it more likely to be eaten .
" You 'd throw away a mouldy apple , but not a mixed fruit salad .
You 've paid a bit more for it . "
Prepackaged , sliced fruit is attractive to children , and to single people , too , who might struggle to get through a whole pineapple or melon or watermelon - and especially all of the above , if they wanted some variety - before it went off .
However , our increasing concerns about food miles , about preservation , about exploitative labour practices , still apply - in fact , apply with a vengeance .
Packaged fruit is often not only grown but also cut up abroad ( I had mangoes for lunch the other day that were prepared in Ghana ) .
Therefore , the tricky process of slowing down spoilage becomes even more difficult .
A couple of years ago the consumer magazine Which ?
discovered that Sainsbury 's sliced apple bites - sold as 100 % apple , no preservative - were being dipped in citrus solution , or AS1 ( ascorbic acid ) , to stop them from going brown .
Many manufacturers use lemon juice ; others use a treatment called NatureSeal , which contains vitamin C and calcium .
Food USA magazine recently reported on the use of bacteria on the cut surfaces of fruit to fight the pathogens than can form there .
Guardian journalist Felicity Lawrence , in her book Not on the Label : What Really Goes into the Food on Your Plate , points out that " between 1992 and 2000 , the period in which sales of bagged salads took off , nearly 6 % of food - poisoning outbreaks were associated with ready - to - eat salads and prepared fruit and vegetables . "
The Health Protection Agency says it does not track which of these outbreaks applied specifically to fruit , but it is as well to remember that it 's less likely to happen to plums , say , than rocket .
" The inside of a fruit is sterile , " says Faulks .
" Once you take the skin off and [ as long as ] you cut it with a clean knife , you should n't have any contamination .
I mention that I have heard that peeling fruit removes much of the goodness available , because most nutrients are to be found near the surface .
" No .
There tends to be a slightly higher concentration of some things under the skin , but if you eat an apple most of the nutrients come from the flesh , not from the skin , " says Faulks .
" The skin is a tiny fraction of the whole thing .
The concentration [ of nutrients ] per unit mass might be higher , but the amount of mass overall , by comparison to the whole apple , is very small .
It 's a misinterpretation . "
It is true that there is some diminution for other reasons , however , as Lawrence argues , the concentration of nutrients in fruit and vegetables has dropped with the introduction of artificial fertiliser ( because soils fed only with artificial fertilisers containing nitrogen , phosphate and potash gradually lose their vital trace elements ) .
Between the beginning of the second world war and the early 1990s , the iron content of vegetables dropped by 27 % , the magnesium content by 24 % .
And a Which ?
magazine investigation published in June 2004 discovered that pre-cut fruit and vegetables often suffered marked decreases in vitamin C content .
Much was made of Asda sliced runner beans , which contained only 11 % of the vitamin C they would have had when fresh , while mango from Marks & Spencer and melon slices from Safeway contained less than half the vitamin C than might have been expected .
( The exceptions were apple slices , which , being treated , had eight times the expected amount , and pineapple slices , which appeared to have four times the expected amount . )
The Which ?
study into this issue seems to be the only known one in the UK , and experts are not entirely convinced of its importance .
" Whenever you cut up fruit or put it into cold storage , or whatever you do when you 've got a prepared product , you are going to lose nutrients , " says Faulks .
" There 's no question about that .
But the level of loss is relatively small . "
So , in the Which ?
survey , a Somerfield citrus fruit medley retained 75 % of the expected vitamin C , while the kiwis in an Asda tropical fruit salad retained 62 % .
" The fact that people are eating more fruit because it 's convenient and readily available is the more important thing , " says Anna Denny , a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation .
" The main thing does seem to be that people struggle to eat enough fruit and veg in this country , so any form of pre-prepared fruit and veg is a great way of helping them to reach five a day .
" A lot of innovations are seen as totally negative , " says Faulks .
" This one , I think , in terms of nutrition , is positive . "
The one thing that is in nobody 's interest to say is this : fruit just does n't provide that much nutrition in the first place .
If you believe the nutrition industry , every week produces some new superfood , often a fruit : blueberries , pomegranates , acai berries .
The fact is that fruit consists of water , sugars ( normally about 10 % ) , some vitamin C , and some potassium ( thought to be good for controlling blood pressure ) .
And that 's kind of it .
Pineapple , for example , has only got about 10mg of vitamin C per 100g ( which means a 80g standard portion would only have about 12 % of RDA ) and is mainly water and sugar .
In a typical supermarket fruit medley of 150 - 200g , at least 15g will be sugar , and the other major constituent water .
If it 's a citrus medley , there will be about 40 mg per 100g of vitamin C , if not , there will be about 10 - 20mg .
" It 's a myth that fruit is packed full of vitamins and minerals , " says Tom Sanders , who is director of the Nutritional Sciences Division at King 's College London .
" The foods packed full of micronutrients are grains , seeds and nuts , the peas and things . "
Bagged salad ?
" It 's mainly water .
Dark green vegetables are a good source of some vitamins , such as vitamin A and folate , but lettuce has n't got much going for it at all .
The really sad thing is that we do n't eat enough vegetables , such as cabbage , spinach and broccoli . "
In May , the Observer reported that dietitians have become so worried about claims being made for so - called superfoods that they convened a debate on the subject at the Science Museum .
It may be claimed that particular exotic berries boost IQ , energy and immunity , but the only science even vaguely backing this up is that they contain folic acid , which does boost brainpower , but is present in many foods .
The antioxidants in pomegranate juice , which supposedly fight diseases as different as cancer and arthritis , actually only last in the body for an hour .
Wheatgrass , that standby of the trendy juicebar , is said to be rich in detoxifying chlorophyll , but every green vegetable and leaf in the world contains cholorophyll - which is not , in fact , absorbable by our bodies .
" The term ' superfoods ' is at best meaningless and at worst harmful , " Catherine Collins , chief dietician at St George 's Hospital in London , told the paper .
" There are so many wrong ideas about superfoods that I do n't know where best to begin to dismantle the whole concept . "
Nor do dietitians have much time for the rise of the smoothie , sales of which have increased by 523 % in the past five years .
They are expensive , says Sanders , " and bloody holier than thou " .
With whole fruit , the cell structure is still intact , and you swallow pieces .
They take longer to digest and the sugar in them is released slowly , rather than the rapid spike in blood glucose produced by drinking juice , or a smoothie .
" If you liquidise it into goo it 's just like drinking ordinary Coke .
Or worse , actually , " he says .
" It 's still a sugary drink .
A lot of people on diets do n't realise that if they 're drinking loads of apple juice or orange juice , it 's got a lot of calories in .
If you drink a litre of apple juice a day , it 'll be 400 calories . "
Saunders particularly objects to labelling that implies that drinking these concentrates substitutes for three or four portions a day : " They do n't .
They only count for one . "
Meanwhile , the British Dental Health Foundation warns that drinking or eating fruit should be kept to mealtimes , rather than indulged in throughout the day .
This is because the sugar ( combined with citric acid in oranges , grapefruits or pineapples ) attacks tooth enamel , which then needs some time to recover ; ie , if you eat many boxfuls of clementines , all the time , you may begin to do actual harm to your teeth .
This is not an incitement to throw the baby out with the proverbial bathwater .
The reason apples are good for you is mainly the cellulose and vitamin C ; chewing gives a feeling of satiety and promotes saliva secretion , which is good for your teeth ; and because , in the real world , they tend to come as part of a deliberate lifestyle .
" People who eat apples probably ride a bike and do n't smoke , " says Sanders .
Except for the truly fanatic , they are also more likely to eat them in moderation .
The added irony , in the topsy - turvy world of supermarkets , is that rich desserts often cost very little , while fruit , especially organic , fairtrade , and prepared fruit , is marked up .
At the Sainsbury 's where I got my lunch , I could have had four 100g creme brulees for 44 p , two tiramisu for 98 p , and six chocolate mousses for 69 p - or a grand total of 11.5 p each , making those Pink Lady slices , gram for gram , four times more expensive .
We are , more or less willingly , paying through the nose for a particularly 21st - century version of virtue .
" You 're made to feel worthy , and therefore you 're made to pay a premium for it , " says Sanders .
" Supermarkets have a lot to answer for in the obesity debate . "
" The way you 've got to look at fruit is that it 's better to eat fruit than biscuits , cakes and puddings , because there 's very little energy value in it and it's not fattening , " he says .
" A bit of sugar gives you a lift and takes the pangs of hunger away .
But it 's not full of all sorts of other nutrients as well .
That 's a myth "
Green 's fans were accustomed to his zany antics , but many found his Andy Kaufman - inspired performance art as funny as cancer .
Which , oddly enough , is what his MTV show is best remembered for , after he aired his own testicular cancer surgery .

POLL : Clinton Up in Ohio , Dead Heat in Texas New poll finds Obama leading on electability in critical March 4 primaries .
Feb. 21 , 2008  --
Trailing in perceived electability , Hillary Clinton is running in a dead heat with Barack Obama in the Texas Democratic primary and holds a single - digit lead in Ohio , lifted there by lunch - bucket voters and party regulars .
Both March 4 primaries have been described as critical for Clinton , who 's lost 10 straight contests , including Tuesday 's Wisconsin primary .
Critical , Close Contests Loom in Texas , Ohio
Differing demographic and political profiles in Texas and Ohio change pieces of the puzzle — but both contests look close , with more than enough moveable voters to tip the balance either way .
With about two weeks until the primary , this ABC News / Washington Post poll finds a 48 - 47 percent Clinton - Obama race among likely voters in Texas , and 50 - 43 percent in Ohio .
A quarter in Texas , and a third in Ohio , say they could change their minds or are undecided .
Hispanics , Party Faithful Boost Clinton
In Texas , Clinton 's being kept competitive by support from Hispanics ; she likely needs them to turn out in greater - than - usual numbers , as they did in California , which she won Feb .
5 .
In Ohio she 's benefiting from a greater number of Democratic Party regulars than in Texas , from fewer college - educated or higher - income voters and from support in some union households .
In both states , senior citizens are crucial to Clinton 's side ; independents and younger voters , to Obama's .
And he 's taken a lead over Clinton on electability , a point he may try to drive home , along with his mantle of " change , " in the days ahead .
Obama Bests Clinton on Electability
Obama beats Clinton in the perception that he's got the best chance of winning in November by 47 - 36 percent in Texas and 48 - 37 percent in Ohio .
He trounced Clinton as more electable in Wisconsin ; he 's also made broad strides on electability in national ABC / Post polling , moving up from a 43 - point deficit in mid-December to just 5 points earlier this month .
Obama 's lead on electability peaks among college graduates , a key group for him ; nearly six in 10 of them say he has the best chance to win in November .
Even women , less - educated voters and mainline Democrats — Clinton groups — roughly divide between her and Obama on who 's most electable .
Indeed among seniors , her best group , well under half say Clinton 's got the best chance in November .
For her part , Clinton continues to prevail as the strongest leader , by 53 - 36 percent in Ohio and 51 - 40 percent in Texas .
That edge extends to some issues : she 's ahead in both states in trust to handle the economy as well as health care , her signature issue .
Clinton has a slight edge in Ohio in trust to handle the Iraq war ; in Texas , they 're even on the issue .
Race & Change vs. Experience
Voters in both states split about evenly on the key dynamic of the race , a " new direction and new ideas " vs. " strength and experience " ; the split mirrors the last national poll .
It cuts overwhelmingly to vote : Eight in 10 voters who place more importance on " strength and experience " favor Clinton ; about as many " new direction " voters go to Obama .
Obama is slightly stronger among " new direction " voters in Texas ( 80 percent support him ) than in Ohio ( 75 percent ) — part of the reason he 's a bit behind there .
Group Support
Clinton does especially well among women , and particularly among white women , one of her core support groups , in Ohio .
Obama makes more inroads among white women in Texas ( 39 percent support ) , though not up to his unusual 47 percent support from white women in the Wisconsin primary Tuesday .
Hispanics are key in Texas ; they favor Clinton by 59 - 36 percent , about the same as the average in exit polls across all primaries to date ( 61 - 35 percent ) .
By contrast , it 's a much closer 50 - 46 percent contest among whites in Texas , while African - Americans there are favoring Obama by a 4 - 1 margin , 76 - 18 percent .
That , too , resembles the outcome in all primaries to date ( 79 - 17 percent for Obama among blacks ) , but it 's lower than some of his high - water marks , including his 91 percent support from blacks in Wisconsin .
Obama continues to do better with college graduates ( who are less numerous among likely voters in Ohio than in Texas ) , with higher - income voters ( also less numerous in Ohio ) ; and with younger voters , particularly in Texas , albeit not at the level he achieved in Wisconsin .
He leads by 59 - 39 percent among those under age 40 in Texas ; Clinton comes back with 60 - 25 percent support among seniors there .
Seniors also are her best age group by far in Ohio , 57 - 33 percent .
Eleven percent of seniors in Texas are undecided , more than in any other group .
But among likely voters who have a preference , it 's the younger people in Texas who are most apt to say they may change their minds — 29 percent of under 40s .
( And about as many in Ohio . )
The age gap shows up other ways .
Texas seniors are much more apt to say they'd be " very satisfied " with Clinton rather than Obama as the nominee ; young people are more likely to be " very satisfied " with Obama .
There are similar divisions by race .
( In Ohio there 's less of a gap by age , but a somewhat bigger one by race . )
A quarter of likely voters in Ohio are from union households ; they back Clinton by 53 - 37 percent , as opposed to a narrower 49 - 45 percent division among those from non-union households .
Clinton lost union household voters to Obama in Wisconsin , though across all primaries to date she 's won them by 50 - 43 percent .
There are very few union voters in Texas .
Party Time
Political allegiance also counts for much .
Clinton leads among party regulars in Ohio ( 55 - 39 percent ) and Texas ( 53 - 42 percent ) alike ; Obama owes his competitiveness to independents who intend to vote in these open primaries .
He leads among independents by 53 -39 percent in Ohio and 53 - 40 percent in Texas .
Those are similar to previous primaries this year : Clinton 's won Democrats overall , by 50 - 44 percent ; Obama 's prevailed among independents , 53 - 37 percent .
The Issues
There 's a difference on issues between these states :
The economy and health care rank about evenly as the most important issue to Democratic likely voters in Ohio , cited by 34 percent and 30 percent , respectively .
In Texas , 33 percent cite health care , with the economy second , 22 percent .
Though demographics and personal attributes matter more , issue priorities do divide voters somewhat ; in Texas , Clinton is supported by 53 percent of those who cite health care as their No. 1 issue , and 51 percent of those who cite the economy , versus just 39 percent of those who say it 's Iraq .
Clinton 's lead among economy voters in Ohio , 52 - 37 percent , is bigger than her lead overall ; that 's not so among health care voters .
As noted , Obama trounces Clinton among voters who care most about change , and she beats him as broadly among those more focused on experience .
But another measure fleshes out this equation , and raises a potential vulnerability for Obama .
Two - thirds in both states say Clinton , if elected , would " do enough " to bring needed change to Washington ; fewer , 56 percent in Ohio and 53 percent in Texas , say Obama has the kind of experience it takes to serve effectively as president .
Obama still has the majority 's endorsement on experience — but at a considerably lower level than Clinton 's acceptability on change .
( In only a few groups does Obama fall short of a majority on experience , such as seniors and Hispanics in Texas . )
Additionally , while Obama leads as the most electable in November , more than six in 10 likely voters in both states say either candidate could beat John McCain , the front - running Republican .
In Texas , seniors and Hispanics say by 2 - 1 that only Clinton could beat McCain ; African - Americans , by 3 - 1 , say only Obama could do so .
In Ohio , college graduates , independents and blacks pick only Obama by especially wide margins .
Enthusiasm & Turnout
Enthusiasm for the candidates — potentially a factor in turnout — is running about equal for Clinton and Obama , albeit a bit lower in Ohio than in Texas .
That 's especially true for Clinton ; in Texas 65 percent of her supporters describe themselves as " very enthusiastic " about supporting her ; in Ohio , 53 percent .
( Obama 's numbers are 62 percent in Texas , 56 percent in Ohio . )
Turnout , naturally , is crucial .
Clinton leads in Texas and Ohio alike among people who say they voted in the 2004 primary ; new voters are better for Obama .
Given their sharp differences , the relative mix of Hispanics and blacks voting in Texas is equally critical ; Clinton 's support may rely on a boost in turnout by Hispanics over 2004 , when they accounted for 24 percent of voters .
On the other hand , Clinton arguably could prevail without a big Hispanic turnout , if instead seniors showed up in large numbers ; they accounted for a sizable 26 percent of voters in the Texas Democratic primary in 2000 , but then dropped to 19 percent in 2004 .
Likely voters in this poll account for 24 percent of the adult population in Texas and 30 percent in Ohio .
While actual turnout at those levels is unlikely , vote preference results are similar in likely voter models positing much lower turnout .
METHODOLOGY
DIGG THIS
I begin with a report of some statements made by John McCain , Republican presidential candidate for 2008 , and the naval son and grandson of American admirals :
The Huffington Post reports :
" The presidential candidate who sang “ Bomb bomb Iran ” is already looking towards the war after the war in Iraq .
Sen. John McCain told a crowd of supporters … , “ It ’s a tough war we ’re in .
It ’s not going to be over right away .
There ’s going to be other wars . ”
[ H ]e repeated … : “ I ’m sorry to tell you , there ’s going to be other wars .
We will never surrender but there will be other wars . ” ”
" McCain did not elaborate who the United States would be fighting .
But he did warn the crowd to be ready for the ramifications of current and future battles .
“ And right now  we ’re gonna have a lot of PTSD [ post traumatic stress disorder ] to treat , my friends , ” he said .
“ We ’re gonna have a lot of combat wounds that have to do with these terrible explosive IEDs that inflict such severe wounds .
And my friends , it ’s gonna be tough , we ’re gonna have a lot to do . ” u201D
The above prompts the following reflections .
Although I 've made some of these points before , I now consider directly , the mindless militarism expressed so clearly and so well by Sen. McCain :
As I 've pointed out previously , the US is ( a ) the world 's most prosperous country ( b ) its third largest in terms of population ( c ) surrounded by 34000 miles of empty , stormy ocean on two sides ; by Canada to the north and impoverished Latin American countries to the south .
No government therefore has been insane enough to suppose it could successfully invade and occupy the US .
For the US military , therefore , the perennial problem is : how to secure continued tax revenues , domestically ?
Given the military realities above , their only avenue : some sort of overseas " threat . "
Now , the same three facts that render the US invulnerable to any foreign attack , also mean that the world overseas is dim , distant , vague , and mostly completely unknown to its population .
This profound ignorance in turn means that , when their officials and politicians speak with the utmost assurance about a foreign " threat , " Americans generally have no way of assessing such confident assertions .
Pearl Harbor was not , and could never have been , a precursor to invasion and occupation of even Hawaii , never mind the mainland US .
At most , it was occasion for a major reprisal .
But this would not have been grounds for a major military expansion .
Only entering WWII could supply that excuse .
So by 1945 the US government included a very extensive military establishment , with troops deployed in Britain , France , Germany , Italy , Japan and Korea .
The military ( be it noted ) are a branch of government  so naturally they wished to continue receiving tax revenues , and even expand their empire .
This is what all government officials want .
So after 1945 : " occupation " of the territory of a defeated enemy supplied the excuse for retaining American troops and bases in Germany and Japan .
The Korean War gave a " reason " for troops and bases in the south of the peninsula .
It was around this time , in the mid-1950s , that former Gen . Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the " military - industrial complex " which had already emerged .
The American military and politicians then quickly seized on continuing political rivalry with the Soviet Union and with China , as a rationalisation for continuing to maintain military forces in various parts of Western Europe , Japan , South Korea , etc .
Over the following decades , this excuse eventually resulted in some 700 US military bases around what to the overwhelming bulk of Americans is the dim , distant , fuzzy , unknown world , somewhere beyond the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .
The Soviet bugaboo collapsed in 1991 , so further foreign occasions had to be , and were discovered , to keep domestic American tax revenues flowing into American military hands .
Over these decades , what was the point of all these military " alliances " ?
During the Soviet era , no doubt the Soviet Union may have had enough missiles to damage parts of many American cities  but to what end ?
The Soviets were not so stupid as to try and invade Western Europe , right on their very doorstep : they had enough to do , to hold on to the territories they invaded and occupied during WWII .
What gain then , from attacking unconquerable American territory , several thousands of miles away ?
And did the Western European governments propose to help stop such totally pointless missile attacks on the US ?
Similarly with South Korea .
No doubt the North Korean government was once a menace  of sorts  to the government of South Korea .
But its danger diminished rapidly as the South Korean economy took off .
A country ( like North Korea ) which suffers from famine  in the late 20th century !
 cannot offer any threat whatsoever to a country which is the world 's twelfth largest economy and the world 's largest producer of electronic parts  and which therefore feeds as well as South Korea does ( it is the largest single importer of Australian beef ) .
[ This night - time satellite photo says it all : that totally black hole in the centre , surrounded by the blazing lights of Japan , South Korea , and even mainland China  is North Korea . ]
So what was and is this military " alliance " between the US and the South Korean government about ?
The danger of a North Korean or a Chinese invasion of the US ?
Against which the South Korean government has promised military assistance ?
The same goes for the American counter - invasion of Kuwait in January 1991 , after Saddam Hussain 's invasion in August 1990 .
No doubt Hussain wished to add to his oil revenues , but this was hardly any sort of menace to American oil imports .
To whom could he have sold the oil ?
NB , which was only a fraction of total oil production anyway .
Had he refused to sell to American oil companies ( thus cutting off his nose to spite his face )  some intermediary would 've stepped in , and American companies would 've still obtained any supplies they wanted from the Kuwait oil - fields .
Finally , the 11th September 2001 .
Patently , this was not , and could never have been , a preliminary to an invasion and occupation of the US  by whom ?
Rather , " entangling foreign alliances " brought on this disaster .
The identities of the men who took over the planes make it clear that the whole was part of an intra-Saudi Arabian / Islamic political quarrel .
The instigator was a man who aspired to obtain the oil revenues of Saudi Arabia for himself .
He denounced the current rulers of Saudi Arabia precisely for their alliance with the infidel Americans , and for allowing infidel troops on Arabia 's sacred soil .
The men themselves came from tribes in the Yemen whose rulers had been displaced by the rulers of Saudi Arabia .
Or else they belonged to ultra-Islamic political movements in Egypt , whose leaders sought to replace the rulers of Egypt , and then impose a stricter , more " Islamic " regime on their fellow - Egyptian Muslims .
Because the US government was allied with the Saudi Arabian government , therefore the enemies of that last government attacked a major American landmark .
" If I wound my enemy 's friend , I wound my enemy . "
And so on….
To summarise :
The US is the third most populous country in the world , and its richest .
It is protected even further by 34,000 miles of open ocean , east and west .
Thus it is totally impregnable to invasion and occupation .
Therefore the only way the American military can obtain large and growing tax revenues is through : maintaining some 700 military bases round the world ; fighting foreign wars ; invading and occupying small , poor countries .
They have done this for some 60 years now .
American taxpayers have handed over trillions of dollars in taxes so " their " military can embark upon all sorts of military adventures overseas .
And why must this military maintain and enlarge those 700 bases , and build more ?
Fight , invade , occupy small , poor territories ? 
How else to obtain trillions of dollars in tax revenues ?
Thus the whole process feeds on itself  it can continue indefinitely  there is no built - in check of any sort … .
And so McCain can confidently promise more wars , more suffering for an indefinite time to come …

Followup to : Who Told You Moral Questions Would be Easy ?.
Response to : Circular Altruism
At the most basic level ( which is all we need for present purposes ) , an argument is nothing but a chain of dependence between two or more propositions .
We say something about the truth value of the set of propositions { P1 … Pn} , and we assert that there ’s something about { P1 … Pn} such that if we ’re right about the truth values of that set , we ought to believe something about the truth value of the set { Q1 … Qn} .
If we have that understanding of what it means to make an argument , then we can see that an argument does n’t necessarily have any connection to the universe outside itself .
The utterance " 1. all bleems are quathes , 2 . the youiine is a bleem , 3 . therefore , the youiine is a quathe " is a perfectly logically valid utterance , but it does n’t refer to anything in the world — it does n’t require us to change any beliefs .
The meaning of any argument is conditional on our extra-argument beliefs about the world .
One important use of this principle is reflected in the oft - quoted line " one man ’s modus ponens in another man ’s modus tollens . "
Modus ponens is a classical form of argument : 1 . A–>B. 2 . A. 3 . .: B. Modus tollens is this : 1 . A–>B. 2 . ¬ B. 3 . . : ¬ A .
Both are perfectly valid forms of argument !
( For those who are n’t familiar with the standard notation , the horizontal line is meant to indicate negation . )
Unless you have some particular reason outside the argument to believe either A or B , you do n’t know whether the claim A– > B means that B is true , or that A is n’t true !
Why am I elucidating all this basic logic , which almost everyone reading this blog doubtless knows ?
It ’s a rhetorical tactic : I ’m trying to make it salient , to bring it to the top of the cognitive stack , so that my next claim is more compelling .
And that claim is as follows :
Eliezer ’s posts about the specks and the torture [ 1 ] [ 2 ] , and the googleplex of people being tortured for a nanosecond , and so on , and so forth , tell you nothing about the truth of your intuitions .
Argument behind the fold …
At most , at most ! , Eliezer ’s arguments establish an inconsistency between two propositions .
Proposition 1 : " utilitarianism is true . "
Proposition 2 : " your intuitions about putting dust specks in people ’s eyes , sacred values , etc. , to the extent they recommend inflicting a small harm on lots of people rather than a lot of harm on one person , when that the aggregate pain from the first is higher than the aggregate pain from the second , are true . "
As I ’ve noted before , I do n’t think Eliezer has even established that .
( The short version : utilitarianism is a lot more complicated than that , it ai n’t easy to figure out how to aggregate harms , it ai n’t easy to map those harms onto hedonic states like pleasure and pain , etc . )
But let ’s give Eliezer that one , arguendo .
Suppose his argument has established the inconsistency .
In symbols , where P = utilitarianism , and Q = your intuitions about dust specks etc. , Eliezer has established ¬ P∨¬Q .
( Not P , or not Q. )
It does n’t establish ¬Q !
Unless there ’s more exogenous reason to believe P than there is to believe Q , Eliezer ’s argument should n’t be any more likely to cause us to disbelieve P than to disbelieve Q .
This is the step that should make your heart sing , now that I ’ve primed you with the review of basic logic above .
Now let ’s take the next step .
Why should there be more exogenous reason to believe P than to believe Q ?
Why might one want to believe that utilitarianism is true ?
This post is already far too long to go over the abstract reasons why one might accept utilitarianism .
But let me make the claim , which you might find plausible , that many of those reasons come down to intuitions .
Those intuitions might be about specific cases which lead to inductive generalizations about rules ( " I think it ’s better to kill one person than to kill five , and better to torture for a week than torture for a year , therefore , it must be best to maximize pleasure over pain ! " ) , or intuitions directly about the rules ( " well , obviously , it ’s best to maximize pleasure over pain ! " ) .
Regardless , intuitions they be .
And now let ’s subjectivize things a little further .
I ’ll bet that the vast majority of the people reading this post , people who hold utilitarian beliefs , came to those utilitarian beliefs largely as a result of articulating their moral intuitions , or reading an argument about normative ethics that spoke to their moral intuitions .
Eliezer ’s own case is a perfect example : he has expressed his utilitarian beliefs as being a direct consequence of his seemingly intuitive choices .
And now the final step .
You get your moral intuitions about the dust specks case from wherever it is that your intuitions come from .
You get your utilitarianism from wherever it is that your intuitions come from .
They ’re on equal footing — you have no more reason to believe your utilitarian intuitions than you have to believe your dust speck intuitions !
Therefore , by the claims above , Eliezer ’s argument should n’t cause you to reject your dust specks intuition .
A summary :
1 . An argument establishing that two propositions are inconsistent does n’t tell you which of those propositions you should reject , unless you have more reason outside the argument to accept one or the other .
2 . For any two propositions P and Q , if you accept P for only the same reasons you accept Q , you do n’t have more reason to accept P than Q .
3 . Your reasons to believe dust specks are better than torture are identical to your reasons to believe utilitarianism is true .
4 . Therefore , an argument ( Eliezer ’s ) establishing that dust specks > torture is inconsistent with utilitarianism does n’t give you any reason to reject dust specks > torture .
Q.E.D .
( A couple objections to this argument : 1 ) " But what if my intuitions about utilitarianism come from many , many cases , and I only have renegade non-utilitarian intuitions about a few cases — does n’t that mean I should believe my utilitarian intuitions more strongly ? "
Answer : Sure , if and only if you think that the strength of intuitions can be summed that way , and it ’s not obvious that ’s true .
Also , I can come up with many more cases than just the dust specks where your intuitions likely get non-utilitarian outcomes .
2 ) I was recently handed a paper where an undergrad argued that the intuitions of utilitarians tend to [ always , even ] match the results of utilitarian calculations [ should she read this post , I invite her to defend that claim in the comments ] .
If true , that would cause problems … but does anyone actually believe it ? )
This all connects back quite strongly to the point of this blog .
Taking an argument of the form ¬ P∨¬Q and concluding , on that basis alone , ¬ Q is an error in reasoning , and it ’s one that strongly resembles a form of overconfidence — or perhaps expecting short inferential distances .
That ’s where the real fierceness lies .
There ’s the naked sword .
There ’s the solar plasma : in recognizing the limitations of your arguments , the point where the road — or " The Way " — stops .

Las Vegas 30 Storey Garden
Las Vegas , the city known for gambling , drinking , lights and wild times will be turning over a new leaf , a green one at that .
The $ 200 million project , expected to open in 2010 , will the the first vertical farm in the world , and without a doubt , the tallest .
The developers hope it will not only serve as another tourist attraction , but that it will grow enough crops to feed 72,000 people for a year .
It will grow around 100 different kinds of crops including fruits and vegetables , with ideal growing conditions created in individual tower sectors .
" The World currently uses about 80 % of the available farm land and 60 % of the earth 's population lives near or in an urban environment so the logical choice for farming is to go up for land where the environment can be controlled and where distribution is local , " NextEnergy News explained .
" Las Vegas is seen as the perfect location for this project by Nevada State officials who would like to demonstrate their sustainability and environmental awareness instead of projecting an image of waste and excess . "
$ 200 million may sound like a lot , but the builders anticipate it will bring in just as much cash as a new casino at a projected annual revenue of $ 40 million and only $ 6 million in operating expenses .
Long Bets has arrived at a decision for Long Bet # 2 between blogger Dave Winer and Martin Nisenholtz of the NY Times .
At stake is US $ 2000.00 plus half the interest that has accrued over the last 5 years in the Farsight Fund , all of which will go to the charity of the winner ’s choice .
In the bet Winer asserts , “ In a Google search of five keywords or phrases representing the top five news stories of 02007 , weblogs will rank higher than the ‘ New York Times ‘ Web site ” .
The premise of this bet is excellent , but unfortunately the arguments were quite vague on how to adjudicate the bet .
Long Bets encourages bettors to construct arguments that involve the least amount of interpretation possible .
Once this bet came up for adjudication we urged both parties to come to their own decision , but they asked Long Bets to be the final arbiter .
We have done our best with the information and resources available to us , but this process should be a good instructor both to future bettors and ourselves …
The major questions that affect the interpretation of this bet :
Q : Which list of “ 2007 top stories ” to use ?
A : We chose the Associated Press list , as it was the only one suggested by one of the bettors ( Nisenholtz ) , and it was in effect at the time of the bet origination .
We found many others , ( some listed in the notes below ) , that may actually be better indices of what a “ top story ” is , but we felt that the AP list was our best choice for this bet .
Q : What is a weblog ?
Does Wikipedia count ?
What about the NY Times blog or other commercial blogs ?
Does it include any non-commercial user submitted web site ?
A : We decided that a weblog had to be something that would have been recognized as a blog in 02002 .
This includes ad supported blogs and commercial blogs like those of the NY Times .
While the bettors argument in this case discusses why non-commercial content will beat out commercial content , Winer never provides a definition of a weblog .
As it turns out , including major news source blogs like those of the NY Times or sources like Wikipedia do not affect the ultimate outcome in the case of this bet , but they certainly could have .
Q : What is the NY Times ?
Does the International Herald Tribune count ( which is owned by the NY Times and its content comes from there ) ?
A : We determined that it had to be on the nytimes.com web site to count .
If the bettor wanted subsidiaries or other associated derivative content to count , they should have specified it in their argument .
This did affect the outcome of one of the searches where the IHT.com result came in at 9 and blogs came in at 10 .
This result would not have affected the ultimate decision however .
Some other notes :
The bettors also never defined what the search semantics should be , and or what date the searches should occur on .
Both of which affect the data a fair amount .
We tried the searches in a number of ways and a number of times since AP released their list of stories in December to arrive at our decision .
We disregarded any search results that were dated after 12/31/02007 when calculating search rank .
Here are 02007 ’s top stories , as voted by AP Journalists with search rankings ( lower is better ) .
We also include results of the highest non-commercial / user submitted content and highest ranked commercial content as a reference .
“ VIRGINIA TECH KILLINGS ” ( NYT score 26 , blog 10 ) winner Blogs
Highest user contributed result : Wikipedia 1
Highest commercial news outlet result : USA Today 2
“ MORTGAGE CRISIS ” ( NYT score 2 , blog 10 ) winner NYT
Highest user contributed result : Wikipedia 1
Highest commercial news outlet result : NYT 2
“ IRAQ WAR ” ( NYT score 24 , blog 5 , ) winner Blogs
Highest user contributed result : Wikipedia 1
Highest commercial news outlet result : CNN 3
“ OIL PRICES ” ( NYT score 172 , blog 38 ) winner Blogs
Highest user contributed result : Monga Bay Blog 38
Highest commercial news outlet result : Bloomberg 1
“ CHINESE EXPORTS ” ( NYT score 57 , blog 3 ) winner Blogs
Highest user contributed result : Blogging Stocks 3
Highest commercial news outlet result : China Today 1
Adding up page rank winners blogs win 4 to 1 .
.
Adding up page rank winners of user submitted content vs. commercial content , user submitted content wins 3 - 2 .
.
If you average page ranks of the NYT ( avg rank 56.2 ) vs. blogs ( avg. rank 13.2 ) Blogs win .
.
If you use an average rank of user submitted content ( avg. rank 8.8 ) vs. commercial ( avg. rank 1.8 ) Commercial news outlets win .
The Long Bets decision on this bet is in favor of Winer ’s side , weblog page ranks came out ahead of the NY Times .
We will be calculating interest and sending a check on to Dave Winer ’s charity of choice the World Wide Web Consortium in the next month .
Notes :
Aside from the observation that Wikipedia often ranks very high and was not really considered at the time of this bet in 02002 , another interesting note was how well government sites ranked in subjects like oil prices , Chinese exports , and others .
The government sites are often listed in the top ten of these types of subjects showing that people are also turning to the government websites for authority .
The other interesting thing to us was how much the bettors own definitions ( or lack there of in this case ) affected the bet .
For instance had the bet been structured around commercial vs non-commercial content , and they had chosen an average ranking system ( which actually seems to answer the question being asked more clearly ) , commercial content would have won by a factor of more than four .
Also of note is that with a slightly different analysis Rogers Cadenhead did come up with the same winning results based on page rank over at his blog Work Bench .
For reference here are some other “ Top Stories of 2007 ” lists that could have been considered .
Testing the first two of these lists yielded results similar to the AP list .

Microsoft ( Nasdaq : MSFT ) is a loser , Chuck .
I do n't mean this in a schoolboy taunt sort of way .
I 'm just telling you it 's not a winner .
Why else would it have spent billions in the past year acquiring companies to beef up its presence in virtualization , cloud computing , and Internet search ?
Is it because the company is losing ground in those booming niches to companies like VMware ( NYSE : VMW ) , salesforce.com ( NYSE : CRM ) , and Google ( Nasdaq : GOOG ) , respectively ?
Of course it is .
You do n't need to watch the " I'm a Mac , I 'm a PC " commercials to see that Microsoft is taking a beating .
You see it in the company 's financials where its online unit , incredibly , is operating at a loss ; overheating Xbox 360 consoles find the company taking a huge warranty hit for a system losing market share to the Wii ; and the upgrade wave of its flagship operating system has been more of a ripple than a tsunami .
That last point is important .
This was supposed to be Microsoft 's final feast , the major last hurrah for its Windows Vista operating entry and its Office 2007 suite of applications before the inevitable embrace of cheaper open source operating systems and Web - based apps .
Delays did n't heighten anticipation .
They only let the apathy simmer in a crock pot of interminable indifference .
Despite the hubbub over Vista 's features , revenue inched just 15 % higher in fiscal 2007 .
The company is guiding investors to expect a 15 % to 17 % advance this fiscal year .
Then that 's all she wrote -- make that all she coded -- for Microsoft .
Analysts expect the top line to inch just 10 % higher next year .
In fact , even Microsoft will tell you that its fortunes peaked several months ago .
After a blowout fiscal first quarter ( that ends in September for Mr. Softy ) , the company 's guidance implies a 12 % to 14 % top - line gain through the final nine months of the current fiscal year .
Forget the fact that it 's Apple 's ( Nasdaq : AAPL ) Leopard that is winning the critical praise .
Forget the fact that companies like Google and Adobe ( Nasdaq : ADBE ) are jumping into the cloud computing realm where productivity software applications are served on the cheap in cyberspace .
All you really need to ask yourself is why you 're invested in Microsoft in the first place .
Is it because the company 's dominance happens to be in the high - margin software space ?
That palatial estate is toast , my friend .
Is it because Microsoft is such a brute that it can make up the distance in emerging growth areas the way it always has with its
Web browsers and productivity suites -- by simply bundling them in new PCs ?
Man , that kind of thinking is as outdated as Y2K .
Microsoft is n't going away , but it will gradually lose its relevancy .
Could be why Bill Gates is leaving this year , dedicating his time to giving away the money he made instead of sticking around , giving away the reputation he built .
Smart guy .
Even he knows that if Microsoft is n't a winner , it becomes a loser by default .
Read Chuck Saletta 's bull argument .
Bear Rebuttal
Microsoft's Viva Pinata finds animated party toys trying to beef up their " candiosity " appeal .
I 'm starting my rebuttal with an obscure Microsoft property because Chuck is cheating you when it comes to the candiosity of the software giant 's cash pinata .
I have no argument with Chuck 's case for the attractiveness of cash in a recessionary environment .
I 'm with you !
Why is n't Microsoft on board ?
Cash and Short - Term Investments
6/30/04 $ 60.6 billion 6/30/05 $ 37.8 billion 6/30/06 $ 31.1 billion 6/30/07 $ 21.1 billion
With cash levels creeping even lower so far in fiscal 2008 , Microsoft 's cash mattress has shed two - thirds of its green feathers since peaking four summers ago .
Chunky dividends , aggressive share buybacks , and overpaying for acquisitions are n't all bad .
However , lighting cigars with greenbacks wo n't make rival products like premium Macs and dirt cheap Linux - powered laptops any less attractive or Google any less threatening .
Posthumous book claims
Ford knew of CIA coverup in Kennedy assassination David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday November 21 , 2007

Print This Email This Did the CIA orchestrate a cover -up in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy ?
According to the publisher of a new book , who appeared on Fox News Wednesday morning , the last living words of former President Gerald Ford fingered the CIA in the orchestration a cover -up of Kennedy 's assassination .
Ford , who died late last year , was the longest surviving member of the Warren Commission , which investigated Kennedy 's assassination .
The new book , " A Presidential Legacy and the Warren Commission , " was written by Ford before his death , its publisher claims .
" This book , actually authored by Gerald Ford , finally proves once and for all that the CIA , our government , did destroy documents and cover - up many facts that day in Dallas , " publisher Tim Miller told Fox & Friends Wednesday morning .
Kennedy was killed as his motorcade rolled through downtown Dallas Nov. 22 , 1963 .
Officially seen as the work of a single shooter , Lee Harvey Oswald , the Kennedy assassination has sparked myriad conspiracy theories placing responsibility for the assassination on a variety of suspects , including the CIA , the Mafia or Cuban President Fidel Castro .
Although Miller was given little time to go into detail about the book on Wednesday morning 's show , a press release gives more detail on the book , being published by Flat Signed publishers .
In the book , Ford argues that the CIA destroyed information about the assassination , but he " contends with interesting specificity that Oswald was the only shooter , " Miller says .
" There was a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy , " says Tim Miller , CEO of FlatSigned.com , in the release .
" There is no doubt that President Gerald Ford knew more about the JFK death .
There is no doubt President Clinton knows more .
Has he or any other US President since November 22 , 1963 ever swore under oath that they know no more ? "
This video is from Fox 's Fox & Friend 's , broadcast on November 21 .
Talented independent filmmakers are benefiting immensely from having their movies distributed for free on BitTorrent .
Films that might never have been heard of before are now being watched by millions of people .
Today , several of the top movies on BitTorrent sites such as mininova are independent films produced by small movie studios .
“ The Man from Earth ” and “ Day Zero ” are two recent examples of films that became known to a wide audience thanks to BitTorrent .
“ The Man from Earth ” in particular has become immensely popular due to its distribution on BitTorrent .
After RLSlog reviewed the film and linked to a torrent of it and to the official site , the producer wrote to the blogger , thanking him for reviewing it .
They had received some 23,000 hits in the days following the review and went from the being the 11,235th most popular movie on IMDB to being the 5th most popular one , and the most popular independent film in a matter of days .
He said :
Our independent movie had next to no advertising budget and very little going for it until somebody ripped one of the DVD screeners and put the movie online for all to download .
After that happened , people were watching it and started posting mostly all positive reviews on IMDb , Amazon and other places .
Most of the feedback from everyone who has downloaded “ The Man From Earth ” has been overwhelmingly positive .
People like our movie and are talking about it , all thanks to piracy on the net !
“ Day Zero “ , too , has n’t even been released yet .
But a leaked DVD screener of it has been making its way around the Internet .
The movie premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival , but will only open in a few theaters in the US on the 18 of January ’ 08 , which will be followed by a wider release in the weeks after .
Despite mainstream audiences having practically no access to this film , it has become popular online and is the 5th most seeded movie in the Drama category on mininova .
Of course there are still several independent Film producers that would rather not see their creations up for grabs while they are still running in theaters .
The following quote is taken from an email that was sent to a BitTorrent site by one of the producers of Cashback .
The film in question was downloaded nearly a million times over the past few months , reaching a much broader audience online than in the movie theaters .
Is it possible to remove it from your site for say 6 months ?
At least then it gives the filmmakers a chance to see how popular viewers really think it is , and for us to make our living .
I ca n’t really attack film piracy , because reality is , it ’s inevitable .. but until we find a real solution that works for everyone is it possible that we could have a bit of compromise from your end ?
The reaction from the producer is understandable , but I dare to argue that the popularity of independent films on BitTorrent does more good than harm .
A pirated copy does not equal a visitor lost in the movie theater , similar to music , independent films might actually profit from filesharing .
It generates a lot of word to mouth advertising .
More and more people start to recognize the potential BitTorrent has .
Last year filmmaker Mark Achbar released a torrent of the award winning Canadian documentary ‘ The Corporation ’ here on TorrentFreak .
He was one of the first to realise that filmmakers can profit from BitTorrent , even though the official distributors did not agree .
It is n’t hard to see why filmmakers are starting to look at “ piracy ” in a different light .
The more hype their movie gets early on , the greater the chance of someone wanting to buy the DVD or go see it in the cinema .
It ’s really as simple as that .
Independent filmmakers do n’t have the same promotional and marketing budgets as Hollywood studios , and getting the word out about their film is really the biggest hurdle for them .
We ’ve seen producers of TV shows start to leak content to BitTorrent and embrace filesharing , so why not movie producers too ?
The Israeli government decided that as of Thursday February 7 it will reduce electricity supplies to the Gaza Strip , a measure which will affect the civilian population region
The decision to reduce power supplies comes after the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a petition last week against the issue .
The petition was filed by ten Palestinian and Israeli Human Rights groups .
The human rights groups stated that this measure violates the international law as it deliberately causes harm to the civilians and deprives them from the basic energy they need to run vital services .
The groups also stated that the electricity cuts are also disrupting the residents and their ability to receive medical care , access to clean water , pump sewage , light and heat for their homes .
The human rights groups also stated that the Israeli Supreme Courtâ€™s decision â€œsets a dangerous precedent and ignores the international law which prohibits deliberate targeting of civiliansâ€ .
The decision also fails to stop the Israeli militaryâ€™s collective punishment against the civilians in the Gaza Strip , the groups added .
The plan which was submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court stated that the army will reduce power supply by 5 % on the three lines providing Gaza with power .
The power supplied by the first line will be cut by 5 % on Thursday , and the electricity supplies provided by the two other lines will be reduced by 5 % over the next two months .
The groups also stated that in total , the Gaza Strip will suffer a 1.5 megawatt reduction in electricity .
Also , the cut of diesel supplies to the Gaza Strip contributed to 20 % of electricity deficit in Gaza which directly affected hospitals , medical centers , water pumps and other vital services .
Currently , residents in Gaza are experiencing power outage eight hours a day , and public transportation was directly affected due to cuts in patrol and regular diesel supplies .
The international law clearly forbids any acts of punishment against the civilians and states that all countries must facilitate the passage of human supplies to the civilians .
On the ground the Gaza Strip remains under strict siege imposed by Israel and dozens of patients died after being barred from leaving the Gaza Strip for medical treatment .
1. Cooperative AI
2. Sandbox Games
3. Emergent Behaviors within Stories
4. Hierarchical Planners
5. Scripting Languages
.]
The topic for the developer discussion two weeks ago was What Trends in Game AI Do You Anticipate for 2008 ? .
Here 's a quick summary of the discussion , including comments and personal opinions , as well as tips to help you make the most of 2008 .
The first few predictions cover the AAA games industry and how AI is going to affect the design of games made , both on next - gen consoles and PC .
The latter predictions go into more technical details , which applies to lower budget and independent games too .
Developers are getting much better at building cooperating groups of enemies .
But in 2007 , pushed the boundaries of character interaction with Alyx , gathering great reception from the players . , in fact , was given the 2007 AiGameDev.com Award for Best Game AI last month .
Increasingly , developers with the bigger budgets and whole sub-teams of AI designers , animators and programmers will include cooperative AI characters to help emphasize the player 's emotional involvement with the story .
In particular , watch out for the dog in , which is an amazing idea and a lower - risk way to provide an AI sidekick .
Tip :
Think about cooperative characters early on in the design and implementation , and iterate often over the behavior .
Use traditional AI techniques to implement the behaviors , but make sure the top priority is to interact with the players without getting in their way .
andare leading the way in taking first - person shooters to new heights by giving the player more freedom , inspired by the roaming worlds of .
A sandbox means that the whole game becomes more of a simulation where AI plays an important role .
For FPS games , this means that squads are setup to be much more autonomous , and the gameplay flows thanks to the goals set by the level designers .
will take the genre to new levels with its next - gen AI , but sandboxes will generally become more popular as they provide diverse gameplay and more replayability .
These environments will allow the AI to show it 's true colors ...
Expect to see both amazingly intelligent or terribly stupid enemies as developers try to move away from short - term scripting !
As ToddM points out Build autonomous AI characters that can respond to their environments , and place them within more open areas .
Try to think of additional gameplay features as interactions with characters .
Game developers are also becoming increasingly skilled at integrating forms of emergence within linear story - like progressions .
For example , the ecosystem inis designed in such a way that you have to understand its functioning to use it to your advantage .
The enemies inalso exhibit forms of emergent group behaviors when you fight against heterogeneous groups ( e.g. and take out the leader ) .
Even in story - driven games , developers will increasingly use pockets of emergent behaviors to increase variety and replayability .
This is a great way to bring a sandbox - like environment into a more traditional AAA form , getting the benefits of both .
Design groups of characters together , and build the AI so that it responds to the rest of the group and not only the environment .
Traditional techniques like finite - state machines are perfectly acceptable to achieve this kind of emergence .
came out in 2005 and was the first major title to handle the enemy behaviors using an AI planner .
Since then , the amount of R&D on the subject in both industry and academia has been increasing dramatically .
A few games resulting from these ideas have already come out in 2007 , but many are still to be released .
In 2008 , expect to see even more planning in games as well as middleware vendors for game AI .
This should not only help improve the development efficiency so more time can be spent on little details , but it should also make the behaviors more intelligent .
Many of the features discussed in the previous points will become possible thanks to this kind of technology .
As Dave Mark comments
Watch out for middleware solutions shipping with HTN planners , and consider these as serious contenders .
Also look into the theory and practice behind hierarchical planners .
Get comfortable with them !
Games likerely heavily on Lua , which shows how mainstream the language has become .
Certainly , is n't famous for it 's AI , but this language is suitable for building AI frameworks too .
The CryENGINE ( behind ) for instance is written mainly in Lua -- with only the computationally intensive routines written in C ++.
Rather obviously , 2008 will see an even wider adoption of Lua from across the spectrum of AAA games to independent games .
Developers are finally getting a grip on building good debuggers for the language , handling errors robustly , and getting comfortable with its semi-coroutines .
However , as companies use the language for more and more aspects of the game logic and AI , some cracks will show up increasingly : - Memory allocation and garbage collection causing performance problems .
- Pure performance issues with the efficiency of the interpreter itself .
There are no obvious solutions in sight during 2008 , sadly .
This topic was brought up by Sergio in this thread of the Game AI Forums ( registration and introduction required ) .
Do n't go too far by relying on Lua to build your entire architecture .
Keep it in a statically compiled language and use scripts only where necessary , like before !
Why is the language called MACLISP ?
Does it run on the Macintosh ?
MACLISP was developed at and named in honor of MIT 's Project MAC , later known as the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science ( LCS ) , which eventually became part of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( CSAIL ) .
Project MAC was named for its conceptual relationship with “ Multiple Access Computers ” and “ Machine - Aided Cognition ” .
Founded in 1963 , more than two decades before the 1984 rollout of Apple Macintosh computers , Project MAC had nothing to do with the Apple " Mac " .
And neither did MACLISP .
What did MACLISP run on ?
MACLISP ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) PDP - 10 series ( DEC10 and DEC20 ) machines under various operating systems , and on the Honeywell 6180 / 6880 under Multics .
Why is this document called the Revised Maclisp manual ?
The original of this document was called The Revised Maclisp Manual .
It was preceded by another document , David A. Moon 's Maclisp Manual , informally and affectionately referred to by the lisp community at MIT as the Moonual .
The Moonual served as an important reference when creating this document , but this document was substantially different in presentational style , content , and scope .
It has always bothered me when a newer document takes the name of an earlier document ; it feels like historical revisionism .
So I gave this document a slightly different name to allow Moon 's older document to continue to be named unambiguously .
It was George J. Carrette who insisted that The Revised Maclisp Manual needed a cute little shorthand name like the Moonual , and who started calling it The Pitmanual .
How do The Pitmanual and the Moonual differ ?
The Moonual had focused heavily on Multics Maclisp , while The Pitmanual was heavily oriented toward the PDP - 10 .
The many differences between these machines and their associated operating systems reflected themselves as quite visible differences between the dialects that ran on the two machines .
Also , because a number of years had passed between the writing of these two manuals , The Pitmanual was able to capture descriptions of a lot of that .
The introduction of “ New I/O ” and the emergence of “ Software File Arrays ” ( SFAs ) are highly visible examples .
And , finally , the manuals differ in personality .
The Pitmanual presents not just technical data , but also offers ( carefully separated ) stylistic advice , something that was in short supply especially at that time .
Why was the 1983 hardcopy edition called the Saturday Evening Edition , and why did the web version appear as the Sunday Morning Edition ?
Names for successive drafts of the Revised Maclisp Manual were based on the idea of a one - week calendar ( starting Monday ) measuring progress toward completion .
( Of course , the actual work took several years , so this was just a metaphor . )
The Midweek Edition , for example was the draft that was thought to be half - done .
As the week crept on , version names varied by day of week and time of day , leading up to a final edition that was intended to be the Sunday Morning Edition , complete with funnies .
But , ultimately , there was n't time to arrange that level of detailing for the print edition , and I needed to just push it out the door .
So I decided to send it to press as the Saturday Evening Edition , reserving to myself the hope of finishing it properly some day .
After more than two decades , this web edition finally completes my original vision for the document as it was intended to be , with all the bells and whistles ; as such , this first web edition gets the long - reserved designation of Sunday Morning Edition .

Credit : Helen Greenwood Hansma , UC Santa Barbara
Life may have begun in the protected spaces inside of layers of the mineral mica , in ancient oceans , according to a new hypothesis .
The hypothesis was developed by Helen Hansma , a research scientist with the University of California , Santa Barbara and a program director at the National Science Foundation .
Hansma will present her findings at a press briefing on Tues. , Dec. 4 , at the annual meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology in Washington , D.C .
The Hansma mica hypothesis proposes that the narrow confined spaces between the thin layers of mica could have provided exactly the right conditions for the rise of the first biomolecules –– effectively creating cells without membranes .
The separation of the layers would have also provided the isolation needed for Darwinian evolution .
“ Some think that the first biomolecules were simple proteins , some think they were RNA , or ribonucleic acid , ” said Hansma .
“ Both proteins and RNA could have formed in between the mica sheets . ”
RNA plays an important part in translating the genetic code , and is composed of nitrogenous bases , sugar , and phosphates .
RNA and many proteins and lipids in our cells have negative charges like mica .
RNA ’s phosphate groups are spaced one half nanometer apart , just like the negative charges on mica .
Mica layers are held together by potassium .
The concentration of potassium inside the mica is very similar to the concentration of potassium in our cells .
And the seawater that bathed the mica is rich in sodium , just like our blood .
The heating and cooling of the day to night cycle would have caused the mica sheets to move up and down , and waves would have provided a mechanical energy source as well , according to the new model .
Both forms of movement would have caused the forming and breaking of chemical bonds necessary for the earliest biochemistry .
Thus the mica layers could have provided the support , shelter , and an energy source for the development of precellular life , while leaving artifacts in the structure of living things today .
Besides providing a more plausible hypothesis than the prebiotic oceanic “ soup ” model , Hansma said her new hypothesis also explains more than the so - called “ pizza ” hypothesis .
That model proposes that biomolecules originated on the surfaces of minerals from the Earth ’s crust .
The “ pizza ” hypothesis cannot explain how the earliest biomolecules obtained the right amount of water to form stable biopolymers .
A biophysicist , Hansma has worked with mica for decades beginning with her work in biological Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) in the late 1980s .
“ We put our samples on mica , because it is so atomically flat , so flat that we can see even bare DNA molecules as little ridges on the mica surface , ” said Hansma .
“ The layered mineral is made of sheets so thin ( one nanometer ) that there are a million of them in a millimeter - thick sheet of mica . ”
Hansma came upon her idea one day last spring when she was splitting some mica under her dissecting microscope .
She had collected the specimens in a mica mine in Connecticut .
The mica was covered with organic material .
“ As I was looking at the organic crud on the mica , it occurred to me that this would be a good place for life to originate –– between these sheets that can move up and down in response to water currents which would have provided the mechanical energy for making and breaking bonds , ” said Hansma .

Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) in Ruby
Your Family Guy fan - site is riding a wave of viral referrals , the community has grown tenfold in last month alone !
First , you ’ve deployed an SVD recommendation system , then you ’ve optimized the site content and layout with the help of decision trees , but of course , that was n’t enough , and you ’ve also added a Bayes classifier to help you filter and rank the content - no wonder the site is doing so well !
The community is buzzing with action , but as with any honey pot with high traffic , the spam bots have also arrived on the scene .
No problem , you think to yourself , SVMs will be perfect for this one .
History of Support Vector Machines
Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) is a supervised learning algorithm developed by Vladimir Vapnik and his co-workers at AT&T Bell Labs in the mid 90’s .
Since their inception , they have continuously been shown to outperform many prior learning algorithms in both classification , and regression applications .
In fact , the elegance and the rigorous mathematical foundations from optimization and statistical learning theory have propelled SVMs to the very forefront of the machine learning field within the last decade .
At their core , SVMs are a method for creating a predictor function from a set of training data where the function itself can be a binary , a multi-category , or even a general regression predictor .
To accomplish this mathematical feat , SVMs find a hypersurface ( for example , a plane in 2D ) which attempts to split the positive and negative examples with the largest possible margin on all sides of the ( hyper ) plane .
Thus , as you can see from the diagram , SVMs make an implicit assumption that the larger the margin or distance between the examples and the hyperplane , the better the performance of a classifier will be - arguably a leap of faith , but in practice , this assumption has proven to perform extremely well .
Certainly within the context of text classification ( spam , or not spam , for example ) SVMs have become the weapon of choice for most ML / AI researchers !
Installing and Configuring LIBSVM with Ruby
There is a plethora of available SVM implementations , but we will choose LIBSVM for our purposes .
Aside from being one of the most popular libraries , it also happens to have a set of Ruby bindings to make our life much more enjoyable !
To get yourself up and running :
# Install LIBSVM $ sudo apt - get install libsvm2 libsvm - dev libsvm - tools # Install RubySVM bindings $ wget http://debian.cilibrar.com/debian/pool/main/libs/libsvm-ruby/libsvm-ruby_2.8.4.orig.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf libsvm * $ cd libsvm * $ ./ configure $ make && make install
Preparing the Data - Building Document Vectors
To perform text classification with SVMs we first have to convert our documents to use a vector space model .
In this representation instead of working with words or sentences , the text is broken down into individual words , a unique id is assigned to each unique word , and the text is then reconstructed as a sequence of unique word ids .
As usual , a picture is worth a thousand words :
Thus , if we use the global dictionary for each document , and mark all present words as ‘ 1 ’ , and missing words as ‘ 0 ’ , Document A can be represented as [ 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 ] - indices 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 are marked as 1 , and index 3 ( Ilya ) is missing from this document .
In similar fashion , Document B would become : [ 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ] .
Thankfully , this process is easily automated with a few Ruby one - liners :
# Sample training set ... #
----------------------------------------------------------
#
Labels for each document in the training set # 1 = Spam , 0 = Not -Spam labels = [ 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ] documents = [ %w [ FREE NATIONAL TREASURE ] , # Spam %w [ FREE TV for EVERY visitor ] , # Spam %w [ Peter and Stewie are hilarious ] , # OK %w [ AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV ] , # SPAM %w [ FREE drugs ] , # SPAM %w [ New episode rocks , Peter and Stewie are hilarious ] , # OK % w [ Peter is my fav ! ]
# OK # ... ] # Test set ... #
---------------------------------------------------------- test_labels = [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] test_documents = [ %w [ FREE lotterry for the NATIONAL TREASURE !!!] , # Spam % w [ Stewie is hilarious ] , # OK %w [ Poor Peter ... hilarious ] , # OK # ... ]
#
Build a global dictionary of all possible words dictionary = ( documents + test_documents ) . flatten .
uniq puts " Global dictionary :
#{ dictionary .
inspect }
" # Build binary feature vectors for each document # -
If a word is present in document , it is marked as ' 1 ' , otherwise ' 0 ' # -
Each word has a unique ID as defined by ' dictionary ' feature_vectors = documents .
map { | doc | dictionary .
map { | x | doc .
include ? ( x ) ?
1 : 0 } } test_vectors = test_documents . map { | doc | dictionary .
map { | x | doc .
include ? ( x ) ?
1 : 0 } } puts " First training vector : #{ feature_vectors .
first .
inspect }
" puts " First test vector : #{ test_vectors .
first .
inspect }
"
For the sake of an example we ’ll keep the training set nice and short - in production , we ’re going to use hundreds of examples to train our classifier .
Nonetheless , executing our code returns ( notice that word ‘ FREE ’ which corresponds to index 0 in the dictionary below is marked as present in both the first training and first test documents , just as expected ) :
Global dictionary : [ " FREE " , " NATIONAL " , " TREASURE " , " TV " , " for " , " EVERY " , " visitor " , " Peter " , " and " , " Stewie " , " are " , " hilarious " , " AS " , " SEEN " , " ON " , " drugs " , " New " , " episode " , " rocks , " , " is " , " my " , " fav ! " , " lotterry " , " the " , " !!! " , " Poor " , " ... " ]
First training vector : [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] First test vector : [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ]
Training the Support Vector Machine
With the grunt work behind us , we ’re finally ready to train our spam classifier .
By default , LIBSVM comes with a selection of kernels which map our vectors into a higher - dimensional space - usually the default ‘ linear ’ kernel is good in 99 % of the cases , but for sake of experiment , let ’s try a few different ones :
require ' rubygems ' require ' SVM ' include SVM puts " Spam filtering test with LIBSVM " puts "-------------------------------"
# ... insert svm-documents.rb code #
Define kernel parameters -- we 'll stick with the defaults pa = Parameter .
new pa .
C = 100 pa . svm_type = NU_SVC pa . degree = 1 pa . coef0 = 0 pa . eps = 0 . 001 sp = Problem . new #
Add documents to the training set labels .
each_index { | i | sp .
addExample ( labels [ i ] , feature_vectors [ i ] ) } #
We 're not sure which Kernel will perform best , so let 's give each a try kernels = [ LINEAR , POLY , RBF , SIGMOID ] kernel_names = [ ' Linear ' , ' Polynomial ' , ' Radial basis function ' , ' Sigmoid ' ] kernels .
each_index { | j | # Iterate and over each kernel type pa .
kernel_type = kernels [ j ] m = Model .
new ( sp , pa ) errors = 0 # Test kernel performance on the training set labels .
each_index { | i | pred , probs = m .
predict_probability ( feature_vectors [ i ] ) puts " Prediction : #{ pred } , True label : #{ labels [ i ] } , Kernel : #{ kernel_names [ j ] } " errors += 1 if labels [ i ] != pred } puts " Kernel #{ kernel_names [ j ] } made #{ errors } errors on the training set " #
Test kernel performance on the test set errors = 0 test_labels .
each_index { | i | pred , probs = m .
predict_probability ( test_vectors [ i ] ) puts " \t Prediction : #{ pred } , True label : #{ test_labels [ i ] } " errors += 1 if test_labels [ i ] != pred } puts " Kernel #{ kernel_names [ j ] } made #{ errors } errors on the test set
" }
Running our SVM produces :
Global dictionary : [ " FREE " , " NATIONAL " , " TREASURE " , " TV " , " for " , " EVERY " , " visitor " , " Peter " , " and " , " Stewie " , " are " , " hilarious " , " AS " , " SEEN " , " ON " , " drugs " , " New " , " episode " , " rocks , " , " is " , " my " , " fav ! " , " lotterry " , " the " , " !!! " , " Poor " , " ... " ]
First training vector : [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] First test vector : [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ]
And there you have it , our Polynomial and Radial basis function kernels correctly identified the spam messages in the system .
Over time , and as we accumulate more and more examples , our kernel performance should only get better , and spam messages will be a thing of the past !

Hillary Clinton has gotten cozy with a Turkish - born businessman whom some have described as anti-Semitic .
Clinton ’s campaign
Web site identifies Mehmet Celebi as one of her “ HillRaisers ” – someone who has raised at least $ 100,000 for her presidential bid .
This despite Celebi ’s controversial producing credit on “ Valley of the Wolves : Iraq ” – a 2006 movie that depicted a Jewish doctor removing the vital organs of civilian prisoners to sell to wealthy transplant patients overseas .
“ In accordance with the old anti-Semitic canard , the movie portrays Jewish - American doctors as forcibly harvesting organs from Muslims to give them to Jews , ” noted Detroit lawyer and columnist Debbie Schlussel observes on her blog .
Clinton spokesman Jay Carson did n’t get back to us for comment .
p4wn , a smallish javascript chess engine
P4wn is a small public domain chess engine .
It was first released in 2002 , and substantially revised in 2012 .
Instructions
Click on the piece you want to move , then click where you want it to be .
If the game is too easy or hard , click on the computer level button until it seems about right .
When you make a stupid move , you can undo it by clicking on the undo button .
Further instructions can be found in the README file .
News
2012-08 - 12 : P4wn 2.01 released
Version 2 had user interface problems in Microsoft Explorer .
Thanks to Uwe Alex for the bug report .
2012-07-03 : P4wn 2 released
Version 2 has been released , following the apparent cessation of activity .
Read the announcement if you wish , and look out for version 3 in 2022 .
Zip and tar files can be found at Sourceforge .
2012-03 - 22 : P4wn 2 also on Github
At https://github.com/douglasbagnall/p4wn.
The clarified code is currently known as “ almost version 2 ” .
2012-03 - 19 : Switch to Git , with clarified code
All of a sudden I decided to pay some attention to this .
The git repository obsoletes the CVS , and the code has had some attention to make it explicable .
2005 -03 - 23 : Sven Vahar 's fancy version in CVS
The improved board that Sven Vahar made in December 2004 is now available in CVS , and as a zip download .
2005 -03 -04 : Unicode version by Antony Lesuisse
Antony Lesuisse replaced the external gifs with unicode glyphs , creating a completely self - contained page of only 4385 bytes .
It has been added to CVS .
If you do n't see a row of chess pieces here ( ♔♕♖♗♝♞♟ ) , you might have problems using the page - it depends on your browser 's font rendering .
2004 - 12 - 14 : New version by Sven Vahar
Sven Vahar has created a cleaner interface with help text , with both Estonian and English versions .
2004-03 - 25 : Sourceforge site registered
This is what you are looking at .
2002 -06 - 16 : First released in 5 k web competition
Development started in 2000 and skipped 2001 .
How it works
It recursively explores the tree of possible moves , keeping score along the way .
It tries to take as many pieces as possible and get into the centre early .
That 's about all .
Its endgame strategy is to win before the endgame .
Mailing list
There is a mailing list hosted by sourceforge , which averages about two messages per year .
Ask any questions there .

Nginx and Memcached , a 400 % boost !
If web architectures , performance , or scalability are topics you would like to keep on top of ( who does n’t ! ) , then chances are , you ’ve heard of Nginx ( “ engine x ” ) .
Originally developed by Igor Sysoev for rambler .ru ( second largest Russian web - site ) , it is a high - performance HTTP server / reverse proxy known for its stability , performance , and ease of use .
The great track record , a lot of great modules , and an active development community have rightfully earned it a steady uptick of users , and most recently , a notable mention in the Netcraft report .
Memcached module - an easy 4 x speed multiplier
Memcached , the darling of every web - developer , is capable of turning almost any application into a speed - demon .
Benchmarking one of my own Rails applications resulted in ~ 850 req/s on commodity , non-optimized hardware - more than enough in the case of this application .
However , what if we took Mongrel out of the equation ?
Nginx , by default , comes prepackaged with the Memcached module , which allows us to bypass the Mongrel servers and talk to Memcached directly .
Same hardware , and a quick test later : ~ 3,550 req/s , or almost a 400 % improvement !
Not bad for a five minute tweak !
Think smart , forget cache invalidations
The only snag in our scheme for easy performance gains comes with the fact that more often than not , our application servers contain additional caching policies ( read invalidations / authentication ) , and MIME type logic .
The former , as recently documented by Tobias Lütke and Geoffrey Grosenbach , if properly thought through can be solved with some clever URL rewriting policies and automatic TTL timeouts .
When implemented correctly , we could simply set the memcached key to be the full request URL , allowing us to completely bypass our app. servers .
MIME - type logic
MIME type magic can be as easy as complex as we wish .
If you only serve one content type ( ‘ text / html ’ , for example ) , the solution is simple :
location /dynamic_request { #
Set default type to text / html default_type text / html ; # ... }
Dynamic argument types , just for fun
However , if we want to serve multiple content - types , or perhaps even parameterize the request type in a query string , we ’ve got some extra work to do .
Not unlike any other HTTP server , Nginx checks the filetype extension at the end of every request path to determine the correct content - type header , a solution which unfortunately breaks down in majority of modern , URL friendly web - applications :
GET /dynamic_request.js - Content - Type = text / javascript
GET /dynamic_request - Content - Type = ?
GET /dynamic_request?format=js - Content - Type = ?
Case 1 is easily solved by Nginx directly .
Case 2 is tricky , but can be solved via a ‘ default_type ’ line in the config as document above .
And case 3 will require some additional logic - namely , we can hardcode a rule to rewrite our dynamic query string parameters to automagically add an extension to the path of each incoming request :
location / dynamic_request { # append an extenstion for proper MIME type detection if ( $ args ~ * format=json ) { rewrite ^/dynamic_request /?(.*) $ /dynamic_request.js $ 1 break ; } if ( $ args ~ * format=xml ) { rewrite ^/dynamic_request /?(.*) $ /dynamic_request.xml $ 1 break ; } memcached_pass 127.0.0.1 : 11211 ; error_page 404 = @dynamic_request ; }
nginx.conf - Full Nginx sample config
That should do the trick !
Cache invalidations are handled , MIME types are served correctly , and our app .
servers are bypassed in 95 % + of the cases .
Instead , Nginx talks directly to Memcached and only proxies the cache misses - an easy 400 % performance boost !
WASHINGTON , Sept. 7 - Senator Bob Graham , the Florida Democrat who is a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , accused the White House on Tuesday of covering up evidence that might have linked Saudi Arabia to the Sept. 11 hijackers .
Mr. Graham made the accusation in a new book and repeated it at a news conference Tuesday arranged by Senator John Kerry 's presidential campaign .
Republicans called the accusations " bizarre conspiracy theories , " and the Saudis said they were unsubstantiated and reckless .
The accusation stems from the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's refusal to allow investigators for a Congressional inquiry and the independent Sept. 11 commission to interview an informant , Abdussattar Shaikh , who had been the landlord in San Diego of two Sept. 11 hijackers .
In his book " Intelligence Matters , " Mr. Graham , the co-chairman of the Congressional inquiry with Representative Porter J. Goss , Republican of Florida , said an F.B.I. official wrote them in November 2002 and said " the administration would not sanction a staff interview with the source . "
On Tuesday , Mr. Graham called the letter " a smoking gun " and said , " The reason for this cover - up goes right to the White House . "
David Shuster : ' Bill O'Reilly is a jerk ... a buffoon '
In the middle of a discussion of the Democratic primaries on MSNBC's Morning Joe , correspondent David Shuster burst out , " I do n't know if this is the time to talk about Bill O'Reilly , but I 've got a lot of things I want to say . "
When encouraged to " get it out , " Shuster stated emphatically , " Bill O'Reilly is a jerk . "
" There 's Bill O'Reilly at a Barack Obama event , " Shuster explained .
" Bill O'Reilly shoved a guy -- shoved a guy who was working for Barack Obama , because the guy happened to be standing in a certain spot .
And there 's Bill O'Reilly saying , ' Nobody gets in the way of the Factor 's cameras . ' ... Obama comes up , and what does Bill O'Reilly do ?
Does he ask some tough penetrating question ?
... No . ' Will you come on my show ? ' "
" Give me a break , " said Shuster .
" What a jerk .
What a jerk .
Fox News ought to be so embarrassed with this guy . "
" He 's a cartoon character , " agreed Mika Brzezinski .
" He 's a buffoon , " amplified Shuster .
" He 's such a buffoon , and everybody knows it . "
" It is unfortunate , " commented Scarborough , " that that 's the way he 's got to get glimpses of presidential candidates . "
" I 'll tell you what , " Scarborough concluded .
" A guy that we do n't have to push to get on , Mike Huckabee .
...
But guess what ?
his security guy ?
Bill O'Reilly ain't going to be pushing him : Chuck Norris . "
A detailed discussion of the O'Reilly incident can be found at Media Matters .
This video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast January 7 , 2008 .
That 's right ... Today we held our local district conventions and selected our delegates to the State convention in Alaska .
We turned out the Paulites !
Not only did we get a clear majority of delegates to the state ( we were very organized and completely stealthy in this - it was like a surprise attack by Ron Paul ) , but listen to this ... While we were there we voted on platform changes for the state GOP .
You will not believe some of the stuff that passed !
The most controversial one was the one that I proposed .
There was a section in the platform that said the Republican Party of Alaska opposes any sort of gaming ( gambling ) in the state on the basis that it is harmful to families and communities .
I proposed striking that out entirely , from the standpoint of personal and economic liberty , and after huge debate and three recounts my movement PASSED by ONE VOTE !
So now that its passed the local level , it 'll go on to state !
Guess what else ?
Another Ron Paul supporter proposed striking out and replacing a section that said something to the effect of : " The Republican Party of Alaska supports the aggressive world wide war on terror and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
The replacement that PASSED read something like : " We will not support military intervention in a foreign country unless a constitutional , congressional declaration of war is made . "
How HUGE is that ?
And perhaps the craziest win of the day , in my opinion , was when we passed a movement to change the party platform to read that we , as Republicans , support the legalization of industrial hemp .
LOL !
Lots of other awesome platform changes passed , having to do with state 's rights , educational choice , and immigration .
Everything was in line with the Ron Paul platform , and pretty Libertarian sounding !
The other conventions that took place elsewhere today and earlier in the week have also reported high numbers of Ron Paul delegates to the state convention , and similar interesting successes at their local level .
It really looks to me like we can go to the state convention and ENACT some extremely controversial party platform changes !
It would be so great to see the neo-cons have to run independent for failing to endorse the Republican Party platform , and so great to see them squirm in terror when they realize that RON PAUL has TAKEN OVER THEIR PARTY !
Anyway ... I just had to share this !
When NBC dis -invited Kucinich from the Las Vegas Debate , he sued the network , owned by General Electric , for illegally shutting him out of the debate because of his views .
On Monday , prompted by Kucinich 's request for a temporary restraining order against NBC Universal , Nevada District Court Judge Charles Thompson issued an injunction stating that MSNBC could not proceed with the debate unless Kucinich was included .
NBC ’s stated reasoning for dis-inviting Kucinich less than 48 hours after he received their formal invitation , was that they changed their minds about the qualifications .
Aside from the breach - of - contract issue , Kucinich ’s campaign is recognized by the federal government .
One might think that would trump NBC .
Not to mention that the people of the United States are the legal owners of the airwaves .
So , Judge Thompson ’s ruling in Kucinich ’s favor on Monday seemed to be in keeping with the laws of the land — of the people , by the people and for the people .
On Tuesday , of course , NBC appealed .

Just a month or so after Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with senior Syrian government officials , and was labeled a traitor by Republicans for visiting " a terror state , " US Secretary of State Condi Rice is now planning to meet with senior Syrian government officials .
Imagine that .
So does Pelosi get credit for the breakthrough in relations , or is Condi a traitor too ?

Rick�s Picks Wednesday , January 23 , 2008 � Phenomenally accurate forecasts �
We�ve never doubted there�s a Plunge Protection Team lurking out there somewhere , ready to do battle with the gravity , but until yesterday we were skeptical The Team would try something so unsubtle as buying stocks hand - over - fist when a selling panic threatened .
That �s the way most market - watchers seem to think the PPT operates , and their conspiracy theory is not without merit .
One reason it seems plausible is that , with the backing of the U.S. Treasury -- and no margin requirements ! --
The Team could propagate an overwhelming rally risking relative chump change .
But is the government�s mere ability to temporarily manipulate the markets higher justification for doing so ?
Consider the consequences if official meddling were to backfire in some presently unimaginable way .
Heads would roll .
Cushy jobs would be lost .
Performance bonuses would evaporate .
More to the point , who needs some shadowy cabal to keep stocks from collapsing when there will always be panic - stricken bears ready and eager to do the job -- to do it far more effectively , we can safely assume , than any dozen of the best and brightest MBAs the government could possibly recruit from the ranks of Wall Street .
The bears acted yesterday as though they were out to prove the point , driving one of the most powerful short - squeeze rallies we can recall .
Its strength was deceptive because probably half of the move was hidden when the Dow fell 400 points in the opening minutes of the session .
In a more rational world , the blue chip average would have opened down 1,000 points , keeping pace with plummeting stocks in Europe and Asia ; instead , when U.S. stocks began to trade , they held like a rock near the overnight lows .
This is shown in the S&P futures chart above -- as compelling a picture as you will ever see of what traders refer to as �strong hands . �
This is not the buying of mere institutional traders second - guessing each other so as to produce a raggedy series of lows .
Rather , it is a buyer whose 1255.50 bid was set in concrete , fearlessly oblivious to the selling panics that had overwhelmed the world�s bourses for two consecutive days .
The bid held for long enough to exhaust sellers , as it doubtless was intended to do , causing the major averages to rally back to unchanged on the strength of the massive short - covering that followed .
The Plunge Protection Team may have rescued the market for a day , but we doubt it will prove clever enough to reverse the bearish tide .
Nor do we expect yesterday�s unscheduled , 75 - basis - point easing by the Fed to stop the bloodfest in the credit markets .
The central bank�s timing may have been perfect , coordinated as it obviously was to add punch to the PPT�s buying of index futures , but at the end of the day it left hanging the menacing question � What next ? � � or to be even more cynical about it , the question , �So what ? �

On lying in bed
Lying in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if only one had a coloured pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling .
This , however , is not generally a part of the domestic apparatus on the premises .
I think myself that the thing might be managed with several pails of Aspinall and a broom .
Only if one worked in a really sweeping and masterly way , and laid on the colour in great washes , it might drip down again on one ’s face in floods of rich and mingled colour like some strange fairy rain ; and that would have its disadvantages .
I am afraid it would be necessary to stick to black and white in this form of artistic composition .
To that purpose , indeed , the white ceiling would be of the greatest possible use ; in fact , it is the only use I think of a white ceiling being put to .
But for the beautiful experiment of lying in bed I might never have discovered it .
For years I have been looking for some blank spaces in a modern house to draw on .
Paper is much too small for any really allegorical design ; as Cyrano de Bergerac says , “ Il me faut des géants ” [ “ I need giants ” ] .
But when I tried to find these fine clear spaces in the modern rooms such as we all live in I was continually disappointed .
I found an endless pattern and complication of small objects hung like a curtain of fine links between me and my desire .
I examined the walls ; I found them to my surprise to be already covered with wallpaper , and I found the wallpaper to be already covered with uninteresting images , all bearing a ridiculous resemblance to each other .
I could not understand why one arbitrary symbol ( a symbol apparently entirely devoid of any religious or philosophical significance ) should thus be sprinkled all over my nice walls like a sort of small - pox .
The Bible must be referring to wallpapers , I think , when it says , “ Use not vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do . ”
I found the Turkey carpet a mass of unmeaning colours , rather like the Turkish Empire , or like the sweetmeat called Turkish Delight .
I do not exactly know what Turkish Delight really is ; but I suppose it is Macedonian Massacres .
Everywhere that I went forlornly , with my pencil or my paint brush , I found that others had unaccountably been before me , spoiling the walls , the curtains , and the furniture with their childish and barbaric designs .
. . . . .
Nowhere did I find a really clear space for sketching until this occasion when I prolonged beyond the proper limit the process of lying on my back in bed .
Then the light of that white heaven broke upon my vision , that breadth of mere white which is indeed almost the definition of Paradise , since it means purity and also means freedom .
But alas !
like all heavens , now that it is seen it is found to be unattainable ; it looks more austere and more distant than the blue sky outside the window .
For my proposal to paint on it with the bristly end of a broom has been discouraged — never mind by whom ; by a person debarred from all political rights — and even my minor proposal to put the other end of the broom into the kitchen fire and turn it to charcoal has not been conceded .
Yet I am certain that it was from persons in my position that all the original inspiration came for covering the ceilings of palaces and cathedrals with a riot of fallen angels or victorious gods .
I am sure that it was only because Michael Angelo was engaged in the ancient and honourable occupation of lying in bed that he ever realized how the roof of the Sistine Chapel might be made into an awful imitation of a divine drama that could only be acted in the heavens .
The tone now commonly taken toward the practice of lying in bed is hypocritical and unhealthy .
Of all the marks of modernity that seem to mean a kind of decadence , there is none more menacing and dangerous than the exultation of very small and secondary matters of conduct at the expense of very great and primary ones , at the expense of eternal ties and tragic human morality .
If there is one thing worse than the modern weakening of major morals , it is the modern strengthening of minor morals .
Thus it is considered more withering to accuse a man of bad taste than of bad ethics .
Cleanliness is not next to godliness nowadays , for cleanliness is made essential and godliness is regarded as an offence .
A playwright can attack the institution of marriage so long as he does not misrepresent the manners of society , and I have met Ibsenite pessimists who thought it wrong to take beer but right to take prussic acid .
Especially this is so in matters of hygiene ; notably such matters as lying in bed .
Instead of being regarded , as it ought to be , as a matter of personal convenience and adjustment , it has come to be regarded by many as if it were a part of essential morals to get up early in the morning .
It is upon the whole part of practical wisdom ; but there is nothing good about it or bad about its opposite .
. . . . .
Misers get up early in the morning ; and burglars , I am informed , get up the night before .
It is the great peril of our society that all its mechanisms may grow more fixed while its spirit grows more fickle .
A man ’s minor actions and arrangements ought to be free , flexible , creative ; the things that should be unchangeable are his principles , his ideals .
But with us the reverse is true ; our views change constantly ; but our lunch does not change .
Now , I should like men to have strong and rooted conceptions , but as for their lunch , let them have it sometimes in the garden , sometimes in bed , sometimes on the roof , sometimes in the top of a tree .
Let them argue from the same first principles , but let them do it in a bed , or a boat , or a balloon .
This alarming growth of good habits really means a too great emphasis on those virtues which mere custom can ensure , it means too little emphasis on those virtues which custom can never quite ensure , sudden and splendid virtues of inspired pity or of inspired candour .
If ever that abrupt appeal is made to us we may fail .
A man can get used to getting up at five o’clock in the morning .
A man cannot very well get used to being burnt for his opinions ; the first experiment is commonly fatal .
Let us pay a little more attention to these possibilities of the heroic and unexpected .
I dare say that when I get out of this bed I shall do some deed of an almost terrible virtue .
For those who study the great art of lying in bed there is one emphatic caution to be added .
Even for those who can do their work in bed ( like journalists ) , still more for those whose work cannot be done in bed ( as , for example , the professional harpooners of whales ) , it is obvious that the indulgence must be very occasional .
But that is not the caution I mean .
The caution is this : if you do lie in bed , be sure you do it without any reason or justification at all .
I do not speak , of course , of the seriously sick .
But if a healthy man lies in bed , let him do it without a rag of excuse ; then he will get up a healthy man .
If he does it for some secondary hygienic reason , if he has some scientific explanation , he may get up a hypochondriac .

Should you buy something ( or not ) ?
There is , sitting in the store window , all 36x24x4 inches of it – the plasma TV of your dreams .
For the past two weeks it 's taken enough willpower to bend spoons to keep yourself from slapping down the plastic and walking off with the thing strapped to your back .
You envision it hanging in your living room like fine art , only better : this piece of fine art linked with the TiVo you plan to buy next will get 473 sports events per week including 24 - hour high - stakes poker , all in high - definition surround sound .
At least that would be the case if it were n't for the current featherweight state of your wallet .
This equation weighs the desirability of the purchase against its practicality .
If it 's a good buy and you have the money , of course you should buy the item .
However , if your desire and need fails to outweigh the cost and it's also a bit of an impulse buy , perhaps you should consider waiting for your heart to stop its consumer - frenzy palpitations .
Or maybe think about investing this money in a safe place until your judgement improves .

Free enterprise has been good to Bill Gates .
But today , the Microsoft Corp. chairman will call for a revision of capitalism .
In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , the software tycoon plans to call for a " creative capitalism " that uses market forces to address poor - country needs that he feels are being ignored .

New York , NY – Tom Kuratagi , President of Sony Electronics , announced that in the fall of 2008 all Sony electronic products would be featuring the new Sony eConnect HD electrical plugs instead of standard power connections .
" Power connector standards have n't changed for years and vary from country to country .
We think a unifying standard like Sony eConnect HD will broaden the market for electronics as well as offer features previously missing from power connectors , " said Kuratagi .
Many think the seeming victory of Sony 's Blu - Ray over HD - DVD standard emboldened the company to make the move .
The new standard plug will require new outlets ( pictured left ) for homes around the world .
Kuratagi said the new connector had something for everyone , " For consumers , eConnect HD will be able to handle HD electricity up to 1080 Hz which is crucial for the next generation of electronics .
For electricity producers , the connector will stop electricity theft by consumers by preventing time - shifting of electric power from outlets into rechargeable batteries . "

Many critics do n't think that consumers will rewire their entire home just to use a Sony product .
" Sony has made some boneheaded moves in the past , but this tops them all , including ATRAC , " said Tom Warrick of HD-electronics.pl .
However , many of the largest utility companies in the world have embraced the standard , and the world 's largest union of electricians has also lent its support , so consumers may not have a choice but to convert .

At 4 in the morning of May 1 , 2005 , deputies from the El Paso County Sheriff 's Office converged on the suburban Colorado Springs home of Richard Gasper , a TSA screener at the local Colorado Springs Municipal Airport .
They were expecting to find a desperate , suicidal gunman holding Gasper and his daughter hostage .

" I will shoot , " the gravely voice had warned , in a phone call to police minutes earlier .
" I 'm not afraid .
I will shoot , and then I will kill myself , because I do n't care . "
Matt 's phone friends — some of whom had being trying to get Rosoff and his associates arrested for years — cautioned Matt to steer clear of the group .
But the teen was cocky and arrogant , and was swept in by Rosoff 's goading , even coming to believe he was invulnerable to prosecution .
" They told him things like , ' You do n't have to worry about this , you 're a blind kid , you 're a minor , ' " says Lotus .
" They would feed this kid this bullshit , and eventually he'd start to believe it . "
The gang specialized in serving up trouble to people who defied them on the party lines .
Their most common tactic was swatting .
Using a commercial caller ID spoofing service called SpoofCard , they 'd call police departments around the country with false alarms , triggering tense confrontations between armed cops and the victims , at least two of whom have suffered injuries .
It was , relatively speaking , mild stuff .
The teen though , soon fell in with a bad crowd .
The party lines were dominated by a gang of half - a- dozen miscreants who informally called themselves the " Wrecking Crew " and " The Cavalry . "
The group was led by a 40 - year - old Cleveland ex-con named Stuart Rosoff , a.k.a.
" Michael Knight , " and Guadalupe Santana Martinez , Jr. , a.k.a. , " Wicked Wizard . "
Matt says he ordered phone company switch manuals off the internet and paid to have them translated into Braille .
He became a regular caller to internal telephone company lines , where he 'd masquerade as an employee to perform tricks like tracing telephone calls , getting free phone features , obtaining confidential customer information and disconnecting his rivals ' phones .
Perhaps grateful to have a worthy protégé to receive his knowledge , Daniels did n't give much thought to how Matt would use it .
" I do n't sit down and say , ' Hey Matt , I 'm going to teach you how to infiltrate such - and - such , ' " Daniels says .
" The conversation starts with a discussion about how equipment operates . "
" We 're enemies at this time , " says Daniels , a 36 - year - old Alabama man who runs one of the party lines .
" And he 's telling me in this little 12 - year - old sounding voice what he 's going to do to me . "
He laughs .
After Matt lost a phone war with Daniels , the elder phone phreak became Matt 's closest friend and mentor , schooling him in the ins-and - outs of the phone system .
Matt started asking questions about phone phreaking , learning a little .
The party lines are a gladiator school of mischief , and Matt began challenging experienced phone hackers with the obscenity - laced bravado of a teenage boy feeling power for the first time .
Blind hackers were a part of the first generation of phone phreaks in the 1970s , and it 's easy to see the draw .
On the phone , Matt 's handicap is irrelevant , and his gifts — which include his ironclad memory , and vocal skills that can mimic a much older man , or masquerade as a woman — make him an impresario .
A party line denizen called " Lotus " remembers the first time he encountered Matt at a Boston conference .
" He was sitting in the room beat - boxing .
And I was like , who 's playing the drums in here ?
And it was just Li'l Hacker . "
" I 've been interested in phones since I 've been about 8 , " says Matt , who lives with his single mother , and older brother and younger sister in an East Boston apartment .
" I talked to technicians when they came down here to do things on my phone . "
Like those early conferences , modern party lines are also home to a small cohort of phone phreaks — hackers who specialize in telephone systems .
It 's a subculture that immediately appealed to Matt .
While similar to online , text - based chat rooms , the party lines are actually an echo of a much older phenomenon that began in the early 1980s with home - brew phone conferences boasting anywhere from two to eight call - in lines .
Today 's computerized party lines offer virtually limitless capacity , and include features like multiple " rooms " for different groups to congregate .
Matt appeared on the phone phreaking scene in late 2004 , when a neighbor gave him the number of a telephone party line called the Boston Raven .
Party lines are privately run telephone - conferencing facilities where people from around the country dial in and socialize , forming friendships , romances and , at times , bitter enemies .
It 's as though the phone companies — which enjoy notoriously close relations with the feds — are so adept at getting their hackers arrested that they 're little motivated to spend money securing their sprawling infrastructures .
If malicious phone phreaks were the only threat to telecom customers , that might be a sound strategy .
But as the pretexting scandals of 2006 showed , the same vulnerabilities make things easy for snoops and criminals of all stripes , and a report released this week tallying identity theft complaints ranks AT&T and Sprint customers as the second and third most victimized , respectively .
The holes he 's exploiting are in large part the same ones a previous generation of phreaks relied on .
He 's running variations of the same old scams .
Daniels notices this as well .
" He is nasty as the day is long because he knows a few tricks from the old days , " he says .
Interviews by Wired.com with Matt and his associates , and a review of court documents , FBI reports and audio recordings , paints a picture of a young man with an uncanny talent for quick telephone con jobs .
Able to commit vast amounts of information to memory instantly , Matt has mastered the intricacies of telephone switching systems , while developing an innate understanding of human psychology and organization culture — knowledge that he uses to manipulate his patsies and torment his foes .
Innocent at first , Matt 's worst instincts surfaced after he fell in with a gang of telephone ruffians — men as old as 40 — who eventually fingered the teenager when they were swept up in an FBI crackdown on swatters late last year .
The government says the gang launched swatting attacks in over 60 cities , leaving hundreds of victims and chalking up over $ 250,000 in losses .
" Who 's the best out there ? " says Jeff Daniels , a veteran phone hacker and an admitted mentor to Matt .
" The little blind kid is one of the best .
And that 's a fact . "
If he 's guilty , the attack is at once the least sophisticated and most malicious of a string of capers linked to Matt , who stumbled into the lingering remains of the decades - old subculture of phone phreaking when he was 14 , and quickly rose to become one of the most skilled active phreakers alive .
Now the FBI thinks it has identified the culprit in the Colorado swatting as a 17 - year - old East Boston phone phreak known as " Li'l Hacker . "
Because he 's underage , Wired.com is not reporting Li'l Hacker 's last name .
His first name is Matthew , and he poses a unique challenge to the federal justice system , because he is blind from birth .
A federal Joint Terrorism Task Force would later conclude that Gasper had been the victim of a new type of nasty hoax , called " swatting , " that was spreading across the United States .
Pranksters were phoning police with fake murders and hostage crises , spoofing their caller IDs so the calls appear to be coming from inside the target 's home .
The result : police SWAT teams rolling to the scene , sometimes bursting into homes , guns drawn .
But instead of a gunman , it was Gasper himself who stepped into the glare of police floodlights .
Deputies ordered Gasper 's hands up and held him for 90 minutes while searching the house .
They found no armed intruder , no hostages bound in duct tape .
Just Gasper 's 18 - year - old daughter and his baffled parents .
Though Danielle doubted his claim that he was only 15 , and blind ( she thought he could be as old as 20 ) , Hacker Matt seemed like a nice guy , she later told investigators .
But as she spoke with him twice a day for about a week , he became less nice , and started pressing her for phone sex .
Their relationship soured for good when the family phone rang at 3 a.m. on May 1 of that year , a few hours before Richard Gasper was scheduled to start his shift as a screener at the Colorado Springs Municipal Airport .
Hacker Matt asked for Danielle , who was asleep in the other room .
" I want to have phone sex with her , " the caller told Gasper .
Gasper called the man a pervert and hung up , perhaps thinking that ended the matter .
But Hacker Matt was persistent .
" What 's the matter ? " Gasper asked on the next call .
" Ca n't you get sex from a real woman ? "
On the fourth call , the caller threatened to " knock the dimple off " Danielle 's chin and to " blow up the fucking airport with ( Gasper ) in it . "
Minutes after the Gaspers hung up on Hacker Matt for the fifth time , the phone rang at the Colorado Springs Police Department .
A recording of the call was obtained by Wired.com .
" Now listen here , " the caller growled .
" I 've got two people here held hostage , all right ?
Now you know what happens to people that are held hostage .
It 's not like on the movies or nothing , all right ?
You understand that ? "
" OK , " the female dispatcher replied calmly .
" One them here 's name is Danielle , and her father . "
Identifying himself as John Defanno , the caller claimed to be armed with a .22 caliber handgun , and said the hostages were duct - taped , and the father injured .
" Defanno " warned dispatchers not to send armed police into the house .
" I will shoot , " he said .
In an effective touch , he seemed to address someone in the room " Shut up ! " he barked .
The Sheriffs Office responded quickly .
They called Gasper 's number , and Gasper told them about the phone calls and the bomb threat .
But they did n't believe him .
Shortly after 4 a.m. , deputy sheriffs showed up at his house , ostensibly to take a report .
When Gasper stepped outside to meet them , he was taken into custody while police stormed the house .
His daughter and his parents were inside , but , of course , there was no gunman .
The next day , Gasper 's phone was mysteriously forwarded to the FBI 's office in Washington DC .
In the aftermath of the swatting , Karl Mai , a deputy sheriff detailed to the FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force in Colorado Springs , started looking for Hacker Matt .
Adam Panagia , the head of AT&T 's fraud division , passed on a tip from an informant that Li'l Hacker had been heard bragging about the Gasper swatting .
But the investigation petered out after two months .
In two phone interviews with Wired.com , Matt was evasive and taciturn .
He spouted angrily about the crimes committed by other party liners , particularly Rosoff and Martinez , but declined to answer questions about his own activities .
He denies making any swatting calls .
But Daniels says Matt , particularly in his younger days , was capable of unleashing hell on his perceived enemies .
" You do n't have a clue , " says Daniels .
" He was a raving lunatic … He could decide he does n't like you , and he could make your life a living hell , and there 's nothing you could do about it . "
" I give that guy props , but in some respects he's not smart enough for his own IQ , " says Jered Morgan , a phone phreak known as Lucky225 .
Unlike Rosoff and the others , though , Matt seemed to develop some restraint as he grew more skilled .
Instead of sending police out to people 's houses , or phoning Child Protective Services with false abuse reports , Matt spent more of his time calling internal phone company numbers and flexing his growing access to phone company systems .
According to the government , between August and October 2006 Matt logged more than 50 pretext phone calls to Verizon 's provisioning center in Irving , Texas .
He also told party liners that he could eavesdrop on calls on Verizon 's network with the help of a credulous employee .
Verizon admits to suffering some breaches , but emphasizes that it was purely indirect .
" No one has literally accessed a Verizon computer , but there has been social engineering taking place , " says Verizon spokesman William Kula .
Li'l Hacker caught on tape .
The blind hacker calls in a disconnect order on an enemy 's phone .
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/article/full/2008/02/little_hacker_social.mp3
To hack AT&T , Matt boldly adopted the identity of a real phone company security agent named William Jones .
In a series of undated recordings obtained by Wired.com , Matt is heard repeatedly phoning AT&T 's internal help desk to get workers to disconnect the phone of Kenneth McComas , a party line rival who lives in Ohio .
" We 're looking at a fraud account , " he said in one call , affecting a confident baritone .
" We 're just gonna have to take that out of there . "
While the worker processed the order , Matt kept him engaged in jocular small talk thick with camaraderie .
His enthusiasm sometimes chaffed other hackers .
At one point , Matt allegedly hacked into a Verizon recorded - announcement system that tells callers when a number has been disconnected or changed .
Other hackers were exploiting the system for more subtle pranks , until Matt stomped over the recordings with his own voice .
" If you called any number that was not in service , you would hear him say some weird shit , " says Teli Brown , a former phone hacker known as " Gray Area . "
" It was funny , but it ruined it . "
By then , Matt 's reputation had taken on a life of its own , and tales of some of his hacks — perhaps apocryphal — are now legends .
According to Daniels , he hacked his school 's PBX so that every phone would ring at once .
Another time , he took control of a hotel elevator , sending it up and down over and over again .
One story has it that Matt phoned a telephone company frame room worker at home in the middle of the night , and persuaded him to get out of bed and return to work to disconnect someone 's phone .
To Matt 's family , the teen 's interest in telephony seemed harmless .
His 18 - year - old brother would read him articles on hacking , according to Lotus .
And while Matt was on the party lines , his mother , Amy , could sometimes be heard in the background playfully imitating his frequent pose as an AT&T technician .
" I think that she has concerns , " says a Boston phone phreak who was Matt 's only real - life friend from the party lines .
" She 's like , ' Do n't get yourself into trouble . '
But I know that she also respects Matt 's interest .
She knows that it makes him happy , and she 's proud of how much Matt 's learned . "
( Amy could not be reached for comment , and the family 's lawyer did not return repeated phone calls ) .
The Boston phone phreak , who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of FBI attention , is the only party liner to meet Matt in person .
In the summer of 2006 , he showed up at Matt 's home to intercede in a brewing confrontation between Matt and another Boston party liner .
The visitor chatted with Matt 's family for a few minutes , before meeting Matt , a heavyset kid with a shaved head .
The visit was a rare incursion into Matt 's real life from the phone world , and Matt was shaking with nervousness .
" I showed up unexpected , and he did n't know what was going on when I rang the bell , " says the phone phreak .
" But after a few minutes he calmed down . "
On another day , the Boston phone phreak met up with Matt at an East Boston plaza while Matt 's mother was shopping .
Often brusque and abusive on the party lines , " in person , he 's a very friendly guy , " the phone phreak says .
" Easy to get along with and have a conversation with . "
The friends hacked on a pay phone for an hour - and - a - half .
But the Boston phone phreak eventually distanced himself as Matt became more involved with Stuart Rosoff and the other swatters — a relationship characterized by posturing and mutual harassment .
" Stuart E. Rosoff is going get on his knees and suck my pole , dude , " Matt taunted one day , in a recorded party line conversation .
" He cut my phone off three times today … But I got it back on , three times . "
" You wo n't get it back on any more , " Rosoff responded , incorrectly .
Poll : How Good
Is the Blind Hacker ?
Mitnick Weighs
In Matt 's roughhousing with the swatters alarmed his party line friends , who'd become protective of the sharp - tongued teen .
When Rosoff began harassing Matt 's mother , another phone phreak sent $ 800 to help the family move .
Their new location did n't stay a secret for long , though .
" He moved , literally , right around the block , " says Lotus .
" He had his phone all rigged so it was showing different locations , and they still tracked him down .
They started to harass him again and sucked him back in . "
But time was running out for the swatters .
They 'd gotten away with their harassment in large part because each individual swatting call was considered a minor , local offense — a misdemeanor in some jurisdictions .
No law enforcement agency had ever stitched them all together .
Then , on Oct. 1 , 2006 , Martinez staged a swatting attack against Stephanie Proulx , a female party line participant in Fort Worth , Texas .
When police arrived , expecting to find a shooting in progress , a detective on the scene realized he 'd already been to the apartment on an earlier false emergency call .
He interviewed Proulx , who told him all about Rosoff , Martinez and other members of the gang .
Martinez had even swatted her father in Cleburne , Texas .
The detective called in the FBI .
Special agent Allyn Lynd , from the FBI 's nine - person Dallas cyber - crime squad , began an investigation .
A West Point graduate and a veteran of the Global Hell defacement gang prosecutions of the late 1990s , Lynd phoned up corporate security officers at Verizon and AT&T , who had been tracking the party liners for years .
Verizon sent Lynd their file on Li'l Hacker , complete with call logs showing Matt phoning a variety of internal Verizon offices , including RCMAC , an office responsible for entering commands directly into telephone switches .
AT&T security agent Gary Beaulieu had a hotter tip :
He told Lynd about Rosoff , who at that very moment was serving time for telephone harassment in a county jail in Cleveland .
Lynd booked a flight to Ohio .
Before he left he ran a check through the FBI 's computers for incidents similar to the Proulx case .
He found the 2005 Colorado Springs case linked to " Hacker Matt , " and contacted Karl Mai to see if he had any questions for Rosoff .
Mai had a request , according to a task force report on the case .
" Any information developed as to the real identity of Hacker Matt would be helpful . "
On Nov. 21 , 2006 , Lynd and a partner interviewed Rosoff in jail .
The details of the conversation are hard to come by , but court records indicate that on that day , Lynd obtained a new confidential informant .
The informant provided ample details about the swatting incidents , naming Martinez , a New York man named Chad Ward , and Jason Trowbridge , a bill collector who'd used his access to a consumer database to get information on the gang 's targets .
The anonymous informant , Lynd admitted in an affidavit , " has been accused by members of the party lines as being engaged in telephone harassment . "
The informant also gave Lynd something the FBI had been looking for since 2005 : the real name of Little Hacker .
Two weeks later , the FBI held the first of several meetings with Matt in the East Boston apartment , while his worried mother looked on .
The teenager proved to be a fount of information on Rosoff 's and Martinez 's actions , but he became evasive when the feds asked him about his own hacking .
" They asked , hey , are you able to drop in on lines ? "
Matt recalls .
" And I told them , I 'd rather not talk about things like that . "
Lynd began grooming Matt as a confidential informant , a path that would make it easy to let the teen emerge relatively unscathed from the looming swatting prosecutions .
But the phone companies
Matt so effortlessly manipulated were less forgiving of the blind teenager .
AT&T investigator Gary Beaulieu began monitoring the phone numbers Matt called .
When Beaulieu saw Matt dial into a party line just a few days after the hacker made a deal with the FBI , the phone cop called in to listen .
He heard another phone phreak describe a new way to forward somebody 's phone without their knowledge using a particular AT&T facility .
Matt 's phone was soon seen calling the AT&T number .
Beaulieu passed the information onto Lynd , and Matt was in hot water again .
Prosecutor Linda Groves called Matt 's attorney , and warned that if Matt continued to hack the phone companies , he 'd lose his status as a protected informant .
Matt agreed to record some phone calls with Rosoff 's crew for the FBI , and in January he turned over four cassette tapes filled with calls .
But he did n't stop hacking .
By February , the FBI had formally revoked his status as a confidential informant , and began planning for his indictment .
Lynd told Mai that Matt could n't stop hacking for more than 72 hours .
Daniels agrees , but says his protégé can't help himself .
His entire world is on the telephone .
In today ’s Chicago Tribune , Steve Chapman points out the hypocrisy that has been exhibited by many on the left in response to the problems in the sub - prime mortgage industry and the increasing number of foreclosures on such loans :
In the old days , financial institutions that refused to lend to people with low incomes or imperfect credit were accused of victimizing the needy .
Today , financial institutions that make many loans to those same people are found guilty of the same crime .
Back in the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s , lenders who refused to lend to people with risky financial portfolios were accused of “ redlining ” — which was the supposed practice of refusing to lend to anyone within certain geographic areas , usually areas dominated by minorities — or of outright racism in their lending practices .
In reality , what lenders were usually doing was responding in a rational way to both the prospective borrowers in question , and the rules and regulations they were forced to deal with .
First of all , poor people , whether they ’re minorities or not , are not good credit risks .
They are n’t regularly employed , they do n’t have significant assets , and they usually have financial obligations that make the idea of being able to meet a mortgage payment often unrealistic .
People in this financial state may have outstanding debts , and these debts could be offset by releasing equity in their home .
Often , the equity release process allows homeowners to clear their existing debt , as well as giving them more financial freedom to choose how they spend their money .
Even the idea of paying for long - term care using a lifetime mortgage is one that is considered while we ’re on the topic of equity release .
Lending someone in such an economic state hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a home would be an incredibly stupid business decision unless the loan was structured in such a way as to protect the lender from the increased risk of default .
And that ’s where # 2 comes in …….
Second , because of banking and lending regulations in the 1960s and 70s , lenders were often restricted in the terms they could offer to borrowers , that ’s why mortgage rates and bridging loan rates varied .
Interest rates , typically the best way of counteracting credit risk , if not capped , were at least highly regulated , and banks were not permitted to offer anything much more than the typical 30 years fixed - rate conventional loan .
When the mortgage industry was deregulated , thanks in part to the people who were complaining about so - called “ redlining ” and discriminatory lending , lenders were able to non-traditional mortgages that permitted people who ’s application was refused or those who otherwise would have been locked out of the opportunity to purchase a home the ability to do so .
One can argue about whether or not people like this are making the right choice when they take on the responsibility of homeownership , but they ’re all adults , and , in the end , they ’re the ones who accept financial responsibility when they sign on the dotted line .
As Chapman points out , the mere fact that some of these subprime borrowers are defaulting on their obligations is not a condemnation of either the subprime market itself or the mortgage industry as a whole :
[ T ]he fact that some borrowers are behind on their payments is no condemnation of the system that furnished them credit .
They are in the subprime market , after all , because their credit history or income suggests they are bad risks , and it ’s no shock to find that some of them turn out to be exactly that .
Precisely , and more importantly , all the press about the increase in foreclosures among such borrowers ignores a broader reality :
[ T ]he overwhelming majority of subprime customers handle their obligations just fine .
At last count , fewer than 14 percent of them were delinquent , meaning that 86 percent were not .
Most people pay what they owe , and those who do n’t suffer the consequences .
Absent consequences , fewer people would repay , and mortgage providers would demand higher rates to lend to the remainder .
And that , ultimately , is what the free market , individual liberty , and being an adult in a free society are all about — accepting the consequences of your actions .
But it does n’t , unfortunately , end there .
Details below the fold :
Instead of letting the system work itself out , though , Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer insist that the state must act :
Schumer hopes to avert future foreclosures by insisting that homeowners demonstrate they have the income to afford not merely the initial payment , but the highest one they eventually will face .
He also plans to spare current borrowers by spending tax revenues for their benefit — as well as vigorously pressuring private financial institutions to “ direct resources ” to this worthy end .
The money would go to non -profit entities , so they can help debtors and creditors reach terms to prevent foreclosure .
Lenders already have good reason to work out bad loans , so they do n’t get left holding a property that , in today ’s market , may be worth less than the mortgage .
If it ’s true , as Schumer claims , that many borrowers could qualify for cheaper loans , they are free to go get them — and mortgage brokers have ample incentive to seek those customers out .
The senator ’s bizarre assumption is that absent federal intervention , these parties will blunder around without a clue .
In fact , most of them know what they ’re doing .
A recent study for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that thanks to improvements in the mortgage market during the last 35 years , “ Households are now more able to buy homes whose values are consistent with their long - term income prospects . ”
But , you see , Chuck Schumer thinks he knows better than you do what ’s in your best interest .
That is precisely what collectivism is all about .

For all the changes in Virginia and elsewhere , vestiges of the Southern strategy persist in some Republican quarters .
Mr. McCain , however , has been a victim , rather than a practitioner , of the old racial gamesmanship .
In his brutal 2000 South Carolina primary battle against Mr. Bush and Karl Rove , Mr. McCain ’s adopted Bangladeshi daughter was the target of a smear campaign .
He was also pilloried for accurately describing the Confederate flag as a “ symbol of racism and slavery . ”
( Sadly , he started to bend this straight talk the very next day . )
He is still paying for correctly describing Jerry Falwell , once an ardent segregationist , and Pat Robertson , a longtime defender of South African apartheid , as “ agents of intolerance . ”
And of course Mr. McCain remains public enemy No. 1 to some in his party for resisting nativist overkill on illegal immigration .
Though Mr. Bush ran for president on “ compassionate conservatism , ” he diversified only his party ’s window dressing : a 2000 Republican National Convention that had more African - Americans onstage than on the floor and the incessant photo - ops with black schoolchildren to sell No Child Left Behind .
There are no black Republicans in the House or the Senate to stand with the party ’s 2008 nominee .
Exit polls tell us that African - Americans voting in this year ’s G.O.P. primaries account for at most 2 to 4 percent of its electorate even in states with large black populations .
Mr. Obama ’s ascension hardly means that racism is kaput in America , or that the country is “ postracial ” or “ transcending race . ”
But it ’s impossible to deny that another barrier has been surmounted .
Bill Clinton ’s attempt to minimize Mr. Obama as a niche candidate in South Carolina by comparing him to Jesse Jackson looks more ludicrous by the day .
Even when winning five Southern states ( Virginia included ) on Super Tuesday in 1988 , Mr. Jackson received only 7 to 10 percent of white votes , depending on the exit poll .

Whatever the potency of his political skills and message , Mr. Obama is also riding a demographic wave .
The authors of the new book “ Millennial Makeover , ” Morley Winograd and Michael D. Hais , point out that the so - called millennial generation ( dating from 1982 ) is the largest in American history , boomers included , and that roughly 40 percent of it is African - American , Latino , Asian or racially mixed .
One in five millennials has an immigrant parent .
It ’s this generation that is fueling the excitement and some of the record turnout of the Democratic primary campaign , and not just for Mr. Obama .
Even by the low standards of his party , Mr. McCain has underperformed at reaching millennials in the thriving culture where they live .
His campaign ’s effort to create a MySpace - like Web site flopped .
His most - viewed appearances on YouTube are not viral videos extolling him or replaying his best speeches but are instead sendups of his most reckless foreign - policy improvisations  his threat to stay in Iraq for 100 years and his jokey warning ( sung to the tune of the Beach Boys ’ version of “ Barbara Ann ” ) that he will bomb Iran .
In the vast arena of the Internet he has been shrunk to Grumpy Old White Guy , the G.O.P. brand incarnate .
The theory of the McCain candidacy is that his “ maverick ” image will bring independents ( approaching a third of all voters ) to the rescue .
But a New York Times - CBS
News poll last month found that independents have even a lower opinion of Mr. Bush , the war , the surge and the economy than the total electorate and skew slightly younger .
Though the independents in this survey went 44 percent to 32 percent for Mr. Bush over John Kerry in 2004 , they now prefer a Democratic presidential candidate over a Republican by 44 percent to 27 percent .
The ground assault followed an air bombardment
Turkey said its ground forces had crossed the border to tackle rebels late on Thursday after an air and artillery bombardment .
PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the offensive is limited in scale and troops will return as soon as possible .
The UN secretary general and the US have urged Turkey to show restraint in the offensive .
A Turkish army statement said : " It has been understood from preliminary information that the terrorists have suffered heavy losses under long - range weapons fire and air strikes . "
It said that 24 Kurdish rebels had been killed in clashes , and at least another 20 by artillery fire and rounds from helicopter gunships .
A Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) spokesman , Ahmad Danas , earlier said two Turkish troops were killed and eight wounded in fighting .
Neither report can be independently confirmed .
PKK fighters are known to use northern Iraq as a base
Mr Erdogan had told Turks on television : " The target , purpose , size and parameters of this operation are limited .
" Our armed forces will come back in the shortest time possible as soon as they achieve their objectives , " he said , insisting that members of the PKK were the sole targets .
Correspondents say the aim is to isolate the organisation and prevent it using northern Iraq as a launch pad for attacks on Turkish soil .
Washington said it had been informed of the incursion in advance and that it had urged the Turks to limit their action to precise targeting of rebel Kurdish targets .
Reports from Turkey on the size of the assault force have varied from 3,000 to 10,000 soldiers .
But senior Iraqi Kurdish sources told the BBC the Turkish side had exaggerated the operation , which they believe to be " very , very limited " , and in a remote border area .
' Unusual timing '
Turkey 's military said the cross - border ground operation backed by the Air Force was launched at 1900 [ 1700 GMT on Thursday ] .
The protection of civilian life on both sides of the border remains the paramount concern

Ground attack confusion
Turkey has carried out at least one ground incursion , as well as frequent air and artillery strikes , against suspected PKK targets in Iraq since parliament authorised the army to act in October 2007 .
But this operation 's timing is unusual as the mountainous border area is still covered with heavy snow , the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Istanbul .
Nor have there been any major PKK attacks inside Turkey for some time , she adds .
More than 30,000 people have been killed since the PKK began fighting for a Kurdish homeland in south - eastern Turkey in 1984 .
The US , the EU and Turkey consider the PKK to be a " terrorist " organisation .
President 's call
Top Iraqi Kurdish and government officials are saying there has been no crossing at the Habur bridge , the only major land route into Iraq , the BBC's Jim Muir reports from Baghdad .

Party militants who control the area in question inside northern Iraq say they have not detected any Turkish forces near any of their own lines .
The office of Turkish President Abdullah Gul says the leader phoned his Iraqi counterpart , Jalal Talabani , about the operation on Thursday evening .
Mr Talabani's office confirmed a conversation had taken place during which Mr Gul invited him to visit Ankara officially , and also assured him that any Turkish operations were against the PKK , not against the Iraqi Kurds .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about the situation .
" The protection of civilian life on both sides of the border remains the paramount concern , " he said .
Programming less Wednesday , November 28 , 2007 by Dave Winer .
A programming lesson I keep relearning .
The design of the central data structure of an app determines the quality of the app , in every way .
Any extra thought that goes into this , will pay off in : 1 . Maintainability of the code .
2 . Size of the code ( you 'll write less code with a well thought - out central data structure ) .
3 . Simplicity of the user interface ( the structure inevitably shows through in the UI ) .
4 . Ability to respond to feature requests .
5 . Adapt to new hardware , OS changes , other apps .
6 . More " it just works " experiences .
This is why it 's sometimes the right thing to start over from scratch .
Programmers often want to start over because they look at the code and it looks complicated , and they think they can make it simpler if they start over .
They 're right , of course , it will be simpler when they start over , because it wo n't do nearly as much as the mature product does .
Once they finish building out the feature set , it may well be just as complicated .
It 's a judgement call .
I remember looking at the source of Unix kernel for the first time as a grad student in Wisconsin , and being amazed at the simplicity and obviousness of the code .
I could n't believe something so simple actually worked .
Your code at its kernel level must have this simplicity .
But at the edges , where you 're accomdating the minds of users , inevitably it gets a little messy .
The key thing to look for is how hard is it to add a completely new feature .
It should be easy to do that .
If it 's not , it 's likely because of a poorly organized ( and therefore not well - understood ) central data structure .
I 've rewritten apps many times , over many years , because when I wrote the first or second versions , I did n't understand the problem well enough , and the code had turned into a morass of patches and workarounds .
Right now I 'm recoding the internals of a special - purpose aggregator .
I 've written many of these , over the years , always quickly , trying to get something running fast , and then lived with data structures that resulted .
This time I 'm going slowly and carefully , with an installed base of one ( me ) and ripping up the pavement whenever I find even a slightly better way of doing something .
I have other users who are waiting , but that 's life .
5/7/97 : " When a programmer catches fire it 's because he or she groks the system , its underlying truth has been revealed . "

RHN : I did not write this , it 's a quote , of sorts : ' When men began to multiply on earth and daughters were born to them , the sons of heaven saw how beautiful the daughters of man were , and so they took for their wives as many of them as they chose .
Then the Lord said :
My spirit shall not remain in man forever , since he is but flesh .
His days shall comprise one hundred and twenty years .
At that time the Nephilim appeared on earth , after the sons of heaven had intercourse with the daughters of man , who bore them sons .
They were the heroes of old , the men of renown .
Genesis 6:1 '
GHD : That all sounds like an ' alien encounter ' episode .
RHN : Oh yeah , well , it 's pretty ' alien ' to me , too .
I am fairly certain , however , recognizing the basic , yet , common , profoundly beautiful nature of sexuality ( not at all ' alien ' to most of us ) , that ages ago , humankind , and , supposedly , scifi- wise , myriad other interest groups ( see above ) , did ‘ it ’ , mostly like we do , and for the same reasons .
So , she , woman , positions herself , and he , man -- almost semi-mindless , controlled 99 % by hormones , empties himself within seconds , then heads out to meet with his fellow ‘ seducers ’ around the pulled - Mastodon barbecue fire pit , where , all present , after adequate rounds of grog and serious bragging about their ‘ sexual prowess ‘ , fall quickly asleep -- snoring loudly .
And yet another Cro-Magnon is being genetically assembled in the womb , no doubt , evolving into ‘ modern man ’ .
Without the presence of men , the women , most importantly , took care of the family , and themselves .
Men , thus , became dependent on women .
We agree here , do we not ?
GHD : Now wait a minute , RH , societies are way more complex than that .
It 's not all sexually oriented .
Humans are above self gratification , but for females , and ultimately females in power today , the concept 's subtle .
RHN : Your point is ?
GHD : Let ’s go back , say , around 8,000 years , BCE , to Mesolithic Ireland ( now called … Ireland ) , to a small community of about 150 people living on the banks of a winding , icy cold , glacier melt river , which , obviously due to global warming , no longer exists .
This hardy pre-Celtic tribe called themselves the ‘ Uppadownafoots ’ ( roughly translated from rock inscriptions ) .
Today , this group is known to professional anthropologists , worldwide , as the ‘ River Dance People ’ , ( okay , okay , I ’m taking a few liberties here ) .
Anyhow , the women of this extraordinary tribe were extremely beautiful : jet black hair , wide - set , big blue eyes , long black eyelashes , pouty lips , ample ( in fact , more than ample ) breasts , long legs , fair , flawless skin -- like peaches and cream , and the in - bred desire to raise large families .
The men of the tribe , to a man , had flaming red hair and freckles all over , but otherwise , were really , really , well endowed .
They also had , ‘ attitude ’ .
When the men went out hunting ( in truth , scavenging the remains of animal kills and fighting other ‘ hunting ‘ males for the spoils ) , the women of the tribe were left to their own means .
This , is where the dildo comes in , ( no pun here ) .
RHN : Yeah , right .
Dildos .
GHD : No , really .
Check this out :
http://www.flickr.com/photos/alun/29080210/
RHN : And , so , women got the upper hand over the men , so to speak .
GHD : Men were really not needed for the sexual act anymore , only for their genetic material -- even back then women suspected there was a connection between becoming pregnant and sex and what their babies would look like .
Mostly , they trusted their own genetic contribution , instictively .
But this instinct was only a side issue , initially , self gratification was not the point , ultimately , coition , focused on appearance and personality traits , prevailed .
But they quickly perceived that they could achieve most of what they needed , without men .
As for the men ?
They had no clue that this ' absentee ' process was , in fact , the beginning of ' politics ' as we know it today .
In other words , bargaining for position based on what candidates for success ' look like ' , became common knowledge for both sexes .
RHN : I suppose men then started to ‘ buy ’ women ’s votes with promises of bigger and better dildos to get their ' genes ' in the pool ?
The male offers could make the difference in the group 's collective vote .
GH , you ’re full of it .
GHD : Well , I do n’t know about that scenario , back then , of course , that interpretation of ' group ' mentality ( that 's a modern thing ) , did not exist , but , you have to admit both men and women , even today , are whipped into a lather by the ‘ appearance ’ of a candidate ... we call it ‘ charisma ’ .
RHN : True , nobody really votes for ‘ values ’ or ‘ ideals ’ anymore , maybe , never did , votes seem based on superfical attributes , and mostly physical , at that .
But , I think your analogy between self - gratification and the political process is a stretch .
Well , time will tell .
As for me ?
I ’m voting for Kucinich .

[ digg - me ] Barack Obama sees the importance of this moment – as many of us now do – and he sees what our nation needs ; in response to this moment , he is trying to conjure the movement , the politics , and the consensus we need to tackle the long - term problems and strategic challenges we face as a nation .
Barack Obama is not the answer to these problems ; he cannot overcome the challenges .
But the movement he is trying to conjure is and can .
The paradox of Obama ’s campaign is that it requires belief – a leap of faith in the possibilities of the American people .
The phrase sounds like boilerplate bullshit .
It ’s not .
What Obama and his supporters are counting on are the choices of many individuals to take a leap of faith – a faith not borne out by recent history , but a faith in a better tomorrow – specifically a better tomorrow founded on the discernment of the American people .
This is what Obama means when he speaks of “ the audacity of hope ” , the “ fierce urgency of now ” , and “ the great need of the hour ” .
It is what skeptics call “ drinking the Kool - Aid “ .
What Obama is attempting to do is call on the “ better angels of our nature ” .
The paradox is that he will only succeed if America is transformed through a leap of faith .
And a majority of individuals will only take the leap of faith if they first believe he will succeed .
Which is why his campaign is a conjuring act .
It is also why his campaign – unlike Hillary ’s – will require American politics to rise to a different level .
The question now is : can he get Hillary to rise to that level ?
Can he convince Hillary to trust the American people and say what she means ?
Can he convince Hillary that the American people will see beyond the gutter politics dominating the campaign ?
Can he convince Democrats that he can win in a politics dominated by character assassination ?
The paradox is in the answer : the only way he can show Hillary or the Democratic party that he can get past the gutter politics is to win .
And the only way he can win , is to convince a majority that he not only deserves to succeed , but that he can succeed .
It ’s a neat magic trick .
I , for one , believe .

CMPH - C Minimal Perfect Hashing Library
Motivation
A perfect hash function maps a static set of n keys into a set of m integer numbers without collisions , where m is greater than or equal to n .
If m is equal to n , the function is called minimal .
Minimal perfect hash functions are widely used for memory efficient storage and fast retrieval of items from static sets , such as words in natural languages , reserved words in programming languages or interactive systems , universal resource locations ( URLs ) in Web search engines , or item sets in data mining techniques .
Therefore , there are applications for minimal perfect hash functions in information retrieval systems , database systems , language translation systems , electronic commerce systems , compilers , operating systems , among others .
The use of minimal perfect hash functions is , until now , restricted to scenarios where the set of keys being hashed is small , because of the limitations of current algorithms .
But in many cases , to deal with huge set of keys is crucial .
So , this project gives to the free software community an API that will work with sets in the order of billion of keys .
Probably , the most interesting application for minimal perfect hash functions is its use as an indexing structure for databases .
The most popular data structure used as an indexing structure in databases is the B+ tree .
In fact , the B + tree is very used for dynamic applications with frequent insertions and deletions of records .
However , for applications with sporadic modifications and a huge number of queries the B + tree is not the best option , because practical deployments of this structure are extremely complex , and perform poorly with very large sets of keys such as those required for the new frontiers database applications .
For example , in the information retrieval field , the work with huge collections is a daily task .
The simple assignment of ids to web pages of a collection can be a challenging task .
While traditional databases simply cannot handle more traffic once the working set of web page urls does not fit in main memory anymore , minimal perfect hash functions can easily scale to hundred of millions of entries , using stock hardware .
As there are lots of applications for minimal perfect hash functions , it is important to implement memory and time efficient algorithms for constructing such functions .
The lack of similar libraries in the free software world has been the main motivation to create the C Minimal Perfect Hashing Library ( gperf is a bit different , since it was conceived to create very fast perfect hash functions for small sets of keys and CMPH Library was conceived to create minimal perfect hash functions for very large sets of keys ) .
C Minimal Perfect Hashing Library is a portable LGPLed library to generate and to work with very efficient minimal perfect hash functions .
Description
The CMPH Library encapsulates the newest and more efficient algorithms in an easy - to - use , production - quality , fast API .
The library was designed to work with big entries that cannot fit in the main memory .
It has been used successfully for constructing minimal perfect hash functions for sets with more than 100 million of keys , and we intend to expand this number to the order of billion of keys .
Although there is a lack of similar libraries , we can point out some of the distinguishable features of the CMPH Library :
Fast .
Space - efficient with main memory usage carefully documented .
The best modern algorithms are available ( or at least scheduled for implementation :-) ) .
Works with in - disk key sets through of using the adapter pattern .
Serialization of hash functions .
Portable C code ( currently works on GNU / Linux and WIN32 and is reported to work in OpenBSD and Solaris ) .
Object oriented implementation .
Easily extensible .
Well encapsulated API aiming binary compatibility through releases .
Free Software .
Supported Algorithms
CHD Algorithm :
It is the fastest algorithm to build PHFs and MPHFs in linear time .
It generates the most compact PHFs and MPHFs we know of .
It can generate PHFs with a load factor up to 99 % .
It can be used to generate t - perfect hash functions .
A t - perfect hash function allows at most t collisions in a given bin .
It is a well - known fact that modern memories are organized as blocks which constitute transfer unit .
Example of such blocks are cache lines for internal memory or sectors for hard disks .
Thus , it can be very useful for devices that carry out I /O operations in blocks .
It is a two level scheme .
It uses a first level hash function to split the key set in buckets of average size determined by a parameter b in the range [ 1,32 ] .
In the second level it uses displacement values to resolve the collisions that have given rise to the buckets .
It can generate MPHFs that can be stored in approximately 2.07 bits per key .
For a load factor equal to the maximum one that is achieved by the BDZ algorithm ( 81 % ) , the resulting PHFs are stored in approximately 1.40 bits per key .
BDZ Algorithm :
It is very simple and efficient .
It outperforms all the ones below .
It constructs both PHFs and MPHFs in linear time .
The maximum load factor one can achieve for a PHF is 1/1.23 .
It is based on acyclic random 3 - graphs .
A 3 - graph is a generalization of a graph where each edge connects 3 vertices instead of only 2 .
The resulting MPHFs are not order preserving .
The resulting MPHFs can be stored in only ( 2 + x ) cn bits , where c should be larger than or equal to 1.23 and x is a constant larger than 0 ( actually , x = 1 / b and b is a parameter that should be larger than 2 ) .
For c = 1.23 and b = 8 , the resulting functions are stored in approximately 2.6 bits per key .
For its maximum load factor ( 81 % ) , the resulting PHFs are stored in approximately 1.95 bits per key .
BMZ Algorithm : Construct MPHFs in linear time .
It is based on cyclic random graphs .
This makes it faster than the CHM algorithm .
The resulting MPHFs are not order preserving .
The resulting MPHFs are more compact than the ones generated by the CHM algorithm and can be stored in 4cn bytes , where c is in the range [ 0.93,1.15 ] .
BRZ Algorithm : A very fast external memory based algorithm for constructing minimal perfect hash functions for sets in the order of billions of keys .
It works in linear time .
The resulting MPHFs are not order preserving .
The resulting MPHFs can be stored using less than 8.0 bits per key .
CHM Algorithm : Construct minimal MPHFs in linear time .
It is based on acyclic random graphs
The resulting MPHFs are order preserving .
The resulting MPHFs are stored in 4cn bytes , where c is greater than 2 .
FCH Algorithm : Construct minimal perfect hash functions that require less than 4 bits per key to be stored .
The resulting MPHFs are very compact and very efficient at evaluation time
The algorithm is only efficient for small sets .
It is used as internal algorithm in the BRZ algorithm to efficiently solve larger problems and even so to generate MPHFs that require approximately 4.1 bits per key to be stored .
For that , you just need to set the parameters - a to brz and -c to a value larger than or equal to 2.6 .

The cmph application
cmph is the name of both the library and the utility application that comes with this package .
You can use the cmph application for constructing minimal perfect hash functions from the command line .
The cmph utility comes with a number of flags , but it is very simple to create and to query minimal perfect hash functions :
$ # Using the chm algorithm ( default one ) for constructing a mphf for keys in file keys_file $ ./ cmph -g keys_file $ # Query id of keys in the file keys_query $ ./ cmph -m keys_file.mph keys_query
The additional options let you set most of the parameters you have available through the C API .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Comprehensive sex education that includes discussion of birth control may help reduce teen pregnancies , while abstinence - only programs seem to fall short , the results of a U.S. survey suggest .
File photo shows a two - year - old boy cooling himself off at a beach in Mumbai May 5 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Adeel Halim
Using data from a 2002 national survey , researchers found that among more than 1,700 unmarried , heterosexual teens between 15 and 19 years old , those who ’d received comprehensive sex ed in school were 60 percent less likely to have been pregnant or gotten someone pregnant than teens who ’d had no formal sex education .
Meanwhile , there was no clear benefit from abstinence - only education in preventing pregnancy or delaying sexual intercourse , the researchers report in the Journal of Adolescent Health .
The study found that teens who ’d been through abstinence - only programs were less likely than those who ’d received no sex ed to have been pregnant .
However , the difference was not significant in statistical terms , which means the finding could have been due to chance .
In addition , there was no evidence that comprehensive sex education increased the likelihood of teen sex or boosted rates of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) -- a concern of people who oppose teaching birth control in schools .
While comprehensive sex ed did not clearly reduce the STD risk , there was a modest , but statistically insignificant reduced risk of engaging in sex .
The abstinence - only approach had no effect on either factor , the researchers found .
“ The bottom line is that there is strong evidence that comprehensive sex education is more effective than abstinence - only education at preventing teen pregnancies , ” said lead researcher Pamela K. Kohler , of the Center for AIDS and STD at the University of Washington in Seattle .
She told Reuters Health the study “ also solidly debunks the myth that teens who learn about birth control are more likely to have sex . ”
Currently , the federal government champions the abstinence - only approach , giving around $ 170 million each year to states and community groups to teach kids to say no to sex .
This funding precludes mention of birth control and condoms , unless it is to emphasize their failure rates .
Critics have long pointed out that studies have failed to show that abstinence - only education delays sex or lowers rates of teen pregnancy .
The current study is the first to compare the effects of comprehensive sex ed and abstinence - only education in a national survey , Kohler noted .
Of the teens in the study , two thirds said they had received comprehensive sex education , while about one quarter had had abstinence - only courses .
Just under 10 percent said they ’d received no formal sex education .
There is now a body of evidence showing that the comprehensive approach may cut the odds of teen pregnancy , without increasing the likelihood of teens having sex , according to Kohler .
However , she added , “ there seems to be a gap between scientific evidence and policy change . ”

Does this really seem like it should be the book cover for The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch , Philip K. Dick 's novel about how the U.N. forcibly drafts people into colonizing planets , and then pacifies them with brain - interfaced Perky Pat dolls and weird drugs that give you eternal life ?
Check out the glowing blue eyes , the desert planet , the winged ships .
Could this be the cover for another famous book , that got reused by a cheapo publisher for the Dick novel ?

Why yes , it is indeed the cover for Dune , re-used by Manor books in the 1970s for its edition of The Three Stigmata .
This Stigmata book cover is from the collection of a lovely lady named Murilee Martin , who writes :
You can just imagine them at the publisher : " Yeah , we already paid for this art . . . what the hell , space , planets , whatever - use it ! "

The funny thing is that they were n't entirely wrong .
Stigmata takes place in a future where Earth has suffered such radical climate change that people can only go outside with giant air - conditioning units .

Lev Navrozov Archive
The decline of genius in the freest nation on Earth Lev Navrozov emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1972
He settled in New York City where he quickly learned that there was no market for his eloquent and powerful English language attacks on the Soviet Union .
To this day , he writes without fear or favor or the conventions of polite society .
He chaired the " Alternative to the New York Times Committee " in 1980 , challenged the editors of the New York Times to a debate ( which they declined ) and became a columnist for the New York City Tribune .
His columns are today read in both English and Russian .
The title of Oswald Spengler ’s book , which he intended to publish in 1913 , but published only after WW1 , has been translated into English as The Decline of the West .
The German title is Der Untergang des Abendlandes , and the word Untergang means in English “ sinking , ” “ self - destruction , ” “ ruin , ” “ fall ” of the Abendlandes , the West .
According to Spengler , a civilization , such as the post - Roman West , or its one country , such as Germany , is viable as long as genius comes forth and thrives therein .
Otherwise its overall mediocrity , and hence der Untergang , ensues .
Also In This Edition
The post -1913 Germany confirmed Spengler ’s prophecy of 1913 .
The German music of genius of the 18th and 19th centuries is still the music of genius in the West today .
But in the 20th century Germany no such great music came forth , which Spengler predicted in 1913 .
Der Untergang was coming .
First , the absurd war , WW1 , then the absurd Nazism , with its even more absurd WW2 , which Germany lost disastrously : Stalin occupied the Eastern Germany and even East Berlin .
The United States was much freer than the Kaiser Germany .
But genius still came forth in the Kaiser Germany .
Fortunately for the United States , Hitler launched anti-Semitism , and many Germans of genius , such as Einstein , emigrated to the United States .
That was one reason why in the USA — and not in Germany ! — the nuclear weapons were developed .
According to Spengler , genius in different fields thrives for the same reason : a profound elitist culture .
Elitist admirers of a genius enable him or her to live in sufficiency , create and become nationally or internationally known — without academic degrees or titles and without any publicity in mass culture .
I recalled Spengler when Leopold Tyrmand ( an immigrant from Poland ) , the editor of the magazine “ Chronicles of Culture , ” began sending me for reviewing those works of American literature that had received glowing reviews in “ The New York Times ” and other such guardians of great literature .
For example , John Updike ’s “ Rabbit Is Rich ” was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1981 , and an opening page listed his 26 (! ) books , showing , judging by their reviews , that as of 1981 he ( a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard ) was regarded as a living classic , a writer of genius , an American genius like ( I take three Russian names well known in the West ) Tolstoy , or Dostoyevsky or Chekhov ( none of whom had an academic degree ) , in combination with Edgar Poe or Baudelaire , since four of Updike ’s 26 books as of 1981 were books of poetry .
Baudelaire ’s summa cum laude ?
Very early in life , Baudelaire contracted a venereal disease from which he died .
Tyrmand and other such rebels also sent me for reviewing the best - sellers of other “ New York Times ” greats of the time : William Styron , Roth Zuckerman , Irwin Shaw , Jersy Kosinski , Philip Roth , etc. , but there was one difference .
Shortly before , Updike had made a trip to Russia , and when his guide - interpreter saw him off , she gave him what she called the best present from Russia : Mikhail Prishvin ’s “ Nature ’s Diary . ”
In Russia before 1917 , Prishvin was paid by the publishers at a par with Chekhov .
But what could he write about in Stalin ’s Rusia ?
About nature !
I translated Prishvin ’s book into English for the same reason Prishin had written it : nature was apolitical .
Updike brought the book to a New York publishing house , and they published it with his preface in which he praised my translation so that they paid me for it though there was no American - Soviet copyright agreement , and they did not have to pay me a cent .
The result ?
It may be supposed that in my review I praised Updike ’s book to the skies and thus he became a highly influential friend of mine .
Right ?
No !
I contended that all those literary celebrities whose books were sent to me by Tyrmand and listed above was not literature , but der Untergang .
Ironically , Irwin Shaw had written in the 1930s a good play , “ The Gentle People , ” when the Untergang had not been yet on .
Recall Hemingway , Faulkner , and Steinbeck .
But his book “ The Top of the Hill , ” published in 1979 and sent to me by Tyrmand for reviewing was der Untergang as much as the rest of the above pile .
Irwin Shaw phoned Tyrmand and screamed at him so that possibly this was the cause of death of the sick Leopold .
As for me , I would stop a hurt author ’s screaming at me by saying : “ Look , I resisted Stalin .
Do you think your screaming will scare me ? ” Der Untergang is full on .
Today in the United States there is not a single internationally or even nationally recognized thinker of genius .
Hence the human intelligence of a group of people is in inverse ratio to the number of people in the group .
In the US debates of 2008 presidential candidates , every candidate ( with exceptions like Duncan Hunter ) has been trying to appeal to the largest group of voters possible , that is , to the lowest level of intelligence .
Suffice it was for him to say publicly that China is a dictatorship , and the destiny of Duncan Hunter awaited him .
An official cause of the preemptive invasion of Iraq in 2003 was Hussein ’s alleged intention to create an honest - to - goodness atom bomb .
Now , China tested its first atom bomb in the early 1960s .
The testing of a nuclear bomb cannot be concealed .
Since then China has been testing all the nuclear weapons the dictatorship wanted .
To say nothing of post - nuclear super weapons .
But a successful presidential candidate McCain has said that it is necessary for the USA to wage “ the preemptive war ” in Iraq even if it takes yet another hundred years to win it .
And thus , in particular , to prevent the creation in Iraq of that honest - to - goodness atom bomb which Hussein allegedly intended to create ?
Is McCain ’s statement intended , in the absence in the United States of a single recognized thinker of genius , for the most numerous and hence most stupid American voters ?
In der Untergang , to use Spengler ’s word , the presidential elections become the stupidity Olympics , which make the annihilation of the free West by the unmentionable dictatorship of China the surest possible .

I recently became the reluctant owner of an Xbox 360 .
Limping along with my ancient Playstation 2-- I remember buying that thing on launch day way back in 2000 -- was no longer viable in light of my Rock Band addiction .
I 've been avoiding a new console purchase for as long as humanly possible , but the version of Rock Band offered on the PS2 is almost criminally crippled : it offers no downloadable content , no band customization , and a barely - there practice mode .
Although it was expensive , I 've been quite happy with my Xbox 360 upgrade overall .
I bought the Xbox 360 Pro value bundle , so I own the more modern , much quieter " Falcon " revision of the console along with two games .
The optional VGA adapter works perfectly with my projector setup at 1024 x 768 , and the Xbox Live internet experience is quite impressive and polished by now .
I do wish WiFi was included in the box , rather than being yet another $ 90 accessory I have to buy , but hawking overpriced accessories is just the way the console economy works -- you have to factor the required extra controllers , memory cards , charging stations , audio / video cables , and so on into the overall cost of ownership .
That 's the way it has always been for every console I 've ever owned , going all the way back to the Atari 2600 .
I 've purchased lots of downloadable content on the Xbox 360 at work , primarily new songs for Guitar Hero 2 , Guitar Hero 3 , and Rock Band .
I foolishly assumed all along that it would be no big deal to transfer that purchased content if I ever purchased an Xbox 360 for my home .
Big mistake .
I did n't realize how precarious my understanding was of Xbox 360 digital rights management was .
If , like me , you believe that in the future ..
most consumer devices will not be complex general purpose computers , but simpler fixed function devices
all content will be downloaded
the hardware will be tightly controlled
the delivery network will be private and commercially locked down
.. then for better or worse , products like the iPhone and Xbox 360 represent the future of computing .
Apple has already taken us quite far down this road , with tremendous commercial success .
Thus , it behooves us to understand precisely how the Xbox 360's mature , mainstream DRM model works .
The Xbox 360 may or may not be around in five years , but it is quite likely that some form of its DRM will be .
Let me break it down for you , so you do n't make the same naive mistake I did .
All content you purchase and download on the Xbox 360 is keyed to two specific things :
The hardware signature of the Xbox 360 you purchased the content on The Xbox Live profile that you purchased the content with
If you keep these two variables in mind , it 's easier to understand why things work the way they do .
Also , remember that any Xbox Live account is inherently " online " .
You 're logging in to a secure internet validation server every time you buy anything through your Xbox Live account .
It 's not quite as dire as it sounds , though .
Pick your dongle :
Xbox 360 hardware dongle
All purchased content is available for use by any account on that particular console you purchased it on .
You can share ownership of that content with anyone else who has physical access to your Xbox 360 , whether their account is local ( offline ) or Xbox Live ( online ) .
Note that if your console hardware signature ever changes -- say , if your console fails and you get a replacement -- you 're in trouble .
Xbox Live profile dongle
As long as you 're logged in to Xbox Live ( and thus by definition using an Xbox 360 connected to the internet ) , you can re-download purchased content and play it on any Xbox 360 .
How do you transport your profile ?
Through the removable hard drive or a memory card .
The hard drive works best , as you 'll save yourself some download time .
It is not possible to copy an Xbox Live profile ; every login writes a unique key to the profile , and all subsequent logins validate the expected key .
It is possible to perform an " account recovery " and move the account , but doing so automatically invalidates any other copies of the profile .
The cardinal rule is this : there can only ever be one valid physical copy of an Xbox Live profile at any given time .
Duplication is not allowed and rigorously enforced server - side .
The user penalty for hardware failure , however , is pretty severe ; it sounds like iTunes has a better hardware failure recovery model for its song DRM :
Microsoft has every right to protect their content , but to punish those who have had their consoles replaced due to failure is unacceptable .
I see threads appear daily on all the popular forums about this issue .
Typically it takes three to four weeks to get consoles replaced by Microsoft .
Little do these users know their [ newly repaired Xboxes will appear to be someone else 's Xbox to the DRM ] .
I do n't intend to provide a solution to the problem here .
I only want to bring attention to the issue .
I am sure an iTunes like approach could be implemented where users can " authorize " and " deauthorize " the console tied to their content .
I am just surprised that a software company like Microsoft cannot find a better solution than creating dummy accounts and asking users to call 1 - 800 - 4- MYXBOX time and time again in the hopes of getting their points refunded just so they can access their content offline .
Getting back to my specific problem : how do I transfer the licenses for all those songs I bought to my home Xbox ?
I experimented with Microsoft 's recommended solution of storing my Xbox Live profile on a memory card , but this meant I 'd be schlepping a memory card dongle back and forth from home to work in perpetuity .
That 's not practical or tenable .
In the end , I broke down and re-purchased 11,240 MS Points worth of Guitar Hero 2 , Guitar Hero 3 , and Rock Band songs through my personal Xbox Live profile on my home Xbox 360 .
If you 're keeping score at home that 's $ 140.50 in real money .
To buy the exact same content .
Again .
I have nobody to blame but myself , I suppose .
DRM sucks , but it 's unavoidable and arguably the future , in the form of ubiquitious consumer devices like the Xbox 360 and iPhone .
I 'm not asking you to like it .
Nobody likes it .
But at the very least understand how it works , because as I recently found out , DRM ignorance is expensive .
Biofuel capacity or production as a fraction of food supply for three different cases , along with sigmoidal ( ie logistic ) projections , 1998 - 2018 .
Plum curves show US corn ethanol processing capacity in service or under construction as a fraction of ethanol potential of entire US corn crop .
Brown curve shows actual production of US ethanol as a fraction of ethanol potential of US corn crop .
Violet curve shows global biofuel production as a fraction of estimate of biofuel potential of entire global human food supply .
Sigmoidal curves all have K = 1/3 ( infection doubling time of three years ) , and cross the 50 % line at 2008 , 2010.8 and 2014.2 respectively .
Sigmoids are scenarios , not forecasts .
Actual biofuel production growth will depend heavily on oil prices and policy responses to increasing food prices .
See text for sources and methods .
Many people are aware that food - based biofuel production has had an influence on food prices .
Many people also know that US ethanol production is growing rapidly and now using a noticeable fraction of the total corn supply .
However , I 'm going to argue that the situation in the near term is potentially more serious than is generally realized .
I will use a mixture of existing data , analysis of biofuel profitability , and simple modeling of biofuel production as an infection or diffusion process affecting the food supply , to demonstrate that there are reasonably plausible scenarios for biofuel production growth to cause mass starvation of the global poor , and that this could happen fairly quickly - quite possibly within five years , and certainly well within the life of the existing policy regimes .
It does n't have to be this way , but unless we start doing things differently soon , the risks are significant .
This piece is very long , and I apologize for that .
But I think it 's important - I 'm coming to the view that biofuel growth is by far the greatest near - term challenge arising from the plateauing of global oil supply that we have experienced over the last two years .
I 'm going to focus a lot on the US corn ethanol situation , because it's where the pattern has developed the furthest , and it's also where we have the best data .
Then I will broaden out to look at the global situation where I think the same pattern is developing , but a few years behind .
Let 's first look at global biofuel production just to orient ourselves .
This next graph shows ( in the lower panel ) the annual production numbers for ethanol and biodiesel from 1975 - 2006 .
Here , and throughout , I am going to use volumetric units of millions of ( 42 US gallon ) barrels / day , for the convenience of those of us used to thinking about oil supply .
However , be aware that the energy content of biofuels is lower than that of fossil fuels ( ethanol has only about two thirds of the energy content per gallon that gasoline has , for example ) .
Major components of global biofuel production , 1975 - 2006 ( bottom ) , with oil prices ( top ) .
Sources : Worldwatch Institute for biofuel production through 2005 , and various sources for 2006 ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) .
Oil prices are sourced from BP and are expressed in 2006 US dollars .
This graph shows the major facts .
Beginning from a very small base in the 1970s , by 2006 , biofuel production reached about 1 million barrels / day , a little over 1 % of the roughly 85 mbd of liquid fuel production in that year .
Ethanol is the largest flow by far , but biodiesel has started to become important .
Growth of both products in the last few years was explosive - that is a key fact at the core of the problem .
Furthermore , that growth is correlated with oil prices ( shown in the panel at top ) .
When oil prices are high , biofuel production increases rapidly , but when oil prices are low , biofuel production grows more slowly or stagnates .
This next graph shows US ethanol production ( almost all of which comes from corn ) as a fraction of the global biofuel supply :
US ethanol versus global biofuel production , 1980 - 2006 .
Sources : US figures are from Renewable Fuels Association .
Global figures from Worldwatch Institute for biofuel production through 2005 , and various sources for 2006 ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) .
As you can see , the US is a major biofuel producer , but both the US and non-US supplies have been growing rapidly .
The reason the US corn ethanol supply is growing so rapidly is a large number of new ethanol plants being built ( as well as expansions of existing ones ) .
Here are the numbers from the Renewable Fuels Association ( they have a very helpful list of every plant in production or under construction ) :
US ethanol plants in production or under construction at year end , 1998 - 2007 .
2007 numbers may be a month or two earlier than the end of the year .
Sources : Renewable Fuels Association .
As you can see , there has been a huge construction boom in the last few years .
Looking at 2006 , when we had 317kbd of ethanol produced in the US , that was coming from about 100 ethanol plants .
Thus the average ethanol plant only produces 3kbd of ethanol - miniscule by oil industry standards .
The blue lines indicate the average time for the population under construction to become the population in production at various points along the way .
That lag is only 1 - 2 years , very short by oil industry standards .
I think these are important points - these plants are very small , and they can be ramped up quickly at quite modest levels of investment .
Thus the biofuel supply can respond quickly to changes in profit incentives of ethanol plant operators .
There 's quite a lot of these plants now , and a lot more on the way .
For me , always the most important thing about some flow is to understand how it relates proportionately to other relevant measures in the situation .
And what I want to do now is relate US ethanol production capacity to the US corn crop .
That requires converting bushels of corn ( which the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service keeps track of ) , to ethanol .
The National Corn Growers Association has statistics for that , as follows :
Conversion efficiency of corn to ethanol over time .
Sources : National Corn Growers Association .
As you can see , the efficiency of ethanol plants is rising slowly , but appreciably .
Note that the NCGA has a theoretical estimate for 2014 .
I figure they are doing their jobs well , which is to be a trade group and aggressively promote the interests of their members , so in my extrapolations later , I used the linear extrapolation of the historical trend , rather than something based on their 2014 estimate ( the red dot ) .
Let 's just pause a moment and figure out how much food we are talking about when we discuss bushels of corn , or gallons of ethanol .
A bushel of corn is 56 lb ( or 25.4 kg ) of corn .
At about 8000 btu /lb we get 113120 kCal / bushel .
Given the average human diet globally contains 2800 kCal / day ( see figure below ) , 1 bushel represents 40 days worth of calories for a person ( if that person eat only corn ! ) .
Thus at current conversion efficiencies of about 2.8 gal / bushel , the corn in a gallon of ethanol represents a shade over two weeks worth of food ( again , all corn ) .
A 15 gallon fuel tank of ethanol is thus 7 months worth of corn calories for one person .
Of course , the American corn crop is mainly fed to animals , and after conversion to meat , eggs , or dairy at efficiencies in the range of 1/10 - 1/3 , the 15 gallon tank of ethanol is more like 1 - 2 months worth of food calories for a person .
Anyway , given the USDA corn production statistics , NCGA conversion efficiencies , and RFA data for the amount of ethanol production capacity on stream or under construction , I made the following graph :
Capacity of ethanol plants at year end , in production and under construction ( stacked on each other ) , together with total ethanol potential of the entire US corn crop ( not stacked ) .
Expressed in millions of barrels / day of ethanol .
Sources : USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service for corn production , National Corn Growers Association for conversion efficiencies , and Renewable Fuels Association for ethanol plant capacities .
This graph completely floored me from the moment I saw it , and immediately suggested the conclusion of this piece .
Let me try to develop the argument in stages though .
The first thing to note is that the corn crop generally increases over time .
This is due both to ongoing improvements in the yield / acre of modern industrial agriculture , but also increasing acreage planted to corn versus other crops ( especially in 2007 ) .
The corn crop also fluctuates , both due to acreage decisions and the vagaries of the weather .
More importantly , the amount of ethanol processing capacity is growing much faster than the corn crop .
Whereas in 2006 , the US produced 317 kbd out of a global total of 982kbd , once all the construction under way is complete , the US will be able to produce almost 1 mbd by itself .
Let 's focus in on the ratio of the ethanol processing capacity ( both finished and under construction ) to the corn crop .
That looks as follows :
Capacity of ethanol plants at year end , in production and under construction , as a percentage of total ethanol potential of the entire US corn crop in that year .
Sources : USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service for corn production , National Corn Growers Association for conversion efficiencies , and Renewable Fuels Association for ethanol plant capacities .
Starting out from 7 % in 1998 , the percentage of the corn crop covered by ethanol plant capacity in progress has now reached 37 - 38 % of the corn crop .
Furthermore , the general shape of this graph is very familiar to me , and strongly suggests thinking of the process of ethanol conversion of corn as an infection process ( or spread process , or diffusion of innovations process , to use various terms from different disciplines for more or less the same kind of thing ) .
There are a large variety of processes in both the natural and social sciences which have the general flavor of something spreading exponentially in a finite setting , and then slowing down as it saturates the finite available capacity .
An infection spreading through a vulnerable population of plants or animals is one classic example .
The diffusion of a new product or innovation through a marketplace of potential users of that product is another .
An invasive plant or animal species spreading through an ecosystem new to it is another case .
In the context of corn ethanol plants , the general idea is that if the existing plants are doing well and making money , there is a basis for building more of them .
Because there are plants already operating successfully , there are a set of skilled employees , managers , and contractors that know how to build and operate ethanol plants .
There are investors who are comfortable enough with the industry to risk their capital and are excited about the returns that building more plants might offer .
There are farmers who are aware of the possibility of selling corn to ethanol plants if there was one close enough ( or forming co-operatives to start their own ) .
And there are marketing and distribution channels that know how to get ethanol sold to final consumers .
The larger the industry is currently , the more new plants it could potentially implement next year .
( Its desire to do so will be heavily influenced by current profitability , but let 's return to that point in a few paragraphs ) .
So when things are going well , a young industry naturally grows exponentially - the amount of new capacity each year is proportional to the existing size of the industry .
Eventually , however , any industry tends to mature - something or other limits further growth .
In most cases , it 's lack of further customers interested in the product .
However , the corn-ethanol growth process faces another obvious limit , which is that it cannot convert more than 100 % of the corn crop to ethanol .
To try to help your intuition for growth / spread processes , I 'm including the following short video .
The spread of a computer worm or virus through a population of vulnerable computers is another example of exponential growth in a finite situation that I am particularly familiar with , having being involved heavily in research on it a few years back .
This example , made by collaborators of mine , shows the progress of the Code Red worm spreading across the globe in 2001 ( the size of the red balls depend on the number of infection cases in each city ) :
Animation of spread of Code Red computer worm on July 19th , 2001 .
Source : CAIDA .
Notice the way nothing much seems to happen for a while , then the infectious agent seems to infect lots of cities at large scale very quickly , then slows down as it runs out of vulnerable computers to infect .
That 's a classic property of exponential - spread - in - a - finite - system situations .
Looked at globally , computer worms infect cities , because that 's where the computers are .
By contrast , ethanol plants infect areas with a lot of corn :
Hopefully this suggests to you , as it does to me , the visual metaphor of little dots of red and pink mold growing in a Petri dish ( yet another case of exponential spread in a finite system ) .
The simplest model of exponential spread in a finite system is called the logistic equation , which gives a simple sigmoid ( S - shaped ) curve .
It 's called the SI model in epidemiology .
I 'm going to spare you the math , since it 's well discussed elsewhere .
At the time of the Code Red computer worm , I happened not to be familiar with that piece of math , and I rederived the equation in the middle of the night as the worm was spreading and I was trying to predict how long it was going to take before it saturated ( " saturated " meaning that it ran out of vulnerable computers to infect ) .
I ended up with a graph like this :
Rate of infection attempts at one location on the Internet due to Code Red worm on August 1st , 2001 .
Blue line is data , and red line is logistic model .
Sources : S. Staniford , V. Paxson , N. Weaver , How to 0wn the Internet in your Spare Time .
That particular infectious agent was a fairly simple - minded thing , and it followed the simple model very well indeed .
Note again the pattern of a long period of very little sign of growth , then the rapid rise in the graph when most of the infections occur , and then the tail off as the worm struggles to find the last few uninfected computers amongst a sea of already infected ones .
Once you are in the middle of that graph , things are going pretty fast .
It 's this that leads , in infectious disease control , to the huge emphasis on quarantining the early cases .
It 's so much easier to put a stop to an infection that has n't got a grip yet , versus one that has already gotten a good grip on a sizeable fraction of the vulnerable population and is now making new infection attempts in all directions at a huge rate .
Which is the perspective that I bring to 40 % , as the fraction of this years corn crop that could be processed by the ethanol capacity under construction .
40 % is well into the steep part of a sigmoid .
Let 's take a look again at that graph of the ratio of ethanol capacity ( producing and under construction together ) to the ethanol potential of 100 % of the corn crop .
This time I 'm going to add a sigmoid model extrapolated out into the future .
Capacity of ethanol plants at year end , in production and under construction , as a percentage of total ethanol potential of the entire US corn crop in that year , together with sigmoid model with K = 1/3 centered on 2008 .
Sources : USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service for corn production , National Corn Growers Association for conversion efficiencies , and Renewable Fuels Association for ethanol plant capacities .
Ok , the fit is a bit rough - clearly this ethanol plant spread process is a little more complex and noisy than the computer worm I just showed you .
Still and all , I think this graph should set off pretty serious alarm bells .
The fit does look like it 's capturing some of the important dynamics of this process , and it suggests that we 'll be using almost all of our corn crop for ethanol in 5 - 7 years .
That 's not very far off .
Should we believe it ?
Let 's investigate further .
One of the major departures from a straightforward logistic spread model is that the doubling time ( or equivalently the growth rate ) has varied significantly through the life of the process .
Let 's look more closely at the changes in the growth rate of this ratio , along with oil prices again .
Bottom panel : capacity of ethanol plants at year end , in production and under construction , as a percentage of total ethanol potential of the entire US corn crop in that year ( left scale ) , together with year on year change in that percentage ( right scale ) .
Top panel : oil prices ( annual average in $ 2006 ) .
Sources : USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service for corn production , National Corn Growers Association for conversion efficiencies , and Renewable Fuels Association for ethanol plant capacities .
Oil prices are sourced from BP .
I suggested earlier that the growth rate has a lot to do with oil prices , and I 've made that more explicit in the graph above with the green lines .
When oil prices spike up , a year or so later we have a new burst of ethanol capacity under construction ( which then comes on stream 1 - 2 years after that ) .
( Note that the drop in the growth rate of the ratio in 2007 is largely a result of a 20 % increase in the acreage put under corn from 2006 to 2007 , due to the high demand for corn - this increase came almost entirely from reducing the acreage under soybeans and cotton .
See p 18 here for details . )
You might argue that correlation is n't causation , and this suggests that it 's important for us to assess the profitability of ethanol plants more carefully - clearly growth of the industry will have a lot to do with perceived profitability of ethanol plants , but do they actually get more profitable when oil prices go up , or is the low energy return of the ethanol process such that they do n't actually do any better ?
Let 's start with the price of ethanol .
I can't find raw data in the public domain , but I did find this graph of rack prices in various locations over the last ten years .
( The rack price is basically the wholesale price at regional distribution terminals ) .
Rack ethanol prices at various points in the country May 1997 - May 2007 .
Source : California Energy Commission .
It helps to understand the relationship between ethanol prices and gasoline prices .
I took the graph above and made the contents of it the background to my own graph of gasoline prices ( on the same scale ) .
That gave this :
Retail and rack gasoline prices , national US averages , and ethanol prices at various points in the country ( background ) .
Source : California Energy Commission for background ethanol rack prices , and EIA for gas prices ( which are all grade , all formulation national averages )
The purple curve is a national average retail price ( average across all grades and formulations ) , while the blue curve is the rack gasoline price .
Clearly , ethanol and gasoline prices correlate fairly well ( as one might expect , given that the main end use of ethanol is to mix it into gasoline ) .
However , wholesale ethanol prices are often higher than wholesale gasoline prices .
This is possible for two reason .
Firstly , gasoline formulators are effectively required in many states to include ethanol in gasoline for oxygenation ( to reduce tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide ) .
In particular , the spike of ethanol prices above gasoline in mid 2006 is likely due to the phaseout of MTBE ( a groundwater polluting oxygenator that Congress decided not to shield oil companies from liability for ) .
Secondly , formulators receive a 51 c tax credit for each gallon of ethanol included in retail gasoline .
This allows them to pay more for ethanol than for gasoline and still make money .
The fact that ethanol prices tend to strongly correlate with gasoline prices is suggestive , but we also need to understand the costs of making ethanol .
I have relied here on the outstanding USDA 2002 Ethanol Cost - of - Production Survey .
( We are only looking now at operating costs , not capital costs , ie the costs of running the plant and making ethanol , not the costs of building the plant in the first place - which at that time averaged about $ 1.50 for each gallon / year of capacity ) .
Let me summarize the operating costs from that survey in the next graph .
Ethanol operating margin analysis for 2002 .
Source : USDA 2002 Ethanol Cost - of - Production Survey for cost data and and DDG and CO 2 revenue .
California Energy Commission for ethanol prices .
This is rather complex , but let me try to explain the highlights .
The left column represents a breakdown of the average costs per gallon of making ethanol .
The largest item by far ( blue ) is the cost of the corn .
The second largest item ( yellow ) is fuel to provide process heat in the plant .
Generally , this has been natural gas in the past , but there is currently an ongoing shift towards using cheaper coal instead .
The rest of the bars are all smaller - administrative expenses , enzymes , maintenance , etc , etc .
The right column of the graph represents the revenues for that gallon of ethanol .
The bottom ( pink item ) is the revenue from selling the distiller 's dry grain ( DDG ) residue left over from fermentation , which is used as animal feed .
The brown column takes us up to the lowest ethanol price obtaining at any time in 2002 ( from the earlier California Energy Commission graph ) .
The blue column takes us up to the highest price of the year .
2002 was not a great year to be making ethanol , with operating margins ranging from a scanty 25 % , to negative ( selling the ethanol for slightly less than the operating costs of producing it ) .
This was because oil and ethanol prices were relatively low in 2002 .
This explains why capacity growth in 2003 and 2004 fell back to essentially zero .
To extend this analysis further , we cannot rely on survey data , which has not appeared since the 2002 survey .
However , with just a little modeling , we can get close .
What I did was to take the 2002 cost structure and divide it into three components : the corn , the natural gas , and everything else .
The corn and natural gas components I extended to other years by using corn and natural gas price data .
The " everything else " component I assumed to be more slowly changing and I just inflated it at a fixed 2 1/2 % annual rate .
I think this will get us fairly close .
My cost structure model then looks like this :
Ethanol production operating cost model , Jan 1997 - October 2007 .
Source : USDA 2002 Ethanol Cost - of - Production Survey for 2002 cost data .
Corn prices came from USDA NASS , with conversion efficiencies from National Corn Growers Association .
Natural gas costs were indexed from 2002 using price data from EIA .
Other costs were computed from 2002 data by inflating at 2 1/2% / year .
As you can see , the main impact on the cost structure of ethanol producers is the price of the corn , which is quite volatile - varying by a factor of two over the course of the last ten years .
Natural gas prices have been less important as a factor , and I assume they will get moderated further over time by switching to the use of coal .
We can now take this cost model and look at the rack price of ethanol against it :
Ethanol prices at various points in the country , along with operating cost model ( with DDG revenue subtracted from costs ) .
Source : California Energy Commission for background ethanol rack prices , and USDA 2002 Ethanol Cost - of - Production Survey for 2002 cost data and DDG revenues .
Corn prices came from USDA NASS , with conversion efficiencies from National Corn Growers Association .
Natural gas costs were indexed from 2002 using price data from EIA .
Other costs were computed from 2002 data by inflating by 2 1/2% / year .
In my mind , this makes pretty clear what is going on .
Making food into biofuel was profitable in 2000 - 2001 , with oil / gas prices high , so the industry started to expand .
It stopped being very profitable in 2002 , so the industry stopped growing .
Then it became hugely profitable in 2004 - 2006 , and we had an enormous wave of expansion which is still coming to fruition .
However , that additional demand has backed up into corn prices , which have now increased .
Thus margins are falling , and we will probably see a drop in the growth rate of corn ethanol capacity for a while .
However , if oil prices go up much further , then there will be another big growth wave .
This one will be starting from around 35 % or 40 % of the corn crop and going up from there .
Clearly , that will drive another big round of corn price increases .
So at this point , corn prices are indexed to oil prices via biofuel arbitrage .
There are lags and imprecisions in that linkage , but corn prices cannot fall too far below gasoline prices , or biofuel production will become very profitable and the industry will quickly grow to the point that corn prices are bought back into relationship with oil prices .
Furthermore , the large displacement of soybean and cotton acreage to corn in 2007 suggests that this arbitrage is quickly extending to other agricultural commodities .
I by no means think that last process is complete , but it has started .
That 's bad news because demand for oil is extremely inelastic , and the world is struggling to grow the supply of it at present , so over the medium term it seems fairly plausible that there will be further rises in oil prices .
As we will see shortly , one can throw the entire global food supply at our fuel problems and still only make a modest impact on them .
Before we turn to the global situation , I want to make one last graph on corn ethanol .
Taking the same cost model I just showed you , I made a graph that shows the cost of making ethanol as a fraction of the ( retail ) cost of a gallon of gasoline .
In both cases , I subtracted the DDG revenue from the ethanol cost , but in one of the lines I also subtracted the 51c / gallon blending tax credit .
Ethanol production operating cost model as a fraction of retail gasoline cost , Jan 1997 - October 2007 .
Green curve is cost net of DDG revenue .
Plum curve is also net of 51c / gallon blending tax credit .

Corn prices came from USDA NASS , with conversion efficiencies from National Corn Growers Association .
Natural gas costs were indexed from 2002 using price data from EIA .
Other costs were computed from 2002 data by inflating by 2 1/2% / year .
As you can see making ethanol has been getting steadily more profitable , and the unsubsidized margins are recently getting comparable to the subsidized margins back in 1997 .
( The fit lines are exponential just to guide the eye to the trend - I have no great confidence in the extrapolation ) .
Let 's now turn to the global picture .
Last year , President Fidel Castro of Cuba alleged that plans by developed countries to power cars with biofuels risked starving up to 3 billion people .
While I am no fan at all of communist dictators , I fear he might have a point here .
I established above that biofuel profitability / growth creates an arbitrage between oil prices and corn prices .
We will see that the same trends are going on globally .
They are n't as advanced , but the basic mechanism are going to be the same , and the growth rates are comparable .
With fuel prices and food prices linked together , then the dinner tables of the poor are in a competition with the gas tanks of the global middle and wealthy classes .
And we already figured out that a 15 gallon tank of ethanol is 7 months worth of corn calories for one person .
Let 's start with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization 's statistics on energy in the global diet :
Global food energy intake per capita , 1960 - 2002 .
Source : FAO .
As you can see , at least until 2002 , the world has been getting better and better fed .
This comes despite the global increase in population over the period :
So far , so good .
Multiplying the food intake by the population , and noting that 1 kilocalorie is 4.184 kilojoules , we can derive the total energy content of the global human food supply :
Total energy in global food supply , 1960 - 2002 .
Source : US Census for population , and FAO for food intake .
Since the amount of land in use has been fairly constant , most of the increase in food energy over this period has come from steadily increasing crop yields .
A petajoule is 1015 joules , or about 278 million kilowatt - hours .
Ok , so is 70 odd petajoules a lot , or a little ?
To answer that question , I 'm going to compare the food supply to the global supply of liquid fuel via a notional conversion to biofuels .
For the cereal portion of the human diet , I can straightforwardly apply the exact same conversion factors as for corn above ( on the theory that a calorie of rice or wheat can be induced to make about the same amount of ethanol as a calorie of corn - a little more than 50 % of the calories in the corn make it into the ethanol ) .
The rest of the diet is more complicated - it ranges from things like lettuce and celery that are probably poor prospects for biofuel feedstock , through things like potatoes and cassava which would probably do about as well on a per- calorie basis as cereals , and then to meat , eggs and dairy products which have , in many cases , been converted at low efficiencies from cereals .
I 'm not in a position at the moment to make a precise accounting of this , so I just assume as a rough calculation that these things will cancel out , and I directly translate 1 non-cereal food calorie to 1 ethanol calorie .
That assumption could be off by a few tens of percent , but it would n't make any difference to the overall conclusion if it was .
Given all that , I can estimate the volume of ethanol equivalent of the global food supply , and compare it to the actual liquid fuels .
( Again , remember in these volumetric calculations that the ethanol barrels are really only 2/3 as good as the oil barrels ) .
Ethanol equivalent of human food supply compared to global liquid fuel supply , 1965 - 2002 .
Cereal and non-cereal portions of food supply are stacked , but fuel is not stacked on food .
Source : US Census for population , and FAO for food intake .
Liquid fuel numbers are from BP .
You can immediately see the problem here .
The biofuel potential of the entire human food supply is quite a small amount of energy compared to the global oil supply - somewhere between 15 - 20 % on a volumetric basis , so 10 - 15 % on an energy basis .
If you look at the rate of growth from the mid 1980s to 2000 ( and it would be similar to 2005 but the graph does n't go that far ) , we were requiring about an additional 10 mbd per decade .
So if we continue to try to drive more at historical rates of growth , eg as the middle class in China , India , and other developing countries continue to build roads and get cars , while our oil supply is stagnant , we can only get about a decade or thereabouts from converting our entire food supply to fuel .
However , just because it's not a very good idea globally , does n't mean it would n't be profitable to the folks doing the conversion .
Let 's look at the growth rates in global biofuel production , and compare them to oil prices .
Annual change in biofuel production , 1975 - 2006 ( bottom ) , with oil prices ( top ) .
Sources : Worldwatch Institute for biofuel production through 2005 , and various sources for 2006 ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) .
Oil prices are sourced from BP and are expressed in 2006 US dollars .
Again , we see a mirror of the US situation - when oil prices are high , biofuel production growth rates respond very dramatically in a short time .
When oil prices are low , biofuel production almost stops growing .
With the increasing oil prices of recent years , global biofuel production is up by a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 23.8 % / year from 2001 - 2006 .
This next graph shows extrapolations of global food supply ( expressed as mbd of ethanol ) , extrapolated on the highly linear trajectory it 's been following , with biofuel production continuing to grow at 23.8 % :
Biofuel production and energy equivalent of food supply , 1975 - 2018 .
Food is extrapolated linearly .
Biofuel production is extrapolated at the CAGR of growth from 2001 - 2006 ( 23.8 % / year ) .
Sources : as above .
It appears that the biofuel production will be catching up to the food supply very quickly .
Clearly , we are in the same exponential - growth - in - a - finite - box situation , again .
It 's just earlier in the process than with the US corn ethanol situation .
To make this comparison clearer , this next graph shows three things .
Firstly , I repeat the same ratio I showed you earlier ( US ethanol capacity in production and under construction divided by total corn crop ethanol potential ) .
I also repeat the same sigmoid I showed you before .
For the global case , we do n't have capacity under construction estimates , just actual biofuel production , which I show as a ratio to the biofuel potential of the global human food supply .
To help make the connection , I have put the US ethanol production on the same graph , as a ratio of the US corn crop ethanol potential again .
The latter is just a couple of years behind the capacity build - out curve .
With the idea that the dynamics are roughly the same here , I 've put the same sigmoid with the same basic doubling time as a projection for all three cases .
I just shifted the time offset - the global production curve is offset about 3 1/2 years behind the US corn ethanol production curve .
Biofuel capacity or production as a fraction of food supply for three different cases , along with sigmoidal ( ie logistic ) projections .
Plum curves show US corn ethanol processing capacity in service or under construction as a fraction of ethanol potential of entire US corn crop .
Brown curve shows actual production of US ethanol as a fraction of ethanol potential of US corn crop .
Violet curve shows global biofuel production as a fraction of estimate of biofuel potential of entire global human food supply .
Sigmoidal curves all have K = 1/3 ( infection doubling time of three years ) , and cross the 50 % line at 2008 , 2010.8 and 2014.2 respectively .
Sigmoids are scenarios , not forecasts .
Actual biofuel production growth will depend heavily on oil prices and policy responses to increasing food prices .
See text for sources and methods .
The underlying idea is that both oil and cereals are global commodity markets .
If it 's profitable to make food into fuel in the US , even without a subsidy , then it 's profitable elsewhere also - possibly more so given lower labor costs .
So the basic growth dynamics are the same .
The infection just has n't got as strong a grip on the whole globe yet , but it 's growing at similar rates .
I want to stress something here about the implications of the recent growth rates for the timing of the problem .
Something growing at 25 % / year growth doubles in three years .
So in both the last two graphs with different extrapolations , you see global biofuel production hitting half the global food supply within about six or seven years .
We 'll discuss in a moment what factors could stop that from happening , but first I just want to point out that these time constants render cellulosic ethanol irrelevant to the issue .
Cellulosic ethanol is what most most advocates of biofuels assume that the future will belong to .
It is ethanol made out of the cellulose in various kinds of agricultural waste , fast - growing grass or tree crops , etc .
In an abstract , in - principle , kind of way , it might indeed be possible some day to produce a lot of fuel this way , since current global consumption of about 8 gigatons of fossil fuel carbon is an order of magnitude smaller than the roughly 60 gigatons of carbon fixed by the world 's plants ( net primary productivity ) .
However , cellulosic ethanol is not commercially practical today , and there are reasons to wonder whether the transportation and material handling issues will be overcome soon .
At the moment , there is a single pilot plant operating in the world at a non-commercial scale , and otherwise the technology is in the lab .
Let 's grant , for the purpose of discussion , that all the problems will get solved and cellulosic ethanol will get off the ground commercially a couple of years from now .
It wo n't have any meaningful impact on what happens with food - based ethanol .
Remember the Code Red video , and the shape of the sigmoid curve ?
Remember how the infectious agent spends a long time quietly multiplying below the radar screen till it gets into the sharply rising part of the curve and seems to take everything over all at once ?
Cellulosic ethanol is at the very beginning of that long growth process .
Food based ethanol is on the steep part of the curve already .
Ok .
So this is all incredibly bad news .
What could stop this process from continuing ?
Well , I think there are three major possibilities worth mentioning .
Again , the key point is that the spread rate of biofuel plants is controlled by the profitability of those plants .
That in turn is mainly set by the difference between oil prices and food prices .
So , for possibility number one , if oil would go back down to $ 20 a barrel , that would certainly do the trick .
There are people who continue to believe that the current stagnation in oil supply will end soon , and allow prices to fall .
I 'm not going to spend a lot of time on that possibility : we 're still waiting , alas .
Those who would claim oil will go back to $ 20 , or $ 35 , or $ 40 , or $ 60 , are getting quieter and quieter as it passes the $ 100 mark .
My own view is that we are on the bumpy plateau of global oil supply .
I do not expect either large increases or large decreases in oil supply any time soon , though small increases and decreases are certainly possible .
If that is correct , I expect oil prices to increase in the medium term , though certainly they could go down in the short - term if the credit crunch affects the global economy enough .
The second way that biofuel conversion of food could sharply slow is when food prices get high enough .
This is certainly going to happen before 100 % of the food gets turned into fuel .
The question is , at what point ?
When we have a bidding war between the gas tanks of the roughly one billion middle class people on the planet , and the dinner tables of the poor , where does that reach equilibrium ?
This is not an easy question to answer .
The situation is unprecedented enough that it 's not easy to find good data with which to project the situation .
Significant uncertainty remains , but I have found a couple of ways of making rough estimates , both of which produce similar answers .
One thing that probably puts a lower bound on the number of persons affected by large food price increases is the number of people who were already chronically hungry .
The UN , as part of its Millenium Development Goals effort , has statistics on how many people currently cannot meet minimum dietary energy guidelines .
Throughout the 1990s , that hovered around 800 million people :
Global population unable to meet minimal dietary energy requirements according to UN Millenium Development Goals Indicators .
Presumably , it remained a similar number , at least until the major food commodity price increases of the last couple of years .
I would n't claim to be very knowledgeable on this , but I struggle to imagine how someone who was n't meeting minimum dietary guidelines already can continue to exist on half as much food , or a quarter as much food , as food prices come into equilibrium with the current oil price level , or perhaps double again should oil prices double again .
I would imagine that if you are hungry all the time you would already be devoting most of the skills and resources available to you to the problem of eating , and you would have limited ability to increase that in the face of large increases of food prices .
This still leaves the question of how many people who were able to meet their minimal dietary needs at historic food price levels might not be able to do so at doubled or quadrupled prices .
I managed to find some data for food consumption elasticities across a broad range of countries in a USDA study Cross - Country Analysis of Food Consumption Patterns by Regmi et al .
The most important graph is the price elasticities :
Food income elasticity by country income according to Regmi et al . .
The definition of the price elasticity is that it's the ratio of the percentage change in quantity consumed as a result of a certain percentage change in price .
For the low income countries in the sample , price elasticity is about - 0.7 .
Thus a 10 % increase in price would be expected to result in about a 7 % reduction in food intake .
It 's not clear that elasticities can safely be scaled up to very large changes in price , but if they could , a 100 % price increase would imply a 70 % decrease in food consumed , which would presumably create severe hardship or death by starvation for most people in poor countries ( unless their income derived from growing food , and they had secure title to their land ) .
The definition of low - income country in the Regmi et al study is that it has less than 15 % of US per-capita income .
Per capita income in the US in 2000 was just a hair less than $ 30,000 , so 15 % of that is $ 4500 .
According to this global income distribution data ,
Global income cumulative distribution according to Chotikapanich et al ..
for which I 've blown up the low end here ,
Low end of global income cumulative distribution according to Chotikapanich et al . .
Pink line represents the $ 4500 income level .
about two - thirds of the world 's population would fall into the low income category , and thus would apparently be extremely vulnerable to doubling or quadrupling of food prices .
For another approach to the same thing , we can look at income elasticities ( the ratio of the percentage change in food consumption produced by a certain percentage change in income ) :
Food income elasticity by country income according to Regmi et al . .
Here the value for the lower - income 2/3 of the world 's population is about +0.7 .
What this means is that a 10 % reduction in income has about the same effect on food consumption as a 10 % increase in food prices .
This suggests that we can use the global income distribution ( shown above ) to roughly estimate the impact of a doubling or quadrupling of food prices .
We noted earlier that according to the UN about 800 million people are unable to meet minimal dietary energy requirements .
That is 12 % of the world population .
On the income distribution ( one graph back ) , the 12 % mark corresponds to $ 1020 / year in income ( shown as the lowermost green dot ) .
By looking at the $ 2040 level ( 36 % of the global population - second green dot up ) , and the $ 4080 level ( 61 % of the global population - third green dot up ) , we can estimate that a doubling in food prices over 2000 levels might bring 30 % or so of the global population below the level of minimal dietary energy requirements , and a quadrupling of food prices over 2000 levels might bring 60 % or so of the global population into that situation .
These estimates should be regarded as quite uncertain .
Still , it seems hard to make a case that food price increases will cause a cessation of biofuel profitability before a significant fraction of the global population is in serious trouble .
The poor will not be able to bid up food prices by factors of two and four and keep eating .
In contrast , the quadrupling of global oil prices , and tripling of US gasoline prices , over the last five years has had very minimal impact on driving behavior by the middle classes .
The core problem is that gasoline price elasticity in the US is about - 0.05 , versus the - 0.7 price elasticity for food consumption by poor consumers .
This makes clear who is going to win the bidding war for food versus biofuels in a free market .
This brings me to the final thing that could stop runaway biofuel growth : public policy .
So far , there has been a fairly broad coalition in favor of increasing ethanol production .
This encompasses agricultural interests , environmentalists hoping to reduce carbon emissions and rely on a renewable fuel , and many citizens concerned about reliance on Middle Eastern oil supplies .
The Renewable Fuels Association reported recently that 3/4 of Americans believe we should increase our reliance on ethanol .
This kind of thinking has led to subsidies and mandates for biofuel production in the US , in Europe , and even in a number of developing countries .
My conclusion in this analysis is that this broad agreement is in fact mistaken .
It is based on a failure to appreciate the speed with which high oil prices and profitable biofuel operations can fuel a very rapid growth of the industry up to the point that it consumes a sizeable fraction of global food production .
This will have only modest benefits for global fuel supply , but will cause massive abrupt global hardship in poor countries .
Many unforseeable consequences may follow from that .
I suggest we reconsider our policy .
Mainstream Media ( TGW ) – Throughout the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign , a total of 3000 questions have been asked by major TV interviewers – and only 6 of them have been about global warming , according to research done by the League of Conservation Voters .

As of January 25 , 2975 questions had been asked , but only six mentioned the words " climate change " or " global warming .
"
To put that in perspective , three questions mentioned UFOs .

Something is very wrong with this picture : The United Nations ’ World Food Program has been hit so hard by skyrocketing grain prices that it may be forced to cut off some food aid to the world ’s poorest countries , while the United States is planning to turn record quantities of corn into automotive fuel .
The astonishing callousness of burning millions of bushels of grain in gas tanks even as global starvation worsens has apparently never occurred to Congress , the Bush administration or the remaining presidential candidates , all of whom are big boosters of ethanol .
The mania for passing ever - bigger mandates on biofuels reached such a pitch last year that the 2007 energy bill called for a whopping 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022 .
In order to ratchet up to that level , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently ordered that 9 billion gallons be blended with gasoline this year .
Most of that will be ethanol made from corn ; last year , the U.S. produced 5.8 billion gallons of the stuff .
Cereal grain import prices for the world ’s poorest countries are expected to rise 35 % for the second consecutive year in 2008 , according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization .
Droughts and floods have reduced grain stocks , and demand is rising in part because better living standards in developing countries are bringing a change in diet -- Indians and Chinese are eating more meat , so more grain is needed for livestock feed .
And ethanol is making a bad situation worse .
The U.S. is the world ’s top corn exporter , and about a quarter of last year ’s crop went to ethanol .
Food prices , meanwhile , have increased so much that the World Food Program says it will have to raise $ 500 million more just to carry out its scheduled operations .
It need n’t come down to a choice between conserving oil or feeding the poor .
The U.N. has developed a tool for assessing the impacts of biofuel production on food security , something Congress never bothered to study before passing its extravagant mandate .
Until the environmental and economic effects of biofuels have been thoroughly examined , the government should stop trying to squeeze more energy out of corn cobs .
Meanwhile , the U.S. is obliged to contribute more to world food aid in order to undo some of the damage it has wrought .
German fans followed their team passionately
Researchers studied the effects on German fans of watching their home team compete in the 2006 World Cup finals .
For men the risk of having a heart attack or another cardiovascular problem was three times higher on days when the German team was in action .
Munich 's Ludwig - Maximilians University found that female fans had an 82 % increased risk .
The researchers found that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match .
They looked at 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the German team played , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 .
Six of the seven games in which the German team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies .
The largest number occurred during a June 30 quarter - final in which Germany defeated Argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot - out .
The next game , Germany 's semi-final loss to Italy , produced almost as many heart attacks .
In contrast , Germany 's match against Portugal for third place , produced no spike in heart - related problems .
Germany defeated Portugal 3 - 1 .
Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine , the researcher said : " Apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress - induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot - out . "
The researchers said previous research had shown that stress could induce abnormal heart rhythms .
However , the impact of stress on severe heart problems is less clear .
They suggest that the release of stress hormones may directly influence the functioning of heart and immune system cells .
The researchers suggested that doctors might want to consider upping the dose for at - risk patients already on medication before a big game .
Alternatively , they say behaviour therapy to manage stress may be an option .
Cathy Ross , a cardiac nurse for the British Heart Foundation , said : " Intense changes in emotions , whatever the cause , can lead to chest pain or even a heart attack in people with diagnosed coronary heart disease - people whose arteries have narrowed over many years . "
But she added : " Factors such as sleep deprivation , poor diet , smoking and binge drinking , which are all associated with such big occasions , may also have acted as a cardiac event trigger - rather than just the excitement of the match . "
All of this sounds very promising ( and the company promotes it as the solution for both peak oil and global warming ) .
The question is - is it for real ?
One variation on the oil free car alternative is the " air car " , which is powered by compressed air .
The Age recently reported that IT MDI - Energy will be setting up a manufacturing plant in Melbourne , with cars expected to go on sale next year for less than $ 8000 and with running costs " 80 % lower than current comparable vehicles " ( 2 L per 100 km ) .
The primary impact of peak oil will be felt on our transportation systems .
As road transportation is the primary consumer of oil , this is where we will need to make the most changes in order to adapt to less available oil .
There are a number of ways of adapting - most , if not all , of which have been discussed at length in the peak oil blogosphere .
These include expanding mass transit systems , redesigning cities and towns to make them easier to walk or cycle around ( or combining both of these approaches in " transit oriented development " ) , making greater use of electric cycles ( or mopeds ) , using lightweight materials in vehicle construction , and - most commonly - switching to electric vehicles ( particularly , in the medium term , plug - in hybrids ) .
The company is claiming that the vehicles will be able to attain speeds of up to 110 kilometres an hour , and travel 150 kilometres on compressed air alone .
The Age article also mentions another ( hybrid ) mode of operation where the air is heated using a fuel source , such as ethanol or diesel , which would make it " possible to travel from Perth to Brisbane without refuelling " .
The car is refuelled by plugging it into the compressed air supply found at most service stations , and founder Louis Arnoux is claiming that the " engine technology could also be used to power homes " .
In other words , it is another way of implementing the vehicle to grid ( or V2G ) concept - which would be an interesting development as one of the main obstacles for this idea ( once plug - in hybrids appear in significant numbers ) is the impact of constantly discharging and recharging on battery lifespans ( though recent developments in this area are promising too ) .
Compressed air is similar to hydrogen - it is an energy storage medium , not an energy source .
Critics point out that using compressed air simply shifts energy production from oil based engines to power stations - usually coal fired ones , particularly in Australia .
On the other side of the ledger , compressed air is a safe , well - known storage mechanism ( already in large scale use to store power produced by wind farms , for example ) , and the energy generation infrastructure can ( and hopefully will ) be converted from fossil fuel based sources to cleaner alternatives over time .
The Air Car was created by MDI ( Moteur Developpement International ) which is headquartered in Luxemburg , while the prototype factory is in the south of France .
Originally conceived by former Formula 1 engineer Guy Negre back in 1991 , the official names for the “ Air Cars ” are the OneCAT , CityCAT and MiniCAT .
The OneCAT is expected to sit three or five people , with the MiniCAT and CityCAT models expected to follow .
MDI recently signed a deal with India ’s Tata Motors , to build the air - powered vehicles in India .
Zero Pollution Motors is looking to market the car in the US , and the Thai government has also invited Tata to manufacture the car in Thailand .
A Colombian company ( MDI Andina S.A ) is also looking to produce the cars and sell them in Latin America .
The company has been talking about producing cars since at least 2000 , so it is worthwhile remaining skeptical until cars start rolling off a production line somewhere .
WebHubbleTelescope had a brief look at the Air Car back in 2004 .
The Air Car has gotten the press excited on and off over the years .
The French design , which has received the most publicity , uses compressed air as an energy delivery mechanism .
It has the potential for providing a clean - burning solution , but as usual it takes net energy to compress the air .
No free lunch , unless wind or solar energy are involved to run the air compressors .
And even there , we require energy to make the windmills and solar conversion devices .
As a sanity check here are two ways to calculate the energy value of 1 liter of compressed air .
Remember that the gold standard is 1 GJ / 30 liters for gasoline ( or 33,000,000 joules / liter ) .
First , if you compress air completely you actually get liquid .
So we take the energy value of liquid nitrogen ( air consists of 70 % nitrogen by volume ) .
1 . Energy Density / Specific Energy of liquid nitrogen = 320 KJ/ l or 320,000 joules / liter
2. Heat of Vaporization of liquid nitrogen = 161 KJ/ l or 161,000 joules / liter ( to double - check the above value ) Looking at specific energy , this is at best 100 times less energy content than gasoline .
On the plus side , the transfer to mechanical power is better than for gasoline ( burning gas generates much wasted heat ) .
Granted that advantage , we still have to generate the compressed air by using energy , and to top it off , we also have much worse energy density ( i.e. energy per volume ) than gasoline .
You understand why consumers and corporations like gasoline ( little energy overhead to extract a free lunch ) .
James Fraser at The Energy Blog had a look at the air car earlier this year when the Indian deal was announced , coming to the following conclusion :
This technology competes with the electric car .
The claimed advantage of compressed air over electric storage is that it is less expensive , has a faster recharge time and pressure vessels have a longer lifetime compared to batteries .
Both technologies have hurdles to overcome , demonstrating that the air engine / compressed air system is as light , efficient and cheap as available electric motors / batteries .
The main issues to me are that the air engine has not been proven to be dependable and advanced batteries are still too expensive .
...
A discussion of the energy efficiencies of an air engine vehicle vs an electric vehicle would breakdown into the efficiency of the air compressor and air engine vs the efficiency of batteries and motors in the electric car , which I am sure the electric car would win .
However because of the potentially low initial cost , low maintence cost and low operating cost compared to a fossil fueled vehicle the " air car " could find a niche market if it could be marketed before low cost batteries are available .
The Australian operation , IT - MDI Energy Pty Ltd , is a merger betweeen MDI and IT Mondial , Louis Arnoux ’s IT business .
The IT MDI - Energy venture has other ambitions besides transport , with its ( in my mind , very confusing ) website detailing plans to provide home power generation ( shades of the key to Richard Smalley 's " distributed energy grid " idea ) and even broadband internet services in a “ green ” manner , using a combination of solar power and some sort of cogeneration technology .
While the air car idea seems to have quite a lot of history behind it , much of the rest smells a lot like vapourware based on the information on the website .
When the article in The Age came out , Kyle Schuant posted a few back - of - the - envelope calculations to The Bullroarer comparing the air car to a small petrol fuelled car in terms of fuel costs and carbon emissions , in which the air car fared pretty well .
If I remember my high school physics and chemistry right , the energy E required to compress air at 25C is , E = 110,000 x ln ( P1/P2 ) /m3/mol
There are about 45 mol air in 1m3 , so , E = 110,000 x ln ( P1/P2 ) /m3
This howstuffworks article tells us that an air car tank might have 300lt at 4,561psi , which is 29,999,087.707 - call it 30,000 kPa .
Atmospheric pressure is 101.3kPa. 300lt at 30,000kPa will be 90,000lt at atmospheric pressure , or 90m3 .
And so we get , E = 110,000 x ln ( 30,000 / 101.3 ) x 90
= 110,000 x 5.69 x 90
= 56,331,000J
which is 15.6 kWhr However , a company which supplies air compressors tells us that " Most systems typically waste 25 to 50 percent of the energy required to generate compressed air that actually provides useful work . "
Let 's be optimistic and assume that with lots of air cars zooming around , service stations will buy the most efficient ( expensive ) compressors .
So we get just a 25 % loss .
This brings us to 20.9 kWhr .
Let 's round it up to 21 kWhr to refill the tank .
Again , this is n't the air car referred to in the article , but it gives us an idea of the order of magnitude .
21 kWhr to travel 200 km .
A regular small city car gets about 10 km / lt .
Petrol costs about $ 1.30 / lt , and causes 2.32kg CO2e / lt .
So to go 200 km in a regular car would cost $ 26 and cause 46.4kg CO2e in emissions .
Electricity from coal cost $ 0.1355 / kWh and 1.21kg CO2e / kWh , so the 200 km journey would cost $ 2.85 and cause 34.9kg CO2e in emissions .
Electricity from wind costs $ 0.19 / kWh and causes 0.04kg CO2e / kWh .
So the 200 km journey would cost $ 3.99 and cause 0.84kg CO2e in emissions .
The average Australian car is driven 15,000 km annually .
That 'd be 75 refills , or 1,575kWh energy in all .
That 's not bad when the average household uses 6,000 kWhr annually .
Presumably service stations could do things better than we could at home , since they can buy the big heavy and efficient equipment ; if service stations supply so much compressed air , they 'll start charging more for it , more than the power costs .
Still , it seems that running it on compressed air will be significantly cheaper in money terms .
However , if the air is compressed by electricity got from coal , the greenhouse gas emissions will be comparable to simply burning petrol in the car .
Again , not perfect calculations , but the best we can do with the data we 've got , and they give us an order of magnitude idea of the numbers involved .
There is another Australian company pursuing air powered vehicles - the Di Pietro Rotary Air Engine , which does n't seem to have made much progress commercialising their technology , though it still appears in the press from time to time .
From a recent ABC interview :
BLANCH : As the world wakes up to global warming , petrol prices rise and greenhouse gases pollute the atmosphere , what better than a car that creates zero pollution by running on nothing but compressed air ?
The dream started seven years ago for a Melbourne engineer , Angelo di Pietro , to advance his innovative air - driven ' Engineair ' vehicle that he conceived , designed and developed and which could have an enormous impact on future motor - driven applications .
I asked Angelo to list after zero-pollution , what he considered to be important improvements that his engine delivered over other motors .
ANGELO DI PIETRO :
Our motor delivers high torque and low rpm , very high efficiency , low noise and it's a fraction of the weight of a traditional piston motor .
It is cheaper to produce and is better for the environment , as less material and energy is used in its production .
BLANCH : So your motor is based on a rotary piston .
How does your engine design differ from existing rotary engines ?
ANGELO DI PIETRO : Uses a single rotary piston and pivoting dividers which runs almost frictionless .
BLANCH : Your motor 's seven times smaller than the piston air motor currently in use , so what power does the engine develop with what about of compressed air ?
ANGELO DI PIETRO :
Although our motor is seven times smaller than the piston air motor , we develop much more power with considerable less energy , even by using our early motor 's testing results of 2002 , conducted by Monash University , we only use 770 litres per minute per horse power compared with the piston motor 's 896 litres .
We have advanced our technology today enormously and our scientific model predictions suggest that the new motor could be made at least four times more efficient for the same power output , compared to its commercial competitors .
BLANCH : So how do you get your motor to operate at a higher torque or with greater efficiency ?
ANGELO DI PIETRO :
By regulating air pressure and timing or manipulating the compressed air to perform the reverse function from when it was compressed .
BLANCH : You 've designed the engine to be suited to a variety of applications and these range from commercial vehicles and motor scooters , buses , boats , trains and cars .
Well that 's a whole spectrum of transport , is n't it ?
So how does your engine adapt to such a range of vehicles ?
ANGELO DI PIETRO :
The engine can be scaled up or down in its size and will be built from different materials specific to each use , for example , carbon fibre or other plastics or even stainless steel for marine use .
Our engine is best suited to a new generation of vehicles that can be built lighter as the need to build current heavier structures to support large heavy motors and all that goes with them is no longer required .
This reduction in the weight of the engine and the elimination of many other components translates into fuel efficiency and economic benefits .

Well , I guess that makes it official : Rep. Barbara Lee ( D - Calif. ) has introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives " expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the current economic slowdown in the United States is directly related to the enormous costs of the ongoing occupation of Iraq , consigning the United States to what can only be called the Iraq recession . "
If passed  and , during an election year in which the war is wildly unpopular , anything is possible  does this mean Congress will vote against funding the conflict ?
No way , José !
That ’s politics , folks , but what we ’re really talking about here is economics  i.e. , the bottom line .
Which brings up an interesting point : this war has gone on despite rising opposition , despite the marches , the demonstrations , the polls showing that nearly 70 percent of the American people want out .
Why , just the other day , Dick Cheney , confronted on ABCs Good Morning America with these poll numbers , replied with a disdainful : " So ? "
The Republican base loved it : what Churchillian verve !
The Democrats and the antiwar movement were outraged : what colossal nerve !
Politics keeps this war going , but economics may yet end it  perhaps sooner than anyone thinks .
A peace group associated with the left wing of the Democratic Party is currently running a campaign designed to convince the American public that the faltering economy is due to the fiscal folly of the Iraq war  but maybe they ’ll have good reason to consider changing their Iraq Recession theme to Iraq Depression .
As Bear Stearns goes under and everyone wonders which big investment bank is next , the cracks in the economy widen , and a new fear is instilled in the hearts of Americans  the sense of vertigo that comes with contemplating a real 1930s - style brother - can - you - spare - a - dime economic meltdown .
They told us the cost of the war was going to be  get this  $ 50 billion .
But as Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize - winning economist , and Linda Bilmes , a professor at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government , point out in The Three Trillion Dollar War , that ’s what we spend in a mere three months .
Remember back when Paul Wolfowitz assured us that Iraqi oil profits would pay the entire cost ?
Oh , those were the good old days !
Those days , however , have long since come to an end , and we are faced with the fiscal reality of a $ 3 trillion war  and that ’s a conservative estimate , as Stiglitz and Bilmes constantly remind us .
They deliberately low - balled cost estimates in making their calculations ; the real cost is probably a lot higher .
The numbers are hard to crunch for two main reasons :
(1) Secrecy .
Stiglitz relates how it was next to impossible to gain access to what should be public information : he had to employ the Freedom of Information Act to get a good deal of the numbers .
2 ) The U.S. government does n’t keep comprehensible or easily accessible accounts .
The Department of Defense flunked its government audit for the tenth year in a row , making it the only agency of the federal government that has so consistently failed to meet its accounting requirements ( Homeland Security is in the same shape , but they have n’t been around that long ) .
In addition , according to Stiglitz and Bilmes , the way the Bushies and their congressional enablers have appropriated funding for this war  a series of " off - budget , " " emergency " measures  has made oversight next to impossible .
We simply do n’t know where all that money is going  and I have no doubt that most of our wise solons would rather not find out .
The key to comprehending the true price of the Iraq war is not to be found in the budget numbers , because , as Stiglitz and Bilmes show , the upfront costs are only a fraction of the actual costs , in economic and human terms .
Based on past wars , we can estimate that 40 percent of our soldiers will suffer from disabilities , as in the first Gulf War .
This means providing lifelong healthcare for hundreds of thousands at a cost of $ 600 billion .
Again , that ’s a conservative estimate  the real number is likely to be much higher .
In addition , many of these disabled vets are eligible for , and will apply for , Social Security disability benefits , making impossible demands on an already bankrupt system .
Stiglitz and Bilmes estimate another $ 125 billion in hidden costs , but that ’s not the full price - tag : the economic effects of financing this war ripple outward , with the reverberations echoing down through the generations as the burden of a war funded entirely by debt  to the tune of some $ 800 billion  is passed down to our children and grandchildren .
Among the more immediately painful macro effects : higher oil prices .
During the course of this war , we ’ve gone from 25 to 100 dollars per barrel .
Cost : $ 300 billion .
Total macro-economic price - tag , including lost opportunity costs : in excess of $ 1 trillion .
Stiglitz and Bilmes suggest what they call " a new metric "  we ought to ask ourselves what portion of the funds flushed down the Iraq war toilet could have been spent solving this or that problem .
Or , in libertarian terms , what portion of these stolen tax dollars could have created jobs and goods in the private sector  and kept the wheels of the economy turning ?
In an NPR interview , Stiglitz not only points out that the money we ’re spending in Iraq is borrowed , he also names the real culprit : the Federal Reserve Bank , which temporarily masked the real costs of the war with a " happy days are here again " policy of easy money .
This created the housing bubble , which led to massive malinvestment , and we are beginning to feel the pain as the narcotic effects of Fed policy wear off .
America is living on borrowed money , and on borrowed time , as Stiglitz puts it , but " the day of reckoning " may be right around the corner .
Of course , some sectors are prospering on account of the war : Richard Perle is probably getting richer .
Halliburton stock is up .
The military - industrial complex is doing quite well , thank you , as is its intellectual Praetorian Guard among the Washington think - tanks .
If Antiwar.com had a tenth the contributions of , say , the American Enterprise Institute  the War Party ’s home base  we would n’t have to ask for another penny ever again .
The worst rise , and the rest are cast down : that ’s the sociological principle at work in the construction of militarism .
As storm clouds darken the economic horizon and we start sinking into the Iraq Depression , a subset of this principle will become apparent : do n’t expect to get bailed out if your name is n’t Bear Stearns .
Why are we asking this now ?
Two Russian mathematicians have suggested that the giant atom - smasher being built at the European centre for nuclear research , Cern , near Geneva , could create the conditions where it might be possible to travel backwards or forwards in time .
In essence , Irina Aref'eva and Igor Volovich believe that the Large Hadron Collider at Cern , which is due to be switched on this year for the first time , might create tiny " wormholes " in space which could allow some form of limited time travel .
If true , this would mark the first time in human history that a time machine has been created .
If travelling back in time is possible at all , it should in theory be only possible to travel back to the point when the first time machine was created and so this would mean that time travellers from the future would be able to visit us .
As an article in this week 's New Scientist suggests , this year – 2008 – could become " year zero " for time travel .

Is this really a serious proposition ?
The New Scientist article points out that there are many practical problems and theoretical paradoxes to time travel .
" Nevertheless , the slim possibility remains that we will see visitors from the future in the next year , " says the magazine says , rather provocatively .
It has to be said that few scientists accept the idea that the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) will create the conditions thought to be necessary for time travel .
The LHC is designed to probe the mysterious forces that exist at the level of sub-atomic particles , and as such will answer many important questions , such as the true nature of gravity .
It is not designed as a time machine .
In any case , if the LHC became a time machine by accident , the device would exist only at the sub-atomic level so we are not talking about a machine like Dr Who 's Tardis , which is able to carry people forwards and backwards from the future .
What do the experts say about the idea of time travel ?
The theoretical possibility is widely debated , but everyone agrees that the practical problems are so immense that it is , in all likelihood , never going to happen .
Brian Cox , a Cern researcher at the University of Manchester , points out that even if the laws of physics do not prohibit time travel , that does n't mean to say it 's going to happen , certainly in terms of travelling back in time .
" Saying that the laws of physics as we know them permit travel into the past is the same as saying that , to paraphrase Bertrand Russell , they permit a teapot to be in orbit around Venus , " Dr Cox says .
It 's possible , but not likely .
" Time travel into the future is absolutely possible , in fact time passes at a different rate in orbit than it does on the ground , and this has to be taken into consideration in order for satellite navigation systems to work .
But time travel into the past , although technically allowed in Einstein 's theory , will in the opinion of most physicists be ruled out when , and if , we develop a better understanding of the fundamental laws of physics – and that 's what the LHC is all about . "
Why is the possibility of time travel even considered ?
It comes down to the general theory of relativity devised by Albert Einstein in 1905 .
It is the best theory we have so far on the nature of space and time and it was Einstein who first formulated the mathematical equations that related both time and space in the form of an entity called " space - time " .
Those equations and the theory itself do not prohibit the idea of time travel , although there have been many attempts since Einstein to prove that travelling back in time is impossible .
Is there anything to support the theory ?

Lots of science fiction writers have had fun with time travel , going back to H.G. Wells , whose book The Time Machine was published in 1895 – 10 years before Einstein 's general theory of relativity .
Interestingly , it was another attempt at science fiction that revived the modern interest in time travel .
When Carl Sagan , the American astronomer , was writing his 1986 novel Contact , he wanted a semi-plausible way of getting round the problem of not being able to travel faster than the speed of light – which would break a fundamental rule of physics .
He needed his characters to travel through vast distances in space , so he asked his cosmologist friend Kip Thorne to come up with a possible way of doing it without travelling faster than light .
Thorne suggested that by manipulating black holes it might be possible to create a " wormhole " through space - time that would allow someone to travel from one part of the Universe to another in an instant .
He later realised that this could also in theory be used to travel back in time .
It was just a theory of course , and no one has come close to solving the practical problem of manipulating black holes and creating wormholes , but the idea seemed to be sound .
It spawned a lot of subsequent interest in wormholes and time travel , hence the latest idea by the two Russian mathematicians .
Apart from the practicalities , what 's to stop time travel ?
The biggest theoretical problem is known as the time - travel paradox .
If someone travels back in time and does something to prevent their own existence , then how can time travel be possible ?
The classic example is the time traveller who kills his grandfather before his own father is conceived .
Cosmologists , renowned for their imaginative ingenuity , have come up with a way round this paradox .
They have suggested that there is not one universe but many – so many that every possible outcome of any event actually takes place .
In this multiple universe , or " multiverse " model , a woman who goes back in time to murder her own granny can get way with it because in the universe next door the granny lives to have the daughter who becomes the murderer 's mother .
Where does this leave the time machine in Geneva ?
The science writer and physicist John Gribbin , who explains these things better than most , points to a saying in physics : anything that is not forbidden is compulsory .
" So they expect time machines to exist .
The snag is that the kind of accidental ' time tunnel ' that could be produced by the LHC in Geneva would be a tiny wormhole far smaller than an atom , so nothing would be able to go through it .
So there wo n't be any visitors from the future turning up in Geneva just yet .
I 'd take it all with a pinch of salt , but it certainly is n't completely crazy . "
So , not completely crazy , just a bit crazy .
So will we one day be able to travel into the future ?
Yes ...
* There is nothing in the laws of physics to prohibit it , and events in Geneva are pointing the way and could be a first step
* In physics , so the saying goes , if nothing is prohibited , it must happen at some point
* All we need to do is to work out how to manipulate black holes and wormholes , and away we go
No ...
* The practical problems with time travel are too immense to solve , and even if you could , who would want to ?
* You might travel back in time and kill one of your grandparents by accident .
Then where would you be ?
* If time travel is possible , why are we still waiting to welcome our first visitors from the future ?

Under Sharia law , adopted in the state seven years ago , homosexuality and same - sex marriages are outlawed and considered very serious offences .
The theatre where the elaborate wedding celebration was held on Sunday has been demolished by Kano city 's authorities .
Lesbianism is also illegal under Nigeria 's national penal code .
Nigeria 's parliament is considering tightening its laws on homosexuality .
Stoning
Kano's Hisbah board , which uses volunteers to enforce Islamic law , told the BBC that the women 's marriage was " unacceptable " .
The BBC's Bala Ibrahim in Kano says Aunty Maiduguri and her four " wives " are thought to have gone into hiding the day after they married .
All five women , who are believed to be film actresses in the local home - video industry , were born Muslims , otherwise they would not be covered by Sharia law .
Hisbah volunteers enforce Islamic law in Kano State
Islam says a man can take up to four wives if he is able to support them .
" As defenders of the Sharia laws , we shall not allow this unhealthy development to take root in the state , " the Hisbah 's deputy commander Ustaz Abubakar Rabo told Nigeria 's This Day newspaper .
Mr Rabo told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that if the women were found guilty of lesbianism they faced one of two punishments .
For a married woman the offence would be considered adultery for which the punishment is death by stoning .
A single woman would be caned .
Large turnout
Our correspondent says the theatre where the colourful wedding ceremony was held was flattened earlier this week .
Several reasons were given for the demolition , including the discovery that it was built on wrongly allocated land .
Eyewitnesses say there was a large turnout for the marriage and guests were given leaflets as a souvenir showing Aunty Maiduguri surrounded by her " brides " .
A Kano police spokesman told the BBC that his officers were not actively looking for the women , but would arrest them if need be .
The Hisbah group , which is run separately from the police , receives state government support .
Two years ago , a Sharia court sentenced a man to six months in prison and fined him $ 38 for living as a woman for seven years in Kano .
Eleven other states in mostly Muslim northern Nigeria have adopted Sharia law .
Siafu is a PC designed to give people with vision loss or impairment a more intuitive computer experience .
It lays flat like a tablet and allows the user to fully interact with it by way of touch .
The surface utilizes a conceptual material called magneclay or magnetized liquid .
This material has the ability to morph upward into any shape via a controlled electromagnetic field enabling the device to create a braille surface for reading and even pictures in 3D relief .
The technology behind Siafu – Magneclay , is an oil based synthetic agent that possesses limitless morphing capabilities .
It has a loose molecular structure but can be infinitely rearranged when acted upon by electrical and magnetic charges .
As long as the charges acting upon it remain stable , the magneclay will hold its structural rigidity , allowing it to be touched without deformation .
As for why the device is named after an aggressive African ant ?
Beats me .
Designer : Jonathan Lucas
Siafu ’s magneclay surface can generate full spread braill layouts , allowing users to enjoy reading digital content in a large book style relief .
The surface of Siafu can form a working 9 - button braille keyboard .
The braille output allows the user to conveniently review what they just typed .
Siaufu also possesses a built - in microphone , which provides an alternative to typing .
Its high performance voice recognition software allows the user to simply speak into the mic , and the words are instantly processed into on screen braille relief .
Siafu has the ability to display screen images such as web pages in a bas relief .
It can even go one step further and convert all the active text on the screen into translated braille relief .
Siafu utilizes 2 - D to 3 - D image conversion technology to process screen images .
It then generates a 3 - Dimensional digital wire frame which is then process through electrical currents into the magneclay .
The end result is a highly accurate 3 - Dimensional representation of the image .
Masanori Naruse jogs every day , collects miniature cars and feeds birds in his backyard , but he ’s proudest of the way his home and 2200 others in Japan get electricity and heat water – with power generated by a hydrogen fuel cell .
The technology – which draws energy from the chemical reaction when hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water .
Developers say fuel cells for homes produce one - third less of the pollution that causes global warming than conventional electricity generation does .
Their plain grey fuel cell is about the size of a suitcase and sits just outside their door next to a tank that turns out to be a water heater .
In the process of producing electricity , the fuel cell gives off enough warmth to heat water for the home .
The oxygen that the fuel cell uses comes from the air .
The hydrogen is extracted from natural gas by a device called a reformer in the same box as the fuel cell .
But a byproduct of that process is poisonous carbon monoxide .
So another machine in the grey box adds oxygen to the carbon monoxide to create carbon dioxide , which – though it contributes to global warming – is not poisonous .
The entire process produces less greenhouse gas per watt than traditional generation .
And no energy is wasted transporting the electricity where it ’s actually going to be used .
Nearly every home in Japanese cities is supplied with natural gas for cooking or heating , which could make it relatively easy to spread fuel cell technology there .
The potential for widespread use of fuel cells in bigger or more sparsely settled countries is less certain .
Many American homes do n’t have gas service , for example .
“ There are not any real show - stoppers for this technology being used in the US , ” said electrical engineering professor Roger Dougal at the University of South Carolina at Columbia .
Dougal said fuel cells are no more hazardous than any stove or water heater .
Their major drawback is cost .
“ Ultimately , I expect that some fraction of homes will use this technology , but it will be a very long time before a sizable fraction does , ” he said in an email .
Naruse is paying $ 9 500 ( about R74 000 ) for a 10 - year lease on a test fuel cell for his home south - west of Tokyo from Matsushita , which sells Panasonic brand products , plans to offer fuel cells commercially in 2009 .
Other Japanese companies working on fuel cells for homes include Toyota Motor , which is developing fuel - cell vehicles , and electronics maker Toshiba .
Automaker Honda Motor is working with Plug Power , a fuel cell company in the US , to test a home fuel cell generator that also provides hydrogen as fuel for fuel cell vehicles .
Honda hopes domestic use of fuel cell generators will help make fuel cell vehicles become more widespread because owners can refuel at home .
It plans to start marketing the FCX Clarity fuel cell vehicle this year in California ; it will lease for about $ 600 a month .
Fuel cells are expensive in part because they do n’t last very long .
The latest model from Matsushita , for example , lasts about three years .
But the technology is improving .
Matsushita says the savings from using fuel cell - generated power will vary by household and climate , but it promises a cost drop of about $ 50 a month .
Naruse ’s family – with three TV sets , a dishwasher , clothes washer , dryer , personal computer and air conditioner – saves about $ 95 a month .
At the same time , conventionally generated electricity remains available to them , should the power generated by their fuel cell run low .
The Japanese government is so bullish on the technology it has earmarked $ 309 - million a year for fuel cell development and plans for 10 million homes – about one - fourth of Japanese households – to be powered by fuel cells by 2020 .

After 17 rounds , the 700MHz spectrum auction has finally hit its one of its most closely watched targets : bidding on Block C has surpassed the Federal Communications Commission 's mandated $ 4.638 billion reserve , meaning that the FCC 's mandated open access rules will come into play .
Bids on the block of spectrum totaled $ 4.744 billion after Round 17 .
Yesterday , the auction passed another significant milestone , crossing the FCC's $ 10.3 billion threshold for the auction as a whole .
As of the end of Round 17 , total bidding stood at $ 12.789 billion .
With the threshold crossed , the auction is all but certain to come to a successful conclusion , meaning that we wo n't have a replay at some point in the future .
The identity of the high bidder on Block C ( or any other block , for that matter ) remains unknown , as the FCC 's auction rules require bidders to remain anonymous .
Speculation about who is behind the action on Block C has focused primarily on AT&T , Google , and Verizon , with many analysts believing that Google will drop out of the bidding once the reserve price has been reached .
Block D , which is a nationwide license that will be used for both a public safety and commercial network , has gotten no interest from bidders since an opening bid of $ 472 million in the first round .
The reserve on that block is $ 1.33 billion .
If it 's not met , the FCC would have the option of accepting the highest bid or holding another auction , perhaps with fewer restrictions on the spectrum .
The rest of the licenses are regional , and bidding on most of those appears to be brisk , with regional licenses going for as much as $ 429.4 million .
There 's no set end date for the conclusion of the auction ; the FCC will stop it once bidding grinds to a halt .
If you want to follow along at home , the FCC 's results page is updated within 10 minutes of a round ending .
Monster Pentagon contractors Boeing and SAIC jointly announced today that two of their latest offerings for the future robot armies of America have entered military testing early .
The machines in question are a relatively dull lightweight groundcrawler job and a frankly splendid ducted - fan flying Dalek .
The two mechanoid warriors are known as the Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle ( SUGV ) and the Class I ( Block 0 ) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle , aka Micro Air Vehicle or MAV .
According to a joint Boeing / SAIC release , 25 SUGVs and 11 MAVs will be shipped to US Army test facilities starting this month .
How the Daleks started out .
Maybe .
" The decision to accelerate , driven in part by feedback from soldiers in theatre ... confirms that we are on the right track to deliver a crucial capability that is needed and desired by our soldiers currently serving in combat operations , " said Boeing wardroid veep Dennis Muilenburg .
Both machines are part of the Army 's Future Combat Systems ( FCS ) plan , under which an amazing panoply of vehicles , robots , intelligent minefields etc will be interlinked across a common network - the net also extending to each individual soldier via helmet displays , rifle cameras and so on .
Originally FCS included something not unlike a robot tank , but sadly ( for fans of Keith Laumer 's Bolo novels , at any rate ) this has been cut - along with some of the other robots - owing to budget pressures .
The SUGV and MAV survive , however , and now appear likely to reach the battlefield ahead of schedule .
There are already large numbers of SUGV - type crawler robots fighting alongside US forces , but the MAV will be something new .
Able to fly at 60 mph , climb to 10,500 feet and yet hover about in restricted urban spaces , it avoids the usual robot problems of slowness and inability to cope with obstacles .
Both bomb - disposal teams and patrolling infantry might very well find it useful , if it can really do all it says .
The MAV is being handled by Boeing as FCS droid - army lead , but in fact was largely developed by Honeywell .
The designers describe it as " a scalable family of systems " , suggesting that the current 16lb , wastebasket - sized job might be only a forerunner .
Thus the prospect exists of bigger dustbin - scale versions , potentially armed with lightning beams or laser rayguns currently receiving Pentagon development funding .
A sink - plunger attachment would be a trivial , almost inevitable addition at that point .
If that is n't a proto - Dalek , we do n't know what is *. ®
Bootnote
* We do know that Daleks are n't robots , being controlled from within by repulsive alien mutants .
We submit , though , < grenade > that there was probably a stage of history on Skaro where the aliens had n't yet mutated to the point of needing to get inside their Daleks , and still handled them by remote control - as the Americans do today .</ grenade >
Afghanistan 's President , Hamid Karzai , has been inundated with appeals to save the life of Sayed Pervez Kambaksh , the student journalist sentenced to death after being accused of downloading an internet report on women 's rights .
While international protests mounted over the affair , with the British Government saying it had already raised its concerns , hundreds of people marched through the capital , Kabul , demanding Mr Kambaksh 's release .
A petition launched yesterday by The Independent to secure justice for Mr Kambaksh had attracted more than 13,500 signatories by last night , and a number of support groups have been set up on the social networking site Facebook with more than 400 joining one group alone .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Kambaksh , 23 , was arrested , tried and convicted by a religious court , in what his friends and family say was a secret session without being allowed legal representation .
The United Nations , human rights groups , journalists ' organisations and diplomats urged Mr Karzai 's government to quash the death sentence and release him .
Instead , on Wednesday , the Afghan senate passed a motion confirming the death sentence .
The MP who proposed the ruling condemning Mr Kambaksh was Sibghatullah Mojadedi , a key ally of Mr Karzai .
In London David Miliband , the Foreign Secretary , told The Independent that Britain had raised Mr Kambaksh 's case as a member of the European Union and with the United Nations , as well as strongly supporting a call by the UN special representative to Afghanistan for a review of the verdict .
He said : " We are opposed to the death penalty in all cases and believe that freedom of expression is one of the cornerstones of a democratic society . "
The British Government is funding training for journalists in the country as part of an effort to create a civic society .
Nick Clegg , the leader of the Liberal Democrats , said : " It is clear that this case has nothing to do with blasphemy and everything to do with prejudice .
Afghanistan is sliding back towards the bad old days where women were subjugated and journalists persecuted .
We have invested far too much in Afghanistan to allow freedom and democracy to falter .
If this sentence is carried through , it will raise major questions about the country 's future . "
William Hague , the shadow Foreign Secretary , said : " We call upon President Karzai and his government to urgently reconsider the decision to sentence Pervez Kambaksh to death .
Mr Kambaksh was tried without being allowed any legal representation .
Moving towards the rule of law is a vital part of peace - building in Afghanistan .
The people of Afghanistan cannot feel secure unless protected by a body of law and a functioning judicial system . "

The former foreign office minister Denis MacShane , who has raised the matter of Mr Kambaksh's " persecution " with the Foreign Office , said : " The challenge to freedom of expression from fundamentalist Islam is now a major world problem .
The maximum pressure must be put on President Karzai , ministers and MPs in Afghanistan stressing that if they want to be partners in democracy then this young man must be set free . "
The Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael , chairman of the all - party group for the abolition of the death penalty , has put down an early day motion urging the British Government to intercede to save Mr Kambaksh 's life .
In a Commons plea to Harriet Harman , the Leader of the House , he said : " I draw the Leader of the House 's attention particularly to the front page of The Independent which highlights the case of Sayed Pervez Kambaksh ...
Surely , given our current involvement in that country ... we will not just sit back and allow this monstrous act to take place without doing anything about it ? "
Ms Harman replied : " The Government are determined to stand up for human rights , including freedom of speech , in all countries , and are of course concerned about the matter . "
Among the representations received by Mr Karzai was one from the International Federation of Journalists , based in Brussels , which stated : " Upholding freedom of expression is essential for your country 's democratic progress .
This death sentence indicates a disregard by your government for its own constitution . "
The Committee to Protect Journalists , based in New York , pointed out that the trial was held in secret and expressed concern that any appeal process would be biased .
The organisation said in its letter : " He should be allowed to resume his studies without delay or punishment . "
The row over Mr Kambaksh 's death sentence came during another day of violence in Afghanistan .
Abu Laith al - Libi , reputed to be the senior al - Qa'ida commander in the country , was said to have been killed .
US and British officials said they were receiving " normally reliable reports " that al - Libi was killed during a rocket attack in northern Waziristan on the Afghan - Pakistan border earlier in the week .
A website used by Islamist groups , ekhlaas.org , said last night evening that al - Libi had " fallen a martyr " .
Earlier yesterday , the deputy governor of Helmand province , Haji Pir Mohammed , was killed in a suicide bomb attack on a mosque .
This followed a blast in Kabul 's Taimani district in which a dozen people were said to be injured .
Mr Pir Mohammed was regarded as an ally of the British at a time when UK policy in the country is coming under strong criticism from President Karzai and senior Afghan officials .
Mr Miliband said the death was " a horrific reminder of the difficulties we face in Afghanistan " .
He added : " The sheer scale of the task is enormous and we will only succeed if we have better co-ordination between the international community and the Afghan government . "
How you can save Pervez
The Independent campaign to save Sayed Pervez Kambaksh has already attracted 13,500 signatures .
But the more pressure that can be brought to bear on President Karzai , the more likely it is that his sentence will be revoked .
So add your voice to the campaign by urging the Foreign Office to put all possible pressure on the Afghan government to spare his life .

A new chip uses so little power , it could enable sensors , communication devices and other gadgets that run on body heat and movement alone .
The chip uses 70 percent less voltage than current chip technologies .
It could lead to an order - of - magnitude increase in energy efficiency for electronics in the next five years , said the MIT researchers who developed the new technology .
" It will extend the battery lifetime of portable devices in areas like medical electronics , " said Anantha Chandrakasan , a professor of electrical engineering at MIT .
" When you look at the digital processor , the fact is that we may be able to reduce the energy needed by 10 times . "
Better circuit design and batteries have already led to smaller , more - mobile electronics .
But changing a battery is not an option for many medical and military devices .
Military researchers at Darpa , which helped fund the MIT work , are keen to increase the lifespan of these technologies or even eliminate the need to charge them .
Military strategists imagine these types of low - power chips could be used in the battlefield , particularly in body and environmental sensors .
Among more mundane uses , Nokia is looking at low - voltage chips for use in cellphones and computers .
Intel also has a low - power - chip research unit .
Designing a low - voltage chip is complicated , because transistors – the bases of chips – use voltage changes to switch on and off .
Increase the voltage to the system , and the transistor eventually hits its threshold and switches on .
Decrease it , and the transistor switches off .
That ability is what allows it to store the binary information – the 1's and 0's – that forms the basis of computing .
But at low voltages , variations introduced during transistor production can cause errors .
" When you scale voltages , the first thing to break is memory on a chip , " Chandrakasan said .
" You have to redesign the memory and logic so you can handle the variation . "
Working with scalable energy voltages , he said , required a whole suite of design techniques , including a fundamental change in the memory cell from six transistors to eight .
The researchers think medical devices like pacemakers and various military applications could use the new chip within five years .
Decreasing power consumption is the key to unleashing medical technologies on the battlefield , said Barry Perlman , associate director for technology at the Army 's Communications Electronics Research and Development Center at Fort Monmouth , New Jersey .
" Sensors that are involved in monitoring the soldier 's health , managing blood flow or heart rate , or measuring the thermal profile of the soldier – there 's no question all of this is very , very important , " Perlman said .
" But it 's not realistic unless the power requirement associated with them is really low . "
The power requirements for sensors attached to the body could be reduced to near zero , Chandrakasan said .
The body 's heat and movement could generate the microwattage necessary to power the devices .
MIT graduate student Joyce Kwong will discuss the new chip at the International Solid - State Circuits Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday .
The researchers designed their proof - of - concept chip with researchers at Texas Instruments , using a standard semiconductor - fabrication process .
The major trade - off for the lower power usage is raw speed , said Connie Brown , spokeswoman for Intel 's mobile platforms .
Intel 's newest mobile platform , SilverThorne , cuts power consumption to less than 2 watts .
That 's less than one - fifth of any previous offerings and one - eighth the power draw of ballyhooed products like the MacBook Air 's new chip , which draws 17 watts .
The MIT team 's chip uses between 1 and 100 microwatts .
While a couple of watts in energy savings might not be a big deal to consumers with access to the power grid , Perlman said soldiers often have to carry all the power for their battlefield communications devices – which are about 10 times bigger than typical cellphones .
" You can start to imagine how power becomes a very , very important parameter to the soldier , " he said .

Extreme Investing for the Adventurous In All of Us
You ’ve probably heard of extreme sports , sports “ perceived as having a high level of inherent danger or difficulty ” .
Well how about extreme investing !
Extreme Investing
I ’m a pretty non-extreme investor in general ; most of our money is in index funds with a small percentage in other industry specific funds .
But I do like to use a small portion of our money for “ extreme investing ” .
What exactly is extreme investing you ask ?
Well it really depends on the perception of the person that is risking the money .
To someone who trades stocks on a daily basis and is very comfortable with the market , making margin trades might be their version of extreme investing .
On the other hand , to a person invested only in CD ’s or bonds , simply buying a stock might feel a little crazy .
Why Extreme Investing ?
Of course the point is n’t to get an adrenaline rush or an extreme buzz from watching your investment ’s progress .
The reason you might want to do a little extreme investing is that it can help broaden your financial horizons .
As creatures of habit we tend to stick with what we know , whether what we ’re currently doing is the best thing for our situation or not .
Extreme Investing Options
Extreme investing basically entails taking a small percentage of your financial capital and using the money to invest in something you typically would n’t but think could be a good opportunity for you .
Maybe you ’re interested in starting your own business , investing in someone else ’s idea , or just trading a few shares of stock .
Ideally , you ’ll do research on the topic before jumping in so you can learn the risks and opportunities of what you ’re getting into .
The money you invest should be money you ’re willing and able to lose 100 % of , after all this is extreme investing : )
Investing Growth
The cool thing about extreme investing is that once you make some money with it , you can use that capital to reinvest into training , research , or more growth with the same idea .
My version of extreme investing has been dabbling in online businesses and I ’ve invested the money I ’ve made back into new ideas .
Investing Guidelines
As I mentioned earlier , it ’s important to only use a small portion of your financial assets for extreme investing , an amount you ’d be willing to lose .
If you lose it all do n’t continue to pile your money into it .
Make sure you research the investment area and understand what it is you ’re putting your money into .
When you make money invest it back into your venture for future growth .
The last rule is to learn from your mistakes and widen your horizons !
WASHINGTON  Students of how the Bush administration led the nation into the Iraq war can now go online to browse a comprehensive database of top officials ’ statements before the invasion , connecting the dots between hundreds of claims , mostly discredited since then , linking Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda or warning that he possessed forbidden weapons .
The Center for Public Integrity , a research group that focuses on ethics in government and public policy , designed the new Web site to allow simple searches for specific phrases , such as “ mushroom cloud ” or “ yellowcake uranium , ” in transcripts and documents totaling some 380,000 words , including remarks by President Bush and most of his top advisers in the two years after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Warnings about the need to confront Iraq , by President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Colin L. Powell , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , the national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice , and two White House press secretaries , among others , can be combed line by line , and reviewed alongside detailed critiques published after the fact by official panels , historians , journalists and independent experts .
There is no startling new information in the archive , because all the documents have been published previously .
But the new computer tool is remarkable for its scope , and its replay of the crescendo of statements that led to the war .
Muckrakers may find browsing the site reminiscent of what Richard M. Nixon used to dismissively call “ wallowing in Watergate . ”
Mr Khodorkovsky said he was facing an impossible moral choice
Vasily Aleksanian , a former executive of the Yukos oil firm , has AIDS and his health is said to be getting worse .
Mr Khodorkovsky says officials are punishing Mr Aleksanian for refusing to sign false confessions against him .
The two men were jailed in 2005 for fraud and tax evasion in a trial critics said was politically - motivated .
In a letter posted on his supporters ' website , Mr Khodorkovsky said Mr Aleksanian had been refused medication and deliberately placed in poor conditions .
He said he had no choice but to " abandon the legal framework " and start a hunger strike .
" I am facing an impossible moral choice : admit to crimes I have n't committed and save the life of a man , but destroy the fate of innocents who will be charged as my accomplices , " he said .
Mr Aleksanian has said he has developed serious health complications and is nearly blind .
' Outrageous conduct '
Mr Aleksanian says he believes he will die in prison
Mr Khodorkovsky 's international lawyer Robert Amsterdam said Russia was " flouting not only international law but the norms of morality " .
In an apparent reference to the Soviet era , he said denial of treatment to Mr Aleksanian returned the Russian prosecutors ' office " to its role in a different chapter of Russian history " .
" This hunger strike should draw attention to the outrageous conduct of senior members of the Russian Federation who should be held personally responsible for these crimes , " he said .
Mr Khodorkovsky , the founder of the Yukos oil company and once Russia 's richest man , is serving an eight - year sentence at a prison camp in Siberia .
His supporters have always said that his arrest was punishment for his support of pro-Western opposition political parties .
SUNNYVALE , California ( Reuters ) - Will Yahoos ’ yodels be silenced ?
People look over displays at the Yahoo ! booth during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Nevadain this January 7 , 2008 file photo .
Yahoo Inc. confirmed on February 1 , 2008 that it has received an unsolicited bid from Microsoft Corp to acquire Yahoo and that its board of directors would consider the $ 44.6 billion deal .

Yahoo
Inc employees fretted on Friday that their fun-loving culture , summed up by early company ads featuring a cowboy yodel , could get quashed by the comparatively stodgy software behemoth that wants to gobble it up .
On a crisp , sunny morning just hours after Microsoft Corp announced a $ 44.6 billion bid for the Internet company , “ Yahoos ” at its Silicon Valley campus milled about with coffee cups outside the low - rise buildings .
One engineer taking a cigarette break in the grassy plaza in Sunnyvale , California , said Microsoft ’s move raised difficult questions for Yahoos .
The woman , who was in her late 30s , would not give her name due to corporate rules against unauthorized contacts with reporters .
“ Everyone sees Microsoft as the big octopus from ‘ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ’ that wants to swallow everybody up , ” she said .
The Silicon Valley veteran said she had previously worked at Adobe Systems Inc , eBay Inc , Nortel and even Microsoft itself .
“ I really do n’t know , ” she said , when asked what it felt like to possibly work for Microsoft again .
Yahoo definitely sees itself as different from other companies .
On its site for prospective employees it says , “ We believe humor is essential to success .
We applaud irreverence and do n’t take ourselves too seriously .
We celebrate achievement .
We yodel . ”
But the company has been singing the blues lately .
Some workers saw the Microsoft bid as a welcome vote of confidence in Yahoo , which has struggled against market leader Google Inc .
“ It ’s really ambivalent here .
A lot of people feel like the stock has taken such a battering , that to have renewed interest in us , that lifts spirits a bit , ” said one headquarters employee who was reached by phone .
A Yahoo technical employee said the other workers he had spoken to were “ pretty measured ” about the prospect of a takeover , and mergers were part of life in Silicon Valley .
“ I have been through other integrations before at Yahoo , ” he said .
Several Yahoo employees said they believed Jerry Yang , the co-founder who took over as chief executive last June , would do what is best for the company and its employees .
“ I trust Jerry to make the right decision , ” the former Microsoft employee said .
“ He inherited a big mess . ”
A former Yahoo vice president who left the company six months ago saw the Microsoft bid as a positive development for a company whose fortunes have soured .
“ Morale has been so bad .
They ’ve been bombarded with bad news for the past two years , ” she said , adding that she had been communicating with Yahoo employees via instant messaging all day .
“ This looks to me like a positive option .
I think they should go for it and I think they will . ”
The big question for many employees , however , was whether Yahoo ’s free - spirited , go - getting culture would be embraced by a decades - old tech giant .
“ A lot of people feel like it would be a culture clash , ” said the employee interviewed over the phone .
“ There ’s a sense that over time Yahoo has moved away from its entrepreneurial roots .
If we ’re acquired by Microsoft , we ’d be moving even further away from that . ”
The former Yahoo VP agreed .
“ There is a whole atmosphere of fun which they have tried to imbue in the culture .
I would hope that would n’t change , ” she said .
“ That is why they have been able to retain such amazing talent . ”
I 've always been kind of jealous at the array of attractive birth control cases exes have had to tote around their anti-baby pills .
Condoms typically come in boxes and wrappers that are clumsy and ugly ( exception ) .
The XYXX condom case wants to change all that with a package you actually want to keep in your pockets .
Yeah it 's pretty phallic looking , but we 're talking about cockwrappers here .

The case is a centimeter thick , and slides open like a a cellphone with the rubber ready to go , preventing drunken Knocked Up moments .
The packaging setup 's aesthetically well - endowed too , with a ring of condoms surrounding the case , which looks sorta like if Apple designed contraceptives .
On other hand , most Apple products now come with color options other than white , and the limited palette 's a downer .
Where 's the neon ?

WHY is the Republicans ’ three - legged stool wobbling ?
Why are n’t economic , social and political conservatives pulling together during this primary season the way they have in the past ?
To understand , let ’s imagine that we had three conservatives in the room with us  and that they said exactly what was on their minds .
The Economic Conservative :
It ’s not my fault that we ’re in such trouble .
You foreign policy conservatives got us into this endless war in the Mideast .
You ’ve driven up oil prices and busted the budget .
And you social conservatives :
Your obsession with same - sex marriage makes us look as if we ’re from the Middle Ages .
And why ca n’t you people pay for your own prescription drugs ?
The Iraq war was bad , but Medicare Part D could cost at least 15 times as much .
What this party needs is a return to the good old Reagan message : less spending , lower taxes and no more of these weird social and foreign adventures .
The Social Conservative :
You ’re blaming us ?
It ’s our votes that pass your tax cuts  and what do we get in return ?
Of course you ca n’t understand why we care about the marriage issue .
You ’re rich and secure and highly educated .
The divorce rates for people like you have plunged since 1979 .
With your big new salaries up there , mothers can quit their jobs and stay home with the children  while your illegal - immigrant housekeepers make the beds .
Down here , though , it ’s still the 1970s .
Our wages are stagnant .
Both parents need to work , and those megachurches you laugh at provide the day care that makes it possible .

It always galls me when I see limousine liberals send their kids to fancy private schools while supporting public school ; or Congressmen exempting themselves from their own wage and hour legislation .
IP laws are no different .
Congress enacts laws protecting imaginary things , with predictably disastrous consequences .
So then exceptions have to be invented , by courts or legislators , to alleviate the consequences .
Without the nebulous , arbitrary , incoherent , and utilitarian " fair use " exception , copyright law would be much more painful and more obviously unjust and intolerable .
In the case of patents , when a patent injunction threatened to prohibit the BlackBerry and bankrupt NTP , upsetting many Congress - critters who used BlackBerries , can there be any doubt Congress would have stepped in to stop this if necessary ?
And during the anthrax scares a while back when the FedGov was catching flak because Bayer was using state - granted patent monopoly rights to keep the supply of Cipro limited and its price high , the feds of course threatened to use its power to issue a compulsory license ( 2 ) .
So what does Congress care about the draconian effects of patent law ? — it can easily alleviate the effects .
Another example : in 1997 Congress added 35 U.S.C. 287 ( c ) to the Patent Act to exempt certain surgical methods from patent liability ( 2 ) .
And now the latest .
Many huge banks , such as " City National , Wells Fargo , BOA , US Bank , Wachovia , Suntrust , BB&T , Bancorp South , Compass , Frost National , First Tennessee , HSBC , Harris , National City , Zions First National Bank , Bank of NY , Bank of Tokyo , Comerica , Deutsche Bank , First Citizens , Keycorp , LaSalle , M&T , PNC , and others , " have been sued by a company called DataTreasury , for patent infringement .
" DataTreasury claims that its patent is necessarily infringed when a bank follows the Federal " Check 21 " procedure for electronically processing checks . "
Well , the corporate - state banking system can't be jeopardized by a pesky patent , now , can it ?
And can there be any doubt that Congress is in bed with these large donors ?
So what does Congress do ?
Easy : it adds a section to impending patent reform legislation which some are calling the " Anti-DataTreasury Provision : " Although DataTreasury is not named in the Patent Reform Act of 2007 , it is clear that Section 14 of the Senate Bill is primarily directed at that single patent holder .
The bill would excuse " financial institutions " from charges that their check imaging methods constitute patent infringement . "
The bastards .
Congress and its corporate cronies should feel the full brunt of its outrageous IP - monopoly privilege laws .
The tunnel should ease the big burden of transalpine traffic
It will cut the journey time between Germany and Italy by at least a third .
It is set to be fully operational in December , and will eventually handle about 42 passenger trains and up to 80 freight trains daily .
The estimated cost of the project is 4.3bn Swiss francs ( £ 1.75 bn ; $ 3.5 bn ) .
Construction started eight years ago .
Worldwide the Loetschberg is third in length , behind Japan 's Seikan tunnel and the Channel tunnel , both of which are underwater .
But it is the longest tunnel on land .
Switzerland acts as one of Europe 's major junctions for freight and the tunnel is meant to move cargo off the roads and onto rail .
More than 4,000 heavy lorries cross the Swiss Alps by road every day , leading to traffic jams , air pollution and accidents .
The Swiss rail tunnel project - including a second , parallel tunnel , due for completion in 2015 - is one of the biggest engineering projects in the world .
Millions of tonnes of rock have to be shifted .
The second rail route , the Gotthard rail tunnel , will measure 60 km - making it the longest in the world - and will cut the travel time from Zurich to Milan to only two - and - a - half hours .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House Democrats on Thursday failed to override President Bush 's veto of a children 's health insurance bill that opponents said was too expensive .
Musician Paul Simon , left , joins House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to oppose Bush 's veto of the SCHIP bill .
By a vote of 273 to 156 , the measure fell 13 votes short of the two - thirds majority needed for an override .
Forty - four Republicans voted for the override .
" Now is the time for Congress to stop playing politics and to join the president in finding common ground , " said a White House statement after the vote .
Bush was " pleased , " the statement said , that the " misguided legislation " was defeated .
Democrats , sensing earlier that they did n't have the votes , vowed to continue the fight , despite a defeat .
The issue has ignited an intense two - week struggle on Capitol Hill after Bush vetoed the proposed five - year expansion and $ 35 billion spending increase .
Bush proposes increasing the program by $ 5 billion .
Before the vote , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke of a middle - class family caring for a child with a birth defect , asking lawmakers : " So when the president wants to have 4 or $ 5 billion for children in this initiative , is he the one , the decider , who wants to go to that family and say , ' Your child is out ' ? "
" We 're lobbying for all of the children , " said the California Democrat .
Watch Democrats pull out all the stops »
Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner explained his and other opponents ' stance on the bill .
" What we 've been working towards is trying to find a way to say that we ought to insure poor children first , " said the Ohio Republican .
" Let 's not let this become another Washington program that starts with one principle of mind and then becomes something for everyone . "
It was the fourth veto of Bush 's term .
See veto record »
On its first go - round , the House passed it with 45 Republican votes -- about two dozen votes short of the two - thirds majority .
Earlier , Pelosi said Bush " is alone , " in his stance on the bill , " and he 's dragging some of his House members with him down this path . "
Bush said Wednesday that the congressional plan would " encourage people to move from private medicine to the public . "
Another member of the Democratic House leadership , Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , vowed Thursday that they would not let up .
" There will be no compromise on 10 million children 's health care , " Emanuel told CNN .
" We wo n't go above it , but we ain't going below it .
" The American people support this issue because kids do not need to suffer for what is basically a broken health care system , and this provides those children with that health care , " Emanuel said .
The SCHIP program covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid , the federally funded program providing health care for the poor , but can't afford private health insurance .
The bill the House and Senate passed in September would extend eligibility for the program to about 4 million more , paying for the expansion with a 61 - cent - per - pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Wednesday found strong support for Democrats ' efforts to override the veto .
The poll found 61 percent of Americans believe Congress should overrule Bush , while 35 percent believe the veto should be sustained .
Pollsters interviewed 1,212 people from Friday through Sunday .
The survey has a sampling error of 3 percentage points .
Bush stood firm during a Wednesday news conference .
" I made clear that , if putting poor children first requires more than the 20 percent increase in funding I proposed , we 'll work with Congress to find the money we need , " said the president .
" I 'm confident we can work out our differences and reauthorize SCHIP . "
Bush complained that administration officials " were n't dialed in " to the plans , " and I do n't know why .
But they just ran the bill , and I made it clear we were n't going to accept it . "
The bill passed the Senate with the support of prominent Republicans such as Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Charles Grassley of Iowa .
House Republican leaders have complained that Democrats postponed the override attempt for two weeks to use the issue for political advantage .
A coalition of labor and advocacy groups had been pounding Republicans with a nearly $ 1 million television ad campaign on cable networks featuring children who have received benefits from the program .
The House Democratic campaign committee has paid for radio ads and automated calls to voters in GOP - held districts it considers competitive in 2008 .
Democrats say they would need to peel off about 14 Republicans in the House to be able to enact the bill over Bush 's veto .
Republican staffers tell CNN that Rep. Bobby Jindal , who is running for governor of Louisiana , is expected to join Democrats in supporting the override .
Jindal did not vote on the original bill .
Meanwhile , of the eight Democrats who voted against the bill in September , only one has said he will reverse his vote and support an override .
Rep .
Mike McIntyre , who described his North Carolina district as " Tobacco Road , " told CNN on Monday that the debate " is no longer about the tobacco tax , but really about whether we 're going to help our children . "
Democratic Rep. Diane Watson of California , who declined to vote on the original bill , has agreed to vote for the override , House Democratic Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn said .
Niki Tsongas , the widow of former Sen. Paul Tsongas who won a special election Tuesday to replace Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Marty Meehan , will be sworn in Thursday morning in time for the vote .

If you think the nutritionists and vitamin peddlers in the UK are weird , you really want to go to South Africa , where President Thabo Mbeki has a long history of siding with the HIV denialists , who believe that HIV does not cause Aids ( but that treatments for it do ) , and where his health minister talks up fruit and vegetables as a treatment , as we have previously covered here .
In this world , Zackie Achmat is a hero : the founder of the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa , he recently won a breakthrough in his long battle against the vitamin - loving Aids denialists of Mbeki ’s government , to make HIV medication available through the public health system .
Article continues
Achmat is also HIV positive , and was wealthy enough to afford antiretroviral medication , but deprived himself , risking his own life , as a matter of principle , until they were made widely available , despite even the personal pleas of Nelson Mandela , an avowed and public supporter of both antiretroviral medication and Achmat ’s work .
Achmat ’s victory , tragically a decade too late , was a deep wound for Matthias Rath , the German vitamin impresario who claims that his vitamin pills are better for Aids than medication , and his colleague Anthony Brink , a barrister and the leader of an allied organisation , the Treatment Information Group , which campaigns vociferously against the currently available antiretroviral medication , claiming – loudly – that they are not just ineffective but actively harmful .
This man Anthony Brink has now managed to file a complaint against Achmat with , of all places , the Hague international criminal court : Achmat is accused of genocide , for successfully campaigning to get access to HIV drugs for the South African people .
Now I have read this ridiculous document – which has been reported as a proper news event in much of the gay and South African media – and for the first 50 pages or so you get the familiar anti-medication and Aids - denialist stuff : they talk up the side effects of HIV drugs , they misrepresent the research .
But then , at around page 58 , by which time any journalist covering this story must , I can only assume , have stopped reading , this “ indictment ” document suddenly deteriorates into full - on fruitcake action .
Brink “ respectfully submit[s ] ” that the international criminal court should punish Achmat with “ permanent confinement in a small , white , steel and concrete cage , bright fluorescent light on all the time … warders putting him out only to work every day in the prison garden to cultivate nutrient - rich vegetables , including when it ’s raining ” .
This is supposed to be a serious war crimes document , remember .
Then it gets nasty .
Achmat should be forced to take his HIV medication ( “ which he claims to take ” ) and it should be “ pushed if necessary down his forced - open gullet with a finger , or , if he bites , kicks and screams too much , dripped into his arm ” .
And how will this forced administration be possible ?
He should be , white barrister Anthony Brink respectfully submits , “ restrained on a gurney with cable ties around his ankles , wrists and neck … until he gives up the ghost on them , so as to eradicate this foulest , most loathsome , unscrupulous and malevolent blight on the human race , who has plagued and poisoned the people of South Africa ” .
I do n’t think it ’s out of line to suggest this is particularly vile considering that Achmat is a “ coloured ” man , by the apartheid government ’s classification : and let ’s not forget that Achmat , a longstanding anti-apartheid and gay rights campaigner , was imprisoned under that brutal regime .
Achmat has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize , and is a hero in ways you ’d better hope you never get the chance to be .
Meanwhile this vicious and unhinged hatred , this surrealist charge of genocide , comes from a colleague of the vitamin peddler Rath : from Anthony Brink , from the man who is credited with introducing Mbeki to HIV denialism , who has helped cost the lives of tens of thousands of people needlessly deprived of effective treatments .

MSNBC hosts mock Sep. 11 conspiracy theorists ; ' I hope we have special prison ' for them David Edwards and Mike Sheehan

An MSNBC morning crew groaned and fumed at 9/11 conspiracy theorists after reporting on an earlier story involving a protester arrested at an appearance by former president Bill Clinton on Monday .
On-air staff of ' Morning Joe , ' hosted by Joe Scarborough , aired footage of the arrest and immediately shouted over the reporter presenting the story , who also had his own scathing comments to add .
Willie Geist reported the Clinton incident as follows : " President Clinton was campaigning for his wife in Corpus Christi , Texas , yesterday when an idiot started waving a sign that claimed 9/11 was an inside job .
Wah , wah , shut up . "
Geist 's associates , including Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski , jeered aloud as the video showed the screaming man being removed by security .
" What 's Rosie O'Donnell doing in Corpus Christi ? " shouted Scarborough .
Continued Geist , " As Clinton was working the crowd after the speech , the man got close to the former president and started yelling at him .
You do n't do that , y'see , ' cause that 's when the Secret Service steps in . "
Scarborough quipped aloud , " Where 's the taser ?
Tase him , bro ! "
" The man led away in handcuffs , " Geist wrapped , " and hopefully taken to one of those secret prisons in eastern Europe , never to be heard from again .
We can only hope . "
As Scarborough plead , " Please leave Bill Clinton alone , " Geist added , " I hope we have a special prison for 9/11 conspiracy theorists .
They deserve to be together . "
Critics and particularly disruptive protesters of the generally accepted facts of September 11 's terrorist attacks have often come under fire by mainstream media figures , dismissed as crackpots or troublemakers .
Last October , ' Real Time ' host Bill Maher became agitated when 9/11 protesters interrupted his show before being escorted off the set by security .
In some countries , folks cheer at the sight of an exotic supercar , while in others they assume the driver is a ( expletive deleted ) .
In which camp would you think England falls ?
We 'd have hoped the former , but the crowd has spoken , and they 're saying otherwise .
When an evidently obscenely wealthy driver parked his Bugatti Veyron in a loading bay in downtown Manchester , a traffic warden wrote him a ticket while a gathering crowd stood by and cheered her on .
The same car was reported to have gotten another ticket in the posh Cheshire neighborhood of Alderley Edge , as well .
The ??? 60 ticket this time , which can be reduced to ??? 30 if paid promptly , will probably not make or break the driver of the seven - figure hyper-exotic , but he should really be more careful about where he leaves his Veyron lying around .
Thanks for the tip , Sparky !

Everyone saw the focus , the insistence , and the scorn for bozos – for people who were happy enough to get by .
What people always missed about Jobs at Apple was the agile mind , able and eager to shift from the inside to the outside and back again .
Apple was not saved by design or innovation .
What saved Apple is the constantly iterated shift from design to execution , from surface to depth , from style to science and back again .
Jobs learned from bad times but did not let bad times shape him .
When he was kicked out as a dreamy incompetent , he went elsewhere , made a couple of new fortunes , came back , and kept dreaming .
When the press assumed that Microsoft would simply discontinue Office for Mac and let someone buy the wreckage at the fire sale , Apple stood on a hill before the setting sun and shook its fist at the heavens and vowed that it would never be hungry ( and powerless ) again .
But Apple did not become a defensive shell or an outlaw .
The original iMac , Steve ’s machine , was Bondi Blue .
Everything else was business beige .
A couple of months later , you could tell which galleries on Santa Fe ’s Canyon Road were doing well because the prosperous galleries all had those Bondi Blue iMacs .
Some were sitting on 17th century Spanish oak , some on polished steel , and some on two planks of raw pine thrown across a couple of old trestles – depends on the gallery – but if they were selling art , they were buying that iMac .
Apple built the iMac into a nice little business , and then wrecked its own business with laptops .
Same thing with MP3 players : people ridiculed the new iPod as underpowered and overpriced , then watched in amazement as it consumed the entire sector .
And watched again as it fought off every challenge until , once again , Apple demolished that market with a new kind of phone .
Mac OS was clearly a better UI package than its competitors .
Rather than refine it , Jobs replaced it with Mac OS X .
This required tons of work and a vast leap of faith , since a company that had always rolled its own foundations now learned to depend on Unix and Postscript .
The dramatic shifts – abandoning floppies , abandoning Pascal and OpenDoc and Java , embracing virtual memory , abandoning the PowerPC , abandoning CDs – masked a steady reengineering of everything .
Compare today ’s MacBook Air to the original .
They look pretty much the same , but the new one is n’t just faster .
It feels better : more solid , more durable .
Remember hinge kits ?
Hinges do n’t wobble anymore .
( A visible side effect of the process is the maxim that every new Apple laptop has a new video connector . )
After Apple had brought color to computers and everyone else was trying to slap juicy colors on their cases , Apple seized white .
Dell and HP kept black for themselves .
This was pure style , but Apple has exploited that blunder for a decade .
Look at the Apple stores .
The analysts thought they were the desperate indulgence of a washed - up hippie who did n’t understand business , and they turned out to make heaps of money .
But they ’re not just distribution and maintenance centers .
Everything is geared to say , you can do stuff with Apple stuff .
You .
MicroCenter and Fry ’s were exciting with their racks of components and motherboards , but Apple put Grandma right in the center of the store and – look at that !
– you were standing there learning stuff about video production , along with Grandma .
Everyone knew that companies should build on their core competency .
What does a boutique computer company know about retail ?
Apple went about it like building a new system , with a fresh package and style and innovative systems in the background .
( Everyone thinks Lion is about the scroll bars , but blocks and Grand Central Dispatch are going to change everything in ways that matter a lot more than scrolling . )
Have you ever seen an Apple Store employee standing around , looking bored , waiting ?
That ’s execution .
It ca n’t have been easy to see why this is important , to convince people it matters , even to make it possible .
It ’s not something you can instill by walking around and asking programmer A whether programmer B is really a bozo , which was Steve ’s original management skill .
This sort of polish goes all the way down .
You never see a pile of Apple products in the stores : the piles are in the back , out of sight .
You never see money .
Do they even take cash ?
There ’s no cashier and no cash register .
It ’s still going on , and the analysts still ca n’t follow the shift from outside to inside .
The iPhone 4 was outside : new design , new display , new camera .
Now , we do the inside , with a new fast processor .
“ Who needs a fast processor ? ” they wonder .
You need it to do stuff , because phone software has only a few seconds to do what you have in mind .
( Desktop programs like Photoshop can take minutes to load , but if an iOS app does n’t get itself loaded in five seconds , the system assumes it ’s run amok and throws it in the drunk tank . )
And what do you want your phone to do ?
Well , Knowledge Navigator is a nice start , is n’t it ?
If you want to do speech recognition , you need a separate thread and a separate core – and look what we have here ?
GCD to manage the cores , and mobile processors with multiple cores and decent battery life .
The action this year is inside .
And down the road , when everyone is finally looking at the inside again , you ’ve got to think that Tim will remind us again that there ’s one more thing ...

This was the incredible scene after a car cartwheeled more than 100ft through the air before embedding itself in a first - floor flat .
John Gordon 's Volvo took off after hitting a tree on a roundabout and flew until it crashed into the flats 15ft off the ground and facing backwards .
The car smashed into a lounge where 19 - year - old Laura Stevens had been a few seconds earlier .
Scroll down for more ...
Emergency crews spent half an hour cutting free Mr Gordon , 31 , but he later died from his injuries .
His nine - year - old son , who was his passenger , survived with cuts and bruises .
Engineers had to spend three hours dismantling the wall of the flats in Werrington , Peterborough , before they could remove the car .
Mr Gordon , from Peterborough , hit the roundabout at around 9.10 am on Saturday , clipped a tree and bounced before being catapulted into the air .
His car cartwheeled so it entered Miss Stevens 's flat backwards , sending debris flying on to the floor .
It is believed a neighbour and a paramedic who was passing ran to help and managed to pull the boy from the wreck inside the lounge .
Firemen worked from inside the flat to free Mr Gordon , who had been heading along the A15 Werrington parkway towards the city centre .
Scroll down for more ...
He was taken to Addenbrooke 's hospital in Cambridge but died later that day .
Miss Stevens 's mother Claire , 38 , said her daughter , a supermarket worker , has not been able to go back to the flat since the crash .
" She is just so lucky to be alive , " she said .
" Seconds earlier or later and she would not have made it either . "
Fire station boss Lynn Betteridge , who attended the crash , said : " We have had to deal with vehicles in buildings before but never one which went into the first - floor . "
A colleague of mine is not fond of backup MX hosts .
He ( correctly ) points out that all incoming mail should be transmitted through another mail server anyway , so the backup MX hosts only serves as an attack point for spammers .
For the most part I agree with him , and that 's a good thing .
After all , the fellow runs some fairly busy mail servers !
The original purpose of having multiple mail servers servicing a domain at different priorities was to ensure that mail intended for the domain actually made it there .
In the days of cross-country 56 k Frame Relay connections , this was a good idea .
Things have changed since then .
Most mail servers are available most of the time , and it is very rare for a mail server to be offline long enough for the sending mail server to bounce the mail back to the user .
A typical mail server configuration will warn the sender that the message has been undeliverable after 4 hours , and then bounce the mail back usually between 1 and 5 days .
In my opinion , it 's this 4 hour undeliverable message that makes a backup MX host so attractive .
I once worked on a project to expand the RAID array for an existing Microsoft Exchange Server .
Unfortunately , expanding this array required the Exchange Server to be offline for about 8 hours .
Without a backup MX host , this company 's clients would have started receiving undeliverable warnings during this outage .
Although this downtime was anticipated by the company , it would have looked very bad to clients that were not " in the loop " .
By having a mail server under our control that could accept mail during the downtime , we were able to ensure that all mail sent to the domain was properly queued while simultaneously protecting the company 's image .
Paul Craig Roberts , a Republican who worked in the Reagan administration , is predicting a 9 - 11 type of attack before the 2008 elections .
If that occurs , Bush can declare martial law and begin arresting those who disagree with his foreign policy ( based on Executive Orders recently issued by the Bush Administration that grant the president these powers and more . )
Wild stuff .
Paul Craig Roberts is an economist and a nationally syndicated columnist for Creators Syndicate .
He served as an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan Administration earning fame as the " Father of Reaganomics " .
He is a former editor and columnist for the Wall Street Journal , Business Week , and Scripps Howard News Service .
He is a graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology and he holds a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia .
He was a post - graduate at the University of California , Berkeley , and Oxford University where he was a member of Merton College .
In 1992 he received the Warren Brookes Award for Excellence in Journalism .
In 1993 the Forbes Media Guide ranked him as one of the top seven journalists in the United States .

The essence of Mr. Starr 's case is that lying under oath is an impeachable offense even if the false testimony begins in a civil suit that was later dismissed or took place in a grand jury as an attempt to hide an embarrassing indiscretion .
Mr. Starr 's view holds that in a society founded on the rule of law , false swearing or witness tampering , abuse of office or obstruction of justice by the person vested with the highest legal powers is impermissible no matter how petty the subject .
( Greetings readers from ... everywhere .
I 'm upset , you 're upset , but there are ways to cheer yourself up . )
Robert Bork & James Rosen , " The Clinton Meltdown , " National Review ( 12 October 1998 ) :
In that contention he has considerable support , not only from the aforementioned Miss Dowd but from many others , including , surprisingly , William Safire , who says , " If forthrightly confessed , perjury about workplace dalliance should not be enough to force out a President . "
In the light of the Starr Report 's footnotes , calling what took place in the Oval Office " dalliance " falls just short of calling World War II a " dustup . "
The idea seems to be that perjury about sex is not as serious as perjury about other matters .
That wo n't wash .
Lying under oath strikes at the heart of our system of justice and the rule of law .
It does not matter in the least what the perjury is about .
The proceedings of a court or a grand jury take place because we have enacted laws that we want to see enforced , and we want them enforced on the basis of truth , not fiction .
We do not say that we care about truth when the subject is murder or drug pushing but care very little when the subject is the sexual harassment of a subordinate or tampering with witnesses to hide adultery .
That the amount of lying at trials is reaching epidemic proportions is a matter not for acceptance but for condemnation .
Cal Thomas , " Burton Soars Over Clinton in Integrity , " Los Angeles Times , ( 9 September 1998 ) :
Had Bill Clinton " merely " had a sexual encounter with Monica Lewinsky in the White House , it would still have been outrageous .
He still would have hurt his family .
The office of the presidency would still have been sullied .
But he would not have committed a potentially impeachable offense .
His fate would have been left to the opinion polls and historians .
But he lied about his affair under oath .
And the forthcoming report by the Office of the Independent Counsel is likely to present evidence that he caused others to lie and tried to keep authorities from learning the truth .
Robert Blecker , " How Does Congress Define ' Perjury ' ? " Wall Street Journal ( 9 December 1998 ) :
" Because we believe that the crime of perjury depends not only upon the clarity of the questioning itself , but also upon the knowledge and reasonable understanding of the testifier as to what is meant by the questioning , " the Sixth Circuit declared , " we hold that a defendant may be found guilty of perjury if a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence presented that the defendant knew what the question meant and gave knowingly untruthful and materially misleading answers in response . "
Whatever else it does , Congress should sweep away this mess by enacting a law clarifying the meaning of perjury : " A person commits perjury who intentionally makes a materially false statement under oath .
A person who gives an answer not literally false but consciously calculated to create a materially false impression when considered in the context in which it was given , also commits perjury . "
William Glaberson , " Testing of a President : Legal Issues , " New York Times ( 18 November 1998 ) :
Defenders of President Clinton have argued that his accusers are overzealous in saying he should be impeached or subject to criminal charges on the grounds that he committed perjury when he denied in a civil deposition that he had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky .
But a review of more than 100 perjury cases in state and Federal courts and statistics on the perjury prosecutions brought around the country show that people are prosecuted for what might be called small lies more regularly than the Clinton defenders have suggested .
Eric Schmitt , " Consequences of Perjury Debated in the House , " New York Times ( 2 December 1998 ) :
In a highly partisan hearing that featured a parade of witnesses , from convicted perjurers to Federal judges to a decorated Army general who has retired , Republicans tried to underscore perjury 's harmful effects on the nation 's justice system .
'' If citizens are allowed to lie with impunity -- or encourage others to tell false stories or hide evidence -- judges and juries cannot reach just results , '' said Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois , the committee chairman .
'' At that point , the courtroom becomes an arena for artful liars and the jury a mere focus group choosing between alternative fictions , '' Mr. Hyde said .
William Bennett , " What We Know , " Wall Street Journal ( 10 November 1998 ) :
And we know that when a person testifies under oath that he does n't remember something when in fact he does , he has committed perjury .
Defenders of the president insist this as an impeachment about illicit sex even though none of the articles of impeachment are about sexual behavior .
And so the question the House Judiciary Committee must decide during the next month is the same one that faced the committee a quarter - century ago , when it considered whether to impeach Richard Nixon :
Will it reaffirm the time - honored American ideal that no man is above the law ?
If committee members answer yes , there is only one principled way for them to conclude this inquiry : the impeachment of the president .
Gary McDowell , " Rule of Law , " Wall Street Journal ( 30 August 1999 ) :
Perjury to cover embarrassing personal behavior is still perjury ; and such perjury is sufficiently serious a federal crime for Sen .
Herbert Kohl to have argued that the president could still be " criminally prosecuted , especially once he leaves office . "
In Sen .
Kohl 's view , " his acts may not be ' removable ' wrongs , but they could be `convictable ' crimes . "
[ Clinton ] is a public official and the sentencing guidelines are less charitable in those cases : " If the defendant abused a position of public or private trust . . . in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense , increase [ the punishment ] by 2 levels . "
It would not be surprising to find a judge inclined to throw the book at the president , as Judge Wright put it , " not only to redress the President 's misconduct , but to deter others who might themselves consider emulating the President of the United States by engaging in misconduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial system . "
Richard Serrano & Robert Jackson , " Judge Finds Clinton in Contempt in Jones Case , " Los Angeles Times ( 13 April 1999 ) :
Jim Nicholson , Republican National Committee chairman , added that " Judge Wright 's decision is a long - overdue victory for the rule of law . "
Several legal experts agreed .
" The judge had no choice but to send a message that future witnesses who are less than truthful wo n't be tolerated , " said Steven Saltzburg , George Washington University law professor and a former high - ranking Justice Department official under Presidents Reagan and Bush .
" I would n't have been surprised if the sanctions were a hundred times higher , " he said .
Stephen Gillers , a law professor at New York University , added : " Any lawyer who testifies falsely before a federal judge has to expect a severe sanction , including possible loss of his license to practice law .
If anything , a judge should take more severe action when that lawyer is the president of the United States . "
Roger Kimball , " Leftists Sacrifice Truth on the Altar of Friendship , " Wall Street Journal ( 22 February 1999 ) :
It is said that truth is one of the first casualties of war .
In the culture wars that have been transforming American society since the 1960s , truth has been a conspicuous casualty : not only particular truths but also allegiance to the very ideal of truth as an indispensable component of any just and moral life .
The competing , countercultural ideal holds that loyalty to the personal trumps loyalty to the truth -- a view that made it difficult for many people to appreciate the gravity of the charges against Mr. Clinton .
So what if he lied under oath ?
It was only about a personal matter .
The novelist E.M. Forster gave classic expression to this pernicious attitude .
In an essay called " What I Believe , " Forster famously wrote that " I hate the idea of causes , and if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend , I hope I should have the guts to betray my country . "
Forster wrote this in 1939 , when for an Englishman there was no more thorough way of betraying one 's friends than by betraying one 's country .
Predictably , his selfish and self - absorbed ideas about loyalty made a great hit with the left - wing , Bloomsburyish intelligentsia of his time .
They have exerted equal fascination for the heirs of Bloomsbury in our own day .
Ronald Ostrow , " ' No One Is Above the Law , ' Starr Reminds Bar Group , " Los Angeles Times ( 2 May 1999 ) :
" A grand jury 's job is not complete until it has , to the best of its ability , run down every lead and heard from every witness , " Starr said .
" As the Supreme Court said in U.S. vs. Nixon { the 1974 Watergate tapes case} , ' the public . . . has a right to every man 's evidence , except for those persons protected by a constitutional , common - law or statutory privilege . ' " " . . .
These exceptions to the demand for every man 's evidence are not lightly created nor expansively construed , for they are in derogation of the search for truth , " the Supreme Court said .
Starr again cited the court 's word : " The impediment that an absolute , unqualified privilege would place in the way of the primary constitutional duty of the judicial branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions would plainly conflict with the function of the courts under Article 3 " of the Constitution .
Robert Bork , reviewing Ann Coulter 's High Crimes and Misdemeanors , Wall Street Journal ( 3 September 1998 ) :
The president 's defenders , experts at changing the subject , prefer to debate whether Mr. Clinton committed a felony .
Though it is clear that the president repeatedly lied under oath in Paula Jones 's lawsuit , they offer arcane disputes about whether that was technically perjury .
I think it was perjury , but that is not the point .
As Ms. Coulter reminds us , the Rodino Committee staff , gearing up for Richard Nixon , concluded , correctly , that " high crimes and misdemeanors " are not limited to actions that are crimes under federal law .
( It is a minor irony of history that Bernard Nussbaum , later Clinton 's White House counsel , and Hillary Rodham collaborated on a report that makes these points . )
When the man charged by the Constitution to " take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed " lies under oath in a federal case and knowingly watches Monica Lewinsky lie in the same case , he has clearly subverted a central constitutional duty .
That alone is amply sufficient for impeachment .
While impeachment is not to be undertaken lightly , it is also not to be avoided at the cost of sanctioning such behavior .
Ms. Coulter tellingly relies on James Madison : " The `first aim ' of the Constitution , " she writes , quoting him , " was to ensure that men with the `most virtue ' would become the nation 's rulers .
The Constitution 's impeachment power was for `keeping them virtuous whilst they continue to hold their public trust . ' "
Paul Simon , " Is It Only About Sex ? " New York Times ( 21 August 1998 ) :
A prosecutor does not create the setting underlying a perjury and obstruction of justice investigation .
Others do .
Here , whether there was a sexual relationship has never itself been worthy of investigation .
But neither the criminal investigators nor Congress can draw conclusions as to whether the President lied under oath , obstructed justice or abused the power of the Presidency , without also considering the events that are the subject of the possible perjury and the motivation for possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power .
We are on a sad and fateful course that cannot be trivialized by the false belief it is all about sex .
The fact and nature of the sexual relationship are for the individuals and families involved , the voters and perhaps Congress to consider .
Mr. Starr 's investigation , as well as the core of any Congressional proceedings , properly focus on important questions of perjury , obstruction of justice and abuse of power .
Richard Serrano , " Starr 's Report Charges That Clinton Abused Powers , Obstructed Justice , " Los Angeles Times ( 12 September 1998 ) :
A droplet moving uphill .
Photo by Philippe Brunet
Droplets of liquid have been shown to travel uphill , rather than sliding down as expected , when the surface they are on is vigorously shaken up and down .
We are all familiar with raindrops on our wind screens .
The small ones stay in place while the big ones roll down the window .
This is because surface tension holds the small drops onto the screen until they get to a size where the force of gravity is greater than the surface tension .
But mathematicians at the University of Bristol have shown that the small drops can defy gravity and travel up hill – even on an incline as steep as 85 degrees – if the surface vibrates up and down sufficiently strongly .
Dr Philippe Brunet , in the Department of Mathematics said , “ Moving small droplets – such as thousands of spots of DNA arranged on a solid surface ( a DNA microarray ) – is very difficult as their small size causes them to stick to the surface .
So improving our understanding of what causes droplets to move on surfaces will help with this and similar problems . ”
Professor Jens Eggers , also from the University ’s Maths Department added : “ As the shaking plate rises the drop is compressed , while it bulges upward as the plate falls .
If the shaking is vigorous enough to overcome the surface tension experienced as the drop is compressed , the drop will tend to lean forward , producing a net force which drives the drop uphill . ”
The research will be published online this week in Physical Review Letters .
Since the droplet must withstand a fair amount of force , alternately pushing and pulling , it is in danger of breaking apart .
Thus the droplet cannot be too large and the fluid has to be a bit thicker than water .
Pure water droplets will break apart before the forces are strong enough to cause them to climb .
On the other hand , the drops move very slowly if the fluid is too thick .
This method for moving droplets using vibrations may prove useful in understanding the small - scale manipulation of fluids .

Republicans know they ’re in for trouble when the first two words of an AP profile of their candidate for president are “ Temper , temper . ”
John McCain ’s temper is legendary .
Now , as McCain assumes the mantle of the head of the GOP , it ’s becoming common knowledge .
The New York Times also examined the notorious McCain temper this weekend :
One of the trademarks of Mr. McCain ’s rebel image has been his inability to cloak his emotions , especially anger .
He has been prone to volcanic blowups over the years .
And while he would hardly be the first president with a temper , Mr. McCain has been ever vigilant of late about resisting provocation .
Can he be vigilant til election day ?
Back in 1964 , the Republicans said of their candidate , Barry Goldwater , “ In your heart , you know he ’s right . ”
The Democrat ’s response was “ In your guts , you know he ’s nuts . ”
The 2008 version of that statement for Republicans ( a little more politically correct ) is that in their hearts , they think McCain ’s wrong .
And , in their guts and in their own experiences , Republicans know McCain is , let ’s say , volatile and unstable .
Matt Yglesias nails why this matters .
It ’s not just about screaming obscenities at other Senators , which , as Yglesias notes is “ a faux pas that can be overcome with an apology after the fact . ”
But , here ’s the real issue with McCain ’s temper :
Those same instincts could , however , be a major problem if applied to the DMZ in Korea or the Taiwan Straits .
Or any other hot spot around the world .

Some Asian men expect their new wives to be virgins
Yasmin ( name changed ) is a confident A - Level student who is glad she has lost her virginity .
She says for her it is simply a case of having sex with someone she chooses .
She knows that when she is older she will enter into an arranged marriage and she is happy to do that , as she does not want the risk of being ostracised by her parents and extended family .
She started going out with her non-Asian boyfriend and decided to take the next step in the relationship .
" I do n't know who I 'm going to end up marrying and with my current boyfriend I know him so well , and I trust him so much , and the first time you have sex with someone it 's meant to be really special so I wanted to give it to someone who I trusted . "
There 's a big culture about keeping it a secret but at the same time everyone knows it 's happening
Khyati Rawal , psychologist
" We have n't told that many people , he 's told his best friend , I 've told mine .
I know the consequences if my parents ever did find out , it would be just disastrous .
" I do n't even want to think about it . "
Male pressure
Virginity is a big issue for second and third generation British Asians across the board whether they are sexually active or not , according to psychologist Khyati Rawal , who counsels young Asian women .
" There 's a big culture about keeping it a secret but at the same time everyone knows it 's happening . "
" The women can have a number of anxieties .
It can be when they 've finished with a relationship they 've been in and they 're now deciding to settle down permanently , or they have met someone who will not tolerate the idea of sex before marriage , so there 's suddenly a massive panic about ' oh my God they 're going to find out ' . "
FAKING VIRGINITY 24 hymen repair operations on the NHS ( 2005/06 ) Private procedure in London costs up to £ 2,000
Some health workers advise dripping red dye in bed sheets
And it is a big issue for men like 19 - year - old Raz .
He says when he gets married , particularly if it is an arranged marriage , he will expect his wife to be virgin .
For him it 's all to do with respect .
If a girl has had sex before , as far as he is concerned , she does not respect her culture .
" You would n't be able to walk outside and hold your head up high because if you did find out your wife was n't a virgin before you married her it makes you feel less of a man . "
Fake blood
At the Brook Advisory Centre in Birmingham , Asian women are asking for advice on faking their virginity on a daily basis .
Jan Deeming , a sexual health worker says she would outline a number of options that were available to them .
" We would talk to women about using red dyes in place of real blood .
We would tell them they could buy blood from a joke shop . "
A few drops of this would be put on the bedsheet after the " first time " extended family sees blood on sheets and everyone thinks the girl is a virgin .
" It 's not as if I or Brook agreed with this faking , " says Jan .
" But the risks are so great to some women the consequences could have been dire . "
Hymen surgery
Some sexually active young Asian women have fled or sought refuge because they fear their life is on the line if somebody found out .
Others are opting for a medical approach by paying to have their virginity restored through hymen surgery .
Professor Linda Cardoza , from London 's King 's College Hospital , says the young women she sees are very pleased to have found a source of help because they did n't think it was reversible .
He just could n't accept I was n't a virgin
Kully
" Sometimes African girls who come from societies where they may be ostracised if they had sexual intercourse before marriage , " she adds .
Hymen surgery is an outpatients procedure , usually carried out under general anaesthetic and costs around £ 1,500 - £ 2,000 if done privately in a London clinic .
It is currently offered on the NHS only if the patient can prove that the issue of their virginity is causing mental distress .
The NHS says it carried out just 24 hymen repair operations between 2005 and 2006 .
A big lie
When Kully ( name changed ) , now a mother of two , got married , she knew there was no way she could have told her husband she was not a virgin .
She simply lied .
" I did worry the first time we were going to have sex , what would happen ?
What if he said ' you 're not a virgin ' ? "
In her previous relationship she had told her then boyfriend that she was not a virgin .
" At first everything was fine .
He said it was n't a problem .
He said he was n't a virgin either and everything was going well .
But then he said he could n't marry me .
He just could n't accept I was n't a virgin . "
My marriage is based on this one big lie
Kully
She says this time the stakes were higher .
She was entering into a marriage .
She believes that if her husband ever found out , then this would probably end their marriage .
" I have to live with the fact that I have lied , and my marriage is based on this one big lie :
That I was n't a virgin . "

Bush Turns US Soldiers into Murderers
By forcing repeat combat assignments to Iraq and Afghanistan – and by winking at torture and indiscriminate killings – George W. Bush is degrading the reputation of the U.S. military , turning enlisted soldiers and intelligence officers into murderers and sadists .

For instance , on Feb. 10 at Camp Liberty in Iraq , Army Ranger Sgt. Evan Vela was sentenced by a U.S. military court to 10 years in prison for executing an unarmed Iraqi detainee who – along with his son – had stumbled into a U.S. sniper position last year .
After letting the 17 - year - old son go , Vela ’s squad leader , Staff Sgt. Michael Hensley ordered Vela to use a 9 - millimeter pistol to shoot the father , Genei Nesir Khudair al - Janabi , in the head , an order that Vela carried out .
“ It was murder , plain and simple , ” military prosecutor , Major Charles Kuhfahl , told the court .
Janabi ’s son , Mustafa , was allowed to make a statement , explaining how his father ’s death had devastated the family and how one of his four younger brothers now avoids their home because he can’t stand the sight of his father ’s empty room .
“ Please do n’t forget about us , ” Mustafa told the court .
But Vela ’s guilty verdict was a rare case of holding a U.S. soldier accountable in the killing or abusing of an Iraqi .
Among the infrequent cases that have been brought , most end in acquittals or convictions only on minor charges .
Last November , for example , another military jury acquitted Hensley in the same murder of Janabi as well as in the killing of two other Iraqi men south of Baghdad in the early days of Bush ’s troop “ surge . ”
That jury ruled that Hensley was following the approved " rules of engagement , " though it did convict him of planting an AK - 47 on one victim .
Some of Vela ’s military comrades complained that it was unfair to single any of them out for punishment because these killings are so common in Iraq .
Vela ’s former platoon commander , Sgt. First Class Steven Kipling , said that if all U.S. combat soldiers in Iraq were subjected to the same scrutiny applied to Vela , “ we would have thousands ” of cases .
[ NYT , Feb. 11 , 2008 ]
Indeed , the evidence does suggest that the handful of homicide cases from Iraq and Afghanistan that reach military trial represent only a small fraction of the unprovoked killings of locals at the hands of U.S. soldiers .
Press Attention
The murder and abuse cases that do result in trials often stem from incidents that get news media attention , like the mass killing of two dozen Iraqis in Haditha on Nov. 19 , 2005 , which Time magazine exposed .
Even more memorable was the case of the sexual and physical abuse of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison , mistreatment that was documented with photographs that reached the U.S. news media in 2004 .
President Bush , who then was seeking reelection , joined in denouncing the low - ranking soldiers who had dressed Iraqi men up in women ’s underwear or made them pose naked on leashes or in fake sexual positions .
Bush said he “ shared a deep disgust that those prisoners were treated the way they were treated . ”
Other senior administration officials called the Abu Ghraib guards – mostly poorly trained reservists – a “ few bad apples . ”
Amid the furor , some Abu Ghraib guards claimed they were simply following guidance from intelligence interrogators on techniques to “ soften up ” detainees .
But the Bush administration stuck to its story that the guards were an out - of - control night shift .
Army Sgt. Sam Provance was the only uniformed military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib to support the guards ’ claim that the prisoner abuse was part of the “ alternative interrogation techniques ” that had made their way from Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib .
Provance , however , was punished for his candor and pushed out of the U.S. military .
The Bush administration went ahead with plans to pin the blame on the MPs .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Ghosts of Abu Ghraib . ” ]
Only after Election 2004 did evidence surface revealing that the sexual abuse of the Abu Ghraib prisoners did fit with the broader policy – approved by President Bush and other senior administration officials – to break down prisoners for interrogation .
For instance , alleged 9/11 plotter Mohammed al - Qahtani , who was sent to Guantanamo in 2002 , was subjected to treatment similar to what later occurred at Abu Ghraib .
Qahtani was forced to wear a bra , had a thong placed on his head , was paraded naked in front of women and was led around on a leash like a dog , military investigators reported in 2005 .
Nevertheless , at Abu Ghraib , only the guards got serious punishment .
Eventually , 11 enlisted soldiers were convicted in courts martial .
Cpl. Charles Graner Jr. received the harshest sentence – 10 years in prison – while Lynndie England , a 22 - year - old single mother who was photographed holding an Iraqi on a leash and pointing at a detainee ’s penis , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Their superior officers either were cleared of wrongdoing or received mild reprimands .
Bush continued to treat the Abu Ghraib scandal like a freak incident that the media had blown out of proportion .
At a press conference on May 25 , 2006 , he complained , “ We ’ve been paying for that for a long period of time . ”
Into the Gutter Never has Bush acknowledged that the abusive treatment of detainees – or the killing of unarmed Iraqis and Afghanis – are a natural result of his aggressive war strategies , nor that he is the one primarily responsible for dragging the worldwide reputation of the U.S. military and intelligence services into the gutter .
In the “ war on terror , ” Bush has asserted unlimited presidential authority that he claims lets him kill , imprison , spy on and torture anyone anywhere in the world , U.S. citizens and foreigners alike .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush ‘ Apex ’ of Unlimited Power ” or the book , Neck Deep . ]
A former senior administration official told the Washington Post in 2004 that Bush “ felt very keenly that his primary responsibility was to do everything within his power to keep the country safe , and he was not concerned with appearances or politics or hiding behind lower - level officials . ”
[ Washington Post , June 9 , 2004 ]
Bush , however , has hid behind lower - level people , especially the soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan , many of whom have faced multiple assignments to the war zones with relatively brief periods of home leave .
As one member of Sgt. Vela ’s sniper team , Sgt. Anthony Murphy , said : “ It ’s a terrible war out there .
And you have to make tough decisions .
This war does n’t provide that luxury to be perfect . ”
In an e-mail interview with the New York Times , Sgt. Hensley , who gave Vela the order to execute the Iraqi detainee Janabi , complained that he [ Hensley ] should not have even faced a court martial because he was following guidance from two superior officers who wanted him to boost the unit ’s kill count .
“ Every last man we killed was a confirmed terrorist , ” Hensley wrote .
“ We were praised when bad guys died .
We were upbraided when bad guys did not die . ”
[ NYT , Nov. 9 , 2007 ]
In another incident near the town of Iskandariya , Iraq , on April 27 , 2007 , Army sniper Jorge G. Sandoval Jr. received an order from Sgt. Hensley to kill a man cutting grass with a rusty scythe because he was suspected of being an insurgent posing as a farmer .
Like Hensley , Sandoval was acquitted because the military jury accepted defense arguments that the killing was within the rules of engagement .
( Sandoval was convicted of a lesser charge of planting a coil of copper wire on a slain Iraqi , and was sentenced to five months in prison . )
The Sandoval case also revealed a classified program in which the Pentagon ’s Asymmetric Warfare Group encouraged U.S. military snipers in Iraq to drop “ bait ” – such as electrical cords and ammunition – and then shoot Iraqis who pick up the items .
[ Washington Post , Sept. 24 , 2007 ]
Afghani
Shot A similar case of authorized murder of an insurgent suspect surfaced at a military court hearing at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , in mid-September 2007 .
Two U.S. Special Forces soldiers took part in the execution of an Afghani who was a suspected leader of an insurgent group .
Special Forces Capt . Dave Staffel and Sgt. Troy Anderson were leading a team of Afghan soldiers when an informant told them where the suspected insurgent leader was hiding .
The U.S. - led contingent found a man believed to be Nawab Buntangyar walking outside his compound near the village of Hasan Kheyl .
While the Americans kept their distance out of fear the suspect might be wearing a suicide vest , the man was questioned about his name and the Americans checked his description against a list from the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan , known as “ the kill - or - capture list . ”
Concluding that the man was Nawab Buntangyar , Staffel gave the order to shoot , and Anderson – from a distance of about 100 yards away – fired a bullet through the man ’s head , killing him instantly .
The soldiers viewed the killing as “ a textbook example of a classified mission completed in accordance with the American rules of engagement , ” the International Herald Tribune reported .
“ The men said such rules allowed them to kill Buntangyar , whom the American military had designated a terrorist cell leader , once they positively identified him . ”
Staffel ’s civilian lawyer Mark Waple said the Army ’s Criminal Investigation Command concluded in April that the shooting was “ justifiable homicide , ” but a two - star general in Afghanistan instigated a murder charge against the two men .
That case , however , foundered over accusations that the charge was improperly filed .
[ IHT , Sept. 17 , 2007 ]
According to evidence at the Fort Bragg proceedings , the earlier Army investigation had cleared the two soldiers because they had been operating under rules of engagement that empowered them to kill individuals who have been designated “ enemy combatants , ” even if the targets were unarmed and presented no visible threat .
In late September 2007 , a U.S. military judge dismissed all charges against the two soldiers , ruling it was conceivable that the detained Afghani was wearing a suicide explosive belt , though there was no evidence that he was .
Loose Rules
The U.S. counterinsurgency and security operations in Iraq and Afghanistan also have been augmented by heavily armed mercenaries , such as the Blackwater “ security contractors ” who operate outside the law and were accused by Iraqi authorities of killing 17 Iraqi civilians in a shooting incident on Sept. 16 , 2007 .
Though most media criticism has focused on trigger - happy Blackwater “ security contractors , ” Bush ’s military strategy has employed its own indiscriminate firepower – from the loose rules of engagement for U.S. troops , to helicopter gun ships firing on crowds , to jet air strikes , to missiles launched from Predator drones .
For instance , the U.S. military acknowledged on Oct. 23 , 2007 , that an American helicopter killed 11 people , including women and children , after someone allegedly shot at the helicopter as it flew over the village of Mukaisheefa , north of Baghdad .
Iraqi police and witnesses said 16 people died , apparently as some rushed to help a wounded man , the New York Times reported .
The helicopter gunners presumed the wounded man to be an insurgent and thus opened fire on the locals who came to his aid , according to witnesses .
“ The locals went to check if he was dead and gathered around him , ” said Mohanad Hamid Muhsin , a 14 - year - old who was shot in the leg .
“ But the helicopter opened fire again and killed some of the locals and wounded others . ”
When Iraqis carried the wounded into houses to administer first aid , the helicopter fired on the houses , killing and wounding more people , said Muhsin , who added that the dead included two of his brothers and a sister .
A local police official said the 16 dead included six women and three children , while 14 other Iraqis were wounded .
The incident followed on the heels of an Oct. 21 gun battle in which 49 people died when U.S. forces attacked alleged Shiite militiamen in Sadr City , a crowded slum in eastern Baghdad .
Local authorities said the dead included innocent bystanders .
[ NYT , Oct. 24 , 2007 ]
Another account of the Oct. 23 incident in the Los Angeles Times quoted residents saying the men who were killed were farmers irrigating their fields in the pre-daylight hours .
Abdul Wahab Ahmed , a neighbor , said the U.S. attack also involved jets that conducted two bombing runs .
The dead included two toddlers and four teenagers , he said .
[ Los Angeles Times , Oct. 24 , 2007 ]
The U.S. military said one of those killed in the Oct. 23 attack was “ a known member of an I.E.D. cell , ” referring to improvised explosive devices that Iraqi insurgents have made their weapon of choice in fighting the U.S. occupation .
The American statement added that four other “ military - age males ” were killed along with five women and one child .
U.S. military spokesmen often justify killings in Iraq and Afghanistan by noting that the dead are military - age males ( or MAMs ) , slain in the vicinity of a firefight .
Vietnam Echo
The shoot - to - kill strategy toward MAMs has a resonance back to the Vietnam War when U.S. helicopter - borne troops sometimes would spot a MAM working in a rice paddy , fire a shot near him and then interpret his running as an aggressive act justifying his killing .
This technique was described approvingly by retired Gen. Colin Powell in his widely praised autobiography , My American Journey .
“ I recall a phrase we used in the field , MAM , for military - age male , ” Powell wrote .
“ If a helo spotted a peasant in black pajamas who looked remotely suspicious , a possible MAM , the pilot would circle and fire in front of him .
If he moved , his movement was judged evidence of hostile intent , and the next burst was not in front , but at him .
“ Brutal ?
Maybe so .
But an able battalion commander with whom I had served at Gelnhausen [ West Germany ] , Lt. Col .
Walter Pritchard , was killed by enemy sniper fire while observing MAMs from a helicopter .
And Pritchard was only one of many .
The kill - or - be - killed nature of combat tends to dull fine perceptions of right and wrong . ”
While it ’s true that combat is brutal and judgments can be clouded by fear , the mowing down of unarmed civilians in cold blood does n’t constitute combat .
Under the laws of war , it is regarded as murder and , indeed , a war crime .
Neither can the combat death of a fellow soldier be cited as an excuse to murder civilians .
[ For more on Powell ’s justification for war crimes , see Chapter 8 in Neck Deep . ]
In effect , Bush ’s “ global war on terror ” has reestablished what looks like the Vietnam - era Operation Phoenix , a program that assassinated Vietcong cadre , including suspected communist political allies .
By early 2005 , as the Iraqi insurgency grew , the Bush administration reportedly debated a “ Salvador option ” for Iraq , an apparent reference to the “ death squad ” operations that decimated the ranks of perceived leftists who were opposed to El Salvador ’s right - wing military junta in the early 1980s .
According to Newsweek magazine , President Bush was contemplating the adoption of that brutal “ still - secret strategy ” of the Reagan administration as a way to get a handle on the spiraling violence in Iraq .
“ Many U.S. conservatives consider the policy [ in El Salvador ] to have been a success – despite the deaths of innocent civilians , ” Newsweek wrote .
The magazine also noted that many of Bush ’s advisers were leading figures in the Central American operations of the 1980s , including Elliott Abrams , who is now an architect of Middle East policy on the National Security Council .
Wanton Death
In Guatemala , about 200,000 people perished , including what a truth commission later termed a genocide against Mayan Indians in the Guatemalan highlands .
In El Salvador , about 70,000 died including massacres of whole villages , such as the slaughter committed by a U.S. - trained battalion against hundreds of men , women and children near the town of El Mozote in 1981 .
The Reagan administration ’s “ Salvador option ” also had a domestic component , the so - called “ perception management ” operation that employed sophisticated propaganda to manipulate the fears of the American people while hiding the ugly reality of the wars .
[ See Robert Parry 's Lost History . ]
Bush has taken the position that he can override both international law and the U.S. Constitution in deciding who gets basic human rights and who does n’t .
He sees himself as the final judge of whether people he deems “ bad guys ” should live or die , or face indefinite imprisonment and even torture .
The troubling picture is that the U.S. chain of command , presumably up to Bush , has authorized loose “ rules of engagement ” that allow targeted killings – as well as other objectionable tactics including arbitrary arrests , “ enhanced interrogations , ” kidnappings in third countries with “ extraordinary renditions ” to countries that torture , secret CIA prisons , and detentions without trial .
This anything - goes approach has been conveyed down to soldiers in the field who believe they have wide discretion to kill Iraqis and Afghanis on the slightest suspicion .
With rare exceptions – like the conviction of Sgt. Vela – the U.S. military has become a law onto itself , an extension of President Bush ’s megalomania .
Robert Parry broke many of the Iran - Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek .

Ms Bhutto warned against extremist elements
The PPP originally disclosed the contents of the document shortly after her assassination in December .
A PPP spokesman said they were now releasing it to end speculation about its contents .
Analysts say the document could enhance the political position of Ms Bhutto 's widower , Asif Zardari .
Mr Zardari is currently in charge of the party .
Their 19 - year - old son Bilawal is the titular head .
' Decide what is best '
The handwritten , one - page letter dated 16 October says that Asif Ali Zardari should be interim leader until a new permanent party head is appointed .
Asif Zardari - repeatedly accused of corruption
Mr Zardari took over the leadership of the party after Ms Bhutto was killed .
She died in a suicide bombing and shooting attack in Rawalpindi while campaigning for elections in December .
" I would like my husband Asif Ali Zardari to lead you in this interim period until you and he decide what is best , " Ms Bhutto 's letter states .
" I say this because he is a man of courage and honour .
He spent eleven and a half years in prison without bending despite torture .
" He has the political stature to keep a party united . "
The letter - written two days before Ms Bhutto's return to Pakistan from exile and 12 weeks before her assassination - urged Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) supporters to continue the struggle for change .
" I fear for the future of Pakistan .
Please continue the fight against extremism , dictatorship , poverty and ignorance , " she wrote .
' Foil controversies '
At a press conference to announce the release of the will , PPP spokeswoman Sherry Rahman said that " some enemies wanted to create chaos in the party by spreading false speculation about the contents of the will " .
" That is why the party high command has decided to share the will with the public and the media to foil all such controversies and keep the party united , " she said .
Ms Bhutto's killing on 27 December while leaving an election rally in Rawalpindi led to a six - week delay to parliamentary elections now scheduled for 18 February .
Correspondents say Mr Zardari is a controversial figure in Pakistan , where he has faced repeated accusations of corruption .
PPP spokesman Farhatullah Babar said that the release of the will was not being done to strengthen Zardari 's position within the party .
He said that the party would formally decide who was the party 's long term leader after the election results are known .
How To Survive in Prison as an Innocent Man Convicted of a Sex Crime
James D. Anderson *
Psychology Editor 's Note :
This article includes some strong views that may be surprising and challenging .
We have chosen to publish it because we believe prisoners have a right to seek interaction with those outside the prison walls .
We also believe there are many innocent men and women in prison who are wrongly convicted of sex offenses .
They too , have a right to stand up for their innocence .
One of the more poignant episodes in our lives was in June , 1985 , when Lois Bentz , accused with her husband , Robert , of sexually abusing children in Jordan , Minnesota , was told by her attorney about a very attractive plea bargain .
With tears running down her face , Lois said to us , " I did not do it and I will not say I did something I did n't do . "
The Bentzes rejected the plea bargain and went to trial .
The Bentzes were acquitted and the Jordan case is often regarded as the beginning of the " backlash " that has led to increased awareness of false accusations and the reversals of several highly publicized convictions in recent years .
Still there are many many lesser known cases where Large numbers of innocent people remain behind bars .
We receive letters every week from men and women in prison who assert their innocence .
For years we have agonized about what we can do in response .
The most we have been able to do is to try to stay in contact and provide information to assist those working on appeals .
Based upon our experience with Ms. Bentz , we have also tried to say what Mr. Anderson repeats several times in this article  maintain your own personal integrity .
Mr. Anderson tells us how he has done this for himself .
It may not be a way that works for everyone , but this is what he tells us works for him .
We believe Mr. Anderson is very likely to walk out of prison when his time is served and be standing up straight and tall .
Your only exposure to what prison is like has been through movies that sensationalize the violence , drug use , and sex in the big house .
The prison bus you 're on rounds a lonely highway corner and you get your first glimpse of what is to be your home for the next 10 - odd years  a steel , razor wire , and concrete house of pain .
You wonder how you 'll ever make it out of this hate factory alive .
You imagine your first day being gang - raped by six huge , tattooed lifers , by the end of the week you 're being sold up and down the tier for cigarettes , and within a month , you 're found dead in your cell with a twelve - inch " shank " protruding from your chest .
Not only are you the new fish in the cell block , but you have been convicted of a sex crime , and you 've heard how convicted sex criminals are abused in the joint .
You 're one of the thousands of innocent men wrongly convicted of sex crimes in the U.S. every year .
Wo n't it matter to your fellow prisoners that you are not a sex criminal and are completely innocent ?
Not in the least .
It is possible , though , to make it through prison even though you were convicted of a skin beef .
You can not only live through the prison experience , you can claim some degree of victory at the end of your unjust prison term .
Life will be neither easy nor fun for the innocent man convicted of a sex crime and sent to prison .
But , surviving prison is not impossible .
I have spent over seven years in maximum - , medium - , and minimum security prisons after being wrongly convicted of first degree rape  the result of my having been falsely accused of date rape by a mentally deranged woman with a history of falsely accusing men of sex crimes .
I am writing this from the Oregon State Correctional Institution .
Although life has not been easy for me in prison , I have managed to keep my self - respect , my dignity , and my integrity .
I have spent months in solitary confinement for defending myself when necessary .
I have allowed no prisoner , no prison guard , and no member of the parole board to disrespect me due to my wrongful conviction .
I have consistently maintained my innocence , even when doing so has added years to my prison term .
I earned a college degree behind bars , and have even escaped from prison once .
To help other innocent prisoners , I founded the Society Against False Accusations of Rape ( SAFAR ) , and for five years have published the underground prison publication , The SAFAR Newsletter .
Currently , I 'm working on my book , Falling on the Deaf Ear : False Accusations of Rape , Child Abuse Hoaxes , Innocent People in Prison and How to End the Sex Crime Witchhunt .
I know first - hand what it is to be an innocent man in prison , wrongly convicted of a sex crime , and I know how to survive the prison experience .
Now that you have been falsely accused of rape or child abuse , been convicted in record time , lost all your assets along with your reputation , and been sentenced to 10 years in prison by a judge who could n't care less that you are innocent , you would think your troubles are over .
Think again .
You not only have to make it out of the prison with your life and sanity , but with your self - respect , honor , and integrity intact .
Let 's face it .
After being wrongly convicted of a sex crime , your sanity , self - respect , honor , and integrity is all you have left .
Prison will not break you if you are a man  or learn to become a man , even though the main goal of prison officials is to sap the soul from men , and spit out castrated , submissive males .
With all the odds against you , it is even possible to walk out of prison a better man with your head held high .
Again , it will be neither fun nor easy , but what battle ever is easy ?
You can either walk out of prison with your manhood intact knowing you beat the corrupt prison industry or you can crawl out on your belly as a hated sex offender .
Outside Contacts
Do n't fool yourself that the community will be outraged that you were convicted and sent to prison for a crime you did n't commit or that may have never even occurred .
You are now a convicted sex offender and your innocence means nothing .
You 're the lowest of the low , in and out of prison .
There will be no mass protests at the prison gates demanding your release .
Most people believe the propaganda of the sex crime witch hunters and probably feel you should die in prison .
Most of your friends will abandon you and even some members of your family will turn their backs on you .
Only your very best friends and your immediate family will stick by your side at first and most of them will fall by the wayside in the coming years as you rot in prison .
One of the most important things for the innocent man in prison is to maintain contact with at least one person on the outside .
This person can help you try to prove your innocence and keep you current on what 's happening outside the prison walls .
If you can maintain contact with at least one free worlder to help you , you 'll be doing a lot better than some prisoners .
Many prisoners lose their friends and their own families and are isolated in prison with no contact with the outside world .
You are going to be walking into prison alone and will be alone while you do your time .
You need at least one ally in the outside to help free yourself from the nightmare of being thrown in a cage and given the scarlet letter of a convicted sex offender for a crime you did not commit .
Prison violence
For the most part , prisons and correctional institutions are not the hell holes of years past .
The " get tough on crime " craze has mutated into " get tough on prisoners . "
Although prisons are not for continued and endless punishment , politicians do n't want to educate or rehabilitate prisoners .
Prisoners are to be warehoused like the commodities they 've become .
College courses and vocational training in prison are a thing of the past .
With all the new prisons being built in the U.S. , doing time has become quite sterile  even safe  because all the new prisons are so controlled and high - tech that prisoners now spend most of their time in their cells .
The idea that prisoners really run the joint is a myth .
Some of the older prisons are still dangerous , but these are slowly being phased out .
It used to be that only the worst , most dangerous , and most hardened criminal was sent to prison .
It was no wonder that penitentiaries were dangerous .
But these days , with so many first - time offenders doing mandatory prison terms and so many people being sent to prison , the nation 's lock - ups have become diluted with nonviolent prisoners .
Today most prisons can even be considered safe .
In all my years behind bars , I 've never seen a murder , a stabbing , or a rape .
I believe some prisoners try to brag how tough prison is to make themselves look tough .
They romanticize their prison experience by telling their friends and family how brutal prison was and how they had to fight for their lives every day .
Prison , however , may be harder for the innocent man convicted of a sex crime because of the scorn .
In the old days , a convicted sex offender  innocent or guilty  was sure to get physically attacked .
Today , that is not the case .
A man wrongly convicted of a sex crime can make it out of prison unharmed if he stays on his toes and keeps alert .
What about all the violence you read about what goes on in prison ?
Of course , violence does happen in U.S. penitentiaries , but with over 1.6 million Americans locked up these days , the chance of being one of the few hundred inmates who are killed or seriously injured is slim .
Standing Up for Yourself
Because you were convicted of a sex crime , you will not be winning any popularity contests with your fellow prisoners .
At first , the other prisoners may mark you to be victimized and harassed .
If you do n't stand tall and fight back , you 'll be victimized your entire prison term .
You must stand up for yourself when you are tested by some idiot who thinks you 're a rape - o , " Chester , " " tree jumper , " or " freak . "
In 1989 , I was compelled to beat a man who attacked me with a folding chair .
Besides a little blood , neither one of us was hurt badly .
I did accidentally break a guard 's hand in the melee and I 've also had to fight a couple of other morons who disrespected me , but I have n't had any trouble in years .
It is well worth it to spend a few months in solitary confinement for defending yourself when the option is being harassed continually in general population .
Another option is hiding for years in Protective Custody ( PC ) , totally separated from the rest of the prison , and locked in a cell for 24 - hours a day .
But only the weakest prisoners go PC , and I do n't recommend it .
For the most part , even for the wrongly convicted sex offender , if you do n't owe debts from gambling or drugs , and if you stay away from the homosexuals , keep your head down , do n't bother anyone , and do n't act like a wimp and whine about your wrongful conviction , you wo n't have to worry about prison violence .
There is very little chance that you will be killed or even stabbed .
But , if something does happen and you need to defend your good name , be a man and do it .
In prison , your good name is all you have .
If trouble comes your way in prison , you have to deal with it on the spot .
Where are you going to run ?
You 're in a cage .
Inmates and Convicts
During my years in prison I have found that there are two types of prisoners  inmates and convicts .
Inmates will not fight if their lives depend on it and they will kiss any ass that comes their way .
Inmates are the type of prisoners who go on national TV to praise prison officials and prison programs for straightening out their miserable lives .
The inmate has no loyalty to anything or anyone except himself .
Inmates will do anything to please their captors and cheerfully inform and rat on other prisoners for breaking prison rules .
Inmates are not men .
Be aware that you can't always tell an inmate worm by his cover .
The biggest , baddest killer on the tier can be the biggest , snitch rat in the joint .
On the other hand , convicts used to be very common in U.S. prisons , but are now a dying breed .
A true convict would never rat on anyone , would take no disrespect , would fight when necessary and would be loyal and live by a code of honor .
Unlike an inmate , a convict is a man .
A convicted sex offender will never be considered a true convict by other prisoners , but you can live by your own code of honor in prison .
Never whine or complain about your wrongful conviction ; sniveling will only make you appear weak and make you a target .
Other prisoners do n't care about your innocence .
The prison hierarchy has you at the bottom of the prison barrel .
Your jacket is that of a sex offender but it 's up to you if you wear this degrading jacket .
You will find that the only prisoners who hang around the sex offender are other wide - eyed , scared , spineless sex offenders .
Even though prison is going to be very lonely for the innocent man convicted of a sex crime , you do n't want to befriend confessed sex offenders .
Also , stay away from the prison chapel .
For some strange reason , confessed sex offenders always find God in prison and carry their Bibles for all to see to show how repentant they are .
In short , even though no one convicted of a sex beef can be a true convict , you must strive to be one .
Talking About Your Conviction
You may think that if you do n't tell any of your fellow prisoners you were convicted of a sexual offense that no one will be the wiser and you wo n't be harassed .
You may think that you can tell people you 're a bank robber and even be a hero in prison .
Nice try , but lying about what you were convicted of will not work .
There are no secrets in prison , especially on why you are there .
You 're in prison now , and any possibility of privacy or keeping secrets is long gone .
Be honest when talking about your wrongful conviction and get ready to defend yourself if it becomes necessary .
All of the convicted sex offenders ( innocent or guilty ) whom I 've heard tell other prisoners that they were burglars or robbers in an effort to hide their convictions were eventually exposed .
If you lie about your conviction , you will be exposed .
Then , any attempts to claim innocence will not be believed and your prison time may get very tough .
Do n't advertise your wrongful conviction , or the facts of your supposed crime , but when asked why you 're in prison , be honest .
Although a convicted sex offender can never gain full respect in prison , I 've managed to gain some measure of respect by being truthful about why I am in prison , and fighting when necessary .
Sure , some punk may call me a " rape - o " behind my back , but no prisoner ever disrespects me face to face .
With so many innocent men being sent to prison these days on false accusations of rape and child abuse , the general prison population is starting to understand how widespread the sex crime witchhunt has become , and how many innocent men are now in prison due to false allegations .
False reports of rape and other sex crimes are so common that an innocent man wrongfully convicted of a sex crime will not be alone .
Prison Guards
The men and women who hold the key to your freedom ( the prison guards ) should be considered your enemy .
There is a reason that surveys on job status and job satisfaction often rate being a prison guard as the lowest job a person can hold .
No one respects prison guards , and they know it .
What kind of man or woman would want to examine body openings for contraband , turn keys , and stand around and do nothing for a living ?
Prison guards hate their jobs and blame prisoners for their unhappy and unfulfilled lives .
It takes no ambition , no talent , no drive , or any creativity to be a corrections officer .
Even police officers know this , and look down on the lowly prison guard .
Think about it .
Does any kid have dreams of being a corrections officer when he or she grows up ?
The Golden Rule to remember not only about prison guards , but about anyone that works inside the prison in which you are held captive , is to stay as far away from them as possible and avoid even talking to them unnecessarily .
Even if you happen to run across a prison guard who appears to be halfway human , do n't befriend him .
Every inmate whom I 've seen develop any type of friendship with any prison employee was , in the end , betrayed and shunned by other prisoners .
Do n't collaborate with anyone other than fellow prisoners while in prison .
Every prison official or staff member is your enemy .
Never forget that .
They will gladly shoot you in the back if they feel the need .
Do n't make eye contact with the people who work at the prison because if you avoid eye contact they will leave you alone .
The less contact you have with prison employees , the better off you will be .
In all my years in prison , I 've observed hundreds of prison guards and only a couple could be considered normal .
The typical male guard I have encountered is not someone you would consider a winner .
He is usually a skinny geek ( or is extremely overweight ) , is undereducated , has no ambition and is sadistic .
His idea of success is a monthly state paycheck , a trailer home , a 12 - pack of beer , and nightly TV .
The typical female prison guard is homosexual , physically unattractive , overweight , and more masculine than most male prison guards .
She 's mad at the world for not being born a man and she takes her penis envy out on prisoners .
I fully admit my dislike for prison guards because I am convinced that every prison guard in the U.S. has witnessed , encouraged , and / or participated in the torture or murder of prisoners .
Prison guards are cowards with a badge who are protected by the state and prison guard unions .
Your only allies in prison are other prisoners .
Never forget it .
Keeping Fit
One of the most important things to do while doing your prison time is to keep in the very best physical shape possible .
Every prison has a weight room , and I strongly suggest pumping iron .
Being in top shape not only feels good , but it 's good for your head and will help you think more clearly .
By working out , running , exercising , and eating as well as possible , you will be physically able to defend yourself in case of any violent situations .
You will also be able to think straight to combat your unjust conviction .
All the guys whom I 've seen go insane in prison did not care about their health .
They rotted in front of a TV for years until they were just a shell of a man .
At age thirty - five , I am now in the best shape of my life and feel great .
Another reason to stay healthy in prison is that medical services are notoriously horrid .
One of my worst prison experiences was when our prison doctor told me that blood tests indicated that I had liver cancer .
He smiled gleefully as he told me I had only a year to live .
I tried to learn more , but he refused to answer my questions and ordered me out of his office .
For months I thought I was going to leave this mad house on a slab .
I learned later that my blood test indicated only that I had been exposed to hepatitis in the past .
The good prison doctor told me I was dying for his own sick amusement .
Dental services are just as bad in prison .
I 'm currently waiting to have a back molar filled .
I cracked my tooth on a rock in some chili in the chow hall .
I 've been on the waiting list to see the dentist for over six months now , and will probably lose the tooth due to neglect .
There is nothing I can do about it .
While in prison , stay in shape , work out , run , and try to eat well  even though that 's nearly impossible with the garbage that passes for food in prison .
But , although you may get depressed , lonely , and frustrated in prison , never go to the prison psychologist .
Prison shrinks only want to drug prisoners into submission .
One of the newest fads in corrections is tranquilizers that are given out like candy to pacify and control inmates .
What better way to turn prisoners into submissive zombies than by medicating them for depression and anxiety .
Do n't fall into the medication trap in prison .
You need to be clear - headed while doing time , not in a drugged - out haze .
When you go to prison , settle down and find a positive routine .
After the shock of prison wears off , and the other prisoners figure out you will defend yourself , you 'll be left alone to do your time .
Do n't sit around vegetating in front of a TV , playing cards or reading westerns .
Do n't waste your time complaining about your wrongful conviction and what a poor victim you are .
Do n't turn into what I call a " prison zombie " who does his time like he 's waiting to die .
Your main mission in prison will be trying to get your unjust conviction overturned .
Learn as much about the law and the corrupt legal system as you can .
Get to know the prisoner law clerks in the law library , and spend as much time in the library as possible .
Study every aspect of your case , and stay on top of your attorney .
Your lawyer is not the one in prison , you are .
The appeals process takes years .
Prisoners rarely win a new trial because the criminal justice system is not about truth and justice , but you can't win if you do n't try .
Fighting the legal system will be frustrating and depressing , but try not to give up hope .
Not only do we prisoners have to stick together , but we men must also join forces in our fight against feminism .
Become a soldier in the Men's Rights Fight .
Contact the antifeminist , pro-family men's groups in your area , as well as some of the national groups .
Sex Offender Treatment
One of the most profitable scams in the prison behavioral modification business is the sex - offender treatment industry .
Because you were convicted of a sex offense , you are now fuel for the sex - offender treatment profiteers .
You will be expected to confess to your crime , end all appeals for a fair trial , dismiss all delusions of innocence , and participate in sex - offender treatment along with admitted child molesters and serial rapists .
Confession is the main tenet of sex - offender treatment .
It does not matter to prison officials that you have always maintained your innocence and are in the process of appeal .
Thousands of people work in the sex - offender treatment industry and to justify their high - paying state jobs you must confess to your offense .
You are the meal ticket not only of prison guards but also sex - offender treatment providers .
As a wrongly convicted prisoner , you should have nothing to do with sex - offender treatment .
Be a man , and stand up for what is right .
There will be repercussions for you for not confessing and becoming another admitted sex offender .
You will be denied any good - time off your prison term and early parole will be out of the question .
I have always refused to even speak to sex - offender treatment counselors .
Not only have I been denied any time off my sentence for good behavior , but the Oregon Parole Board has labeled me mentally unfit and dangerous to society because I refuse to confess , show remorse , and beg for forgiveness .
Not only should you avoid sex - offender treatment , but I suggest you refuse to participate in any behavior modification programs in prison .
Do n't admit anything to prison officials or prison counselors .
Those who work in the behavior modification industry behind prison walls will use anything you tell them against you .
Tell them nothing about your past .
Prison counselors are not your friends .
Never talk to any prison psychologist .
There is no faster way to be labeled mentally and emotionally unfit than to trust a prison psychologist .
As a convicted sex offender , innocent or not , you are the bread and butter of the sex - offender treatment industry , prison counselors / psychologists , and prison guards .
The only way they can justify their jobs is to keep you in their prison programs as long as possible .
Be aware of their true motives , do n't trust them , tell them nothing , and never doubt yourself .
You owe them nothing .
You are an innocent man in prison .
Act like one , and good luck my friend .

The pop singer Morrissey claims he can no longer live in a Britain he believes lost to an " immigration explosion " .
The former frontman of the Smiths , who is now based in Rome , claimed England was just ' a memory now ' .
The 48 - year - old added : " Other countries have held on to their basic identity yet it seems to me that England was thrown away .
Scroll down for more ...
" The change in England is so rapid compared to the change in any other country .
" If you walk through Knightsbridge on any bland day of the week you wo n't hear an English accent .
" You 'll hear every accent under the sun apart from the British accent .
" The British identity is very attractive , I grew up into it and I find it quaint and very amusing . "
Morrissey , who has sung of his love for English culture and can count Tory leader David Cameron as a fan , is the son of an Irish immigrant family which settled in Manchester .
Scroll down for more ...
In 1986 , when The Smiths released their critically - acclaimed album The Queen is Dead , the UK had a population of 56 million .
It now stands at 60 million and some predict that could almost double by
2081 .
Morrissey 's comments were made in interviews with the music magazine NME .
In the mid-1990s he was accused of racism after wearing a Union Jack on stage and releasing the songs Bengali in Platforms and the ironically - named National Front Disco .
The singer 's supporters insisted he had been seeking only to reclaim the flag from extremists .
Tim Jonze , the reporter who conducted the interview , said : " Morrissey has had a stormy relationship with this magazine and its readers over the last three decades .
" He might once have been the voice of a generation but given his comments in these two interviews , he 's certainly not speaking for us now . "
Recent polls , however , have shown Le Pen winning between 13 percent and 14 percent in a presidential election .
He has built a national organization with dozens of local offices all across France ; a substantial number of National Front members have already been elected to municipal and regional government councils .
In southern cities , where there exists a potentially explosive combination of large Arab communities and French returnees from the former North African colonies , National Front candidates got as much as a third of the popular vote in the legislative balloting in March 1986 .
In those elections , Le Pen led a group of 35 of his party 's members to seats in the French National Assembly .
The most important factor of the Le Pen phenemonon may well be that the other conservative parties are already worrying that they will not be able to win in next year 's presidential elections - thereby achieving their cherished objective of dislodging the Socialists - without Le Pen 's help , an alliance they have refused to consider in the past .
In the southern city of Grasse , the Mayor , Herve de Fontmichel , was re-elected this summer when he entered into an alliance with National Front members of his city council - prompting his expulsion from the small , centrist Radical Party he had belonged to for most of his career .
Other areas are likely to see the same arrangement .
And so , when one of Le Pen 's closest associates in the National Front , Jean - Pierre Stirbois , told summer audiences that '' every major political figure in France is now forced to define himself in relationship to Jean - Marie Le Pen , '' few stood up to dispute the assertion .
' ' I do n't think that the National Front in itself is the real danger , because , in one form or another , the tendency it represents has always existed in French society , '' said Jean - Francois Kahn , editor of L'Evenement du Jeudi , a leftist weekly magazine strongly opposed to Le Pen .
'' The real danger is that the classic conservative parties will ally themselves with the National Front , that Le Pen will make a conquest of the classic right from the inside . ''
WHO IS THIS stout , ruddy , roustabout with a glass eye ( replacing an earlier pirate 's black eyepatch ) who called one journalistic critic a ' ' stinking hyena ' ' and who foments the message that France is threatened with extinction and only he can save it ?
The words commonly heard in France to describe Le Pen include protofascist , totalitarian , extreme rightist and , most frequently , racist .
Le Pen himself has , of course , his own view .
Sitting quietly in the backyard of his ancestral home in Brittany , where sky - blue hydrangea flourish against the bright whitewashed exterior of a centuries - old mariner 's home , he comes across as something of an intellectual .
Yet he speaks in blunt , colorful language very different from the refined parlor talk of most of the members of the French political class , who , he claims , are out of touch with the everyday reality of their country .
Le Pen portrays himself as a misunderstood man , the victim of a ' ' witchhunt ' ' carried out by his enemies in the press .
'' People who are frightened by me are those who have created their own phantom , like people who carve a monster 's face out of a pumpkin , put a candle inside it , and are then scared by their own creation when they see it glowing outside of their houses , '' he said .
'' They have created a Jean - Marie Le Pen that has nothing to do with the real Jean - Marie Le Pen . ''
He cites an example , that of the journalist who claimed to be frightened not by what Le Pen says but by what he does not say , implying that his language is a coded incitement to racial hatred .
'' You can use that technique against anybody , '' Le Pen said .
'' There 's a facile sort of dialectic by which people who disagree with me automatically make the connection with Auschwitz .
I totally reject that method of reasoning .
Nazism is at the very antipode of what we represent . ''
( '' Whenever the television is here , '' he told an appreciative audience in La Baule , on the Breton Coast , raising the specter of the accusatory press , '' the cameras are attracted immediately to the only shaved head in the hall , even if there are 10,000 other heads that are not shaved .
And the suggestion is that behind that single shaved skull among my supporters are harbored I do not know what sorts of dictatorial machinations .
And so , if the actual discourse of Le Pen appears too moderate , if it seems to be actually reasonable , then at least the television has a shaved skull to broadcast to show that Le Pen could not be these things . '')
According to Le Pen , the National Front represents the true classic right in France , where , he says , the conservative parties from de Gaulle onward have carried out '' leftist policies ' ' even as they have held to a rightist vocabulary .
He accuses the established parties of being rife with '' sclerotic privileges ' ' paid for by the taxpayers .
'' Moliere 's miser , '' he said , referring to the play , '' hoarded money , but it was his own money .
The minister of finance hoards the money that the French have labored to produce . ''

The IFPI 's solution ?
Sort it out at the internet service provider level .
" ISP cooperation , via systematic disconnection of infringers and the use of filtering technologies , is the most effective way copyright theft can be controlled .
Independent estimates say up to 80 per cent of ISP traffic comprises distribution of copyright - infringing files . "
You know what I say ?
Damn right .
Let 's get ISPs to stop copyright infringement .
But , um , music people ?
Better form an orderly queue .
You think you were the first to suffer from your content getting ripped off and spread to the four corners of the earth ?
Get to the back of the line , bud .
There 's a few people ahead of you .
Let me introduce , first , the newspaper industry .
We were probably among the very first to realise that the digital medium would be incredibly important in the future , and so we put lots of our content online .
Well , more than just the content - almost every newspaper also has blogs , and reader comments , and pieces by journalists that do n't appear in the print edition ( such as this one ) .
Article sharing
And you know what ?
People copy them .
They copy - and - paste entire articles from online newspapers to blog sites or to their own computer and they do n't pay a thing .
Then they read them or " share " them with other people who they might not even have met .
I guarantee you that the minute this piece goes onto the Guardian site , a zillion spam blogs will copy its precis and put it on their sites , pretending it 's their own .
It 's choking our investment in new journalism , believe me .
In the past 10 years , hundreds - probably thousands - of journalists have been thrown out of jobs as newspapers and magazines have downsized .
Do n't give me all that guff about a structural change in the industry , or tell me that the magazine Business 2.0 closed because it did n't give people enough celebrity exposés .
No , we the print newspaper industry demand that ISPs stop people sharing our content over the internet .
In fact , why not a " reading tax " on ISPs ?
The more of its customers visit a newspaper site , the more tax it should pay .
Next , pornography .
You know , there used to be tons of top - shelf magazines , all earning a comfortable living .
Then you know what ?
The damn internet came along and at a stroke destroyed their business model , in which shifty - gazed commuters had to go into insalubrious shops to get " content " .
Now there are loads of internet sites ( Google reliably tells me ) where you can get free amateur porn - exactly the same sort of stuff that people used to pay for !
It 's shocking ( and what 's more , there are no unsightly staples in the middle of the pictures ) .
Unlicensed pornography trading has put paid to some of the best - known names in the industry .
Name any porn magazine that is n't 75 % thinner now and filled with ads in the back for internet sites .
This can not be allowed to go on .
Once again , ISPs bear a heavy responsibility for propelling big porn empires and small corner shops with dimly lit corners - not to mention the makers of high shelves - into penury .
Broken central locking
Next up are motor mechanics .
I know - you 're wondering how people swap cars over the internet ?
Tch !
Do n't be so literal .
What we 're talking about is people swapping information , the very lifeblood of the motor mechanic .
Because remember , these are people whose income depends on being the only ones in a locality who have the time and knowledge to fix cars .
Newsgroups - those discussion forums that pre-date pretty much everything that happened after 1999 - are the prime offenders .
Take this example of someone brazenly offering a fix for broken central locking in a Vauxhall Zafira .
Shameless !
Any ISP should be embarrassed to even let it pass over its modems : quite simply , it 's taking the food from someone 's mouth .
You want me to carry on ?
There 's needlepoint , which in 2000 was revealed to be reeling from an assault by grandmothers and others sending each other needlepoint patterns via email .
Oh , the humanity !
And of course there are games companies like Nintendo , which had to suffer people swapping their consoles ' ROMs over the net .
You can imagine how damaged Nintendo was by that .
It 's never been the same .
It crawled away to sob in a hole and close up shop - am I right ?
So before the IFPI gets ISPs to start inspecting the packets passing through their routers for music , they 'd better sort it out first so that ISPs can see and stop it when someone is copying newspaper articles , or pornographic content , or reading suspiciously helpful newsgroups , or sending a needlepoint pattern that they might not have invented , or downloading a ROM sequence for a now - outdated console .
Then we 'll be ready to listen to the music industry .
Alternatively , of course , we could try to adapt to the world as it is , rather than dreaming of what it used to be .
But hell , where are the headlines in that ?
I love fast cars .
Enter the Audi R8 supercar .
OMFG .
I get a massive amount of e-mail — almost 300 per hour at one point during major media — which is why I outsourced my inbox in the first place to virtual assistants .
Sometimes , though , comes a snort - worthy e-mail — a zinger exciting enough to make me choke and spurt morning coffee out of my nose like a fire - breathing dragon ( not recommended ) .
Here is one of them , received last week , from James Tate of Traction magazine :
“ I ’ve got a gray six - speed Audi R8 booked from the 28th through the 4th of Feb . and can do any of those dates .
Any chance you ’ll be in town ? ”
…
The Audi R8 – The supercar the US market is still waiting for .
Let me keep this simple .
I ’m not a car person and do n’t expect you to be .
I just do n’t care about most cars .
BUT , there are a few cars that put me in an odd state of 200 + mph-induced euphoria .
I am a racer at heart .
James ’ e-mail had good timing , as I had just read a review of the R8 as the best Audi ever built .
More convincing still , the reviewer reported that it was the first car of the dozens he ’d reviewed to make his wife and all the women who rode in it drool like blubbering fan boys .
WTF was going on ?
That ’s not supposed to happen .
It would be like a bunch of men crying while watching Whale Rider .
[ Postscript : OK , I did , but only the scene where she ’s reciting the story for her grandfather …
Man , that ’s a rough one . ]
This was the car I wanted to drive .
Due to massive pre-orders and other factors , the Audi R8 supercar is n’t even available in the US until April or summer of 2008 .
Its 420 HP of power is transferred to all - wheel drive and its design , based on the Lamborghini Gallardo , allows you to drift and do all manner of things impossible in normal street cars .
“ So let me get this straight , ” I wrote .
“ I get to drive the machine at faster than 25 mph ? ”
Here ’s the sequence , leaving out the parts that would get me a nice sit down with fine gents in uniform …
Magnetic suspension and introduction of the R8 .
First acceleration test .
Second acceleration test .
Smoother than butter at triple digits within a 1 / 4 mile — I can only assume , of course 🙂
For more shots of the test day , check out Flickr .
I suspect this will not be the last time you see me in an R8 .
If you like speed and the feeling of commanding the road ( not to mention the ego - driven but still fun experience of having EVERYONE gawk at the car ) , I recommend you take this one - of - a - kind dream machine for spin .
Just put yourself on the waiting list and be forewarned … mixing testosterone with this Audi could be hazardous to your bank account .

For tips from our Medical co-author on recognizing implantation symptoms , read on !
An Italian urologist and high - heel enthusiast has caused a stir , by claiming that the shoes improve women ’s sex lives , by putting the pelvic floor muscles in the optimum position .
Dr Maria Cerruto , who the BBC describes as a “ self - professed lover of the sexy shoe ” , has apparently been on a mission to prove high heels are not bad for women ’s health after all .
Of course , this is something of a difficult one to prove – you only have to speak to an actual woman who has worn heels to figure out that they are deeply uncomfortable , at least until you train your feet to happily accept the pain .
And they have long been linked to all sorts of foot problems .
Check out this colour x-ray of a woman ’s foot in high heels for more information .
But setting aside the pros and cons of this type of footwear , let ’s unpack this story a tiny bit .
First we have Dr Cerruto herself .
She is a urologist .
Not a foot specialist .
A urologist .
I ca n’t help but wonder if matters foot - related are bit outside her field of reference , as is the task of balancing any potential benefit with the damage done to toes in the meantime .
Let ’s look at the study she carried out :
She said her study of 66 women under 50 found that those who held their foot at a 15 degree angle to the ground – the equivalent of a two inch heel – had as good posture as those who wore flat shoes , and crucially showed less electrical activity in their pelvic muscles .
This suggested the muscles were at an optimum position , which could well improve their strength and ability to contract .
I do n’t know much about pelvic muscles , but does n’t this stuff about “ electrical activity ” sound a bit weird ?
I do n’t remember hearing much about getting your calf muscle , or your bicep in the correct position to exercise it based on electrical activity .
I ’m no scientist of course , but does this seem wacky to anyone else ?
[ edit : not weird , apparently !
Reader Cara points out : “ What she is describing is measuring the electrical activity of the muscles ; a legitimate scientific technique indicating how hard the
muscles are working ( as you say , i.e. the muscles were in the optimum position ) .
However , you are correct that ‘ in the optimum position ’ is not the same thing as toning . ” ]
Regardless , what she found seems to be that high heels might put your pelvic floor muscles in a good place , * not* actually exercise them .
In other words , wearing painful shoes is no substitute for actual things you can do to increase the amount of sexy fun you are having .
The BBC quotes another expert , who puts it like this :
Gill Brook , a women ’s health physiotherapist in Bradford , stressed the findings did not suggest that stilettos were a good thing for those keen on improving their pelvic floor function .
“ But for women who like a slightly higher heel , these are reassuring findings – although we have n’t yet done away with the need for regular exercises to maintain what is such an important part of the female body . ”
In addition , this is all based on a letter to a urology journal .
As in , she does n’t seem to have submitted an article for peer review .
So the question remains – why so much excitement about it in the BBC news room ?
Could it be because a ) it justifies the use of high heels and b ) it links a shoe that is meant to intrinsically make women look sexier with an actual increase in sexual performance ?
Does anyone else find that a bit… creepy ?

As we observe the slow and increasingly certain disintegration of Pakistan , we should force ourselves to confront an uncomfortable fact : events in Pakistan are to a large degree side effects of our war in Afghanistan .
The Jan. 12 Washington
Times headline was " Pentagon Spies al - Qaeda in Pakistan , " as if this were somehow news .
It quotes the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman , Adm. Michael Mullen , as saying , " There are concerns now about how much [ al - Qaeda ] turned inward , literally , inside Pakistan so [ the Pentagon is ] extremely , extremely concerned about that . "
One can only respond , quelle surprise !
Of course al - Qaeda turned inward inside Pakistan .
First , Pakistan is strategically a vastly more important prize than Afghanistan or Iraq could ever be .
Second , when guerillas are put under pressure in one place , they go somewhere else .
Third , we have allowed ourselves to be put in the position of fighting the Pashtun in Afghanistan , and there are lots of Pashtun in Pakistan .
War with the Pashtun is war with the Pashtun , to whom borders drawn in London mean nothing .
Our attempt to contain the damage in Pakistan instead set the wreckage on fire .
We forced our friendly local dictator , General / President Musharraf , to line up publicly with George Bush , to the point where his local nickname is " Busharraf . "
It is not intended as a compliment .
Worse , we pressured him into sending the Pakistani army into the Northwest Tribal Territories , where it has gotten its backside kicked at the same time that it has brought more tribesmen into the fight .
Defeat plus destabilization plus de-legitimatization , most of it American - inspired , has left Pakistan ’s government teetering on the edge of disintegration , with a real danger that the disintegration could spread beyond the regime to the Pakistani state itself .
Not content with mere disaster , the Bush administration ( " Blunders Are Us " ) wants to put out the fire it set by pouring gasoline on it .
A story in the Jan. 6 Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that " President Bush ’s senior national security advisers [ Larry , Curly , and Moe ? ] are debating whether to expand the authority of the CIA and the military to conduct far more aggressive covert operations in the tribal areas of Pakistan . "
Pakistan has publicly said no , but that wo n’t stop the Bushies .
If the tribesmen soon have American captives to display , what little is left of Musharraf ’s legitimacy will be beheaded along with them .
Again , the point to remember is that most of this is a side effect of the war in Afghanistan .
Why is this important ?
Because it reminds us that the ill effects of bad strategy tend to spread .
The bad strategy is invading , occupying and attempting to transform countries whose culture is vastly different from our own .
That is the essence of the neocons ’ neo -Trotskyite vision of the world revolution , which the Bush administration has made its own .
Nor is George W. Bush the neocons ’ only dupe : the same poisonous nonsense flows in the speeches of most of the presidential candidates , from Obama on the Left to McCain ( nominally ) on the Right .
Only Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich have dared suggest we might serve ourselves better by minding our own business .
In statecraft as in war , side effects can prove fatal .
If Pakistan collapses , turning into another stateless happy hunting ground for al - Qaeda and numberless other Islamic 4GW organizations , our position in Afghanistan will quickly become unsustainable .
Our grand strategic position in the whole Middle Eastern / Southwest Asian region will be reduced to a two - legged stool , not the most stable of platforms .
Osama in his cave will be distinctly more comfortable than W. in the Oval Office .
How will the Bush administration respond to such a cascade of unfortunate events ?
By doing what it plans to do anyway : bomb Iran .

Call of the wild : A starling
Birds are becoming more musical after having their brains altered by gender - bending chemicals released into the environment , research shows .
Scientists say they have the first hard proof that female hormones from the contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy are finding their way into the food chain and dramatically changing the behaviour of birds in the wild .
They found male starlings exposed to oestrogen spent more time singing and sang more complex songs than other male starlings .
The Cardiff University team looked at the effect of the pollutants on starlings foraging for earthworms at a sewage treatment works in the South - West of England .
Starlings ' songs form a key part of their mating ritual .
To their surprise , Dr Katherine Buchanan and colleagues found that female starlings preferred the more elaborate songs of the " feminised " male birds exposed to the hormone .
They discovered that the region of the brain that controls songs in starlings - the " high vocal centre " - was much bigger in contaminated birds .
Their study , reported in the journal Public Library of Science One , did not look at the effect of the oestrogen on the birds ' fertility .
Past studies have shown that oestrogen in sewage outlets is changing the sex of fish and causing males to produce eggs .
( AP ) CARLISLE , Pa. - Barflies , forget having to talk your troubles over with a bartender .
A pastor plans to put teams of chaplains in local bars in this central Pennsylvania town so they can lend a sympathetic ear to patrons who may need one .
The chaplains wo n’t preach against drinking or evangelize when the program starts at Market Cross Pub , organizer Chuck Kish said .
" We ’re simply going to be there to help anybody who wants it .
Sometimes people really just want somebody they can talk to who is not going to be judgmental , but be sympathetic , " he said .
" Some people may think this would be a strange place to find a chaplain .
But we need to go where the people are , " said Kish , a 44 - year - old senior pastor at the Bethel Assembly of God in Carlisle , southwest of Harrisburg .
Chaplains will work in teams , one male and one female , and will be in the bar for about three hours on the first Friday of every month , he said .
The program is slated to start next month at one pub , with the hope it will be expanded .
Market Cross Pub owner Jeff Goss said he did a double - take when Kish first approached him .
" I thought , a chaplain in a restaurant and bar ?
And then I thought , that makes sense , " Goss said .
Bartender Liz Horn said she ’d have no problem referring a customer to a chaplain .
" Sometimes a bar is a place where people go when they ’re down , " she said .

The Man Who Found Zen - The Story of Sedona Method
First off , I would like to make it clear that this post is NOT to impress you , but to impress upon you what ’s possible !
This is a quick review on how I went from one of my worst years of making money online to my best year , and all it took was one big idea , one web site and several hundred hours of effort along with many sleepless nights .
This is “ How I Made $ 860,538.38 Profit in 4 Months ! “ .
MARKETING EXPERIENCE & RIDING THE WAVES :
Time and time again , I talk about how you must change your marketing niche every once in a while to continuously make new money online .
Over the years I have done everything from content web sites , to sweepstakes and freebie type sites , to running my own affiliate programs and even permission based email marketing .
In early 2004 I had one of my best years with making money online , then later on in the year things started to slack off and this continued on through most of 2005 .
At the time I was n’t making much money and it was quite depressing .
It ’s very tough to get back into the groove when you hit a few underachieving projects in a row .
In short , I was in a dip … and at the bottom of my latest successful wave .
It was n’t until October 2005 that I came up with my next big idea that would soon bring me my best months and year !
FIND A NEW IDEA & TAKE CONTROL OF IT !
Social networking was just starting to catch fire and for months I knew there was a way to profit from it , but I just had n’t come up with an idea yet .
MySpace had millions of users on their network 24 hours a day , there had to be a way to take advantage of this .
Soon enough I realized , instead of trying to sell to all of these users , why not offer them something for free .
I ran through some ideas and came up with my own site to provide free content for social network users .
To make a long story short , my site and my content went viral extremely fast .
Instead of having users upload their own content or have to search around for what they were looking for , I provided everything for free .
In no time I was receiving thousands of users to my site daily .
At max points I was pushing up to 180,000 + unique visitors per day , while pushing TERABYTES of data bandwidth .
Imagine hosting thousands of images , viewed by millions across several different social networks !
MANAGEMENT OF MASSIVE GROWTH :
Just two months after going live with my new site , I was starting to accumulate some amazing hosting costs .
Imagine the cost on hosting thousands of widgets , text applications and images , which are loaded millions of times a day across social networks like MySpace !
The only reason why I was able to afford these insane hosting costs , was because of the massive volume of users I was receiving back to my site , not only through social networks , but also from Google and other search engines .
You only need a small percentage of a very big number to click on ads , fill out surveys or take any action , to make money .
In two short months I went from having a single dedicated server to having over TEN , then with the insane bandwidth costs added in I was paying up to $ 12,000 a month .
At this time I was currently with EV1 Servers.net , and leasing all of my servers .
Since I ’m not a tech / programmer type guy , I also had a server management team watching my servers constantly to make sure they were always running , just being down for a few minutes would have lost $ 100s of dollars .
This server management team was not part of EV1 Servers , and cost $ 1000 a month to manage all of the servers , and keep the servers balancers in place .
By the end of the third month , I talked with my server management team and we decided it was time to for me to invest in my own servers and take out the middleman for hosting .
I went on to order 17 servers from Dell , which are all held and managed in a data center now .
MONETIZATION IS KEY :
On average , my site was receiving around 100,000 unique visitors per day , and I was generating most of my ad revenue through Yahoo Publisher Network , ValueClick Media and CasaleMedia .
It was n’t until a year later that I would start testing CPA offers on the site .
To my surprise , the CPA offers from networks like NeverBlueAds worked extremely well .
Originally I had stayed away from promoting a few of their offers because I thought they were over saturated and would n’t convert .
I finally took their advice and listed a few on the site and to this day they are still pushing some great earnings through the site .
TO EXPAND , SELL OR STAY THE SAME :
Back in April , I wrote a post asking the question …
“ To Sell , or Not to Sell ? “ …
This was a question I had to ask myself when I was approached by a company that wanted to merge / purchase my MySpace resource site .
I not only turned down their seven - figure deal , but I was lucky enough to not be one of the many sites screwed by the company , as they tried buying many other sites as well .
Once acquired by the company , they would wreck the site with adult - like video content and I heard from several people on how they got screwed out of their owed money and contracts .
SUCCESS IS FOUND :
Two years , and over seven - figures later … my little site idea that rapidly became one of my most profitable ideas yet , is still running strong .
Despite the fact that I really have n’t touched the site in several months , it ’s still receiving over 25,000 uniques per day and still making a decent amount of change .
— — — — — —— ——
EARNINGS DETAILS :
As I mentioned earlier , three of the main initial revenue sources I monetized my site with were ValueClick Media , CasaleMedia and Yahoo Publisher Network .
While I did use other programs such as NeverBlueAds and Google Adsense later on , these three programs were heavily used during months of peak traffic .
As for promotion costs of the site , during this three month period , there were none .
No PPC Advertising either , everything was viral traffic and a couple links off my other sites .
This write up focused on how I made $ 860,538.38 PROFIT in 4 months .
The site is now well over two years old and has since earned over seven figures in profit / earnings .
ValueClick Media is a company that buys your web site advertising space on a CPM basis .
From my stats chart below , you can see the monthly increase in revenue went from $ 243.63 to nearly $ 30,000 a month .
CasaleMedia provides the same type of service as ValueClick Media , but are more strict with acceptance into their program .
They also have higher CPM rates , but usually purchase a smaller percentage of your ad space .
Peak earnings with CasaleMedia were around $ 7,000 a month .
One of the major reasons for my dramatic increase in income , was due to the release of the Yahoo Publisher Network .
This program , run by Yahoo , is basically their response to Google Adsense .
Like Adsense , you are paid an unknown percentage for each click you send to the contextual advertisements displayed on your site .
It was n’t til about a year after launching the site , that I would start testing with CPA offers from NeverBlue .
To my surprise , the majority of offers I listed on the site performed extremely well .
Even though I thought the market was over saturated on these offers , there was still a high demand .
With the new revenue generated from NeverBlue , the site was able to pull in another $ 60,000 + .
For any of the doubters , or photoshop addicts …
Just to prove my legitimacy , take a look at the video below !
東京大学大学院情報理工学系研究科の竹内郁雄教授のグループは、SunのTim Bray氏（Webテクノロジディレクタ）とJRubyチームのメンバと共同で、RubyとJRubyの両方におけるマルチ仮想マシン（multiple virtual machine ：MVM）環境の実装を行う。MVM環境により、これまでよりももっと効率的にRubyのプログラムを実行できるようになることが期待されている。研究の成果は、より大きなRuby開発者のコミュニティによってオープンソースとなる予定であり、さらなる技術革新が進むだろう。
これまでは 、Rubyで１つ以上のアプリケーションを同時に実行するためには複数のインタプリタが必要であり、そのため必要以上のメモリが消費されていた。計画されているMVM環境では、ただ１つのインタプリタ上に複数のVMを生成することができ、もっと効率的にアプリケーションを実行できるようになるだろう。この共同研究では、MVMを利用するための共通インタフェース定義、VMインスタンスの並列化やメモリの共有などの、技術的な問題を明らかにし、そしてRubyやJRubyで利用できる技術を実装することを目標としている。
Rubyはすでに広く商用その他の環境で使われているが、MVMの研究はRubyの性能や実用性をよりいっそう向上させるだろう。
Deep within the bowels of the FBI translation program are contained many dark secrets .
If the Bush Administration and the Democratic Congress have their way , many of these painful truths will never see the light of public scrutiny .
Some come in the form of transcripts of wiretapped conversations that reveal U.S. officials are willing to sell nuclear secrets for cold , hard cash to untrustworthy allies .
So says FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , in an explosive new interview with the The Times ( U.K. ) .
In the story , Edmonds claims “ she heard evidence that one well - known senior official in the US State Department was being paid by Turkish agents in Washington who were selling the information on to black market buyers , including Pakistan . ”
The article goes on to say :
The Turks and Israelis had planted “ moles ” in military and academic institutions which handled nuclear technology .
Edmonds says there were several transactions of nuclear material every month , with the Pakistanis being among the eventual buyers .
“ The network appeared to be obtaining information from every nuclear agency in the United States , ” she said .
The Times article does not name the high - level State Department official who is alleged to have sold out his country to Turkey and Pakistan .
However , to those who have paid close attention to the Edmonds case , there is little doubt that she is referring to Mark Grossman , currently an associate of the Cohen Group .
Grossman , former Ambassador to Turkey under President Clinton and Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs under President Bush , has been named repeatedly by Edmonds in interviews as someone “ very important ” to her case .
The fact that any indiscretions Grossman may be accused of occurred during both a Democratic and a Republican Administration may explain why neither political party has aggressively tried to pursue Edmonds claims .
If the charges are true , the unnamed State Department official , whoever he or she is , may be guilty of more than leaking secrets to a trusted ally ; cash payments may have been involved as well .
Edmonds apparently told the Times that “ in one conversation Edmonds heard the official arranging to pick up a $ 15,000 cash bribe ” .
It is not clear whether there is proof any cash payments ever took place , yet the charge is damning .
Grossman , besides being a former policymaker at State , is known publicly as Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald ’s first witness in the Scooter Libby trial .
Libby was accused of perjury in the investigation of former CIA operative Valerie Plame , who was part of a CIA front company monitoring the global nuclear black market .
At least one story claimed Grossman himself had leaked the identity of Plame ’s front company , Brewster - Jennings , to Turkish agents in June , 2001 .
Though the story was never picked up by the mainstream media , if true , it would lead credence to the idea that the Brewster Jennings operation had already been compromised before the retaliation against Plame ’s wife , former Ambassador Joe Wilson , by members of the Bush Administration .
Grossman is also being subpoenaed by the defense in the AIPAC espionage trial , along with several other officials who may have passed classified information to the powerful Israel - connected lobby group .

The Global Flat Tax Revolution :
Lessons for Policy Makers
Thanks largely to tax competition , governments are dramatically improving tax policy .
Over the past 30 years , tax rates on productive activity have been sharply reduced .
Personal and corporate income tax rates have been slashed .
Capital gains tax rates , wealth taxes , and death taxes have been lowered or eliminated .
These pro-growth reforms have boosted the global economy , lowered poverty , and improved living standards .
Perhaps the most exciting development , though , is the flat tax revolution .
The number will probably be higher by the time you are reading this , but as this article went to press , 24 nations have adopted some form of single - rate tax regime .
These reforms have generated impressive results , including faster growth , more jobs , and increased competitiveness .
While politicians generally are most concerned about losing tax revenue , they should not worry .
Flat tax systems oftentimes generate higher tax revenues because of more income and better compliance .
The economic consequences of tax reform are positive , but the political implications also are profound .
Governments are deciding – in part because labor and capital can cross national borders to escape punitive tax rates – that it no longer makes sense to discriminate against highly - productive taxpayers .
Thanks to tax competition , expect the number of flat tax countries to continue to grow .
By Daniel J. Mitchell
Thirty years ago , the average top personal income tax rate in industrialized nations was more than 65 percent , and the average corporate tax rate was nearly 50 percent .
Double taxation of dividends and capital gains was ubiquitous , and most nations taxed income a third time with either death taxes or wealth taxes - or sometimes even both .
Not surprisingly , economic stagnation was common , and policy debates focused on how to divide a shrinking pie .
Today , the world of fiscal policy is profoundly different .
Beginning with “ radical ” reforms implemented by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan , governments across the globe have been racing to lower tax rates on productive behavior .
Personal and corporate income tax rates have been dramatically reduced , and the tax burden on saving and investment has been lowered .
In a growing number of nations , the debate now is focused on fundamental tax reform .
A fiscal revolution is taking place and 24 jurisdictions now have flat tax regimes ( Figure 1 ) .
The only question now seems to be is how many new nations will join the flat tax club with each passing year .
This flat tax revolution is changing the world .
Jurisdictions with the most aggressive and far - reaching single - rate tax systems , such as Estonia , Hong Kong , and Slovakia , are enjoying rapid economic growth .
Flat tax systems also are leading to more revenue in many cases , reaffirming the Laffer Curve notion that reasonable tax rates and strong economic growth are the best way to generate monies for government .
Perhaps most important , the flat tax revolution signifies a victory over the notion that the tax code should be used to penalize those who contribute most to economic growth .
The ultimate irony is that this revolution in both economic and moral attitudes is being led by nations in Central and Eastern Europe - countries that were part of the Communist Bloc less than two decades ago .
Thanks to tax competition , it is likely that the list of flat tax nations will continue to expand .
Because the geese that lay the golden eggs can more easily fly across the border , globalization is putting pressure on politicians to lower tax rates and reform tax systems .
Nations that adopt flat taxes are attracting jobs and capital from uncompetitive high - tax nations .
Perhaps after France relents and implements tax reform , a flat tax will even be adopted in the United States .
What is a Flat Tax ?
The pure flat tax system is based on the proposal put forth by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of Stanford University ’s Hoover Institution .
Hall and Rabushka brought the concept of the flat tax to national attention in a 1981 Wall Street Journal article and later in a 1983 book ( which has been updated ) .

Casual observers frequently associate flat tax plans with radical simplification , but postcard - sized tax returns are the potential result - not the cause - of the pro-growth components of a flat tax .
These positive features include :
A Single Flat Rate .
The flat tax has a single rate , and the goal is to bring the rate down as low as possible , usually less than 20 percent .
The low , flat rate reduces penalties against productive behavior , such as work , risk taking , and entrepreneurship .

The flat tax eliminates provisions of the tax code that create tax advantages for certain behaviors and activities .
Getting rid of deductions , credits , exemptions , and other loopholes promotes growth both by allowing a low tax rate and by removing incentives to misallocate resources merely to reduce tax liability .

No Double Taxation .
Flat tax proposals are based on the principle that income should be taxed only one time .
This means no death tax , no wealth tax , no capital gains tax , no double taxation of saving , and no double tax on dividends .
Eliminating the tax code ’s bias against capital formation is conducive to job creation and capital formation .

Territorial Taxation .
The flat tax is based on the common - sense notion of “ territorial taxation , ” meaning that governments only tax income that is earned inside national borders .
Getting rid of “ worldwide taxation ” simplifies the tax system , promotes international comity , and enables taxpayers and companies to compete on a level playing field around the world .
The flat tax has other selling points , including transparency ( it is difficult to swap campaign cash for special tax breaks when the tax system is based on two postcards ) and generous personal allowances based on family size .
These features are politically important , but the economic benefits of fundamental reform result from the above factors - particularly the low tax rate on productive behavior and the end to tax code biases based on the source of income , use of income , or level of income .
The Flat Tax Sweeping the World
Single - rate tax systems have suddenly become very popular .
Up until 1994 , the only jurisdictions with flat tax systems were Hong Kong , two other ( very obscure ) British territories - Jersey and Guernsey , and Jamaica .
Today , by contrast , there are 24 flat tax systems .
With just a handful of exceptions , the new flat tax jurisdictions are former Soviet Republics or Soviet Bloc nations .
2
But Iceland ’s shift to a flat tax in 2007 is a key development since it shows that tax reform is possible in a mature and prosperous democracy .
The shift to flat taxes is dramatic .
For decades , critics said a flat tax was unrealistic and that Hong Kong was a special case .
They never explained why it was a special case , but supposedly a flat tax could not work anyplace else .
They made similar assertions after the Baltic nations adopted flat tax systems , but adapted their arguments to suggest that a flat tax only worked in small jurisdictions .
But then when Russia and other large Eastern European nations hopped on the flat tax bandwagon , opponents began to concede that flat tax regimes were feasible , but rationalized that tax reform worked only in transition economies .
Now that Iceland has a flat tax , one can only imagine the new excuses that will be used to argue the flat tax does not work or that it is impractical .
If imitation is the highest form of flattery , the flat tax certainly is getting lots of praise .
The flat tax revolution is especially remarkable because so many wanted to dismiss it as a fad .
Indeed , as recently as 2006 , an International Monetary Fund study boldly stated that , “ Looking forward , the question is not so much whether more countries will adopt a flat tax as whether those that have will move away from it . ” 3
Yet within months of the IMF study being released , as seen in Table 1 , several new nations were part of the flat tax club – and several more nations hopped on the flat tax bandwagon this year .
The international bureaucracy ’s powers of prediction certainly leave much to be desired , both because the study was wrong about whether more nations would adopt flat taxes , but also because the speculation about countries moving in the other direction proved false as well .
The durability of the flat tax is just one of several noteworthy observations about the flat tax revolution .
Nations are choosing low - rate flat taxes .
With the exception of Iceland , every flat tax adopted this decade has a tax rate of less than 20 percent .
This is important since the economic benefits of a flat tax are directly linked to the reduction in marginal tax rates on productive behavior .
In the mid-1990s , the Baltic flat taxes had rates ranging between 25 percent and 33 percent .
While these rates were much better than the confiscatory levies imposed by Western European nations , flat - tax rates above 25 percent are more likely to discourage work , saving , and investment than rates below 20 percent .

Tax rates are dropping .
Not only are new flat tax nations choosing low rates , nations that already have flat tax systems are reducing their rates .
Estonia has dropped its rate from 26 percent to 21 percent , and the rate is scheduled to fall to 18 percent by 2011 .
Lithuania ’s rate has fallen from 33 percent to 24 percent .
Macedonia ’s flat tax was just implemented at the low rate of 12 percent , but it already has dropped to 10 percent .
Montenegro ’s flat tax rate , meanwhile , will fall to 9 percent in 2010 - giving it the lowest flat tax rate in the world .

More nations are considering the flat tax .
The Czech Republic and Bulgaria are among the nations that just adopted the flat tax .
Mauritius also just joined the flat tax club .
Single - rate tax systems currently are being discussed in Poland and Hungary .
There is even a growing interest in flat tax systems in Western Europe – a debate that presumably will intensify because of tax competition .

No nation has returned to a so - called progressive tax .
Notwithstanding faulty analysis from the IMF , the flat tax seems to be remarkably resilient .
None of the flat tax nations have returned to a discriminatory rate structure .
The most recent threats to single - rate regimes came in Russia , where lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected a scheme to create a progressive system with a top rate of 30 percent .
5
More impressive , Slovakian voters in 2006 elected a coalition of socialists and nationalists , leading many to conclude that this did not bode well for the flat tax implemented by the outgoing government .
Yet Slovakia ’s new leaders decided not to tinker with the goose that was laying golden eggs and the flat tax seems securely enshrined .
6
While the flat tax has become very trendy , it is not a cure - all for every economic ill .
To maximize the economic benefits of tax reform , a nation should have the rule - of - law , property rights , sound money , limited government , and low levels of regulation .
In such an environment , a flat tax ensures that the tax code will not be an obstacle to growth .
In a nation such as Russia , however , a flat tax is going to have only limited success because people worried about arbitrary expropriation by the government are unlikely to feel confident about investing in the nation ’s future .
Likewise , the flat tax created for Iraq in 2004 is almost irrelevant to that country ’s economic prospects because of ongoing turmoil .
Leading Flat Tax Systems
Not all flat tax systems are created equal .
In some cases , such as Lithuania and Russia , there is a significant difference between the corporate rate ( which is higher in Russia ) and individual rate ( which is higher in Lithuania ) , creating artificial incentives to manipulate how income is received .
A gap in the rates is not a big issue if the difference is small and both rates are low - as in Hong Kong - but one of the goals of a flat tax is to encourage people to be productive without worrying about finding the best niche in the tax code .
Last but not least , many flat tax nations fail to achieve the important goal of taxing income only one time .
While all 24 flat tax jurisdictions have features worthy of attention , there are a handful of flat tax regimes that are worth highlighting .
There is no nation with a pure Hall - Rabushka two - postcard system , but many countries have done a remarkable job in creating tax codes that fulfill most or all of the major goals of a pro-growth tax system .
These include :
i. ) Hong Kong : Starting the Trend
Hong Kong has enjoyed a flat tax since 1947 and the system works so well that Hong Kong routinely is the world ’s fastest growing economy .
Indeed , growth is so robust that the government has just lowered flat tax rates to keep budget surpluses from becoming even bigger .
As of April 1 , 2008 , Hong Kong taxpayers enjoy a low - rate optional flat tax of 15 percent on personal income .
7
Taxpayers also can choose an alternative system with graduated rates , and the top rate in this system is just 17 percent .
Interestingly , there is no withholding in Hong Kong , meaning that taxpayers pay their entire income tax liability themselves ( usually twice a year ) .
The corporate tax is not perfectly aligned with the personal tax , but the flat rate is just 16.5 percent , so the gap is very small .
Hong Kong generally does not double - tax dividends , interest , and capital gains , so the system is very close to fulfilling the goal of taxing income only one time .
Likewise , there is no death tax or wealth tax .
Hong Kong also has a territorial system , so there is no second layer of tax on income earned by Hong Kong citizens in other jurisdictions .
Other features of the fiscal system are equally impressive .
There are no payroll taxes in Hong Kong .
Workers put 10 percent of their income into private retirement accounts .
There also is not a general sales tax or value - added tax in Hong Kong .
The entire tax code , even after being in place for 60 years , is only about 200 pages long .
Because of the absence of other taxes , Hong Kong has a very low burden of government spending , at least by modern standards .
Indeed , the budget consumes less than 20 percent of GDP .
The Hong Kong fiscal system certainly has generated good results , such as :
Hong Kong ’s budget usually has a budget surplus and there is very little government debt .
Indeed , the government has net surplus reserves .
8
Hong Kong has been one of the world ’s fastest growing economies .
Per capita income today is about $ 30,000 , up from less than $ 2,000 after World War II .
9
As shown in Figure 2 , Hong Kong has surpassed France and has dramatically narrowed the income gap with the United States .
As shown in Figure 2 , Hong Kong has surpassed France and has dramatically narrowed the income gap with the United States .
The wealthy pay most of the tax in Hong Kong .
The bottom 60 percent pay no income tax while the richest 100,000 taxpayers ( the top 8 percent ) pay 57 percent of the total tax burden .10
ii . ) Estonia : Leading the Way for Ex-Soviet Bloc Nations
Estonia has a flat tax of 21 percent , and the rate keeps falling .
When first implemented in 1994 , the rate was 26 percent .
By 2011 , it will drop to 18 percent .
The business rate also is 21 percent and it will drop in lock - step with the personal income tax rate , though it is important to understand that Estonia has , for all intents and purposes , eliminated the corporate income tax - at least as it is conceived in most other nations .
Businesses merely impose a withholding tax of 21 percent on any dividends paid to owners .
There is no double - tax on those dividends , and interest also is free from double taxation .
There also is no death tax or wealth tax , so Estonia has done a good job of eliminating the tax bias against saving and investment .
There is a capital gains tax , though individuals easily can avoid the tax by setting up companies to hold and manage investments .
Unlike Hong Kong , Estonia does have other taxes , including an onerous 29 percent payroll tax ( technically 33 percent , but four percentage points go directly into a personal retirement account ) .
Estonia also has a value - added tax of 18 percent .
The payroll and VAT levies are substantial , which is why the overall burden of government in Estonia is approximately twice as high - as a share of GDP - as it is in Hong Kong .
But this still means that government in Estonia is smaller than it is in most other European nations .
And the presence of other taxes should not detract from the key achievement of the flat tax , which include :
Economic growth , even after adjusting for inflation , has averaged nearly 9 percent over the past six years .
The budget has been in surplus for the past six years because revenues are rising so quickly .
11 Personal income tax revenues have doubled since 2000 and corporate revenues have jumped by about 300 percent during the same period .
12
Personal income tax revenues have doubled since 2000 and corporate revenues have jumped by about 300 percent during the same period .
Unemployment has dropped from more than 12 percent at the beginning of the decade to barely 6 percent today .13
iii . )
Slovakia : The Slavic Tiger
Slovakia implemented a flat tax rate of 19 percent on January 1 , 2004 .
The flat tax rate applies equally to labor income and business income .
Most forms of double taxation have been abolished .
Dividends paid to shareholders are not subject to a second layer of tax .
As part of the reform , the death tax and gift tax were both abolished .
There also is no wealth tax .
Like Estonia , other taxes are significant in Slovakia .
The country has a 19 percent value - added tax .
Payroll taxes are a significant burden .
Counting both employee and employer shares , they are nearly 50 percent , though there is a cap on the amount of income subject to payroll taxes .
Even with these onerous taxes , the aggregate tax burden in Slovakia is about 30 percent of GDP , down from a peak of 41 percent of GDP in 1993 and one of the lowest levels among developed nations .
In addition to tax reform , Slovakia has implemented personal retirement accounts , liberalized labor markets , enacted school choice , and reformed the welfare system .
The flat tax and other reforms have improved economic performance .
Economic growth , after adjusting for inflation , has averaged 6.6 percent per year , and is projected to average nearly 8 percent in 2007 - 08 .
14
The flat tax reform has generated a supply - side feedback effect .
Because lower income tax rates stimulated additional productive behavior , personal income tax revenue collections in the first year were higher than forecasted by static revenue estimates .
Likewise , value - added tax collections were lower than forecast in response to the generally higher tax rate .
15
Slovakia ’s system is widely seen as a model for other nations , leading one economist to state , “ The Slovak public finance reform will be studied in economic textbooks all over the world one day . ” 16
iv . )
Iceland ’s High - Rate Flat Tax
Iceland is an exception to the rule that flat tax systems have low tax rates .
Beginning January 1 , 2007 , the island nation near the Arctic Circle has a 35.7 percent flat tax .
While it is remarkable that a Nordic nation has chosen to abandon so - called progressive taxation , a system with a tax rate above the highest tax rate in the U.S. system is an outlier in the flat tax community .
On the other hand , Iceland has significantly reduced the double taxation of income that is saved and invested .
The corporate tax rate , for instance , is just 18 percent – and soon will fall to 15 percent .
There is also a low tax rate of just 10 percent on various forms of capital income paid to individuals , such as dividends , interest , and capital gains .
The death tax has been cut to 5 percent , and the wealth tax has been abolished .
Like other European nations , Iceland has an onerous value - added tax , in this case 24.5 percent .
But payroll taxes are modest , totaling less than 6 percent .
17 Nonetheless , the aggregate tax burden is sufficiently high to finance a government that consumes about 43 percent of national economic output .
In addition to tax reform , Iceland also has adopted other market - based reforms , such as personal retirement accounts and privatized fisheries .
18 Iceland ’s flat tax is too new to draw any conclusions , but other policies to reduce the burden of government have played a salutary role :
Thanks in part to market - oriented reforms , Iceland is now one of the world ’s richest countries , ranking in the top 10 according to both methods used by the World Bank .
19
Unemployment is almost nonexistent , with fewer than 2 percent of the working - age population without a job .
20
The corporate tax rate has been dramatically reduced , yet revenues have climbed .
As shown in Figure 3 , corporate tax revenues have jumped significantly , rising from less than 1 percent of GDP to more than 2 percent of GDP .
Other Positive Results
Like Iceland , many of the flat tax systems are so new that it is difficult to draw conclusions , but some flat tax systems have been in place long enough to show positive effects .
To augment the earlier discussion of Estonia , the World Bank reports that the three flat tax Baltic nations of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania are the richest nations of all the former Soviet Republics .
21
The IMF , meanwhile , reports that GDP in the three Baltic nations increased by 9.0 percent in 2005 and 9.7 percent in 2006 - and projects growth to average nearly 8 percent in 2007 and 2008.22
Slovakia ’s flat tax also was discussed earlier , but the results are even more impressive when compared to other Eastern European nations .
The IMF , for instance , reports that Slovakia is growing faster than the Czech Republic , and is expected to continue growing faster - by nearly three percentage points annually - over the next couple of years .
23
The key difference : Slovakia has had a flat tax since 2004 whereas Czech lawmakers waited until 2008 to implement a simple and fair tax system .
Romania is another positive story .
The economy has been expanding by about 6 percent each year , and the IMF expects the trend to continue - an impressive performance compared to nearby non-flat tax jurisdictions such as Croatia , Hungary , Serbia , and ( prior to this January ) Bulgaria .24
Georgia is another success story .
Its 12 percent flat tax went into effect in 2005 and annual growth has averaged 9 percent since then , and the IMF expects growth to remain high at about 7 percent for the next two years .
25 But Georgia is not resting on its laurels .
It has now combined the 12 percent flat tax and 20 percent payroll tax into a combined 25 percent tax – a seven percentage - point reduction in the combined tax rate , and it intends to lower this combined tax to just 15 percent over the next five years .
Russia and Ukraine also are enjoying respectable growth , though political unrest and the impact of rising energy prices make it particularly difficult to isolate the effect of tax reform .
But even with the other factors , the Russian flat tax has had a remarkable Laffer Curve effect .
As shown in Figure 4 , personal income tax revenue has been growing at double - digit rates ever since the 13 percent flat tax replaced the old progressive system that had a top rate of 30 percent .
26
These numbers are adjusted for inflation , incidentally , making the Laffer Curve effect even more impressive .
Rapid growth in former communist nations , to be sure , should be expected .
These nations are recovering from decades of economic mismanagement and traditional economic theory suggests that they should enjoy more rapid growth as they “ converge ” with wealthier nations .
The flat tax is noteworthy , though , since the nations that are more market - oriented - particularly with regard to tax reform - seem to be converging faster than the nations that are saddled with so - called progressive taxes .
As mentioned above , the flat tax is just one aspect of tax policy , and tax policy is just one half of the fiscal policy equation , and fiscal policy is just one of the many factors that influence an economy ’s performance .
As illustrated in Table 2 , flat tax jurisdictions do not necessarily get high grades for overall economic policy .
Hong Kong , Estonia , and Iceland score highly .
Lithuania , Georgia , Latvia , Mauritius , and Slovakia are examples of nations that do reasonably well .
Other nations score poorly , with Russia and Ukraine earning especially low scores .
The Role of Tax Competition
Globalization has had a positive impact on tax policy because governments now have to compete .
Simply stated , the geese that lay the golden eggs can fly away , and this discourages politicians from trying to pluck too many feathers .
Capital is now extremely mobile across national borders , for instance , which makes it very difficult for governments to impose punitive tax rates on saving and investment .
This applies to both direct investment ( which occurs , for instance , when a company builds a factory in another nation ) and indirect investment ( which occurs , for example , when an individual purchases and / or manages portfolio investments in another nation ) .
Competition to attract capital ( or to keep it from fleeing ) is one of the main reasons why the average corporate tax rate in developed nations has dropped by 20 percentage points since 1980 .
Competition for mobile saving and investment also has encouraged countries to reduce or eliminate various forms of double taxation on capital .
Some nations have low - rate taxes on individual capital income ( dividends , interest , and / or capital gains ) .
Others have eliminated or reduced death taxes and wealth taxes .
In many cases , these reforms are adopted explicitly to encourage taxpayers not to move their funds out of the country .
And because the personal income tax often is imposed on capital income , the tax competition - induced reduction in personal income tax rates also has helped reduce the tax burden on saving and investment .
The average top individual tax rate in OECD nations , for instance , has dropped by more than 25 percentage points since 1980 .
The Thatcher and Reagan tax rate reductions began the process of tax competition , and the global tax reform movement is the latest chapter .
The flat tax revolution in Eastern Europe may be the first phase .
The unanswered question is whether the flat tax will jump over the old Iron Curtain .
This is why it is noteworthy that Iceland now has a flat tax .
There also have been tax reform discussions in Germany , Greece , the Netherlands , Finland , and Spain .
In each case , the political obstacles were too severe , but it is remarkable that the flat tax is even being contemplated .
Conclusion
Twenty years ago , the Soviet Empire was a threat , both militarily and ideologically , to the free world .
Today , the Soviet Union no longer exists and 18 nations to emerge from communism ’s collapse now have single - rate systems – accounting for a clear majority of the world ’s 24 flat tax jurisdictions .
This tax reform revolution is remarkable , both because it signifies the spread of market - oriented policy and because it demonstrates that it is possible to have an income tax without following Marx ’s dictate of “ From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs . ”
Thanks to tax competition , this flat tax revolution almost certainly will continue to spread .
More nations hopefully will adopt flat taxes .
Those nations will likely choose low tax rates .
And countries with flat tax systems will probably shift to lower rates to keep competitive .
The global shift to flat taxes means more growth in more nations .
A flat tax does not guarantee robust economic performance , but it does mean that the tax code will be less of an impediment to productive activity .

2 There are several likely explanations for this development .
People emerging from the economic deprivation of communism doubtlessly are anxious to catch up with their richer neighbors in Western Europe and the flat tax is seen as an effective strategy to attract job - creating capital .
Having suffered under regimes that supposedly helped the poor , people in post -Communist nations also are probably less likely to be swayed by class - warfare arguments against tax reform .
Additionally , low - rate flat tax systems are viewed as effective ways of improving tax compliance since the incentive to evade is reduced when the tax rate is less punitive .
Last but not least , tax competition clearly is playing a role in recent years as nations scramble to adopt pro-growth tax systems in response to the successful flat taxes adopted by other nations in the region .

DC Comics will kill off Batman as one of a " series of cosmological cataclysms " designed to prop up circulation in the face of the increasing newsstand and cinematic domination of rival Marvel .
That 's according to the Times , which says the axe is due to fall in April 's issue 676 , representing the latest in a string of fatalities which has seen Superman popping his clogs back in 1992 , and the Green Lantern and Green Arrow off to superhero Valhalla .
DC says issue 676 - entitled Batman R.I.P - will " change the legend of the Dark Knight forever ! " .
The blurb adds : " Who will live ?
Who will die ?
Who will be Batman ?
The answers are sure to shock you in Batman R.I.P . "
Blimey .
However , the Times notes that Superman and the two aforementioned green chaps were later resurrected , leading to the suspicion that once DC has caused a bit of a kerfuffle , Batman will rise from the grave to once again battle Gotham City villainy . ®
The RIAA apparently produced a new video , already available on a variety of torrent tracker sites , in conjunction with the National District Attorneys Association with the goal of instructing U.S. prosecutors on how to deal with music piracy cases .
According to early reports , the video , called In Trial , also provides instructions on how to get an RIAA investigator qualified as a court expert .
P2PNet's Jon Newton pointed out that the video kicks off with a judge 's gavel slamming down , and that we can expect clips from the file to appear on video sharing sites soon .
This of course would be followed by a meta - lawsuit in which the RIAA sues to protect something it recorded itself .
-
Update :
The video apparently is n't as old as it seems , and pertains mostly to physical CD piracy , with ex-Maryland state trooper Frank Walters pointing to a CD burner tower and showing how prosecutors can identify a pirated CD ( no printing on the CD ) .
It also includes some choice lines like as this one , about how piracy accusations can help take down people who are skirting other laws ( think Al Capone ) :
Jim Dedman , National District Attorneys Association : " If I have my drug officers out there , and they see what seems like a nice music collection , this may be something you could help me out with . "
Deborah Robinson , Regional Counsel , Anti-Piracy Div. , RIAA : " Exactly , exactly .
And sometimes drug officers call us and say , 'we know they 're selling music , can you help us ?...
We 're trying to arrest this drug dealer , what should I look for , what should I put in that affidavit ?
Here 's a short clip from YouTube ( again , the entire " In Trial " video is available via torrent tracker sites ) :
Newton writes ,
Starring ex-prosecutor Deborah Robinson and Frank Walters ,
an ex-Maryland State trooper , it was made to " assist in the training ofU.S. prosecutors responsible for handling music piracy cases . "
It includes footage from " surveillance " videos and , " techniques onhow to identify illegal sound recordings and highlights , " not tomention , " examples of how illegal music is sold . "
And here 's the kicker .
It even claims to provide instructions on , and we quote , " qualifying an RIAA investigator as an expert . "
So that 's where Doug Jacobson and MediaSentry acquired their skills !
Nice one .
Update : Pirate Bay user phrackingtoast claims to have originally obtained the video through a friend who " holds a position in the criminal prosecutorial system " :
Things tend to even out .
Religion , some people say , has caused wars and fighting .
Yes , but it ’s also boring to sit through a church service , so it evens out .
One moment you ’re depressed because your doctor tells you that you have alcoholism .
But then you cheer up when you go home and find a hidden bottle of vodka you had forgotten about .
Things are evening out all the time , if you take time to notice , like I do .
Let ’s say you want a big cupcake , with lots of icing , so you go buy one and eat it .
But then you realize , I do n’t have the cupcake anymore .
Or maybe you take a bite of salsa that ’s labelled “ HOT , ” and it does n’t seem that hot , but then about a second later it seems really hot .
You might hear that some guy you know is having a party , so you call him up , but he says there ’s no party .
But then you call back , using a different voice , and suddenly there is a party .
One day , you ask people to take a look at a skin rash you have .
Then , a few days later , you ’re looking at their rashes .
You send someone a death threat and then , mysteriously , the police come to your house and threaten you .
Maybe you find a nice flat pebble on a riverbank , and when you pick it up and throw it it skips across the water several times .
But then the next pebble you ca n’t even pry loose because , what is this , glue mud ?
You notice an ant drifting away on a leaf in the water .
Then you look up to see your aunt drifting away in a rowboat .
Eventually , I believe , everything evens out .
Long ago , an asteroid hit our planet and killed our dinosaurs .
But , in the future , maybe we ’ll go to another planet and kill their dinosaurs .
Even in the afterlife things probably even out , although I can’t imagine how .
Still do n’t believe that things even out ?
Try this simple test : flip a coin , over and over again , calling out “ Heads ! ” or “ Tails ! ” after each flip .
Half the time people will ask you to please stop .
Once you realize that things even out , it ’s like a light being turned on in your head , then being turned off , then being turned to “ dim . ”
Probably the perfect example of things evening out happened to me just last month .
I was walking to the post office to mail a death threat .
It was a beautiful day .
I was happily singing away in my super - loud singing voice .
I did n’t step on any chewing gum , like I usually do , and when I threw my gum down it did n’t stick to my fingertips .
As I rounded the corner , there was a bum begging for change .
I was feeling pretty good , so I gave him a five - dollar bill .
At first I tried to make him do a little dance for the five dollars , but he would n’t do it , so I gave him the five dollars anyway .
Not long after that , I was reading the paper , and there was a picture of the bum .
He had won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry !
He had a little bigger nose and straighter teeth , but I ’m pretty sure it was him .
So , my five dollars had made him change his ways and become a chemistry guy .
A few days later , I was walking by the corner again , and there was the bum , back begging .
So , things had evened out .
He had gotten the Nobel Prize , but now he was a bum again .
I asked him for the five dollars back , but he started saying weird stuff that I guess was chemistry formulas or something .
I told my friend Don the story , but he said it was n’t an example of things evening out so much as just a stupid story .
That ’s interesting , Don , because you saying that evens out what I said to your mother that time .
I have a lot of stories about things evening out , but I think the one about the Nobel Prize - winning bum is the best .
I ’d say it would take about three of my other stories to even out that one . ♦

3 . The 10,000,000,000th Prime Number
. By Eugene McDonnell .
First published in Vector , 10 , 4 , ( April 1994 ) , 110 - 113 .
What is the 10,000,000,000th prime number ?
This column tells a story , and it has a moral .
It does not concern itself directly with J , the ostensible reason for these columns , but it can be justified because one of the direct antecedents of J is the language A , developed by Arthur Whitney while he worked at the investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley .
It was one page of C code for an A - like interpreter , written one afternoon by Whitney at Ken Iverson 's Kiln Farm in Ontario that gave Roger Hui the direction he needed to start work on what was to become J. Roger exhibits this code in Appendix A of " An Implementation of J " , published by Iverson Software Inc .
Whitney no longer works at Morgan Stanley : he has set out as a free lance and is developing a language called K , which has some affinity with A and J .
Hui now works at Morgan Stanley , and it is his adventure hunting down a large prime that the story is about , and Hui used A as the weapon with which he targeted the large prime .
The story begins when Hui's boss at Morgan Stanley challenged him by saying , " You think you 're smart , but you do n't even know what the 10 - to - the - 10 - th prime is . "
Hui 's immediate response was , " Do you start counting from 0 or 1 ? "
The boss was so taken aback that for a minute or so he did n't understand Roger 's question .
The boss 's challenge seems to have been meant as an example of a theoretically attainable but practically impossible computational task .
This article tells how Roger went about achieving the impossible .
I look on it as a triumph of the client - server technology .
This column is not so much an article about programming as it is about computer logistics .
The programming aspects , while important , are secondary to the story of how Roger went about organizing the solution .
The germ of Hui 's solution was to envision a Boolean vector p of length k such that the i th element of p is 1 if i is prime , and 0 otherwise .
Just sum - scan this very long vector and look for the index of 1e10 in it .
How long should such a vector be ?
The Prime Number Theorem says that the number of primes less than k is roughly k%( log k ) .
Solving for k in the equation 1e10=k % ( log k ) gives a value for k about 2.63e11 .
Roger , out of prudence , used the value 2.7e11 .
A vector of 2.7e11 elements is unrealizable in the present state of computer memories , especially since A does n't have a Boolean type : Boolean vectors require the same space as integer vectors .
A vector of 4*2.7e11 , or 1e12 bytes long is simply not in the cards .
Even a Boolean vector taking just 1 bit per element would have to be more than 3e10 bytes long , so it was clear that the problem had to be partitioned .
Hui 's central program computes the primes between m and n , using the sieve method , eliminating multiples of 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , etc .
This can be done independently in parallel on many small intervals that make up the larger interval of interest , and , if portioned out to computers that can communicate with a common central file , will permit the problem to be solved in shorter time than if only one computer was to tackle it .
The method of partitioning was suggested by the presence of more than 150 workstations on the floor in Hui 's part of Morgan Stanley .
They are all interconnected Unix machines , and any machine can be used from any other machine .
With relatively small effort a multi- processor solution could be set up , using these machines in parallel .
The machines are not heavily used on the weekends , and it was on a weekend that the experiment took place .
The strategy was to let the machines tackle the problem a billion integers at a time .
Hui 's colleague at Morgan Stanley , Seth Breitbart , suggested creating 271 files , named 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , 270 , each denoting the named interval of 1e9 consecutive numbers , and each one empty .
What a machine would do once it was set going was to look at the list of files , pick one at random ( named m ) , erase it , work on the interval ( 1e9 * m ) + i.1e9 , a million numbers at a time , and after finishing , write a file containing a record giving the number of primes in each of the million - number intervals within that 1e9 ( there are a thousand of them ) .
After finishing , it repeats that process , stopping only when the list of files / intervals are empty .
The machines were set up to process a million numbers at a time since the smallest machine available had enough memory to handle that many numbers at once .
Roger notes that there 's no great harm if two machines accidentally happen to pick the same file / interval .
In the flexible Unix universe additional machines could be brought on stream at any time .
If one is a Unix system superuser it is possible to take all sorts of liberties with these machines , like finding the ids of all other machines , but Hui prefers ( wisely , I think ) not to be tainted by such capabilities , so to get the machine 's names he went about the floor reading the names of the machines from strips of paper affixed to each one , then sat down at his machine and made inquiries about the state of each machine on his list .
If it was idle , he set it going on the problem .
As he was doing this , there was a nice dilemma to resolve .
Should his time be spent improving the algorithm before launching more machines , or should he spend time looking for additional machines ?
He favored the latter approach for the novelty of it , and ended up using about 15 IBM RS / 6000s and 60 Sun Sparc 2s and Sparc 10s .
After 20 hours , he had 271 files , each with 1,000 records .
From these he made a 271,000 element vector of the number of primes in the intervals 1e6 * i.271000 .
By sum-scanning this he knew the interval containing the 10^10 - th prime .
His function psieve returns a Boolean list selecting the primes between m and n .
Applying this to the magic interval gets the actual 10^10 - th prime .
Some details about his program " sieve " :
If a number q is not divisible by any number less than or equal to sqrt( q ) , then q is prime .
Therefore , to test a number less than 2.7e11 for primality one need only use trial divisors less than sqrt ( 2.7e11 ) or roughly 6e5 .
In practice , Hui precomputed a list of all the 78,498 primes less than 1e6 recursively , bootstrapping up from 2 3 5 7 .
( This only takes a few seconds . )
It was then a routine matter to determine for any number less than 1e12 whether or not it was prime : just see whether its residues with respect to each of the primes less than a million was nonzero ; if so , it was a prime .
For the curious , here is a condensed list of the first 10,000,000,002 primes , with their 0 - origin ordinal numbers .
0 2 1 3 2 5 3 7 4 11 ...
1e10 -1 252,097,800,623 1e10 252,097,800,629 1e10+1 252,097,800,637
After doing this , Hui found that there is a table in William Judson LeVeque 's " Fundamentals of Number Theory " , section 1.1 , giving the number of primes less than 10 ^ 3+i.8 .
Hui 's table agrees with LeVeque 's for 10 ^ 3+i.7 .
For 10^10 , however , LeVeque says 455,052,512 and Hui says 455,052,511 .
It turns out that LeVeque is wrong , Hui having checked his results with some help from Lee Dickey at Waterloo University .
Dickey tells
Hui that his colleagues speculate that LeVeque may have gotten his numbers from lists that D.N. Lehmer compiled , which included 1 as a prime , and LeVeque may have slipped in not subtracting 1 from that particular count .
( 1 is n't a prime since it does n't satisfy the definition of a prime : a positive integer n with exactly two distinct factors , 1 and n . )
Now for the moral of the story :
Hui tells me he has also since found some work that would have made it much easier to discover the nth prime , for any n. E.D.F .
Meissel , a German astronomer , found in the 1870s a method for computing individual values of pi(x ) , the counting function for the number of primes < :x .
His method was based on recurrences for partial sieving functions , and he used it to compute pi( 1e9 ) , where pi is a function that computes the number of primes less than or equal to its argument .
D.H. Lehmer simplified and extended Meissel 's method .
Recently , further refinements of the Meissel - Lehmer method which incorporate some new sieving techniques have been reported by Lagaria , Miller , and Odlyzko , in " Computing pi( x ) : Meissel - Lehmer Method " , Mathematics of Computation , Volume 44 , Number 170 , 1985 4 , pages 537 to 560 .
In this article the authors give an asymptotic running time analysis of the resulting algorithm , showing that for every e>0 it computes pi(x ) using at most O( x ^ ( 2r3 ) +e ) arithmetic operations and using at most O( x ^ ( 1r3 ) +e ) storage locations on a computer using words of length 1 +<. 2 ^.x bits .
The algorithm can be further speeded up using parallel processors .
They show that there is an algorithm which , when given M parallel processors , computes pi(x ) in time at most O ( ( % M ) * x ^( 2r3 ) +e ) using at most O( x ^ ( 1r3 ) +e ) storage locations on each parallel processor , provided M < : x ^1r3 .
A variant of the algorithm was implemented and used to compute pi( 4e16 ) .
Senate passes Bush - approved FISA update , Dodd sees House as best bet to strip immunity Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday February 12 , 2008

Print This Email This Update : The Senate has passed wiretapping bill in its entirety just before 6 pm ET , 68 - 29 .
More here .
With just a few days until a stop - gap surveillance measure expires , the Senate finally seemed ready to acquiesce to President Bush 's demand that telecommunications companies that helped him spy on Americans be let off the hook .
After failing to strip immunity from the Senate bill , Sen. Chris Dodd announced he would abandon his effort to block the bill with a filibuster , arguing that the House , which has passed an immunity - free bill , would be a better place to try to strip immunity from Congress 's final piece of legislation .
" We lost every single battle we had on this bill , " Dodd said on a conference call Tuesday with reporters and bloggers .
" And the question is now , Can we do better with the House carrying the ball on this bill ? "
The bill to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , including a provision granting retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated government spying , passed the Senate on a 68 - 29 vote Tuesday evening .
In an effort to move along the legislative process prior to a Friday deadline on the temporary measure , Dodd said he wanted the Senate to pass something so that both chambers can begin a conference committee .
If the two chambers produce a bill containing immunity , Dodd said he would filibuster that conference report .
There seemed some hope for blocking immunity in the House , as its Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , who has seen secret White House justifications for its warrantless wiretapping , said the documents do not support giving immunity to the telecommunications companies .
" Indeed , review and consideration of the documents and briefings provided so far leads me to conclude that there is no basis for the broad telecommunications company amnesty provisions advocated by the Administration and contained in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) bill being considered today in the Senate , " Conyers wrote in a letter to White House counsel Fred Fielding ( .pdf ) .
and that these materials raise more questions than they answer on the issue of amnesty for telecommunications providers . "
On Tuesday , the Senate struck down several proposals to strip retroactive immunity from an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance act and seemed ready to pass a final bill .
However , the FISA update still needs to be squared with the House , which passed an immunity - free version several months ago and remains opposed to the proposal .
The Senate actions would shield from lawsuits telecommunications companies that helped the government eavesdrop on their customers without court permission after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
After nearly two months of stops and starts , the Senate rejected by a vote of 31 to 67 an amendment sponsored by Sens.
Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) and Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) that would have stripped a grant of retroactive immunity to the companies .
Also voted down were amendments that would have shielded the companies from most aspects of the lawsuits while still maintaining some judicial oversight of Bush 's program , which critics say violated privacy and telecommunications law .
On a 30 - 68 vote , the Senate rejected a proposal from Sens. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) and Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) that would have made the government stand in as defendant in those suits .
The Senate then rejected an amendment to allow the FISA court to determine whether the companies did , in fact , respond in " good faith " to government requests ; that proposal from Sens. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) and Ben Cardin ( D - MD ) failed on a 41 - 57 vote .
Sens. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) took some time from campaigning for Tuesday 's slate of " Potomac Primaries " in Maryland , Virginia and Washington to swing by the Capitol and vote on the amendments .
Obama voted for the amendments to strip immunity from the bill , while McCain opposed the amendments and voted in favor of keeping immunity .
Hillary Clinton did not vote on the immunity issue at all , although she was in Washington at least part of the day Tuesday , competing in the same primaries as Obama and McCain .
It is unclear whether Clinton will pay a political price for her absence , especially in light of her campaign 's decision last fall to highlight Obama 's " present " votes when he was an Illinois State Senator .
" A president can't pick and choose which challenges he or she will face , " she said in October .
National Journal correspondent Shane Harris suggests Clinton 's present votes could be a bit of a boon for Obama , but likely wo n't hurt Clinton too much because the most vocal immunity proponents probably already were n't going to vote for her anyway .
" She was never considered fully onboard with the anti-immunity crowd , represented most vocally in the Senate by Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
Presumably , this hands Obama an arrow to fire at his rival , who has criticized the former Illinois state senator for his record of " present " votes , " he writes .
" But I m not sure how sharp this arrow is .
Obviously , the liberal wing of the Democrat party will have some problems with her non-position position .
But I do n't see how this costs her anything in the primaries , or in the long run .
But lets see how she votes on the full bill , or if she does . "
A Clinton spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the New York senator 's absence from Tuesday 's votes , but Marc Ambinder reports she had already left Washington to campaign in Texas .
" Senator Clinton was unable to vote earlier , but she has made her strong opposition to this legislation crystal clear , " her Senate spokesman Philippe Reines tells Ambinder in an e-mail .
President Bush has promised to veto any new surveillance bill that does not protect the companies that helped the government in its warrantless wiretapping program .
About 40 lawsuits have been filed against telecom companies by people alleging violations of wiretapping and privacy laws .
Telecom immunity must still be approved by the House ; its version of the surveillance bill does not provide immunity .
Roll Call reports that House Democrats may not be ready to give in to the president 's immunity demands and are girding themselves for a fight if Republican senators obstruct , or President Bush vetoes , an immunity - free bill .
The Captiol Hill newspaper 's Emily Pierce reports :
To try to insulate themselves from the likely Republican argument that theyll be exposing the United States to new terrorist attacks , Democrats have argued that the administration can continue ongoing eavesdropping investigations until August or possibly later , and they can still use the FISA court to get approval for new wiretaps .
But at the same time , Democrats are nervous about giving Republicans fodder in an election year .
To that end , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) has three bills ready to go : a 15 - day extension , a 30 - day extension and an 18 - month extension .
He may seek consent to pass one or all of those bills this week , the Senate Democratic leadership aide indicated .
And if it does expire because of filibuster or veto , its the fault of Republicans and the White House , Democrats will argue .
 If we say were willing to do an extension and they refuse , it will be them who allow the program to expire , rather than Democrats ,  the House Democratic leadership aide said .
The government 's post - 9/11 Terrorist Surveillance Program circumvented a secret court created 30 years ago to oversee such activities .
The court was part of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , a law written in response to government abuse of its surveillance authority against Americans .
Glenn Greenwald , a lawyer and blogger for Salon who has sharply criticized the warrantless wiretapping program , offers a brief history lesson Tuesday on the catalyst for FISA reform and its disappointing endgame :
It 's worth taking a step back and recalling that all of this is the result of the December , 2005 story by the New York Times which first reported that the Bush administration was illegally spying on Americans for many years without warrants of any kind .
All sorts of " controversy " erupted from that story .
Democrats everywhere expressed dramatic , unbridled outrage , vowing that this would not stand .
James Risen and Eric Lichtblau were awarded Pulitzer Prizes for exposing this serious lawbreaking .
All sorts of Committees were formed , papers written , speeches given , conferences convened , and editorials published to denounce this extreme abuse of presidential power .
This was illegality and corruption at the highest level of government , on the grandest scale , and of the most transparent strain .
What was the outcome of all of that sturm und drang ?
What were the consequences for the President for having broken the law so deliberately and transparently ?
Absolutely nothing .
To the contrary , the Senate is about to enact a bill which has two simple purposes : ( 1 ) to render retroactively legal the President 's illegal spying program by legalizing its crux : warrantless eavesdropping on Americans , and ( 2 ) to stifle forever the sole remaining avenue for finding out what the Government did and obtaining a judicial ruling as to its legality : namely , the lawsuits brought against the co-conspiring telecoms .
In other words , the only steps taken by our political class upon exposure by the NYT of this profound lawbreaking is to endorse it all and then suppress any and all efforts to investigate it and subject it to the rule of law .
The surveillance law has been updated repeatedly since then , most recently last summer .
Congress hastily adopted a FISA modification in August in the face of dire warnings from the White House that changes in telecommunications technology and FISA court rulings were dangerously constraining the government 's ability to intercept terrorist communications .
Shortly after its passage , privacy and civil liberties groups said the new law gave the government unprecedented authority to spy on Americans , particularly those who communicate with foreigners .
That law expires Feb. 15 , the deadline against which the Senate is now racing to pass a new bill .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reportedly has prepared 15 - day , 30 - day and 18 - months extensions of the temporary Protect America
Act he would seek to pass if the push for a long - term update stalls again .
In a separate voice vote Tuesday , the Senate expanded the power of the court to oversee government eavesdropping of Americans .
The amendment would give the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the authority to monitor whether the government is complying with procedures designed to protect the privacy of innocent Americans whose telephone or computer communications are captured during surveillance of a foreign target .
The House approved its own update last fall , and differences between the two remain to be worked out , approved by both houses , and delivered to the president for his signature .
( with wire reports ) ( Editor 's note : Article at one time incorrectly mixed up Obama 's and McCain 's votes on immunity )
Do We Need Death ?
No .
Next question .
All right , seriously folks , why would anyone think that that we need death ?
Pro-mortalists generally fear that longer lives will result in a nursing home world , filled with aging , miserable , debilitated people draining resources from the young to keep themselves alive .
Second , they worry about the social consequences of longer lifespans .
In his lead essay , Aubrey de Grey ably demolishes the nursing - home - world dystopias .
The point of anti-aging research is not to make us older longer , but to make us younger longer .
Enough said .
So what about the social consequences of radically longer and healthier lives ?
In that regard , Diana Schaub in her reaction essay raises many questions for reflection about those consequences , but curiously she fails to actually reflect on them .
Schaub is n’t “ willing to say that agelessness is undesirable , ” but she simultaneously “ ca n’t shake the conviction that the achievement of a 1,000 - year lifespan would produce a dystopia . ”
She then simply recapitulates the standard issue pro-mortalist rhetorical technique of asking allegedly “ unnerving questions ” and then allowing them to “ fester in the mind . ”
Sadly , all too many bioethicists think they ’ve done real philosophic work by posing “ hard ” questions , then sitting back with steepled hands and a grave look on their countenances .
So instead of just letting questions “ fester , ” let ’s actually make a stab at preliminary responses to some of the questions posed by Schaub and other pro-mortalists .
If people lived for 1,000 years , Schaub asks , “ How would human relations be affected ?
How would monogamy fare ? … would there be enough psychic energy for ever - renewed love ? ”
First , the real question is : why has monogamy already begun to fall apart in developed societies ?
I suspect that the increase in life expectancy over the last century may have had a bit to do with it , but surely the advent of truly effective contraception and the entrance of women fully into the paid workforce are far more significant factors .
Schaub worries about declining psychic energy , but so far declining psychic energy correlates pretty well with declining physical energy .
Schaub next asks ,
“ What would the tally of disappointments , betrayals , and losses be over a millennium ? ”
Turn that around –what would the tally of satisfactions , affections , and triumphs be over a millennium ?
Modern material and intellectual abundance has already offered many of us a way out of the lives of quiet desperation suffered by our impoverished ancestors .
The 21st century will provide an ever - increasing menu of life plans and choices .
Surely exhausting the coming possibilities for intellectual , artistic , and even spiritual growth will take more than one standard lifetime .
Schaub ’s conviction that 1000 - year lifespans would end in dystopia so distorts her vision that only gloomy questions come to her mind .
Schaub then queries , “ Would we love other people more or less than at present ?
Would we be better partners , parents , friends , and neighbors ? ”
Again she does not attempt an answer to her own questions .
As someone who has a “ conviction ” that an ageless dystopia looms , she surely has an obligation to try to explain why she thinks longer - lived folk may not love as deeply or might be worse neighbors , friends , and parents .
Does she have any evidence that shorter - lived people in past centuries and societies loved more deeply or were better neighbors , friends and parents ?
It is very suggestive that as life expectancies increased over the past century , levels of violence also declined . [ 1 ]
Perhaps empathy has a chance to increase as life becomes ever more valuable .
“ What would it be like to experience the continued vitality of the body in conjunction with the aging of the spirit ? ” asks Schaub .
Whatever can she mean by “ aging of the spirit ? ”
She initially suggests that longer healthier lives might happily unite the vitality of youth with the wisdom of maturity .
But being a pro-mortalist , Schaub inevitably must try to direct our attention to the possible downsides .
So she worries that instead longer lives would combine the “ characteristic vices of age with the strength of will to impose them on others . ”
Just what are the “ characteristic vices of age ” that trouble her ?
Which of the traditional vices — gluttony , anger , greed , envy , pride , lust , indifference , melancholy — does she expect will increase among hale near - immortals ?
As Georges Minois notes in his History of Old Age : From Antiquity to the Renaissance , the most commonly mentioned fault of old age is avarice . [ 2 ]
Roman playwright Terence wrote , “ A vice common to all mankind is that of being too keen after money when we grow old . ” [ 3 ]
In Gulliver ’s Travels , Jonathan Swift warned that “ avarice is the necessary consequence of old age . ” [ 4 ]
Swift was describing the immortal , but not ageless , Struldbrugs .
I do not doubt that material comfort and security grow in importance as physical vitality ebbs and mental acuity withers .
But perpetually vital oldsters would have no need for such security because they can count on having the mental and physical powers to apply to their pursuit of new goals and possibilities .
No failure is permanent , but instead becomes a learning experience .
In addition , Schaub suggests that “ a nation of ageless individuals could well produce a sclerotic society , petrified in its ways and views . ”
Hastings Center co-founder , Daniel Callahan ( who will be participating in this discussion ) makes a similar argument .
“ I do n’t believe that if you give most people longer lives , even in better health , they are going to find new opportunities and new initiatives , ” Callahan writes . [ 5 ]
To back up his claim , Callahan cites the hoary example of brain - dead old professors blocking the progress of vibrant young researchers by grimly holding onto tenure .
That seems more of a problem for medieval holdovers like universities than for modern social institutions like corporations .
Assuming it turns out that , even with healthy long - lived oldsters , there is an advantage in turnover in top management , then corporations that adopt that model will thrive and those that do not will be out - competed .
Besides , even today youngsters do n’t simply wait around for their elders to die .
They go out and found their own companies and other institutions .
Bill Gates did n’t wait to take over IBM ; he founded Microsoft at age 20 .
Nor did human genome sequencer Craig Venter loiter about until the top slot at the National Institutes of Health opened up .
And in politics , we already solve the problem of clutching oldsters by term - limiting the presidency , as well as many state and local offices .
Schaub offers no data nor even a plausible line of reasoning that longer healthy lives will result in “ social sclerosis . ”
In fact , the available evidence cuts the other way .
Social and technological innovation has been most rapid in those societies with the highest average life expectancies .
Yale University economist William Nordhaus estimates that the huge increase in average life expectancy in the United States , from 47 years in 1900 to 77 years today , has been responsible for about 40 percent of the increase in our standard of living . [ 6 ]
Schaub conjures the possibility of near immortal tyrants –Stalin and Hitler forever .
Frankly , I am not persuaded by the implied argument that everyone must continue to die before age 100 in order to avoid the possibility of millennial tyrants .
Must we really surrender to the tyranny of aging and death in order to prevent human despotism ?
Would n’t a better strategy be to focus on preventing the emergence of tyrants , either of the short - or long - lived variety ?
At the end of her essay , Schaub worries about decreased fertility ; that healthy oldsters would be less interested in reproducing .
A first response is : so what ?
Should n’t the decision to have children be up to individuals ?
After all , already countries with the highest life expectancies have the lowest levels of fertility .
A lack of interest in progeny could have the happy side effect of addressing the possibility that radically increased human lifespans might lead to overpopulation .
No one can know for sure , but it could well be that bearing and rearing children would eventually interest long - lived oldsters who would come to feel that they had the time and the resources to do it right .
Since assisted reproductive techniques will extend procreation over many decades , people who can look forward to living and working for hundreds of years will be able to delay and stretch out the period of parenthood .
Pro-mortalist Callahan has asserted “ There is no known social good coming from the conquest of death . ”
In point - counterpoint debate with Gregory Stock , the director of the Program on Science , Technology , and Society at UCLA about whether or not doubling human lifespans is a good idea , Callahan points that the “ problems of war , poverty , environment , job creation , and social and familial violence ” would not “ be solved by everyone living a much longer life . ”
He further demands that all problems he thinks might arise from dramatically increasing lifespans be solved in advance .
Callahan claims ,
“ The dumbest thing for us to do would be to wander into this new world and say , ‘ We ’ll deal with the problems as they come along . ’ ”
Callahan ’s argument is a non sequitur .
People already engage in lots of activities that do not aim directly at “ solving ” war , poverty , environmental problems , job creation , and the rest .
Surely we ca n’t stop everything until we ’ve ended war , poverty , and familial violence .
Anti-aging biomedical research would n’t obviously exacerbate any of the problems listed by Callahan and might actually moderate some of them .
If people knew that they were likely to enjoy many more healthy years , they might be more inclined to longer - term thinking aimed at remedying some of those problems .
Callahan ’s demand that all problems that doubled healthy lifespans might cause be solved in advance is just silly .
Humanity did not solve all of the problems caused by the introduction of farming , electricity , automobiles , antibiotics , sanitation , and computers in advance .
We proceeded by trial and error and corrected problems as they arose .
We should be allowed do the same thing with any new age - retardation techniques that biomedical research may develop .
Finally , the highest expression of human nature and dignity is to strive to overcome the limitations imposed on us by our genes , our evolution , and our environment .
Future generations will look back at the beginning of the 21st century with astonishment that some well - meaning and intelligent people actually wanted to stop biomedical research just to protect their cramped and limited vision of human nature .
Our descendants will look back , I predict , and thank us for making their world of longer , healthier lives possible .

As Pakistanis risk life and limb to oppose Musharraf , US elite rallies round military regime
By Keith Jones
7 November 2007
Tens of thousands of Pakistanis have taken to the streets over the past two days — risking arrest , assault and even shooting at the hands of the country ’s security forces — in opposition to the imposition of martial law by General Pervez Musharraf ’s US - backed military regime .
The government admits that in the first 24 hours after Musharraf ’s Saturday evening proclamation of a state of emergency , security forces took hundreds of opposition politicians , journalists , and lawyers into “ preventative detention . ”
On Monday and again yesterday , security forces broke up widespread anti-government protests , attacking demonstrators with batons and dragging large numbers off to jail .
Under the emergency , the constitution and its guarantees of free speech , free movement , and free association have been indefinitely suspended .
Police have been given new powers to arrest and detain people without charge and the media , especially broadcasters , are subjected to rigorous censorship .
Since Saturday evening , only the state television network has been allowed to broadcast .
Musharraf ’s Provisional Constitutional Order ( PCO ) strips the judiciary of its constitutional prerogative to review the legality of government actions , decreeing that the courts have no right to instruct President Musharraf , Prime Minister Aziz , or anyone acting in their name to do anything .
Large sections of the top echelons of the judiciary , a body hitherto notorious for its complicity in military rule , including the majority of the judges on the Pakistani Supreme Court , have been purged , either because they refused to pledge to uphold the PCO or because , deemed insufficiently pliant , they were not asked to take the military ’s new oath of office .
In a desperate attempt to give the Musharraf regime — which came to power in a 1999 coup and now has aborted its own effort to construct a democratic façade for continued military rule — a fig leaf of legality , the remaining supreme court justices and some fresh Musharraf - appointees met Tuesday .
Their first action was to rescind a ruling issued by Pakistan ’s highest court last Saturday , just before it was disbanded by security forces , declaring the state of emergency unconstitutional .
Faced with mounting and emboldened popular opposition , Musharraf and his cronies threatened repeatedly during the past six months to invoke emergency rule .
Ultimately , the trigger for what has aptly been dubbed Musharraf ’s second coup was the general - president ’s apprehension that the Supreme Court was about to declare unconstitutional his recent “ election ” to a further five - year presidential term .
The October 6 presidential vote was a military stage - managed sham that flagrantly violated both the letter and spirit of the constitution .
While Pakistan seethes with opposition to Musharraf and the military , the Bush administration and the US ruling elite as a whole have made manifestly clear that they stand with the military regime and will , in the name of the war on terror , continue to provide it with massive injections of aid .
Speaking publicly Monday for the first time on Musharraf ’s declaration of a state of emergency , US President George W. Bush did not demand that martial rule be immediately lifted , let alone that the general and his government resign .
Rather he voiced the “ hope ” that Musharraf “ will restore democracy as quickly as possible ” — something that the Pakistani dictator has claimed that he was doing throughout the past eight years of military rule .
Bush mixed tepid , ritualistic criticism of the general ’s latest actions with praise for his record , telling reporters “ President Musharraf has been a strong fighter against extremists and radicals . ”
The US president pointedly did not spell out any measures the US government would , or even might , take in the event Islamabad does not comply with Washington ’s call for Musharraf to lift the emergency and make good on his earlier pledges to quit as head of the armed forces before being sworn in for a new presidential term and to hold legislative elections in January .
“ All we can do is continue to work with the president as well as others in the Pak ( sic ) government , ” Bush said .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates echoed Bush ’s remarks .
He said the various programs under which US aid is provided to Pakistan — since September 2001 , the US government admits to supplying some $ 10 billion , most of it military aid , to Islamabad — will have to be reviewed , since some may be subject to statutory restrictions on funding countries whose constitution have been suspended .
That legal necessity notwithstanding , insisted Gates , “ We also want to be mindful of the fact that Pakistan continues to be an extremely important ally in the war on terror , so we have an interest in an ongoing security relationship . ”
An unnamed senior US official told the Associated Press , “ The question is what do you do when someone makes [ a ] mistake that is a close ally ?
You know , do you cut him off , hit him with sanctions , walk out the door ?
Or do you try and see if you can work them to get them back on track ? ”
The Democratic Party leadership has taken essentially the same position .
Over the past year , the Democrats have repeatedly criticized the Bush administration for not having made better use of US aid to Pakistan to prod Musharraf to take a more aggressive stand against Taliban and other Islamicist militias in the border regions of Pakistan and thereby strengthen the US occupation of Afghanistan .
( In fact the Musharraf regime has launched several major offensives in Pakistan ’s tribal regions and as a result the Pakistani military has suffered large casualties and increasing defections from its ranks . )
In the wake of Musharraf ’s coup , several Democratic Party leaders repeated these criticisms saying future aid to Pakistan should be tied to Islamabad doing the US ’s bidding , even its risks further destabilizing the country .
But all echoed the Bush administration ’s insistence that Pakistan is a pivotal ally in the war on terror and that the US must continue its close alliance with the Musharraf and , above all , the Pakistani military on which his regime rests .
Hilary Clinton commented , “ We now find ourselves having to cope with yet another threatening challenge made worse by the failed policies of this president . ”
Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd , a second tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , said , “ I am firmly opposed to cutting assistance to the government and people of Pakistan at this time — in fact I would argue that additional assistance might even be necessary in the coming days . ”
The principal press mouthpieces of the US elite have staked out similar ground .
“ The main US interest here is a stable Pakistan that can help defeat the jihadists , ” declared the Wall Street Journal Monday .
“ That interest wo n’t be served by precipitously moving to sever ties with Mr. Musharraf , or with the Pakistan military the way the US did in the 1990s . ”
In an editorial published Tuesday , the New York Times , the leading voice of the US liberal establishment , criticized the Bush administration for having “ centered ” its Pakistan policy “ slavishly on a single , autocratic ruler . ”
The US , it complained , “ had gained little leverage for the more than $ 10 billion that has fattened Pakistan ’s coffers . ”
But it quickly arrived at a policy prescription not far removed from the White House ’s : “ The United States is increasingly left with bad options .
Cutting off aid would only make it harder to enlist Pakistan ’s military in the anti-extremist fight and renew doubts about America ’s reliability as an ally . ”
The Times urged the Bush administration to renew its efforts to bring about a power - sharing agreement between the military and Benazir Bhutto and her Pakistan Peoples ’ Party ( PPP ) .
“ Reviving General Musharraf ’s back - room deal with the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , however distasteful , may be a way back from the abyss ... ”
The Times ’ hopes may well prove forlorn .
Bhutto has signaled time and again her readiness to serve Washington ’s interests and to work with the Pakistani military to prevent the eruption of mass popular opposition to Musharraf .
She has indicated she would help reconfigure the Musharraf regime so as to provide the PPP with a share of power , in return for providing a popular and “ democratic face ” to a government that would continue to be dominated by the military and its US patrons .
Even after Musharraf ’s declaration of emergency , Bhutto said she would not rule out further talks with the general and her PPP has been largely absent from the protests against martial law ..
But she has had to retreat from that stand , announcing that she will not meet with the general - president and will lead a protest rally on Friday .
Bhutto ’s objectives remain the same .
But with the opposition to the government swelling and Musharraf more and more relying on outright repression , the PPP ’s popular support threatens to hemorrhage , if she does not distance herself from the dictatorship .
Already there are reports of deep fissures in the PPP leadership .
The US establishment ’s rallying round Musharraf and the Pakistani military as they trample on the most elementary democratic rights of the Pakistani people , has once again put the lie to the democratic verbiage in which both the Bush administration and the Democrats seek to cloak US diplomatic and military aggression around the world .
The US elite is utterly indifferent and hostile to the democratic rights of the Pakistani people .
The Musharraf regime has been a pivotal and highly - touted US ally in the war on terror for the past six years .
The Bush administration has connived in and apologized for its innumerable violations of democratic and human rights , from the phony elections of 2002 , to the violence unleashed against anti-Musharraf protesters in Karachi this May , to the deportation of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , when he tried to return to Pakistan in September , to the current recourse to martial law .
Washington ’s attitude toward Pakistan is entirely shaped by US predatory strategic interests .
Pakistan is pivotal to US efforts to control the adjacent oil - rich regions of the Middle East and Central Asia .
Pakistan has been the principal logistical support base for the US invasion and occupation of Afghanistan and with the neighboring Central Asian republics becoming , under Russian influence , less cooperative , Pakistan has become even more important to the US position in Afghanistan .
Pakistan ’s military regime has allowed the US military to use the country to prepare for war with Iran , by staging training exercises and mounting incursions into Iran .
Pakistan is also widely reported to have provided US security forces with sites to conduct the illegal torture of alleged terrorist suspects .
This is not to say that the US elite is not gravely troubled by Musharraf ’s coup .
It is widely and rightly seen as a debacle for the Bush administration ’s foreign policy , since it has so graphically exposed the hollowness and hypocrisy of the claims to be promoting democracy .
The regime that the Bush administration has itself lauded as a pivotal US ally has once again bared its fangs .
Even more importantly , there are widespread fears that Musharraf ’s actions will backfire , sparking a popular mobilization that will redound not only against the interests of the military but against those of the US , which has been its chief patron .
Given the stakes , it is not impossible that US will try to remove Musharraf from the equation , by encouraging another general to strike the deal with Bhutto that Musharraf has proved unwilling to make — that is , to try to preempt a popular upsurge by reconfiguring the military regime .
The one thing the entire US elite is determined to avoid , including by countenancing mass violence , is the genuine intervention of the Pakistani masses into the country ’s political life .

Remember when a chequebook was an essential part of the shopping experience ?
Not any more .
An increasing number of shops are refusing to accept them .
Tesco is the latest , saying the move will speed up service at the checkout and help prevent fraud .
Other cheque - free zones include Asda , Argos , Boots , Next , Sainsbury 's , WH Smith and very soon Marks & Spencer .
So is this the end for them ?
After finally locating and dusting down my much neglected chequebook , I headed to the shops to see how much financial muscle it still flexes .
Confusion
The reaction of shop assistants ranged from surprise to complete confusion .
Some looked at them like they were a museum exhibit and had to ask for help , having never dealt with one before .
Others would accept anything else - even travellers cheques - but not bank cheques .
Another common problem was having nowhere to write one out .
Shops no longer seem to designate spaces where you can put pen to paper and I often had to balance my cheque book on to the edge of tills and display stands to write one .
I can hear people behind me in the queue let out a long sigh when I get my cheque book out
Cheque user Michael Dyke
No cheques at Tesco
The concept of cheques first came about in the 16th Century , according to Brian Capon of the British Bankers ' Association .
Merchants had goldsmiths look after their gold and wrote notes to other merchants , asking that a certain amount of gold be paid to the bearer of the note .
The first actual example of a cheque as we now know it dates from 1659 .
" They became popular because they were safe , effective and efficient , " says Mr Capon .
" A much better way of handling your money rather than carrying it around with you all the time .
Clumsy
" There was little chance of fraud because only the wealthy had bank accounts .
If a gentleman came in off the street who did n't look wealthy questions would be asked . "
There were over 4.4 million personal and business cheques issued every day in 2007 .
This is compared with 11 million in 1990 , the peak year for cheque usage .
By 2016 it is predicted there will be only 2.3 million per day .
There are a number of factors that have contributed to the decline in popularity of cheques , says Mr Capon .

" It 's now much easier to pay by debit or credit card using the Electronic Point Of Sale ( EPOS ) system in shops , and you can go on the internet to transfer money via online banking . "
There are some myths attached with the cheque system , not least that a man once paid a cheque in to a bank that was written on the side of a cow .
But you could use one if you wanted , says Mr Capon .
A cheque is simply an instruction to your bank to pay someone .
You could write that instruction on a bovine , but banks do have the right to refuse and probably would .
" You could , however , use a blank sheet of paper as a cheque , so long as it has the relevant information , " he adds .
Fakes
Shops which have stopped accepting cheques say it 's because they have become less popular and there was a problem with fake ones .
The decline of the cheque is largely consumer led , says Apacs , the UK trade association representing institutions that deliver payment services to customers .
This is why it has pushed for high street shops to ditch cheques .
Starbucks do take cheques - but not very often
" We 're not predicting the end of the cheque as yet , but its demise is well under way , " says a Apacs spokeswoman .
" People now favour debit cards over cheques on the high street and direct debits , internet and telephone banking to pay their household bills . "
But the cheque has not fallen out of favour with all consumers .
Some are angry that a growing number of shops are refusing to accept them .
" I 'm not comfortable about using credit cards because of the risk of fraud , but I feel I am being forced into doing so because of shops like Tesco refusing to accept them , " says Michael Dyke , 60 .
Reliable
" I'm angry that consumers have not been consulted about this and I think it is all driven by money and the handling costs shops have to pay for cheques .
Again saving money is being put before the customer .
CHEQUE - THE FACTS 5 m people regularly use guaranteed cheques , compared with 16 m in 1996 Women make almost 52 % more guaranteed cheque payments than men
Less than one in ten regular bills paid by cheque , compared with one in three in 1995 4 % of retail spending is paid by cheque , compared with over 60 % by debit or credit card More than 4.4 m business and personal cheques issued each day in 2007 , compared with 11 m in 1990 Source : Apacs
" I think phasing out cheques will have serious consequences for some older people .
Many still rely on them because they may not have credit cards or a knowledge of how to use them . "
Mr Dyke says up until recently he mainly used cheques , but is being forced to pay with his bank and credit cards more and more often .
There is a lot of huffing and puffing from fellow customers , as well as staff , when he gets out a cheque .
" I can hear people behind me in the queue let out a long sigh when I get my book out , " he says .
Having encountered some huffing and puffing on my shopping spree , I know what he means .
At the end of my spree I have found three places that accepted cheques and four that do n't .
After a flurry of use , I think my cheque book will be left in a drawer to become the museum piece it looks destined to be .
The report is all about retail and I agree that the chip and pin credit and debit cards are much quicker to use .
However , cheques are still the most efficient way , apart from cash , for the mojority of individuals to pay money to each other .
Not everyone has internet banking to transfer money and sending a cheque in the post is often easier for some than going to a bank and arranging a transfer .
Online payment systems as used by internet auction sites , are just too expensive , however convenient they are .
The cheque still has a place , but its use will become limited to personal transactions between individuals .
John Ferris , Coventry
Cheques are particularly useful for paying local traders - plumbers , etc - who wo n't want to carry round an EPOS with them all the time , but may charge more than most people keep in cash .
Apart from that , I very rarely use cheques at all - with online banking , it 's so easy to pay money directly into someone 's account , and my credit card mops up all other purchases .
Stevie D , Selby , UK
Cheques are actually making a come - back in some small shops .
I was in a small bookshop that no longer accepts credit cards because of the cost of chip & pin ; I had to return to car & dig out cheque book , which , fortunately , I had with me .
Alan , Shaftesbury Dorset
What worries me about the cheque book disappearing is I still use cheques to pay the self - employed , eg plumber , electrician .
Will I have to give them large sums of cash ( theft risk ) , or will they have to invest in portable chip and pin machines ( and put their prices up to cover this ) ?
Heather Arnold , Gloucester , England
I had a cheque book stolen in the post a year or two ago .
It was a nightmare with Sainsbury and several other supermarkets threatening to sue when the fraudulent cheques were refused .
It took months of writing letters and reporting the matter to the police to deal with the matter .
I wrote to the CEOs of the various companies suggesting they should stop taking cheques because of their lack of security .
I am delighted my excellent advice is being taken !
Mike Newland , London .
England
Retailers stopping accepting cheques is all very well and it suits them as it is seen as an expense to process a piece of paper .
However , if they disappear completely how will I pay small traders or give money to friends in a secure way ?
I think they 'll need to stay in some form for a while yet .
Phil Antill , Leicestershire
I refuse to use credit or debit cards .
They are too vulnerable to fraud and encourage profligacy .
I pay everything by cheque or by cash except for regular payments which go by direct debit or standing order .
The apparent demise of the cheque is driven principally by the retail chains and banks cutting handling costs .
I think the Government should step in to require all retail outlets to accept cheques .
Ian Sedwell , Weymouth , UK
I can place an online order against a credit card at lunchtime on Monday and receive the item first thing on Tuesday morning .
Try getting the item in less that a week or ten days using a cheque .
But when sending cash to a small club or a friend then using a cheque is ideal .
Horses for courses .
Graham Noyce , St Ives
It is bad to know that Tesco and other superstores have completely stopped accepting cheques .
It does make sense that paying by cheques does involve cost and time , but I still think that this cost is much less than 2.5 % being paid by these retailers to Credit Card companies companies to process Credit Card transactions .
Also , there are lot many ( mostly vulnerable ) people who do not have knowledge or access to technology like internet banking or Chip / Pin .
Retailers should behave sensibly and should not fully stop accepting cheques , though they can discourage such transactions by directing them to say Customer Service desk ( anyway , they already do so if they have billed you incorrectly or if you need a refund ) .
Shamsher Khan , Staines , UK
I avoid chip and pin whenever possible and use cheques instead because chip and pin is so unsafe .
How can you prove who pressed the four buttons containing your PIN ?
Cheques have my signature , a copy of which I have supplied to the bank .
Easily proven or disproven .
I too believe retailers should be made to accept cheques .
Steve , Berkshire , UK
The problem with no longer accepting cheques is when the system for using your card and pin number goes down .
I recently had filled my car up with petrol , went to pay and found that the chip and pin system was not working .
I was told I would have to find another means of payment .
Bit difficult when , as the systems were down for my bank , the cash machines were no longer working and the garage did not take cheques .
At least at a garage they have a system where you give your details and pay at a later date as it is not easy for them to recover the goods , how many supermarkets are going to allow you to take the goods home if you have n't paid for them , even if you have just spent an hour wondering around the shop .
Kath , Wirral
I find it hard to believe anybody here supports using cheques in shops .
I have had a bank account for almost a quarter of a century and have never used one in a shop ; always cash or cards .
It must be at least a decade since I remember having to wait behind somebody slowly filling one out in a check out queue .
Is the day ever going to come in the UK when people say to a change " about time , I much prefer the new way " ?
Always looking back to an imaginary golden age .
Des , London , UK
We run a guest house and take payment by cash or cheque only because of the costs of taking payment by card .
Our business is mainly business people during the week and key to them is price , if we had to increase our price to cover the additional costs of taking payment by card we would lose a considerable amount of business .
That said cheques are a liability , as we have found to our cost and we would much prefer to take cards if it made financial sense .

Paul Krugman released a bombshell editorial today that exposes the flaming carcass of the " nation " of Iraq for what it is .
There is no nation of Iraq .
There are three major ethnic groups fighting for control of resources and a number of smaller groups fighting to survive .
Given that there is no nation of Iraq and the U.S. still needs Iraqi oil the fall back position for big oil is to cut separate regional deals with the regional governments .
That is exactly what has happened .
Paul Krugman reveals :
What ’s particularly revealing is the cause of the breakdown .
Last month the provincial government in Kurdistan , defying the central government , passed its own oil law ; last week a Kurdish Web site announced that the provincial government had signed a production - sharing deal with the Hunt Oil Company of Dallas , and that seems to have been the last straw .
Now here ’s the thing : Ray L. Hunt , the chief executive and president of Hunt Oil , is a close political ally of Mr. Bush .
More than that , Mr. Hunt is a member of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , a key oversight body .
The surge , the Petraeus speech and Bush 's latest speech are all political Kabuki theater .
They all know that there is no nation of Iraq .
The surge in Baghdad provided cover for ethnic cleansing of Sunnis - as intended .
The arming of Sunnis in Anbar encouraged the formation of Sunni enclaves .
The nation formerly known as Iraq is now close to complete ethnic cleansing .
And Bush 's closest friends and allies are profiting .

Source : BP for fossil fuel , hydro , and nuclear data , EIA and IEA for renewable data , and author 's calculations as described in the text for projections .
This is a scenario not a forecast .
This post is the start of an attempt to sketch out what an integrated solution to the world 's food , energy , land , climate , and economy problems might look like .
My basic goal is to get to a somewhat defensible story of how civilization could get to 2050 in reasonable shape , despite the problems of climate change , peak oil , global population growth , etc .
Since it 's not possible for me to entirely solve this problem in a week of part - time work , I put this out as a hasty straw - man .
Feel free to point out the parts of this that do n't work , or where my ignorance of some of the relevant issues shows particularly badly .
Of course , I do n't make the claim that I can predict what will happen forty years ahead .
Nor do I expect the global population to pay much attention to what I think they should do .
Instead , the value of a scenario is to try to think through the general issues that society faces , and the value of an integrated scenario is that we can think about how all the parts fit together holistically , whereas usually they get projected separately by specialists , and even the obvious interconnections get missed by decision - makers ( if we try to solve our fuel problems by converting food to fuel , perhaps the price of food might go up ) .
With that said , for the remainder of the piece I 'm arrogating to myself sole authorship of all relevant international treaties and implementing legislation at the national level .
Here 's how I 'd go about it .
In this first piece , I 've analyzed the overall requirements for the problem , but only fleshed out any detail on the population , economy , and energy sectors ; I did not have time to write up my analysis of transportation and agriculture / land issues .
I will do so in a future piece .
Requirements
Population :
The global population is able to grow and go through its demographic transition with death rates continuing to go down .
No die - offs .

Carbon emissions :
The global energy infrastructure will be mainly replaced with non-carbon - emitting energy sources by the end of the period , and residual emissions will be rapidly diminishing .

Fossil fuels :
I assume that peak oil is here about now but that declines will be governed by the Hubbert model ( and thus will be gradual ) .
I assume natural gas and coal are globally plentiful enough that climate policy is required to prevent their full use .

Technology : I do not assume any massive breakthroughs - no technological miracles that solve problems in ways completely unknown or untested today .
However , where technological sectors have long established rates of progress in key metrics , I extrapolate the metric to continue improving at the historic rate ( eg the economics of solar power , or the yields / acre of agriculture are assumed to keep improving on the historical trajectory ) .

Impact on wild ecosystems .
Developed countries are assumed to maintain the protections they currently have in place ( for national parks , wildernesses etc ) .
Developing countries are assumed to exploit their unused land up to the point of best current practices for developed countries .
Whatever impact on ecosystems arises from climate change due to past carbon emissions and the tail of emissions to 2050 is viewed as unavoidable .

Conservatism
Other than the above , I use the overarching principle of trying to assume as little change in the way the world works as possible - I assume it remains a more - or - less free market world , in which national governments regulate their own countries to temper the worst excesses of the free market and periodically enter into treaties on the more pressing global problems .
I assume it remains full of highly imperfect humans mostly struggling to improve their own circumstances .
I assume people are willing to come together and take collective action for the common good , but only when the need for that action has become so overwhelming and immediate as to be irrefutable .
In engineering , there is a saying " requirements before design " , which indicates that you should think through as comprehensively as possible what you want the system to do before you start trying to figure out how to build it to do that .
Otherwise , there 's a tendency to think of a subset of the requirements and then rush into a design , only later realizing that some were forgotten , which then must be added at much greater expense .
So here are my list of requirements :
A few comments on these requirements .
The first two on population and economy I view as minimally necessary to ensure the world 's political and social stability .
If the population or economy were to contract substantially , I believe a number of countries would become unstable and there would be revolutions , mass population migrations , etc .
All predictability in the world would likely be lost at that point .
The first , on population , also seems to me a non-negotiable moral imperative .
Of course , these conditions alone will not be enough to prevent a normal amount of human mistake and misery , but I believe they are required to prevent mistakes and misery from becoming globally endemic .
The carbon emission requirement seems essential to have some hope of stabilizing the climate .
There is a considerable possibility that the climate is already destabilized to an important degree .
Nonetheless , it 's likely possible to make it much worse by continuing to emit exponentially increasing amounts of carbon .
The best we can hope for is to start now , as energetically as possible , substituting our energy sources and sinks as best we can , until we do n't emit carbon .
On fossil fuels , I have explicated my best guesses on peak oil timing ( here and here ) and on decline rates , and will let those stand for now .
On technology - of course , it 's not likely that 40 + years of human ingenuity will pass without some big breakthroughs ( think of what has happened since 1968 - personal computers , the Internet , statin - class drugs , mobile phones , etc , etc ) .
But there is no hope at all of predicting specifically what those breakthroughs will be , or whether we will make one important to our climate / energy problems .
So I assume nothing here - any breakthroughs will hopefully serve to offset whatever negative surprises the world may pose to us .
However , I think it would be unduly pessimistic to assume that well established trends of technical progress will not continue , unless there is a clear game - changing theoretical barrier in the way of further progress .
As everyone knows , the rest of nature has taken a real beating from humans , and it 's going to get worse .
Climate change means that species must move , and habitat fragmentation means they can't in many cases .
I recognize the tragedy in this , but I do not see what can be done about it given the other requirements above .
I do n't think it 's realistic to assume that developing countries will do any better than the examples that developed countries have set in terms of set - asides - I certainly support efforts to conserve as much as can be conserved .
And then , finally , I am still a liberal on the contemporary American political scale , but a rather centrist and very independent one .
In particular , at this point in my life I have a very strong sympathy for the strain of thinking in the Anglo - American conservative tradition which says that humans are complex and highly imperfect , that it has taken a long time to get society to work as well as it does , unsatisfactory as that may be , and that radical experiments to improve the way it works are dangerous .
One should attempt change by making improvements step - by - step on the most pressing issues of the day , and one should be prepared to accept that society will never be utopia .
In this case , we have no choice but to make some radical changes in where we get energy from , but let 's at least not try to change any more things than we have to .
I 'm more than happy to settle for a world that will be a minimally acceptable place for my children and grandchildren to grow up and live out their destinies .
I take the requirements above to be a description of that minimal level .
The world will not become a utopia ( whether you prefer your utopia agrarian , socialist , libertarian , spiritual , or transhumanist ) .
Outline of Solution
My basic approach is as follows .
Over the next fifty years , we 're going to phase out most burning of fossil fuels , but they will still be used for petrochemicals and fertilizer ( manufacture of which will be mainly in the Middle East ) .
We will cope with short term energy problems by efficiency improvements , but in the long term we will power society predominantly by massive amounts of solar PV , with smaller amounts of wind , and legacy hydro .
We will use a global transmission grid to balance supply and demand between the nighttime and cloudy areas and the areas in the sun that generate power .
Nuclear is avoided in the long term out of proliferation and waste concerns but is used in the short and medium term .
Owners of fossil fuel infrastructure will be compensated at fair market value .
Ground transportation will be by a mix of electric cars and electrified public transport ( in areas of high enough density ) .
The car fleet will be moved through hybrids to plug-ins to full electrics as storage technology slowly improves .
Developing countries will be encouraged to urbanize and develop as rapidly as feasible to reduce pressure on remaining wild ecosystems and to build public transport systems in their very dense cities .
Building heating and cooling will be transitioned predominantly to ground source heat pumps powered by electricity instead of burning fossil fuels .
Agriculture will remain predominantly industrialized , and ongoing yield improvements , particularly in the lower - yielding poor countries , are assumed to be able to feed the world .
The residual oil production and modest and regulated amounts of biofuels will be used for certain applications where the advantages of liquid fuels are indispensible ( predominantly heavy construction and agricultural machinery , shipping , and aviation ) .
There is considerable scientific uncertainty on the extent of soil depletion , but the assumption here is that at - risk areas will be placed in conservation reserves , and that , later in the century when energy becomes cheap again , restoration and remediation will be attempted .
The overall economic approach for implementation will be a hybrid " markets - within - a - plan " approach .
A pure free market approach is likely to be disastrous ( eg starving the poor to make biofuels for the rich , which will result in riots and revolutions ) .
However , markets are very powerful drivers of innovation and efficiency when well designed .
We will set general goals with binding targets by treaty , and then use a combination of subsidy auctions , rights auctions , and reverse auction retirements of fossil fuel infrastructure to meet the binding targets .
Market competition will improve the technology and drive down the required subsidies over time .
In general , this will require a massive global infrastructure project .
It will be expensive , but it 's not impossible .
It seems very cheap compared to further uncontrolled experiments with the climate , or to allowing the world to descend into starvation and chaos by adopting dysfunctional approaches to our energy challenges .
It will place civilization on a tolerably sustainable footing for the longer term .
With that , let 's turn to looking at the major sectors of the global economy in a little more detail .
Again , I 'm going to go through population , economy , and energy sectors this time .
The rest will have to await future pieces .
Population
Here , from an old piece of mine on population , is a graph of the various UN population scenarios :
UN population projections through 2050 .
Click to enlarge .
The medium scenario ( dark green ) is the UN 's best guess as to what will happen .
High and Low represent their best estimates of the range of reasonably likely outcomes .
The Constant Fertility line is their estimate of what would happen if world average fertility did not decline any further .
Source : World Population Prospects : The 2004 Revision .
In this piece , we will take the medium population scenario as our goal to be supported by the planetary economy .
It 's worth looking for a moment at the assumptions the demographers are making in the less developed countries ( where most of the population growth will be occurring ) :
Birth and Death rates for UN less developed countries ( excluding least developed ) .
The lines through 2000 are data , and after that the lines are the UN 's medium projection .
Source : World Population Prospects : The 2004 Revision .
As you can see , death rates have been falling , and they are assumed to fall further as countries continue to develop and get wealthier .
Birth rates follow death rates down , but with a lag ( this is the demographic transition ) .
Least developed countries are following a similar trajectory but are not as far along .
The assumption I make here is that if the economy and food supply are allowed to grow at reasonable rates , then population will follow the UN 's assumptions .
Economy
The way the economy develops in my scenario is as follows ( I 'm going to summarize it here , but some of the justification comes later ) .
This graph shows global GDP on a $ 2007 purchasing power parity basis .
The data through 2007 are from the IMF .
My scenario basically has global growth dropping sharply for the next few years due to an assumed US recession caused by the credit collapse .
Then growth starts increasing again , but slowly due to high energy prices .
Finally , as our energy problems get thoroughly solved around 2025 , growth returns to about the current long term trend in developed countries .
Developing countries are assumed to gradually slow down until by 2050 they are not growing much faster than developed countries ( since they will be fairly developed by then ) .

Expressed in $ 2007 dollars on a PPP basis .
Source : IMF for historical data , and author 's calculations as described in the text for projections .
The global economy , about $ 72 trillion in 2007 , will be several hundred trillion dollars by 2050 under my assumptions .
In addition to GDP data , the IMF has also kept track of the level of investment in the global economy .
I show this data , and also how much investment there would be in the future , assuming that the fraction of GDP invested averages the same in the future as in the past .
I place this graph here to give some idea of the world 's investment budget for when we start spending some of it on a new global energy infrastructure .

Expressed in $ 2007 dollars on a PPP basis .
Source : IMF for historical data , and author 's calculations as described in the text for projections .
Total investment is about $ 17 trillion in 2007 , and rises to somewhere around $ 75 trillion / year by 2050 .
This includes spending on houses , factories , offices and infrastructure of all forms , but excludes current consumption .
Again , left alone with a sufficiency of resources , a capitalist economy will tend to grow .
Inventors will invent more efficient ways of doing things and more desirable end - consumer goods ; entrepreneurs will bring them to market ; people will get more productive ; bigger and better houses , factories , cars , etc will be built , and the whole thing will be bigger next year than it was last year .
Thus the basic analysis to justify my scenario consists in showing that none of the apparent resource bottlenecks are necessarily fatal to growth .
By far the most important of these is energy .
Energy Sector
There are basically three choices for non-carbon - emitting , non-biofuel , energy production technologies that are already in practical commercial use and have potential for major expansion : nuclear , wind power , and solar .
Let me briefly discuss the trade - offs .
Nuclear is the furthest along in that it already provides a material fraction of global primary energy ( about 5.6 % of marketed energy on a thermal basis ) .
See Is Nuclear Power a Viable Option for Our Energy Needs ? for a good summary of the case for nuclear .
Nuclear has a high energy return on energy invested and there is sufficient uranium for a long time ( though there are short term price issues associated with the ending of the burning of the stockpile of uranium from old nuclear warheads ) .
New nuclear energy will probably be reasonably cheap as long as interest rates are n't too high ( since most of the cost is the upfront capital to build the plant , the cost of finance is critical to nuclear economics ) .
Nonetheless , I do not favor nuclear power as the long - term major solution to powering the global economy .
Pervasive presence of a nuclear power industry throughout all or almost all countries of the world has three major issues : developing countries are frequently corrupt with a tendency for their building subcontractors to do things like leaving the rebar out of concrete to save money .
Nuclear power is an industry were mistakes and short - cuts can not be tolerated .
Furthermore , the nuclear fuel chain always has the potential to be diverted into weapons use by its owners ( the basis for western concerns about Iran ) .
Nuclear weapons remain the only way humanity has come up with to not just end our civilization but end our species and most life on the planet and they ought not to be proliferated further .
And finally , after fifty years of operation of the industry there is still no commercially demonstrated permanently satisfactory solution for what to do with the waste .
I share these concerns with many members of the public , and , even if I did n't , the presence of broad political objections to nuclear power would make its future problematic .
That said , the issues with nuclear power seem to me somewhat less pressing than climate change , and in scenario building it turns out to be very valuable to allow the nuclear industry to grow for a while , and then buy them out at fair market value in due course .
In my scenario , I allow global nuclear to grow until 2025 ( at the historical 5.4 % annual growth rate that obtained globally from 1980 - 2006 according to BP data ) and then start buying out older and less - profitable plants to reduce the nuclear contribution by 3 % per year .
See The Most Frequently Asked Questions About Wind Energy for the case for wind .
Wind power is already cost - competitive with fossil fuel power , emits no carbon in operation , and has a very satisfactory EROEI of around 18 on average .
Wind power delivered has grown on average 23.7 % annually from 1990 to 2005 according to the IEA , and the new capacity delivered has been growing 30 % - 40 % annually in the last couple of years , suggesting that the growth rate is accelerating .
I feel wind is an excellent option .
However , many people differ as soon as someone tries to put a wind turbine near them - objecting to the noise , visual impact , and harm to bird - life .
Local political opposition to wind plants has frequently been very strong , and because wind is extremely diffuse , one needs to put an awful lot of turbines in place to garner it 's full potential .
For this reason , I assume wind continues to grow , but eventually saturates the politically acceptable sites .
The two countries that have the most wind are Denmark with about 1.1 TWhr / year per million people of wind production in 2005 , and Germany with about 0.33 TWhr / year per million people .
New wind installation in Denmark has largely stopped , and it appears to be slowing in Germany .
I treat the global politically acceptable maximum as around 0.5 TWhr / year / million people , and grow wind up to that point at the historical 23.7 % growth rate .
( This threshold is highly uncertain and my calculation should only be treated as qualitatively indicative .
If I 'm wrong , we 'll end up with more wind and less solar , but the issues are basically the same either way ) .
Wind power still produced only 0.2 % of global marketed primary energy in 2005 ( treated on a thermal oil equivalent basis with an assumed power plant fuel efficiency of 38 % - what BP does for hydro and nuclear electricity statistics ) .
Thus it will take a long time still for it to grow to providing an appreciable fraction of our power .
My feeling is that photovoltaics are the right answer for the long term future .
They do n't harm wildlife , do n't pollute , people around them do n't seem to object to them much , they do n't critically depend on anything in ultimately short supply , and they have outstanding energy payback .
For example , Nanosolar claims payback of manufacturing energy in less than one month for their state - of - the - art product , but more conventional options still have energy payback in the single digit years , implying an EROEI in the tens to hundreds as we go from current to future PV products .
There are two major issues to overcome : economics , and intermittency .
PVs are not yet economically competitive with fossil fuel energy , but there is a long cost history that lends itself to a fairly stable extrapolation that is quite encouraging :
Left panel shows cost of PV panels versus versus cumulative installed capacity .
Right panel shows a sensitivity analysis for the learning rate ( the percentage drop in the cost due to a doubling of the installed capacity ) .
Source : Fig 3 of McDonald and Schrattenholzer , Learning Rates for Energy Technologies .
The learning rate is the percentage by which some technology drops in cost per doubling of installed capacity .
Solar has been dropping at about 22 % for each doubling , and this is fairly stable , give or take a few percent .
If anything , the learning rate is improving slightly over time .
According to the IEA , the installed base of PVs grew at a combined average growth rate ( CAGR ) of 34.9 % from 1990 to 2005 .
Thus we would expect costs to drop by about 9 % per year , which would correspond to halving every eight years .
At current costs of about $ 4 / peak watt , unsubsidized PV power costs about 10c / kWhr in sunny places like Los Angeles and about 16c / kWhr in a cloudy place like Seattle ( from Solar Revolution , p 110 ) .
Thus it is probably already competitive with retail electricity in many sunny places , and will become competitive with wholesale prices of about 5c / kWhr in less than a decade in sunny places and in about 15 years in cloudy places .
With serious policy help , PV installed capacity can grow much faster than the 35 % global average .
Eg in Germany , PV has grown at a CAGR of 61 % over the same 1990 - 2005 period .
However , the global installed base of PV is miniscule - in 2005 it only comprised 0.0033 % of marketed primary energy ( on a thermal equivalent basis ) .
The effect of all these trends - tiny current installed base , rapid growth , very fast learning curve , high EROEI tends to mean that PV can be of almost no meaningful benefit to the global situation in the short term , but in a couple of decades from now reaches critical mass , and then will potentially be in a position to provide almost all of society 's power within a couple more decades from that .
Since PV can be readily fit into all kinds of otherwise unused surfaces on buildings , and also spread out over otherwise low - value desert , and can be applied in installations from a single panel up to thousands of acres or more , it can be ramped up very quickly - there are few barriers to deployment .
This is the basis for my selecting it as the backbone of long - term sustainable power for society in my scenario .
The remaining problem that needs to be solved is the intermittency ( PV provides no power when it 's dark and not much when it 's very cloudy ) .
There are basically two possible approaches to this .
The first is that we would install enough storage everywhere that the energy stored during the day would be enough to power usage at night .
I have not been able to construct a believable story about how current electric storage technology can scale to the required magnitude in a timely way , and thus this approach , as far as I can see at present , faces a critical bottleneck .
It 's one thing to have a battery that will power a plug - in hybrid for an hour commute .
It 's another to have enough batteries to get a region through a week of clouds and rain .
The second approach is to construct a global electricity grid .
As far as I 'm aware , this approach was first proposed by Sanyo under the rubric Project Genesis .
Their idea was to install PVs throughout the world 's deserts , and connect them up via superconducting cables to the world 's cities - they estimated 4 % of the world 's desert area would be required .
To get some feel for the issues , you might want to stare for a while at this screenshot of the planet :
View of the earth as of about 11 pm Pacific time on Friday 1/25/08 .
Source : Screenshot of OS X Planet .
Obviously , half the planet is dark at any given time , and about half the rest is under cloud .
We would have to be generating enough power in Africa , the Middle East , and the non-cloudy portions of Asia to power the globe , and then shipping it from those sources to wherever it was required all over the world .
12 hours later , those areas would be returning the favor .
Nighttime electricity use is only about 30 - 40 % of the daily peak , but it 's still a lot of energy to move .
The worst case seems to be early evening here in California in the northern hemisphere winter :
View of the earth as of about 6:30 pm Pacific time on Saturday 1/26/08 .
Source : Screenshot of OS X Planet .
In that case , Asia and Australia have to power their own daytime use , as well as evening use in the Americas , and residual night time use in Europe and Africa .
I imagine that the Australians would clean up financially with big PV arrays in the interior .
I have two changes I think are required to Project Genesis .
One is that most PV already is being installed on buildings in the urban environment , and I expect this to continue ( albeit supplemented by utility scale plants in waste areas ) .
The second is that I do n't want to rely on superconducting cables , since they are still on the drawing board , which violates my " no breakthrough " requirement .
However , existing technology for high energy transmission lines appear to be able to do the job , albeit with significant losses .
High voltage direct current lines lose about 3 % per 1000 km .
The earth has 6378 km radius , so it 's 20,000 km to go to the exact opposite point on the other side .
However , if we figure the average electron only needs to go about 2/3 of the way around the planet to get to its customer , then average losses will be 1 - 0.97^13 = 33 % .
In short , by shipping PV around the world , we lose about a third of the part that 's shipped .
However , if we figure on average two thirds of PV goes locally to the awake / bright side of the earth with little loss , and one third goes to the asleep / dark side at 1/3 lost , overall losses are a fairly manageable 1/9 of total power generated .
This is in the same ballpark as the losses of natural gas in LNG shipping ( about 15 % of the natural gas ) .
In short , existing technology appears able to get the job done - it's an enormous global infrastructure project , but does n't require breakthroughs .
Any breakthroughs in electric transmission can only make it better .
Before I analyze the costs required to build a global renewable electricity grid , let me summarize my total energy generation scenario as it stands at present ( I reserve the right to improve it over time ) .
I assume PV capacity grows at the historic rate of 35 % until 2012 , when the replacement for the Kyoto treaty comes into force .
Since I will be writing the treaty , in my scenario , it will call for a much accelerated rate of growth in renewables , and so PV then grows at the German rate of 61 % until 2025 .
At that point , it is reaching critical mass and will then slow down and just grow overall top line societal energy usage by 3 % / year .
But after about 2025 , energy will get cheap again and it's not clear how fast usage will grow - it will be constrained by demand , not supply .
Fossil fuel usage is assumed to be impacted in the near term by a significant US recession and global slowdown , and in the medium term by strenuous conservation efforts inspired both by high energy prices and the ongoing legislation / regulation process responding to climate concerns .
From 1979 to 1983 , overall primary energy consumption dropped as a result of the second set of 70s oil shocks .
I assume that , this time around , developing country demand growth is too robust to cause an actual drop in overall energy consumption , but I assume it essentially stays flat until the renewable energy explosion starts to really hit with wind making increasing contributions after 2015 , and solar PV starting to completely swamp the situation from the early 2020s on .
After 2025 , we can easily grow PVs and we can begin to aggressively retire the remaining fossil fuel and nuclear infrastructure .
This graph summarizes the scenario at present :
Global marketed primary energy production 1970 - 2050 .
Expressed in thermal equivalent of millions of barrels / oil day ( ie electricity streams such as hydro or photovoltaic are treated as if they had been converted from fuel at 38 % efficiency ) .
Source : BP for fossil fuel , hydro , and nuclear data , EIA and IEA for renewable data , and author 's calculations as described in the text for projections .
This is a scenario not forecast .
Of course , I would n't claim for a moment that my back of the envelope calculations will actually be the way things play out quantitatively .
However , it does seem to me that the qualitative features of this graph are likely if we do the required international public policy groundwork to install a global renewables grid .
The qualitative features I mean are a period over the next 15 - 20 years of high energy prices and slower global growth , followed by a period after that when renewables take off and become the main power source for society and energy becomes cheap again .
The remaining questions are around costs - can we afford to to do this ?
Well , if you look at my scenario , we need about 550 mbd of primary energy capacity , which under my assumptions corresponds to about 125 PWhr / year , or about 14 TW of electricity .
Of that , we probably need worst case capacity to move about half of it around the globe .
So we need 7TW capacity cables circling the globe in a roughly east - west arrangement , but let 's add 50 % for path deviations due to the complexity of land topography .
Therefore , we need 7TW x 60,000 km of cable capacity by 2050 .
Now , the cost of HVDC lines is ballpark $ 1m/km / GW .
So given that we need 7000 GW x 60,000 km , we will have to spend about 400 trillion dollars ( $ 2007 ) between now and 2050 to achieve that .
That 's a lot ( learning curve may reduce it somewhat - I 'm not assuming any ) .
However , if by this means we keep economic growth going , then the system will certainly be affordable .
Recall that above I gave the IMF investment data and a projection of it .
In my scenario , GDP from 2008 to 2050 totals about $ 7700 trillion , and investment at the historical ratio is $ 1700 trillion .
So the cost of the renewable grid is about 25 % of investment , or 5 % of GDP .
However , we save on all the fuel .
For example , in 2006 , the global fuel bill for oil , coal , and natural gas ( at commodity prices ) was about $ 3.6 trillion , which was 5.4 % of 2006 global GDP according to the IMF .
Presumably fuel prices going forward are not likely to be much better than 2006 .
Thus , although a global renewables grid would require a major investment over the course of the next forty - fifty years , it 's only comparable to what we would be spending on fuel if we stick with our current course of action .
And our current course leaves us with no idea what kind of climate we 'll be living in , and whether it permits civilization or not .
Well , with that , I 'm about out of time for this piece .
Next week , I 'll try to flesh out what some of the other sectors of the economy might look like .

As the year draws to a close , it will be tempting for pundits — liberal and otherwise — to despair at the Democrats ’ inability to wield their new congressional leadership to affect real and swift change in the country .
After all , the war in Iraq not only continues , but 2007 was its deadliest year .
FISA presents a greater danger to American civil liberties today than it did when the Democrats took their gavels in January .
And the radiant vision of Karl Rove being escorted down Pennsylvania Avenue to jail never came to pass .
But there have been successes , too .
Many have emerged as part of an aggressive oversight effort , which has dragged a number of scandals out of the shadows and into the cleansing daylight .
Democrats in both the House and Senate have led the way in exposing corrupt leadership at the Department of Justice , in revealing just how shadowy the president ’s domestic spying program is ( and how unpopular it is among members of the federal law enforcement community ) , and in alerting the country to the damaging and deadly role private military contractors play in war zones .
So as we all take the measure of 2007 , here ’s the good , the bad , and the ugly in a year ’s worth of congressional oversight .
Quiet as a mouse .
There certainly have been gaffes , softballs , and missed opportunities .
And the most obvious are found in the Senate Committee on Homeland Security — the Senate ’s version of Rep. Henry Waxman ’s Oversight Committee in the House .
Unlike Waxman ’s enthusiastic probing , the Senate chair conducted zero proactive investigations into Bush administration malfeasance .
It ’s chairman ?
Connecticut ’s Joseph Lieberman .
Fit for a Prince .
Likewise , when Erik Prince , the now - infamous CEO of private military contractor Blackwater , was called to testify before Waxman ’s committee on October 2 , many assumed he ’d be slaughtered .
Blackwater contractors had recently massacred more than a dozen Iraqis and had been implicated in a host of other atrocities .
Waxman even came armed with a long and damning report about the company ’s misdeeds .
But by the end of the hearing , Prince had found his stride .
He shifted the focus from Blackwater to structural problems with the war effort in Iraq and refused to disclose how much of his company ’s billion dollars in federal contracts constituted profit .
He closed by graciously thanking the committee for its hospitality .
“ Glad I could come here and correct some facts , ” Prince said .
Naming names — of sources .
Over the summer , the House Judiciary Committee created an electronic tip line for whistleblowers in the Justice Department .
Do-gooders provided enough personal information to allow the committee to investigate , but were assured the information would be kept in confidence .
And it was — until the committee accidentally sent a list of the whistleblowers ’ email addresses to every address that had been entered at the site , including Vice President Dick Cheney ’s public email : vice_president@whitehouse.gov .
Foresight is 20 /20 .
Blunders were n’t confined to investigations .
Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Charles Schumer helped Republican Judiciary Committee members endorse the nomination of then - designate Attorney General Michael Mukasey , despite his equivocal answers to questions about torture .
The full Senate confirmed him by a vote of 53 - 40 on November 8 ; just one month later , the Department of Justice revealed that CIA videotapes of two detainees being interrogated — and allegedly waterboarded — had been destroyed , despite widespread objections among members of the government in the know .
Given Mukasey ’s unwillingness to describe waterboarding as torture — and therefore a crime — some , including Senator Joe Biden , want an independent investigation of the matter .
The year started on a better foot for Democrats .
Mukasey ’s nomination was the result of months of congressional tenacity in uncovering the administration ’s lies and distortions about its firing of U.S. attorneys and its warrantless wiretapping program .
Throughout the spring and summer , the House and Senate Judiciary committees uncovered documents and held hearings that shook the Justice Department to its foundation .
Oops , did I say that ?
The U.S. attorneys scandal erupted almost immediately after the Democrats took over Congress , and , as such , became the focal point of their oversight .
In their first weeks in power , Democrats interrogated Justice Department officials and obtained documents at odds with their testimonies .
On May 23 , under a grant of limited immunity , Justice ’s former director of public affairs , Monica Goodling , told the House Judiciary Committee that her one - time colleague , then - Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty , had misled the Congress about the extent of White House involvement in politically motivated firings of U.S. attorneys .
Poor bedside manner .
Just days earlier , on May 15 , former Deputy Attorney General James Comey detailed for the Senate Judiciary Committee a 2004 attempt by then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to make then - Attorney General John Ashcroft sign off on the National Security Agency ’s so - called Terrorist Surveillance Program .
Delirious in his hospital bed , Ashcroft refused , referring Gonzales instead to Comey .
Comey thought the warrantless domestic snooping illegal and did not approve it .
When the White House attempted to go over his head , he and several senior Justice Department officials threatened to resign .
All in the family .
Prince ’s graceful exit from Waxman ’s October hearing was not the end of the Blackwater saga .
A big part of Blackwater ’s job in Iraq is to protect State Department officers , but former Inspector General Howard “ Cookie ” Krongard had a peculiar allergy to watchdogging the relationship .
On November 14 , we learned why .
Waxman ’s committee asked Cookie some tough questions — among them , did he know that his brother , A.B. “ Buzzy ” Krongard , was a member of Blackwater ’s advisory board ?
Cookie first insisted that his brother had told him otherwise in a conversation six weeks prior .
During a break , he called his brother Buzzy and , he says , learned the hard truth , prompting him to vow before the committee to recuse himself from all Blackwater investigations going forward .
The story did n’t end there .
Later that same day , reporter Spencer Ackerman of TPM Media reached Buzzy by telephone and learned that Cookie , according to Buzzy , had known of his brother ’s role at Blackwater for weeks .
In the wake of this revelation , Cookie stepped down from his position altogether .
Whether he ’ll face a perjury inquiry remains to be seen .
The attorney general has no clothes .
Perhaps the biggest oversight victory can be found in the dislodging of Gonzalez .
On July 24 , brewing Justice Department controversies came to a head when Gonzales appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee and embarrassed himself badly on a number of fronts .
In his testimony , Gonzales insisted , among other things , that the warrantless wiretapping program was a matter of little controversy within the Department of Justice — that all disagreements had involved another , unidentified intelligence operation .
But two days later , on July 26 , FBI director Robert Mueller , under questioning by the House Judiciary Committee ’s Rep. Mel Watt , admitted to having “ serious reservations about the warrantless wiretapping program . ”
The admission raised two possibilities : Either the wiretapping program had once been much more aggressive than we know , or Gonzales had directly perjured himself .
In September , following in the footsteps of a host of senior Justice officials , Gonzales tendered his resignation — a capstone of a series of investigations so aggressively obstructed that three current and former administration officials may well be held in contempt by one or both houses of Congress in 2008 .
Researchers assume that most of the novel DNA is microbial in origin , but they have yet to identify the organisms or see what they can do , because most microbes are notoriously difficult to cultivate in the lab .
Bacteria may happily swim through toxic waste , but when it comes to confinement on an agar plate , thank you , they ’d rather be dead .
Technical challenges notwithstanding , scientists have made some progress in investigating preposterous life forms and tallying the biochemical tools that such extremophiles use .
Thermophilic microbes , for example , which can withstand temperatures of 238 degrees Fahrenheit , well above the boiling point of water , have stiffening agents in their membranes , to keep them from melting away , and they build their cell proteins with a different assortment of amino acids than our cells do , allowing the construction of strongly bonded protein chains that wo n’t collapse in the heat .
By contrast , said Steven K. Schmidt , a microbiologist at the University of Colorado in Boulder , when you look at organisms that thrive in subzero conditions , “ their membranes are really loosey - goosey , very fluid , ” and so resist stiffening and freezing .
It turns out there are a lot of these loosey - gooses around .
Dr. Schmidt and his colleagues study the fridgophile life forms that make their home in glacial debris high in the Andes Mountains , 20,000 feet above sea level , where the scene may look bleak , beyond posthumous , but where , he said , “ we ’ve been pretty amazed at the extreme diversity of things we ’ve found . ”
The complexity of the Andean microbial ecosystem , he said , “ is greater than what you ’d find in your garden . ”
Yes , microbes were here first , and they ’ve done everything first , and synthetic lifers are happy to scavenge for parts and ideas .
Drew Endy , an assistant professor in the biological engineering department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and his colleagues are putting together a registry of standardized biological parts , which they call BioBrick parts .
The registry consists of the DNA code for different biological modules , interchangeable protein parts that they hope may someday be pieced together into a wide variety of biological devices to perform any task a bioengineer may have in mind , rather like the way nuts , bolts , gears , pulleys , circuits and the like are assembled into the machines of our civilization .
Numbering some 2,000 parts and growing , the registry contains many recipes for clever protein modules invented by bacteria .
One sequence engineered by researchers in Melbourne , Australia , encodes the instructions for a little protein balloon , for example .
“ It ’s based on a natural part found in a marine micro-organism that controls the buoyancy of the cell , ” Dr. Endy said .
Invisible though it may be , the microbial community ever keeps us afloat .
CBS , CNN obtain secret dossier alleging Pakistani vote - rigging scheme David Edwards and Muriel Kane

At the time she was assassinated , Pakistani opposition leader Benezir Bhutto was just hours away from meeting with two US lawmakers to hand them a dossier alleging that Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) was plotting with its Election Commission to rig the upcoming elections .
According to CBS
News , which has obtained a copy of the report , it " alleges widespread plans to stuff ballot boxes , rig voting lists , and intimidate , even kill , opposition voters . "
CNN quotes the document more specifically as saying , " Where an opposing candidate is strong in an area , they have planned to create a conflict at the polling station , even killing people if necessary , to stop polls at least three to four hours . "
The report , titled " Another Stain on the Face of Democracy , " was compiled from Bhutto's own sources within the police and intelligence services .
It was to be given to Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) and Rep. Patrick Kennedy ( D - RI ) , because Bhutto did not trust the Bush administration , which is seen in Pakistan as strongly backing Musharraf .
The dossier also accuses Musharraf 's regime of diverting US aid into political dirty tricks , charging that " ninety percent of the equipment that the USA gave the government of Pakistan to fight terrorism ... is being used to monitor and to keep a check on political opponents . "
Pakistani Senator Latif Khosa told CBS , " The ISI has set up a mega - computer system which has the capacity to hack any of the computers in Pakistan , and it is connected with the Election Commission of Pakistan 's computers and therefore they will overturn the results . "
Khosa also charged that computers are being used to change the voter rolls .
Pakistan 's government has called the allegations " ludicrous . "
Musharraf 's top spokesman told CNN that he had never heard of the dossier but that the allegations were " just a pack of lies ... laughable ... ridiculous . "
CNN analyst Peter Bergen noted , " There 's no reason to believe that she was killed because of this dossier , because the people behind her killing almost certainly are al Qaeda and the Taliban , and they 've got nothing to do with this election . "
That is the official Pakistani position , based primarily on allegations of intercepted phone calls from a pro-Taliban warlord who has denied any involvement .
Bhutto herself had accused Gen. Ijaz Hussain Shah , who has been named in the Pakistani media as part of the vote - rigging effort , of plotting to kill her .
Shah , described as a close personal friend of President Musharraf , is a former ISI official who now heads the civilian Intelligence Bureau , which supplied many of the guards surrounding Bhutto 's vehicle at the time of an earlier attempt on her life in October .

Although most undergraduates are fretting over acceptance letters1 , there has been recent interest in personal statements 2,3,4 .
Below is an outline of what I would consider a typical chemical personal statement .
With slight modification , it can also be used as a general outline for all bright - eyed science undergraduate personal statements .
1st paragraph :
© Molly Kelly
2nd paragraph :
3rd paragraph
4th paragraph
In my personal opinion , personal statements should only be one page ; you really should be able to summarize yourself that succinctly .
If you have a blemish on your record , I ’m not convinced it should be mentioned in a personal statement .
Negative statements about yourself will stick out more than all your positive ones ; so it ’s upon you , to make sure your negatives are even worth discussing .
Addendum : From my P.I. Heino Nitsche
I am asking students requesting a letter of recommendation from me to send in electronic form ( preferably WORD not PDF so that cut and paste is as easy as possible ) the following material :
1. Newest unofficial transcript ;
2. Updated resume , including honors , etc. , and undergraduate research
experience ;
3. Statement about their academic future ;
4 . List of anything good / volunteer work they have ever done ;
5. List of Universities ( including detailed addresses , points of
contact , and deadlines ) they are applying to ;
6 . Pre-addressed and stamped envelopes for mailing of the
recommendations .
A very important point is that the recommendation that will take the least amount of time for me is the one which I will provide first , i.e , . the better the students prepare their case , the less effort I will have to write it .
I usually ask the students to use the letter recommendation service of their university .
This makes thing so much easier for me because I have to write only one letter and the rest is
taken care of by the service .

Welcome to the big time , bloggers .
According to Chris Matthews -- taking cues from Bush , natch -- we 're in charge of the Democratic Party .
Andrew Sullivan and John Heilemann ratchet down Tweety 's hyperbole .
SULLIVAN : I wish he ( Bush ) just had as much focus on winning the war in Iraq that he has on winning the war against the Democrats .
I can't believe that in a moment of this war -- which is in a pivotal point -- that he 's playing Rove 's partisan politics ...
This clip is very much an interesting example of media trying to further narratives that their own talking points belie .
Matthews asserts that Democratic bloggers are in charge , but goes to his panel who unanimously say that the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate would not be responsive to bloggers .
He calls MoveOn 's anti-war efforts ( and let 's be clear , they are anti-Iraq occupation , not reflexively anti-war in general ) indicative of the far left and turns around and immediately agrees with Sullivan that 80 % of the population are anti-war now ... 80 % of the population being far left is one hell of a strange bell curve , Tweety .
In a NY Times op - ed today , prominent social analyst Gloria Steinem weighs in on America ’s persistent gender and politics problem :
Gender is probably the most restricting force in American life , whether the question is who must be in the kitchen or who could be in the White House .
This country is way down the list of countries electing women and , according to one study , it polarizes gender roles more than the average democracy .
Steinem is right about a great deal in this analysis , and while I do n’t agree with her that Sen .
Clinton is the best candidate for the job of president , I share her frustration at the cynical , regressive gender politics framing the public “ debate . ”
Women really are screwed when it comes to their pursuit of leadership .
They grow up in a culture where strength – which is the most important of all possible qualities in every phase of American life – is cast in strictly masculine terms , and as they train for positions of leadership the subtle , but clear message is that in order to succeed they have to become men .
If they adopt masculine styles , of course , they ’re bitches .
If they do n’t , they ’re weak .
We see this trap playing out yet again in New Hampshire , where Sen .
Clinton came dangerously close to showing emotion yesterday .
ThinkProgress provides an outstanding look at the ensuing hypocrisy of the “ press , ” which most days displays neither strength nor the slightest hint of intelligence .
Please watch the clip , because it ’s instructive seeing CNN , MSNBC and ABC tripping over themselves trying to out - stupid FOX ( with a good deal more success than we might hope for ) .
Pay attention – crying is weakness !
Well , unless , of course , it ’s a Republican male .
As our friends at ThinkProgress note , Mitt Romney can cry .
Robert Gates can cry .
Dubya can cry .
Dubya ’s daddy can cry .
But if Ed Muskey cries he ’s a simpering liberal pussy .
If a female candidate shows signs of humanity , we ’re faced with a choice : is she weak , or is she calculating and manipulative ?
There are reasons to prefer another candidate to Sen .
Clinton – real reasons , valid reasons that do not require you to demonstrate before the world that you ’re a drooling moron .
It ’s maddening having to watch all this 21st Century technology being deployed in service to 14th Century ignorance , though .
When Sen. Clinton had a near - emotional moment on the campaign trail after one of the most hellish weeks of her life it did n’t really tell me anything new about her .
I already knew she was human .
Sadly , the media ’s response did n’t teach me anything I did n’t already know about it , either .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China urged activists linking its stance over Sudan to the Beijing Olympics to play fair and rebel groups in Darfur praised the decision by film director Steven Spielberg to quit as an artistic adviser to the Games .
U.S. movie director Steven Spielberg speaks during a news conference announcing the creation team for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing in this April 16 , 2006 file photo .
Darfur 's splintered rebel groups on Wednesday united in praising Spielberg for quitting as artistic adviser to the Beijing Olympics , with one calling for athletes to follow his lead .
REUTERS / China Daily / Files
Spielberg said he was withdrawing his services because of China ’s policy on the Darfur conflict .
China is accused by critics of providing diplomatic cover as Khartoum stonewalls efforts to send peacekeepers into the western region .
His conscience would not allow him to continue his work on the opening and closing ceremonies for the August Games while “ unspeakable crimes ” continued to be committed , Spielberg said .
The Chinese embassy in Washington , while not directly referring to Spielberg ’s decision , called on “ relevant parties ” to respect the facts about the “ positive role played by China on the Darfur issue ” and shy away from politicizing the Olympics .
“ As the Darfur issue is neither an internal issue of China , nor is it caused by China , it is completely unreasonable , irresponsible and unfair for certain organizations and individuals to link the two as one , ” the embassy said .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice told lawmakers the filmmaker had taken his decision as a private citizen .
“ I think the role of the United States is not to make judgments about who participates in the Olympics or not , but to continue to stand for the very concerns that we have for human rights and freedoms in China and to use the opportunity to continue to promote those , ” Rice said .
Darfur ’s splintered rebel groups said the move by Oscar winner Spielberg could shame Beijing , a major investor in Sudan ’s oil industry and the East African country ’s largest supplier of weapons , into changing its stance on the region .
“ This will send a message to other countries , other individuals and athletes , who have n’t taken a strong stance on Darfur up to now , ” said spokesman for the insurgent Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) Ahmed Hussein Adam .
“ We are calling on all countries to boycott the Olympics , athletes as well . ”
NOBEL LAUREATES
Four Darfur advocacy groups said in Washington they planned to release new advertisements this week pressuring China .
“ The games China is hosting in Beijing ca n’t hide those it ’s playing in Darfur , ” said one of the ads from the Save Darfur Coalition and three other groups .
Some 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in more than four years of conflict in Sudan ’s western region of Darfur , according to estimates by international experts .
Khartoum puts the death toll at 9,000 .
A spokesman for the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games ( BOCOG ) said no reaction to Spielberg ’s move was expected on Wednesday while an International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) official said his decision was a personal one .
“ The IOC has not been part of the relationship between Spielberg and the Games ’ organizers .
It is not for the IOC to make a particular comment , ” the official told Reuters .
Spielberg ’s statement was released on the day nine Nobel Peace laureates -- including Archbishop Desmond Tutu , Elie Wiesel and Jody Williams -- sent a letter to President Hu Jintao urging a change in China ’s policy toward Sudan .
He sent his own letter to Hu in April after actor and Darfur activist Mia Farrow said he risked becoming to the Beijing Games what Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl was to the 1936 Berlin Olympics .
The winner of the European Union ’s top prize for human rights , Sudanese lawyer Salih Osman , said it was perfectly valid to use the Olympics as a stick to beat China .
“ This is a simple balance or decision between money and oil or people ’s lives , ” Osman told Reuters via telephone .
“ We cannot allow the Games to undermine the lives of innocent people in Darfur .
The Olympics is the opportunity to make China listen , why should n’t we use it as a stick ?
Spielberg expressed his position , so others should do the same . ”
New York - based watchdog Human Rights Watch said Spielberg ’s withdrawal should prompt others , such as governments , corporate sponsors and National Olympic Committees to press Beijing for reform .
“ These influential players should be prepared to show the steps they are taking to address the worsening rights climate in China , or they risk being tarnished by a human rights debacle , ” said Minky Worden , the group ’s media director .
The Chinese government has rejected attempts to influence their foreign and domestic policy by leveraging the Beijing Games .
More than 30,000 international media are expected to descend on the Chinese capital for the Games , intensifying scrutiny on the government and its human rights record .
The Games take place from August 8 - 24 .
Is It Normal to Hurt Others ?
More than you can stand .
Do you think that you ’re emotionally healthy ?
Do you have moments where you strike out at others verbally or physically ?
It ’s amazing how we ’ve all been hypnotized into believing that attacking others verbally is perfectly normal and healthy .
Some of us believe that we ’re doing just fine , and those unpleasant moments do n’t really matter .
The truth is that we all have moments when the weight of our lives threatens to crush us .
We may not think about it that way .
But in a moment , something within us says , enough , and anger or bitterness comes roaring out of us .
It may be a single overwhelming moment , or a combination of dozens or hundreds of moments , reaching back through the years .
There ’s no absolute standard of what ’s unbearable .
Failure , criticism , and embarrassment commonly cause us pain .
Two people may encounter the same words or the same criticism , yet they experience the intensity of the pain differently .
One may not even feel pain at all .
Some people bear the most difficult circumstances and people with calm , nearly untouched by events that would destroy others .
And then , there are people who find ordinary activities emotionally painful , and almost impossible to live with .
The question is , which experiences cause you pain ?
And when does the pain of one experience , or the collective pain of events take you to the point where you have to do something to release that pain ?
And even when released , does the pain go away ?
Or does it just slide under the surface , waiting for only a drop of new pain to make it burst forth .
How Do You Try to Release Your Pain ?
When the inner pain is too much , do you strike out at the most convenient target ?
Or does pain leak out from you most of the time , in the guise of a bitterness that covers everything ?
When we attack others , verbally or physically , it is because we are in pain .
But did that person cause the pain , or was she just in the wrong place at the wrong time ?
And if people vary widely in their sensitivity to pain , what does it mean to cause pain ?
Who is responsible for the pain ?
Is it the one who is unusually sensitive , and easily hurt ?
Or , is it the one who knew that the other person was sensitive , and still spoke in an ordinary way that causes her pain ?
In a world where each person seeks to perfect herself , I look for what I can do without trying to change anyone else .
Inner growth is tied to my sense of responsibility , and what I can accomplish without blaming others .
If I know what causes pain to others , and I can readily avoid being a source of pain , it ’s up to me to act in the appropriate way .
And then , as someone who suffers pain , it ’s up to me to be responsible for my own pain .
There is no law , no cosmic force that requires me to give over my personal power to anyone .
I do not have to hand a weapon to someone and say , “ Here .
I give you the power to hurt me . ”
I do not have to feel lasting pain , and be injured from the emotional attacks of others .
The intensity of the pain is affected by the way I think about it .
And the pain can come like the stab of a thorn , and disappear , if I learn to let it go .
But we hold onto our pain like a treasure .
We wo n’t let it go , and it circles within us , like a wound that wo n’t heal , drifting into and out of our awareness .
The lasting effects of those moments of pain are something that we can work on .
We can learn to release that pain so it causes little injury , and then disappears completely .
Where Does the Pain Go ?
What can I do to let go of all the pain within me ?
Here ’s the hard part .
If you have mental health issues , it ’s unlikely you can face it on your own .
You need help in choosing and applying the appropriate therapy .
For the rest of us , you may often need the experience and relative objectivity that a therapist provides .
When you look for a therapeutic modality , realize that there are methods that want to help you quickly release your pain , and do n’t require you to swim in it .
There are many therapies that are useful here .
Some like cognitive therapy help you change the way you think in the presence of pain .
Along with other methods , NLP , the Sedona Method , and the energy therapies like EFT and EmoTrance can help you change the way you relate to old pain and trauma .
What will your life be like when you finally release that old pain , so it is not awakened again and again , by everyday struggles ?
These therapies can also help you change the way you relate to new situations .
You might think that we ’re suggesting a solution that requires you to become cold like a stone , unfeeling and insensitive .
The goal is not to eliminate your emotions , but to let them come and go , without getting stuck in endless circles of pain and attacks .
It feels sometimes like our emotions seem to get frozen within us , as though a powerful river had been dammed up , unable to flow to the sea , and it seeks temporary explosive release wherever it can find it .
The energy therapies , EmoTrance in particular , can help you learn to relate to your emotions in a whole new way – as energy , which flows , and then , is completely released .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans do n't understand debt , which may be one reason that they have too much of it , according to a survey released Tuesday .
The survey presented 1,000 people with a hypothetical scenario about credit card debt and asked them to compute how long it would take to pay it off .
Only 35.9 % of the 1,000 respondents could figure out how many years it would take for the amount they owe on their credit cards to double .
A full 18.2 % did not know how to respond and 31.9 % of those surveyed over - estimated the timeframe .
The survey by Harvard Business School and Dartmouth College professors and TNS asked respondents to assess their debt levels .
Those who said they felt they were carrying too much debt were found to be " wildly wrong " when it came to using compound interest to calculate how long it would take to pay off that debt .
Of those polled , 26 % said they consider the debt they are carrying to be unmanageable , while 61 % said their debt level was " just right . "
Americans do n't realize they 're unaware of some of the complexities of personal finance - like compound interest - said Bob Neuhaus , the executive vice president and the head of the financial services sector in the U.S. for TNS .
" If financial literacy was higher , you would see more caution in the use of consumer debt .
It would not eliminate the problem , but it would mitigate [ it ] . "
The survey draws attention to a large problem without an easy solution .
" Even those with a college degree do n't have an understanding of the basic finance ideas , " said Annamaria Lusardi , Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College .
However , there are smaller , more manageable steps that can make a difference .
Harvard Business School Professor Peter Tufano , a self - proclaimed believer in financial education , does not see credit as inherently bad , but he said that debt services are much more complicated now than they were a generation ago .
He said credit card companies could help by creating more consumer friendly credit contracts that plainly spell out the terms , and bills that itemize outstanding debt so consumers can grasp the reality of how they spend money and how long it will take to pay .
A lack of savings could be compounding the consumer debt problem .
Another nationwide survey of 1,000 Americans released Monday by the American Savings Educational Council ( ASEC ) and America Saves found that a mere 53 % of Americans have adequate savings with only 28 % saving the recommended 10 % of their annual income .
Three - quarters of Americans surveyed said that they spend less than their income and save the difference , which may provide enough for an emergency unexpected expense , but only a little over 50 % have enough savings to provide for a comfortable standard of living in retirement .
However , those who make more money are able to sock away more for a rainy day , according to the savings survey .
Ninety - percent of the high - income group ( those earning at least $ 75,000 annually ) say they have adequate savings , but only 48 % of the low - income group ( those earning below $ 35,000 annually ) can say the same .
And 81 % of the high - income group report saving at least 5 % of their income , compared with 34 % of the low - income group .
Regardless of income or level of financial literacy , there is one unifying lesson : have a plan .
" Having a financial plan increases savings and financial stability , " said Stephen Brobeck , executive director of Consumer Federation of America .
REIMAGINING MACBETH REIMAGINING
MACBETH
Even if you 've seen Macbeth dozens of times , you 're not likely to have seen it the way Teller has re-imagined the Shakespearean classic .
" Let 's face it , that play is the ultimate supernatural horror thriller , " says Teller .
" All we 've done is bring that aspect to life . "
Teller and co-director Aaron Posner 's production of Macbeth , A Horror Show ) premieres January 15 in Red Bank , N.J. , and on Feb. 28 moves to the Folger Theater in Washington , D.C. It 's Tellers first foray into traditional stage work , and he hopes the skill he brings to bear - magic - will help people see the play the way the Bard intended in the first place .
" If you read Shakespeare 's stage directions , all the gore and violence is right in there , " he says , eyes widening .
" So when he writes , ' The weird sisters vanish , ' you better believe we 'll make them vanish . "
Teller describes with evident pride a scene where the psychologically tortured protagonist stares into a mirror , only to find , floating mysteriously before him , a dagger dripping with blood .
With Teller 's help , that moment creeps to life .
" It 's an old magic trick really , to make something appear and become real , but used in this context it really adds so much to the play , " he says .
But purists need not be alarmed .
" We have n't changed a word of the play .
The difference is , where people often opt to read the play first , we want them to come experience the show , and then go find out what it all means . "

Facebook LAS VEGAS  Drive up to Teller 's compound on the outskirts of town , and you 're immediately greeted by the sound of his voice over the gate intercom .
Which is , of course , surreal .
PHOTOS : Get deeper inside Teller 's Vegas compound
The one - name magician — he legally changed it ages ago — has been known for three decades as the non-speaking half of Penn & Teller , whose inventive magi-comedy act is rolling into its sixth year at the Rio Hotel and Casino here .
But the mute shtick is just that , a brilliant Harpo Marx - like foil to Penn Jillette 's booming Groucho .
Catch Teller at his homestead , however , and behold a chatty , erudite prankster who lives in his own personal romper room .
" Like much of my life , this house is a reflection of everything I wanted back when I was 12 , " says Teller , 59 .
" I love this house because it 's honest .
If you see a floor that looks like concrete , that 's because it is concrete .
But , ah , on the other hand , nothing is what it seems . "
Did we mention the house has multiple mirrors , hidden doors , screaming tables and one talking bear sculpture who plays card tricks on visitors ?
Like the man said , it 's a 12 - year - old 's dream .
Zoom back .
A decade ago , Teller spotted a 10 - acre rocky outcropping with great views of the Vegas Strip and the mountains and decided this was his Xanadu .
What rose on the spot is a squared - off fortress with an exterior of corrugated steel that 's interrupted by expanses of windows .
Inside , the structure is more maze than living space , 4,500 square feet of books , memorabilia , DVDs , as well as a coffin and the odd preserved human skull — macabre touches shared by Teller 's show - mate , Penn , who lives a mile away in his own eclectic mansion .
Teller 's house tour starts in the kitchen , which , like most of the house , is more functional than glamorous .
Whimsy rules .
Near the dual waffle iron is a plastic red sculpture of a man ; he 's pierced by five sharp paring knives .
In the small dining room next door is a bookshelf crammed with Simpsons figurines , not far from a chest - high rendition of Homer Simpson that dances and sings .
The room 's table is even more offbeat .
Crafted in glass and steel , it boasts a metallic skeleton at its center .
If guests come , just crank on the lever .
But be prepared for the accompanying screams as you distend the skeleton on its medieval rack , or , in reverse , the moans .
Teller demonstrates with all the decorum of a kid on Halloween .
" Pretty cool , huh ? " he says .
But Teller can quickly turn serious .
On the wall is a telling keepsake : an elegantly framed receipt for a cab ride given to comedian Buster Keaton in 1942 .
" It says ' Drunk , ' " says Teller .
" Keaton 's life went downhill fast after he joined a big movie studio operation .
The lesson is simple .
Never give up your independence . "
And then he 's off .
Next stop is an outdoor patio that stars a life - size metal bear .
As a guest approaches , the bear growls profuse personalized greetings .
" Smart bear , " says Teller , arching an eyebrow .
What 's more , he gave name to the house : The Bear Bones .
Back inside , Teller slips past a pint - sized media room , whose flat - screen television is almost bigger than the couch , and into the library .
Here , industrial lighting that usually does duty on docks is used to illuminate the book spines that line all four walls .
There 's no place to sit .
Among the many paintings on the walls are some done by his late father .
The two busts on display are of his mother and father .
There 's also a black raven made from rags , another Joe Teller handiwork .
Teller points to a painting of him done by an artist named Georgia Maher .
In it , he looks old and run-down .
" It 's my own Dorian Gray portrait , " Teller explains .
" Every year , I have Georgia come here and update the painting , and make me look just a little bit worse . "
Before you can ask anything else about this intriguing work , Teller leans a hand against one of hundreds of books on magic and … suddenly the entire bookshelf opens up into his private office .
" Got to have a secret bookcase that opens , " he says .
The office is crammed with papers , a computer and a vibraphone ( which he plays on stage ) .
A table and four chairs sit in his " Houdini corner . "
Among the memorabilia here are a set of hand restraints and a black cross owned by the late legend , as well as a brick from the hospital where he died .
Teller 's prized possession , however , is a letter from Houdini to his brother written after their mother died .
Teller eyes a deck of cards .
" Pick it up , " he asks .
" Shuffle it , cut it at a card , look at it , then walk over to the bear with it . "
Done .
" Hellooooo , " says the bear .
" Your card was the nine of spades … no , of clubs . "
Correct .
Teller offers a " do n't look at me " shrug and walks off .
" This way , " he says , and heads down a corridor crammed with DVDs , magic tricks and more books .
And then there 's the huge black coffin .
He opens the big box .
Inside lies a skeleton .
" For my 55th birthday I was kidnapped , stuffed in this coffin and taken to a Chinese restaurant , " says Teller .
" I actually called my mother from inside it . "
Teller points to the end of the corridor .
A window looks out on a range of mountains splashed by the sun .
" Before you leave , walk down there and have a look , " he says .
But when obliged , his unwitting subject barely manages to avoid crashing headlong into a … full - length mirror .
The door with the window is an illusion , a reflection .
Teller just smiles .
It 's the unmistakable grin of a 12 - year - old .

" We are told that a goldfish has a memory span of less than three seconds and that no matter how small its tank is , it will always discover new places and objects , " Rory said .
" I wanted to challenge this theory as I believe it is a myth intended to make us feel less guilty about keeping fish in small tanks . "
Rory 's experiment involved teaching a small group of fish to swim to a beacon by establishing a memory connection between the beacon and food .
Over a period of three weeks , he placed a beacon in the water at feeding time each day , waited 30 seconds and then sprinkled fish food around the beacon .
The time taken for the fish to swim to the beacon reduced dramatically , from more than one minute for the first few feeds to less than five seconds by the end of the three weeks .
Following the initial three - week period , Rory removed the beacon from the feeding process .
Six days later , he once again placed the beacon in the water and despite not seeing it for almost a week , the fish swam to the beacon in 4.4 seconds , showing they had remembered the association between food and the beacon for at least six days .
" My results strongly showed that goldfish can retain knowledge for at least six days , " Rory said .
" They can retain that knowledge indefinitely if they use it regularly . "
Rory also conducted a number of sub-experiments which showed that goldfish were capable of negotiating a simple maze , having them move onto a second beacon if they found no food at the previous one .
" My experiments showed that goldfish have the mental capabilities to learn and remember fairly complex concepts and they can retain that knowledge for at least a number of days , " he said .
Australian Science and Mathematics School principal Jim Davies said the series of experiments were an excellent example of science investigation made fun .

The Middle East has had quite a time with legal issues surrounding the use of free speech in regards to the web and other publications , along with a handful of other countries around the globe .
This is emphasized today with the confirmed detention of outspoken Saudi blogger Fouah al - Farhan by the Saudi Interior Ministry today .
While the reason for Mr. Farhan 's arrest on December 10 , 2007 has not been revealed , the officials have stated that he is not being jailed , only questioned , according to a report by the New York Times .
After writing about political prisoners ' plight in Saudi Arabia and accusing the government of lying in regards to its accusation of certain political advocates as terrorists , the Saudi government is apparently seeking a signed apology from Mr. Farhan , which he is not ready to give up just yet .
Friends of Mr. Farhan's are still posting on his popular blog , while also promoting his release from custody .
The matter of free speech varies drastically from country to country , and Australia has been inching towards a more regulated web existence with several pushes for controlled implementations of censorship on the Internet .
And the topic gets particularly heated when it comes to blogs : they 're often powered by larger entities , and easily found across the web thanks to search tools .
What we 're left with is a very sticky , very global issue of free speech and corporate responsibility , all speaking to the heart of the matter for governmental involvement and allowances .
While this is n't particularly the case with Mr. Farhan , how many more entities would need to get involved on the legal end if Mr. Farhan had not disclosed is identity ?

But neither has secured enough party delegates to secure the nomination to contest November 's presidential poll .
For the Republicans , Senator John McCain is on course to win all three races , beating rival Mike Huckabee .
With eight consecutive primary wins behind him , Mr Obama is beginning to look formidable and the manner of his victory on Tuesday looks ominous for Mrs Clinton , says the BBC's North America editor , Justin Webb .

" I 'm tested , I 'm ready , let 's make it happen , " she told supporters .

Mrs Clinton 's deputy campaign manager , Mike Henry , reportedly stepped down on Monday , in a shake - up coming only a day after her campaign manager left .
Meanwhile Mr McCain , who holds a strong lead over his Republican rival Mike Huckabee , told supporters he was " fired up and ready to go " .
Significant lead
With results counted in almost all of Virginia 's precincts , Mr McCain led by 50 % to Mr Huckabee 's 41 % .
In the District of Columbia , Mr McCain took 68 % of the Republican vote to 17 % for Mr Huckabee , with almost all the votes counted .

Mr Huckabee has been under pressure to stand aside for the sake of party unity , but has said he has no intention of pulling out .
Exit polls suggest he won the support of very conservative voters in Virginia by nearly three to one , while Mr McCain was backed by somewhat conservative and moderate Republicans .
Broad appeal
In Virginia , Mr Obama was leading by 64 % to Mrs Clinton 's 35.5 % , with almost all precincts reporting .
His margin of victory was even greater in Washington DC , where he led by 75 % to 24 % with almost all the votes counted .

Exit polls conducted for AP in Virginia suggested Mr Obama had won the support of two - thirds of men and almost six in 10 women .
Mr Obama also made gains with women voters , who have been a core constituency for Mrs Clinton in past contests , and with white men and Latino voters .
And nine in 10 black voters in Virginia backed the Illinois senator , an even bigger margin than in previous primaries .
The economy was the top issue for both Democratic and Republican voters in the so - called Potomac primary , named after the river that runs through the two states and the nation 's capital .

What are these ?
NBC ’s Heroes is , according to many fans as well as television rating systems , one of the best shows to come out of the Fall 2006 season .
It was a fun , interesting , well - written , show with a good mix of comedy and drama that boasted one of the most diverse casts on network TV .
Season one has its faults , yes , but the awesome usually far outweighed the bad .
Most fans eagerly looked forward to season two .
But when it finally arrived , many fans found themselves bitterly disappointed .
Gone was much of what we loved about Heroes , replaced by boring / tiresome / offensive plots and characters .
The faults of the first season increased tenfold and , just for good measure , a few more were thrown in .
Many of us wondered if it was worth watching anymore or if Heroes would turn into one of those shows that fans referred to as having a second ( perhaps final ) season that “ does n’t exist ” .
The show ’s creator , Tim Kring , acknowledged some of the problems and said he intended to fix them .
We approve .
But there is a lot that Mr. Kring did n’t mention .
And if we , the fans , are going to hang in there for the long haul , continue watching Volume 2 , and go on to watch Volume 3 , then we need to know that Heroes ‘ problems are going to be addressed .
Because it ’s not about just getting rid of troubling characters and ditching inconvenient plots , it ’s about understanding why those characters were troubling and why those plots made the audience twitch .
And beyond that , Mr. Kring needs to understand how issues of race and gender play into both aspects .
All of these issues have been explored , sometimes at length , in blogs and on message boards in fandom .
But is Tim Kring seeing all of that ?
Probably not .
Does he care what the fans think ?
Of course .
Is he capable of change and growth ?
Obviously .
Therefore we , as fans , have to find a way to make our voices heard .
We need to write a detailed critique of the plot , character , race and gender elements of Heroes .
We need to have one place where the producers and writers of Heroes can come and find what fandom has to say on these issues .
That ’s the purpose of this website .
We do n’t need to Save Heroes from cancellation or network misuse , we need to Save Heroes from itself .
Because it ’s not a lost cause .
It ’s still capable of being the amazing show it was in season one .
No , it ’s capable of being even better .
How can you help Save Heroes ?
Easy .
Just give your opinion on the Plot and Characters or Race and Gender issues in the show .
We ’re inviting all fans to contribute to a collaborative document in which we provide constructive , respectful criticism of the current season .
Whether you offer your original thoughts or point to existing posts on the Internet , all ideas are welcome .
Once we have enough contributions to create a coherent document , we ’ll put it together in total and digitally sign it .
Because of the writer ’s strike , Kring and the other writers can’t create any new Heroes scripts .
That makes this the perfect time to present them with our thoughts , so they can keep them in mind moving forward .
Timeline
Pursuant to this post , we ’re going to stretch the timeline out so that we have time to generate a deeper conversation about the issues that concern us re : Race and Gender .
So :
November – early January
Collecting links , essays and commentary .
Weekly roundtables discussing specific characters .
January
Putting together drafts drawn from the discussions and links provided .
Working with that draft toward a final .
End of January
Final draft revealed , signing , getting the letter to the producers and writers .

Police train in realistic situations with armed " suspects "
Taser training
How do you stop a man with adrenaline surging through his veins and a knife in his hand ?
After you 've used every possible means of restraint , what is left ?
That 's the dilemma the police face every day and that 's why they say they need Taser stun guns .
Pc Simon Ashton , a City of London officer , said : " We use what we call pain and compliance techniques , but we deal with people every day on whom that does n't work .
" It 's fight or flight , the rush of adrenalin .
It gives them a lot of strength and they can fight against us .
" So if we want to put handcuffs on them , what do we do ? "
Taser works by producing neuromuscular incapacitation ( NMI ) - disrupting signals from the brain to the muscles causing temporary paralysis .
Tasers are yellow precisely so they are not confused with a gun
Pc Ashton , who is on secondment to the Metropolitan Police and involved in Taser training , says it makes the muscles " freeze and tense " , forcing the subject into a " plywood state " .
He or she then falls over .
Taser generates 50,000 volts , although it is actually the amps delivered , not the voltage , that cause NMI .
Police stress that a household plug carries 13 amps , while Taser delivers 0.0021 amps .
It does this via two probes which are fired on wires into the subject .
However , they do n't need to pierce the skin and will work through thick clothing .
The initial disabling effect lasts for five seconds , but the probes remain attached so , if the person continues to resist , another burst can be delivered .
" We tell them they will come to no further harm if they comply with us , " Pc Ashton said .
A major part of Taser training is learning what to say and , from the moment it is pulled , the officer is constantly talking .
Two probes are fired at the subject to deliver the shock
The subject is told the device carries 50,000 volts and warned to look down at their chest at the red laser sight dot .
Then they are told that if they refuse to comply they will feel the full force .
The police hope the mere presence of Taser will be effective in many cases - what they call the power of " the differentiated use of force " .
" The people we deal with day in , day out see this bit of kit and know what it does , " Pc Ashton said .
" It 's a show of strength and it has a psychological effect that stops them in their tracks .
The other psychological effect is from the red dot .
Everyone seems to know what that means . "
Officers can also " spark "
Taser without firing it , producing a loud and threatening electrical crackle .
" But if the psychological effect does n't work we have the physiological .
" And you can't fight it .
It does n't matter what drugs or alcohol you 've had , it will freeze your body if it 's used correctly . "
' No lasting effects '
But the million dollar question - is it dangerous ?
Amnesty International said the weapons have been linked to more than 70 deaths in the US , while the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has reported that up to 18 people have died in Canada since 2003 after being stunned by a Taser .
Officers must justify any force they use , including Tasers
But , according to UK police , there have been " no severe or adverse reactions " since Taser was introduced in 2003 .
Pc Ashton said : " There are no recorded incidents of Taser causing the death of anybody .
" It definitely hurts but , unlike the restraint tactics we use which can cause broken bones or torn tendons , there are no lasting effects and you make a very quick recovery .
" There is a risk someone could fall over and smash their head , but is there not the chance that could happen with the tactics we use at the moment ? "
Wherever possible , subjects are shot in the back to avoid accidentally hitting the face or genitals .
Pacemakers are not a problem as they are easily able to withstand the amount of energy delivered .
But guidelines do warn that people of particularly small stature or small children could be at greater risk because their heart is not protected by as much overlying muscle .
" Of course , there are circumstances in which we would n't use it .
It could set off an explosive , for example , but it 's about having a range of options , " Pc Ashton said .
Ten forces
As of today , previously unarmed Metropolitan Police officers will carry Tasers .
They will join colleagues from nine other forces involved in the Home Office 's pilot of the devices by non-firearms specialists .
The Met officers are all members of the Territorial Support Group ( TSG ) who face violence , conflict and weapons in their work .
Eventually , 734 TSG officers will pass through Taser training at the Met 's specialist centre in Gravesend , Kent , but at any one time only six will be on shift carrying them in the capital .
Trainees are put into realistic situations to test their new skills .
These are created in a small , but crime - ridden " town " complete with houses , tube trains and burnt out cars on site .
They also practise with armed and moving targets and on firing ranges .
Last week , the Met opened the training centre to the media to demonstrate what goes on and why they believe the controversial new device is needed .
Police practise hitting targets with Tasers on a firing range
" It 's about protecting the people we 're protecting ourselves against .
We are using less force against them . "
At present , police have a number of weapons at their disposal - batons , metal bars , CS gas and their own feet , fists and brute strength .
But all of these require close proximity to the subject - often a risky business - and may still not be enough .
" We can try the Metropolitan Police pyramid display team as I call it and all pile on , but there 's a real problem with that in terms of public perception , " PC Ashton said .
" There 's also a high risk of someone suffering positional asphyxia .
" So we have Taser .
It 's going to allow our officers the first chance ever to deal with someone at distance , much like a firearms officer .
" Only this bit of kit can't kill and is unlikely to seriously maim . "
Hard drive
Part of Taser 's appeal in the government 's eyes is its accountability .
Officers must sign out each Taser cartridge they use and every one has a unique serial number and barcode .
When a cartridge is fired it sprays out 20 to 40 AFIDs - anti-felon identification discs .
These are tiny circles of paper which also carry the cartridge 's serial number .
These can be retrieved later to show where Taser was fired and which cartridge was used .
Each Taser cartridge has a unique serial number and barcode
Finally , each Taser is designed to automatically record when and for how long it was used .
It stores the last 1,500 firings .
" This is the most accountable piece of equipment the police have today , " Pc Ashton said .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) says it fully supports the use of Taser by firearms officers in situations " where there is otherwise a real risk that someone may have been shot and killed " .
But Chief Constable Charlie Hill said ACPO was reserving judgement on Taser 's use by non-firearms officers until the results of the pilot have been analysed .
The Metropolitan Police Authority , an independent statutory body which scrutinises the work of the Met Police , has expressed concern over Tasers .
It reluctantly supported the expansion of Taser use by the Met , but deputy chairwoman Cindy Butts said : " We remain worried about the message this sends out to London 's communities about the escalation of confrontation and need further reassurance that vulnerable people who may behave differently - the young , old and those with disabilities - will not be adversely affected . "
Your comments :
I have recently moved from South Yorkshire police to Western Australian police where they use tasers as one of their force options .
The taser is a good , useful bit of equipment , but needs to be used in a controlled , professional and closely monitored way .
Through training and strict monitoring I think it will prove to be a useful tool that will help protect the general public and make people think twice before offering violence in the presence of the police .
stephen moffatt , Perth Australia
I was tasered by police in the USA about 3 years ago during an incident that I was since cleared of .
To say that it hurts is an understatement .
I felt like being stabbed by 1000 sewing needles at once whilst dancing to nu-rave .
I didnt like it .
Tom Horn , Tranent
I grew up in England , and just like everybody else of my generation , I was taught that a policeman is your friend .
I do n't want to disillusion you , but a taser is a lethal weapon - it 's just another word for gun .
We 're still reeling as a nation feeling the shame of a Polish immigrant being tasered recently at Vancouver International Airport .
It was n't necessary , and the man died .
Philip Renouf , Victoria , BC , Canada
Thank God it can stop criminals in their tracks , they are everywhere here in Manchester !
I feel so sad to see police officers here cowering from criminals , this will make our offices a bit more like the American heroic police ; so you have all my encouragement .
Jack Ek , Manchester
I think two things are needed , 1 . more research should be done on affects of 50000 volts to vulnerable people such as pregnant women , children , pacemaker users and other people with health problems , and that 2 . only very highly trained police officers should ever be able to use them under strict guidelines - after all just look at what happened in a Canadian airport recently .
Marc , London , UK
Tasers for the Police .
About time too !
I have been sick to death of reading or seeing reports of thuggish louts resisting authority with impunity .
To see a female Police Constable confronting a non-compliant out of control body built thug without any form of real defence herself is , for me a member of the public , a no - go area !
Martin , Crawley UK
I think these things are dangerous even in a police officers hands .
If those spikes for some reason hit a person in the head it would no doubt be serious if not fatal .

It should be part of the Taser training for the trainee Police Officer to receive a Taser shock .
Thus , they might think twice before Tasering .
50,000 volts electric charge is too high and there have been deaths due to Taser shots , so there 's a need to make it less intense .
Also to consider is Tasers going into wrong hands .
Criminals will be more trigger friendly with Tasers compare to guns .

I am a serving Police Officer , not a member of any specialist team - just a response Officer .
The wider introduction of the Taser is long overdue .
We are the people who need to be issued this equipment as a matter of urgency .
We are the ones who go to violent domestic disputes , often alone , and often without any back - up .

A taser is a potentially lethal weapon and treated as such if the police come across a member of the public with one , yet they are going to allow non-firearms trained officers out onto the street with them ?
This is madness , such weapons should be restricted to officers who are qualified to use firearms .
We have already seen more than a few incidents in the USA which have resulted in death as well as inappropriate use .

It makes me angry just reading about this !
How can this once peaceful land end up like this .
I blame the Government for it 's heavy - handed approach , lack of respect for peoples rights and freedoms and basically creating a them and us culture .
It 's no wonder the average man reacts and resists the oppressive acts of this state !
Will this Government never learn ?!!

First of all : yes , I was sitting at home on a Saturday night watching the Democrats debate in New Hampshire .
Second , here ’s why I started clapping and cheering in the middle of the debate – something those of you who know me know I would tend not to do :
Senator Clinton had obviously made the judgment that she could get Senator Edwards to team up with her against Obama during tonight ’s debate .
It is a strategy I think she regretted rather quickly .
She accused Senator Obama of attacking Edwards as being unelectable , and accused Obama of switching positions on health care ( a characterization Obama clearly refuted just before this exchange which Senator Edwards refers to as “ some Associated Press story ” . )
Right now , all I have is the transcript which is below .
After Hillary attacked Obama for attacking Edwards , Senator Edwards responded :
Any time you speak out powerfully for change , the forces of status quo attack .
That ’s exactly what happens .
It ’s fine to have a disagreement about health care .
To say that Senator Obama is having a debate with himself from some Associated Press story , I think is just not – that ’s not the kind of discussion we should be having .
I think that every time this happens – what will occur every time he speaks out for change , every time I fight for change , the forces of status quo are going to attack .
Every single time .
And what we have to remember — and this is the overarching issue here – because what we really need in New Hampshire and in future state primaries is we need an unfiltered debate between the agents of change , about how we bring about that change , because we have differences about that .
But the – the one thing I do not argue with him about is he believes deeply in change and I believe deeply in change .
And anytime you ’re fighting for that , I mean , I did n’t hear these kinds of attacks from Senator Clinton when she was ahead .
Now that she ’s not , we hear them .
And anytime you speak out – anytime you speak out for change , this is what happens .
[ my emphasis ]
( From the New York Times .
The full exchange after the jump … )
Hearing Edwards respond , I literally started cheering .
If they had both teamed up against Obama , the night would have been very different .
But as Hillary glared at Edwards , it seemed as if the forces of history were aligning in Obama ’s favor .
Again .
…
I should say though , my judgment about the probable motive of Edwards ’ comments has changed since my immediate reaction .
Looking on it with an hour ’s hindsight , it seems clear that Edwards is trying to knock Hillary out of the race and make it a two - man race – with him facing off against Obama .
Especially after listening to him tonight , I want that as well .
I want the Democratic party to have a debate about how to accomplish change – and I am confident Obama will win .
Here ’s a video of Hillary just after the exchange described above getting a bit heated :
Edit :
In an unfortunate , but predictable turn of events , the highlight of the debate is not John Edwards ’s truly moving performance – both here and throughout – or Obama ’s cool demeanor and parrying of every attack , including those by the Republicans on the stage immediately before him – but Hillary ’s angry outburst – the one found at the very end of this clip .
Drudge is already linking to this .
And Jake Tapper of ABC
News sees this as the key event of the night .
If anyone can find the clip of Edwards talking about the “ agents of change ” that I referenced above – I ’ve been looking for it and I ’d love to put that in here .
To me , that speech changed the course of the evening – not Hillary ’s outburst .
Edit : Clip found .
Poor quality , but gets the point across .
Thanks .
And here ’s the clip that appears at the end of the longer one above of Hillary getting “ hoppin ’ mad ” :
Let me also defend my title here – as I am already sensing the flack coming in from the feminist angle about my title .
Yes , it ’s provocative .
But in reality , the “ bitch ” in “ bitch slap ” refers to the person slapping .
What I wanted to convey with the title was both the shock I felt ( and seemingly Hillary ’s as well ) at Edwards ’s move despite the fact that it was certainly foreshadowed by Edwards ’s previous debate performances .
In my mind , a bitch slap is a term used to describe a slap that “ is preceded by ample forewarning and delivered with a flourish ” .
That was Edwards .
And I loved him for it .
From the New York Times , this excerpt from tonight ’s debate :
SEN .
CLINTON : You know , I think that two weeks ago you criticized Senator Edwards in saying that he was unelectable because he had changed positions over the course of four years , that four years ago he was n’t for universal health care , now he is .
Well , you ’ve changed positions within three years on , you know , a range of issues that you put forth when you ran for the Senate and now you have changed .
You know , you said you would vote against the Patriot Act ; you came to the Senate , you voted for it .
You said that you would vote against funding for the Iraq war ; you came to the Senate and you voted for $ 300 billion of it .
So I just think it ’s fair for people to understand that many of the charges that have been leveled not just at me , but also at Senator Edwards , are not totally , you know , unrelated to the very record that you have .
And you ’ve said records matter , and I think that we should get into examining everybody ’s record .
SEN .
OBAMA : Let me – I want John to be able to get in on this , but since this was directed at me , let me just make sure that I — I address this .
First of all , I never said John was unelectable .
Somebody asked me specifically what did I think was the difference between myself and John , and I pointed out some areas where I thought we had some differences .
And – SEN .
CLINTON : And you said that he had changed positions , did you not ?
SEN .
OBAMA : And I did , because I thought that I had been more consistent on those positions .
I have no problem , Hillary , with you pointing out areas where you think we have differences .
But on health care , for example , the reason that I mandate for children is because children do not have a choice .
Adults do , and it ’s my belief that they will choose to have health care if it is affordable .
Now , that ’s a perfectly legitimate policy difference for us to have .
That is different from saying that I will refuse to cover or leave out a bunch of individuals .
And the last point I just want to make on this is — Charlie , is these are all good public servants , and everybody has great qualifications and has done good things .
But what I think is important that we do n’t do is to try to distort each other ’s records as , you know , Election Day approaches here in New Hampshire , because what I think the people of America are looking for are folks who are going to be straight about the issues and are going to be interested in solving problems and bringing people together .
That ’s the reason I think we did so well in Iowa .
MR .
GIBSON : You ’ve been very patient [ to Senator Edwards ] .
SEN .
OBAMA : You have , and I appreciate it .
MR .
EDWARDS : Thank you .
Thank you .
No , you ’re welcome .
You ’re more than welcome .
Let me just say a quick word about this .
You know , Senator Obama and I have differences .
We do .
We have a difference about health care , which he and I have talked about before .
We have a fundamental difference about the way you bring about change .
But both of us are powerful voices for change .
And I might add , we finished first and second in the Iowa caucus , I think in part as a result of that .
Now , what I would say is this :
Any time you speak out powerfully for change , the forces of status quo attack .
That ’s exactly what happens .
It ’s fine to have a disagreement about health care .
To say that Senator Obama is having a debate with himself from some Associated Press story , I think is just not — that ’s not the kind of discussion we should be having .
I think that every time this happens — what will occur every time he speaks out for change , every time I fight for change , the forces of status quo are going to attack .
Every single time .
And what we have to remember — and this is the overarching issue here — because what we really need in New Hampshire and in future state primaries is we need an unfiltered debate between the agents of change , about how we bring about that change , because we have differences about that .
But the — the one thing I do not argue with him about is he believes deeply in change and I believe deeply in change .
And anytime you ’re fighting for that , I mean , I did n’t hear these kinds of attacks from Senator Clinton when she was ahead .
Now that she ’s not , we hear them .
And anytime you speak out — anytime you speak out for change , this is what happens .

Many of you Americans may be feeling the early stages of drama withdrawal .
Sure ,
The Wire is happening and yes , there are still a few trickles of American excellence on the networks , like Friday Night Lights .
But it ’s dwindling and very soon it wo n’t be enough to get you through the night .
You may want to explore means other than your cable feed for getting hold of TV drama .
If you know a teenager who can hook you up , the internet may help you find the drama fix you need to get you through the hard times .
I know you guys are on strike , but at the end of a long day on the picket line , I ’m sure you want to relax with a good show .
And what I ’m talking about here are dramas written under legitimate collective agreements .
Plus , the delivery system that you ’d be end running is n’t working for you right now anyway — hence the strike .
I ’m not advocating that you do anything immoral or illegal .
I am after all somebody ’s mother and an upstanding , law abiding citizen .
But I ’m also a TV junkie and I ’ve come across some stuff that you may want to check out and some other stuff I can suggest you avoid .
So here is my current international viewing report :
US Network PreAir Pilots
Canturbury Law looks like it could be watchable series .
The pilot offers an hour ’s worth of entertainment .
It ’s a bit of watered down Damages with one more of this season ’s female antiheroes .
Babylon Fields :
The premise is that dead people in the town get up out of their graves and start to live again .
Now you know everything that happens in the pilot and you do n’t need to watch .
One hour , one beat .
Eli Stone is going to air starting at the end of the month .
It ’s a lawyer meets superpowers show .
The superpower in question is that Eli has visions and a spiritual bent .
Also he can summon George Michaels .
I ’ll watch a second episode .
New Amersterdam is a cop meets superpowers show .
Homicide detective John Amersterdam can’t die until he meets his soul mate and since he wants to die , he is searching for the one woman he is meant to be with .
Or something .
I thought it was a pretty lame pilot with a few too many flashbacks .
Leaving the borders of the US , you could try out some of the new Canadian fare
The Border is worth checking out .
Start with episode 103 , it ’ll make you want to watch the rest of the season .
The series focuses on the agency that polices the Canadian border , it ’s fast paced , has lots of action and the story keeps turning with every new act .
Murdoch Mysteries :
This series airs premieres this week .
I ’ve seen a couple , enjoyed them both immensely .
Murdoch is a detective working in Toronto in the late 1800s .
He rides a bike and uses science to solve his cases .
It ’s funny , charming and has some great mysteries .
Leaving the continent , you can check out some of what the Brits have on offer
Oliver Twist 2007 : If you have n’t seen it yet , this British miniseries is easy to devour in a couple of evenings .
It clips along , looks dynamite and is much closer to the Dickens than any of the adaptations you remember .
Secret Diary of a Call Girl : omg , you have n’t seen it yet ?
Do yourself a favour , get hold of the whole first season , lock the door , take the phone off the hook and enjoy .
Remember to stay hydrated .
I ’ve got a whack of new British and Canadian series to make my through and I ’m pretty sure there ’s plenty of drama to get us through the strike .
I ’ll keep you posted .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Six years of investigations and prosecutions have turned up little evidence of Islamic jihadists at work in the United States , according to a study released Monday .
Zacarias Moussaoui was convicted in 2006 of conspiring to kill Americans on September 11 , 2001 .
The study , conducted by New York University 's Center on Law and Security , tracked 510 cases billed as terrorism - related when arrests were made .
But it found only 158 of those people arrested since al Qaeda 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks were prosecuted for terrorism .
In a statement issued Monday afternoon , the Justice Department said the report " reflects a serious misunderstanding " of anti-terrorism efforts and includes " wildly inaccurate " statistics .
The study found only four people -- including confessed al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui and " shoe bomber " Richard Reid -- were convicted of planning attacks within the United States .
" The vast majority of cases turn out to include no link to terrorism once they go to court , " the report found .
The analysis " suggests the presence of few , if any , prevalent terrorist threats currently within the U.S. "
The report questioned the usefulness of the anti-terrorist USA Patriot Act , passed after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , finding prosecutors relied primarily on previous laws .
" Although we are just beginning to discern the true extent and manner in which the administration has used the sweeping investigative powers granted by the Patriot Act , the record indicates that the criminal law provides an adequate tool set for trying suspected terrorists , " the report stated .
In his 2006 State of the Union address President Bush urged Congress to reauthorize the Patriot Act .
" We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to al Qaeda operatives overseas .
But we did not know about their plans until it was too late , " Bush said .
" So to prevent another attack --- based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from America . "
Receiving applause , Bush said , " If there are people inside our country who are talking with al Qaeda , we want to know about it , because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again . "
The Justice Department disputed the law center 's figures in Monday 's study , saying more than the 62 people who the study cited have been convicted of terrorism - related offenses since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
But the law center said most of those 62 cases involved people planning attacks overseas , not inside the United States .
And looking at possible attacks worldwide , just 7 percent of those arrested in what authorities called terrorism - related cases have been convicted of terrorism charges or providing material support for terrorism , the report said .
Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said that as of late September prosecutors had won 312 convictions in " terrorism and terrorism - related cases with an international nexus " since the 2001 attacks .
And Justice Department statistics found far fewer defendants had been charged with terrorism offenses between September 11 , 2006 , and September 11 , 2007 , than the 109 the report asserted .
" Our efforts to prevent terrorist attacks have moved our focus to the preparatory stages of terrorist planning and to those who would support and actively encourage such activity , " Boyd said .
He added , " We have used other criminal charges that apply to the facts of each case to disrupt terrorist activity before it occurs . "
In many cases , prosecutors used criminal conspiracy charges to obtain convictions against suspects like Jose Padilla , the accused al Qaeda operative found guilty in August of plotting to support overseas terrorism .
The Bush administration jailed Padilla without charges for nearly four years on allegations that he planned to set off a radioactive " dirty bomb " in the United States , but eventually tried him on unrelated charges .
The report praised what it called the increased effectiveness of the FBI , which it credited with breaking up plots to bomb fuel pipelines at New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport and attack an Army post at Fort Dix , New Jersey .
But it questioned the use of what it called " preventive arrests " by federal agents to disrupt plots rather than let agents continue watching suspects and gathering more evidence .

All About September 11 Attacks • Zacarias Moussaoui • Jose Padilla
The Senate plan also adds one provision considered critical by the White House : shielding phone companies from any legal liability for their roles in the eavesdropping program approved by Mr. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The program allowed the National Security Agency to eavesdrop without warrants on the international communications of Americans suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda .
AT&T and other major phone companies are facing some 40 lawsuits from customers who claim their actions were illegal .
The Bush administration maintains that if the suits are allowed to continue in court , they could bankrupt the companies and discourage them from cooperating in future intelligence operations .
The House approved a surveillance bill in November that intentionally left out immunity for the phone companies , and leaders from the two chambers will now have to find a way to work out significant differences between their two bills .
Democratic opponents , led by Senators Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , argued that the plan effectively rewarded phone companies by providing them with legal insulation for actions that violated longstanding law and their own privacy obligations to their customers .
But immunity supporters said the phone carriers acted out of patriotism after the Sept. 11 attacks in complying with what they believed in good faith was a legally binding order from the president .
“ This , I believe , is the right way to go for the security of the nation , ” said Senator John D. Rockefeller , the West Virginia Democrat who leads the intelligence committee .
His support for the plan , after intense negotiations with the White House and his Republican colleagues , was considered critical to its passage but drew criticism from civil liberties groups because of $ 42,000 in contributions that Mr. Rockefeller received last year from AT&T and Verizon executives .
Senator Olympia J. Snowe , a Maine Republican on the intelligence panel , said the bill struck the right balance between protecting the rights of Americans and protecting the country “ from terrorism and other foreign threats . ”
Democratic opponents , who six months ago vowed to undo the results of the August surveillance vote , said they were deeply disappointed by the defection of 19 Democrats who backed the bill .
After Downing Street , Dan DeWalt —
In a packed hearing room on Feb 19th , under a carved wooden sign reading “ Live Free or Die ” , the New Hampshire House committee of State - Federal Relations and Veterans ’
Affairs heard testimony on Representative Betty Hall ’s HR 24 , which calls on the U.S. Congress to begin impeachment hearings for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
What was most notable about the four straight hours of testimony was not that opponents of the resolution could only muster two people willing to testify against it , both Republican stalwarts using selected excerpts from Jefferson ’s parliamentary manual or from the bill itself , whose arguments were embarrassingly empty .
It was not that Kris Roberts , the committee chair , had taken this hearing seriously enough to have researched the law , history and nuances of the subject , and that he used this to inform the proceedings in a reasonably fair manner .
It was not the fact that after the hearing ended , several pro-impeachment witnesses were approached by committee members and thanked for their clarity and useful testimony .
It was not even the novelty of the interjections by one committee member that would periodically steer the conversation abruptly into Rockefeller / Trilateral Commission territory .
The most remarkable moment came late in the afternoon when Republican House member Steve Vaillancourt strode into the room to testify .
After passing out copies of the second chapter of Patrick Buchanan ’s “ Day of Reckoning ” as supporting evidence , Vaillancourt opened his remarks quoting “ fools rush in where wise men fear to tread ” , and it sounded like a set up to condemn a rush to impeach .
But instead he said that Betty Hall is neither fool nor wise man , but is a model of courage and that her impeachment resolution should be supported .
And then the fun began .
Member Vaillancourt then gave a short history lesson , telling the committee that until Bush / Cheney , America had never engaged in an offensive war [ sic. ] , and pointing out that the Truman , Eisenhower .
Kennedy and Reagan “ Doctrines ” had all been based on defense and had not been offensive in nature .
Warming to the subject , he delved into the ramifications of Bush / Cheney ’s actions , saying that their reckless foreign policy has been anti-American , unconstitutional , and ruinously costly to the nation .
He was fairly thundering by the time that he pronounced that not only should Bush and Cheney be impeached , but also they should be tried as war criminals in a Nuremburg style trial for crimes against humanity .
He flatly stated that the war in Iraq has provided grounds for war crimes charges against the President and Vice President .
And there was not one word of protest from a single committee member .
They may or may not support this resolution to impeach , but there seems to be no one left with a credible argument to defend Bush / Cheney .
Vaillancourt said that he spoke not as a Republican , a New Hampshire citizen or an American , but as a member of humanity .
His remarks made a common sense plea for an honest appraisal of our current political situation , for the acknowledgement that we have a duty to act as a decent and responsible people , and that principle be the governing factor of our government ’s actions .
These are all values that should , and once did , cut across party lines .
If the current political parties have forgotten this , and become so degraded as to allow the lawlessness and criminality of this administration to go unchecked , the people have not .
And at that hearing the people had their chance to speak .
One member of the committee remarked that she had never before seen such a wide range of viewpoints as represented by the witnesses , to be so united on one issue .
After deliberation the next day , loyalty to party leadership proved a stronger pull than reasoned argument , for five committee members voted to recommend the bill , with eleven voting against .
Now facing an uphill battle to get it passed in a full House vote in March , Betty Hall was still encouraged by the committee hearing and vote .
She has received much more support for this resolution than she did with a similar effort last year , and is already working to get grass roots supporters out between now and the vote to get their legislators ’ attention .
If the grass roots continue to pour out as they did on Tuesday , and if there were a few more politicians like Steve Vaillancourt and Betty Hall , we might see things begin to change .
It ’s instructive to remember that some politicians who are now leading the charge for impeachment did not want to talk about it only a few short months ago .
The spotlight is now on the New Hampshire House , the third largest deliberative body on the planet , and arguably one of the more democratic representative systems anywhere as well .
These representatives may listen to an outsider ’s viewpoint on what to do about the Constitution , but they will be influenced most by the neighbors whom they represent .
The question is , is New Hampshire angry enough and organized enough to convince the legislature to call for impeachment ?
For those outside of New Hampshire the question is , how can we raise the temperature everywhere else , making it all the more plausible that the Granite State will reach the boiling point .
One person was injured yesterday morning when a Hummer crashed into a school bus .
No children were on the Indianapolis Public Schools bus when it collided with the Hummer at Terrace Avenue and Madison Avenue , according to Marion County police .
Police closed Madison Avenue near Pleasant Run Parkway North Drive while firefighters worked to extricate the driver of the SUV out of the vehicle .
The victim was awake and transported to an area hospital .

The 86 - year - old died from head injuries
Allan Chappelow , 86 , was found beaten to death at his home in Downshire Hill , Hampstead , north - west London , in 2006 .
His body was hidden for about a month as a man stole his post in order to access his finances , jurors heard .
Wang Yam , 46 , of Hampstead , denies murder , burglary as well as four dishonesty offences .
The charges include obtaining a money transfer of £ 20,000 by pretending to be the writer and taking four cheques and post from the house .
Missing post
The court heard Mr Chappelow 's body was found under a pile of papers in a room at the dilapidated house , which is thought to be valued at £ 2.5 m .
Prosecutor Mark Ellison said Mr Chappelow had returned from a trip to America on 1 May and found his front door had been forced open and his post stolen .
This would have included correspondence about a " substantial amount of money " in his accounts .
The last time he was known to be alive was on 8 May when he telephoned the Inland Revenue to check that a tax rebate had not been amongst the missing post .
Highly intelligent
Mr Ellison said Mr Yam was using a form of identity theft known as " facility takeover " where the thief would impersonate the victim over the internet or telephone .
The court heard that in September 2005 the defendant had declared himself bankrupt after amassing debts of £ 1.1 m with virtually no assets .
" There is no evidence that the defendant and Mr Chappelow were known to each other - but there is evidence of Mr Wang 's dire financial circumstances while he continued to put himself about as someone with the money to purchase properties worth more than £ 1 m in the Hampstead area , " said Mr Ellison .
The court was told how Mr Chappelow had been a successful author , particularly in the 1960s when he wrote two biographies of George Bernard Shaw .
At the time of his death he lived alone in the house with rubbish piled up on the inside and out .
Before the case started jurors were told that part of the trial would be heard " in camera " where the press and public would be excluded .
The case continues .
There are too many moments these days when we cannot recognize our country .
Sunday was one of them , as we read the account in The Times of how men in some of the most trusted posts in the nation plotted to cover up the torture of prisoners by Central Intelligence Agency interrogators by destroying videotapes of their sickening behavior .
It was impossible to see the founding principles of the greatest democracy in the contempt these men and their bosses showed for the Constitution , the rule of law and human decency .
It was not the first time in recent years we ’ve felt this horror , this sorrowful sense of estrangement , not nearly .
This sort of lawless behavior has become standard practice since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The country and much of the world was rightly and profoundly frightened by the single - minded hatred and ingenuity displayed by this new enemy .
But there is no excuse for how President Bush and his advisers panicked  how they forgot that it is their responsibility to protect American lives and American ideals , that there really is no safety for Americans or their country when those ideals are sacrificed .
Out of panic and ideology , President Bush squandered America ’s position of moral and political leadership , swept aside international institutions and treaties , sullied America ’s global image , and trampled on the constitutional pillars that have supported our democracy through the most terrifying and challenging times .
These policies have fed the world ’s anger and alienation and have not made any of us safer .
There ’s a lot to like about Obama as a candidate for President .
The man has gifts ; no doubt about it .
But the thing that fascinates me most is how hard it is to label him .
He ’s neither white nor black .
He ’s neither old nor young .
He ’s not a southerner or northerner because he grew up in Hawaii .
He ’s not too left or too right .
He ’s not too Christian , and even has a Muslim name .
He ’s not an old school politician or a newcomer .
He ’s not handsome in a standard way , yet he ’s attractive .
He ’s a man , but somehow projects a feminine vibe too .
I predict Obama will win the Democratic nomination .
In the general election he will lead in the polls but lose to John McCain because the Republicans will do a better job of rigging the election .

The Dutch capital may be unique as its geology lends itself to the technical feasibility of this scheme .
Moshé Zwarts explained , " Amsterdam sites on a 30 - metre layer of waterproof clay which will be used together with concrete and sand to make new walls .
Once we have resealed the canal floor , we will be able to carry on working underneath while pouring water back into the canals .
It 's an easy technique and it does n't create issues with drilling noises on the streets . "
( Thanks to Alex Haw for the tip ! )
Will the city of Amsterdam soon build " a labyrinth city " beneath its canals ?
Maybe so .
According to World Architecture News , " Newspapers around Europe have been reporting on the scheme , which requires the city 's canals to be drained to allow the construction of a vast underground mixed - use complex beneath .
" It 's an idea by Zwarts & Jansma architects , whose plans includes excavating " a range of underground facilities ... at various levels below the city .
" Apparently , the project is even technically feasible : But does that mean Amsterdam should really build it ?
For instance , World Architecture News is quite opposed to the project – yet the Telegraph reports that " the project has been approved by Amsterdam 's city council .
Construction work , lasting up to 20 years , is expected to begin in 2018 .
" Maybe they should build it and use it as a penal colony .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A divided Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday backed Michael Mukasey as attorney general despite concerns about the retired judge ’s refusal to denounce “ waterboarding ” -- simulated drowning -- as unlawful torture .
On an 11 - 8 vote , with two Democrats joining all nine Republicans , the committee sent President George W. Bush ’s nomination of Mukasey to the full Democratic - led Senate for confirmation , which is virtually assured .
All 49 Senate Republicans are expected to support Mukasey , along with up to half of the 51 - member Senate Democratic caucus , more than enough to clear possible procedural roadblocks , aides said .
Regardless , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared his opposition and said he may wait a couple of weeks before bringing Mukasey up for a confirmation vote .
“ It ’s been no secret how I feel about waterboarding , ” said Reid , a Nevada Democrat .
“ We have executed people for waterboarding Americans . ”
Critics have accused the United States of torturing suspects in the war on terrorism , with the CIA reportedly using the simulated drowning technique while interrogating at least three high - level detainees after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Bush says torture is prohibited but refuses to disclose U.S. interrogation methods .
Torture has long been barred by the U.S. criminal code and international treaties .
Bush ’s selection of Mukasey to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as chief U.S. law enforcement officer initially drew broad support .
Lawmakers were encouraged by Mukasey ’s vow to review administration security policies to make sure they adhere to the law and resign if Bush crossed the line .
But Mukasey ran into trouble at his confirmation hearing when he declined to say if he considered waterboarding torture .
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , opposed Mukasey and took a verbal shot at the White House , saying , “ Nothing is more fundamental to our constitutional democracy than our basic notion that no one is above the law . ”
“ This administration has undercut that precept time after time .
They are now trying to do it again with an issue as fundamental as whether the United States of America would join the ranks of those governments around the world that approve of torture , ” Leahy said .
MUKASEY’S ASSURANCE
Sen .
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , senior Republican on the committee , said he , too , had concerns about Mukasey ’s refusal to declare waterboarding torture .
Michael Mukasey answers questions on the second day of his Senate confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington October 18 , 2007 .
A divided Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved Mukasey as U.S. attorney general despite concerns about the retired judge 's refusal to denounce simulated drowning as unlawful torture .

But Specter said Mukasey assured him that if Congress passed legislation to specifically declare waterboarding illegal , he would uphold it .
Sen . Edward Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat , mocked such an assurance in opposing Mukasey .
“ Waterboarding is already illegal under United States law .
It ’s illegal under the Geneva Conventions , which prohibit outrages upon personal dignity , including cruel , humiliating and degrading treatment , ” Kennedy said .
In making the case for Mukasey , backers praised him as a fair and independent - minded former judge who could restore confidence in the Justice Department after Gonzales ’ stormy tenure .
Gonzales resigned under pressure and amid complaints he had injected politics into the administration of justice .
“ We urgently need , at this moment , someone to run that department , because right now , it ’s being run down , ” Specter said .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino welcomed the committee vote and said , “ Judge Mukasey has clearly demonstrated that he will be an exceptional attorney general at this critical time . ”
The two committee Democrats who voted for Mukasey were Charles Schumer of New York , who had suggested Bush nominate him as attorney general , and Dianne Feinstein of California .

Is Smarter Than I :" Giuliani vs. The Facts " Edition | Main | Blast From The Past »

Against Giuliani
" Hillary and Obama are kind of debating whether to invite [ Osama bin Laden and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ] to the inauguration or the inaugural ball , " says Rudy Giuliani .
Andrew 's right .
This guy is out of his goddamn mind .
You know , a few years ago , Sally Quinn wrote an article explaining why elite Washington had united against Bill Clinton .
In it , David Broder famously said that , " He came in here and he trashed the place , and it 's not his place . "
He got a lot of flack for that comment .
But it gets at an important truth :
That the media does , indeed , come together to repel perceived threats .
In Clinton 's case , it was a gauche striver .
He was a threat to DC 's prestige , or vision of itself .
Not the greatest danger in the world , but the media was quite effective in kneecapping him .
So what of Rudy ?
Rudy , after all , is a danger to the world .
Every reporter in this town knows that he 's become a pandering lunatic .
Why does n't Time have cover stories asking " Is hGiulianie out of his #( $ *^ mind ! ? "
Why are n't the Sunday shows filled with horrified reporters agreeing to disagree about much of the race , but uniting against the apocalyptic stupidity on evidence in the Giuliani campaign ?
Why are n't the various horserace reporters fitting every successive foreign policy pronouncement into an overarching narrative of Giuliani 's crazed belligerence , " which is causing serious doubts about his campaign among some in the GOP ? "
There is precedent for all this .
And in Giuliani 's case , the threat has the added benefit of being true .
You do n't need to make anything up , invent any scandals , concoct any problems .
You just have to honestly evaluate the words coming out of Giuliani 's mouth , the rhetoric coming out of his campaign , and the advisers circling the candidate .
It 's all there .
There 's no blowjob , I know , but there 's a real threat , and the media should , in its role as guardian of some minimal level of competency within the political process , be pointing out that this man is dangerous , his statements scary , his campaign unsettling , and his advisers insane .
His is not a normal candidacy , and so long as the reporters continue treating it as the equivalent of Hillary Clinton 's campaign rather than Pat Buchanan's , we 're in trouble .

" Hillary and Obama are kind of debating whether to invite [ Osama bin Laden and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ] to the inauguration or the inaugural ball , "
Do US voters want to see a guy who uses such smears in political discourse as a president ?
I hope NOT .
Even Bush largely kept away from this mudslining , leaving it to his supporters instead .
Giuliani not only has less class than Bush , he is even dumber ( yeah , sounds unbelievable , I know .. ) .

C'mon !
That should be enough to get anyone disqualified .
For anything , really , much less the presidency .
I have no idea why the Romney campaign is n't running endless " Do you know that Rudy Giuliani was married to his cousin ?!?!? " ads nonstop in Iowa and New Hampshire .

A TPM reader makes the point that the Dem candidates have n't targetted GOPpers in the same way the GOP candidates have focused on Clinton ( and to a lesser extent Obama and Edwards ) .
Of course , the media will only discuss the idea that Giuliani is a crazy fascist with a team of crazy warmongering advisors if a Democrat says it .
Otherwise , it 's not a ' campaign issue ' .
And then , if a Dem candidate does mention it , the preliminary will be a long discussion on whether Rudy 's obvious craziness ought to be a campaign issue : that is , whether the Dems are opening themselves up to accusations of ' being soft on national security ' by doing so , along with various tangents on whether Hillary can say this , because she has girl cooties .
In summary :
1 . If no Dem candidate mentions that Giuliani is a crazy , substance - free authoritarian whose campaign is based upon smears , petty insults and bullshit , it 's not a ' campaign issue ' .
2 . If a Dem candidate mentions it , it 's bad for the Democrats , because it raises questions of whether they 're ' serious on national security ' , 'an area where they 're historically weak ' ( TM every fucking Village idiot ) .
Welcome to American politics , 2007 .

The problem , though , is that while Rudy Guiliani 's pronouncements are certainly insane in real - world terms , they are n't terribly outside the realm of what is considered sane within the media discourse on foreign policy .
On the right , hawkish wing , of course .
But not outside the talk show / op - ed columnist circuit realm of " reasonable " policies .

Compared to Giuliani , Pat Buchanan is a combination of George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , and Pericles .

I do n't think they actually do perceive Giuliani as nuts .
They think that wanting to nuke Iran , repeal the Bill of Rights and establish military hegemony over the earth are perfectly legitimate goals that deserve respectful consideration .

I 'm sure if approached on the subject , Giuliani would just use the Coulter - Beck Gambit : " I was only kidding !

Rudy Giuliani's entire candidacy is premised on the lie that he was America 's Mayor on 9/11 .
He makes a fortune on the speaking circuit from it .
So if any candidate feels the need to invite Bin Laden to his inauguration , it 's Rudy .
He 's using the Rovian tactic of accusing his opponents of having the very weaknesses which Rudy himself has .
Very transparent .

I am not at all surprised by Rudy 's statement .
It is also unsurprising that none of the Democratic politicians came out and said that it is quit touching to see Rudy take time off from activities to devise plans to send more of our kids to die in Iraq and to spend this time in examining the guest list of the Hillary Clinton White House .

Now that 's really amusing as we watch Hillary , Obama and Edwards give away free ________________( fill in with expensive give - a- way du jour ) .
List to choose from :
Free healthcare
Free childcare
Free College
Free citizenship for illegal aliens
Guaranteed time off work
Guaranteed wage
On top of that , both Hillary and Obama went to Southern Churches and adopted fake Southern accents .
I 'd say the pandering , Ezra , is everywhere , even in your blind spot ( Democrats ) .

I do n't see why that 's confusing ... the GOP has a more open field .
Cutting an ad saying how you 're the " best candidate to beat Giuliani " is a waste of hundreds of thousands of dollars if Romney becomes the nominee .
The appropriate Democratic message right now is " Jesus Christ , all of those guys are morons " and I think they 're doing a decent job of that .
Personally , I think it 's a good idea for the Democrats to hold their ammo on any particular candidate until it's too late for the Republicans to retract their standard - bearer .
Contrary to Ezra , I 'm giddy over the idea of Giuliani becoming the nominee ...
Hillary 's attack campaign on him will be a three - month - long version of Sunday 's Patriots game .

ElV , None of your dishonest statements in any way detracts from the fact that Rudy Giuliani is out of his mind .
Why are you supporting candidates who are out of their mind ?
Do you endorse his insane stateements ?
I certainly do n't want my children exposed to people who froth at the mouth andclaim that presidential candidates will invite Osama bin Laden to the inauguration .
Why is it that these are the sorts of people you wish to associate yourself with ?
Are all Republicans supportive of this sort of immoral dishonesty ?
Does n't that place them at odds with mainstream Americans who do not believe such things ?
Why are Republicans pandering to their extremist , violent fringe ?

The comments to this entry are closed .
One morning in late 1997 , Stanley Miller lifted a glass vial from a cold , bubbling vat .
For 25 years he had tended the vial as though it were an exotic orchid , checking it daily , adding a few pellets of dry ice as needed to keep it at – 108 degrees Fahrenheit .
He had told hardly a soul about it .
Now he set the frozen time capsule out to thaw , ending the experiment that had lasted more than one - third of his 68 years .
Miller had filled the vial in 1972 with a mixture of ammonia and cyanide , chemicals that scientists believe existed on early Earth and may have contributed to the rise of life .
He had then cooled the mix to the temperature of Jupiter ’s icy moon Europa — too cold , most scientists had assumed , for much of anything to happen .
Miller disagreed .
Examining the vial in his laboratory at the University of California at San Diego , he was about to see who was right .
As Miller and his former student Jeffrey Bada brushed the frost from the vial that morning , they could see that something had happened .
The mixture of ammonia and cyanide , normally colorless , had deepened to amber , highlighting a web of cracks in the ice .
Miller nodded calmly , but Bada exclaimed in shock .
It was a color that both men knew well — the color of complex polymers made up of organic molecules .
Tests later confirmed Miller 's and Bada ’s hunch .
Over a quarter - century , the frozen ammonia - cyanide blend had coalesced into the molecules of life : nucleobases , the building blocks of RNA and DNA , and amino acids , the building blocks of proteins .
The vial ’s contents would support a new account of how life began on Earth and would arouse both surprise and skepticism around the world .
Although one of Miller ’s final experiments , it certainly was n’t the final word .
The last several years have seen a steady stream of corroborating evidence , including one experiment — so new it has not yet been published — that Miller ’s colleague , the late Leslie Orgel , called “ astonishing . ”
For decades , those studying the origin of life have imagined that it emerged in balmy conditions from primordial soups , tropical ponds , even boiling volcanic vents .
Miller and a few other scientists began to suspect that life began not in warmth but in ice — at temperatures that few living things can now survive .
The very laws of chemistry may have favored ice , says Bada , now at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California .
“ We ’ve been arguing for a long time , ” he says , “ that cold conditions make much more sense , chemically , than warm conditions . ”

Miller ’s frozen experiment is a striking testament to the idea .
Although life requires liquid water , small amounts of liquid can persist even at – 60 °F .
Microscopic pockets of water within the ice may have gathered simple molecules like the ones Miller synthesized , assembling them into longer and longer chains .
A single cubic yard of sea ice contains a million or more liquid compartments , microscopic test tubes that could have created unique mixtures of RNA that eventually formed the first life .
If life on Earth arose from ice , then our chances of finding life elsewhere in the solar system — not to mention elsewhere in the galaxy — may be better than we ever imagined .
The vial of ammonia and cyanide chilling in Miller ’s lab was just one of the chemical cocktails he kept , aging like wine in a cellar .
Some of the samples sat in freezers , others under the sink , and still others in water baths maintained at various temperatures .
They were part of an effort to understand chemical reactions that must have unfolded over millennia on early Earth .
The location of every sample was stored in Miller ’s head ; occasionally he would give one to a student to analyze .
Matthew Levy , once a graduate student of Miller ’s and now a molecular biologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City , recalls being handed one of the 25 - year - old samples to work on .
“ I was scared , ” he says .
“ I was thinking , these samples are older than I am . ”
Levy burned holes in his shirts over the next few weeks as he dissolved the samples with hydrochloric acid and ran them through an instrument called a high - performance liquid chromatograph to identify the chemicals that had formed .
Red and green pens on the device traced out telltale peaks on a scrolling strip of paper .
Those peaks corresponded to seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases .
“ What was remarkable , ” Bada says , “ is that the yield in these frozen experiments was better , for some compounds , than it was with room - temperature experiments . ”
There were people who found the results a little too remarkable .
When Bada and Miller submitted their findings to a top - tier science journal , the article was rejected .
A reviewer of the manuscript felt that those molecules must surely have formed while the samples were thawing , not while frozen at the ridiculously low temperature of – 108 °F .
So Miller , Bada , and Levy did more experiments to show that thawing played no role .
They published their results in another journal , Icarus , in 2000 .
The skepticism they faced was understandable .
Chemical reactions do slow down as the temperature drops , and according to standard calculations , the reactions that assemble cyanide molecules into amino acids and nucleobases should run a hundred thousand times more slowly at – 112 °F than at room temperature .
By that reckoning , even if Miller had run his experiment for 250 years — let alone 25 — he should have seen nothing .
This is the main argument against Miller ’s experiment , and against a cold origin of life in general .
But strange things happen when you freeze chemicals in ice .
Some reactions slow down , but others actually speed up — especially reactions that involve joining small molecules into larger ones .
This seeming paradox is caused by a process called eutectic freezing .
As an ice crystal forms , it stays pure :
Only molecules of water join the growing crystal , while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded .
These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice , and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often .
Chemically speaking , it transforms a tepid seventh - grade school dance into a raging molecular mosh pit .
“ Usually as you cool things , the reaction rates go down , ” concluded Leslie Orgel , who studied the origins of life at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , from the 1960s until his death last October .
“ But with eutectic freezing , the concentrations go up so fast that they more than make up ” for the difference .
Cyanide is a good candidate as a precursor molecule in the life - in - a - freezer model for several reasons .
First , planetary scientists suspect that cyanide was abundant on early Earth , deposited here by comets or created in the atmosphere by ultraviolet light or by lightning ( once the atmosphere became oxygen rich , 2.5 billion years ago , the process would have stopped ) .
Second , although cyanide is lethal to modern animals , it has a convenient tendency to self - assemble into larger molecules .
Third , and perhaps most important , no matter how much cyanide rained down , it could become concentrated only in a cold environment — not in warm coastal lagoons — because it evaporates more quickly than water .
“ The strong point of freezing , ” according to Orgel , “ is that you concentrate things very efficiently without evaporation . ”
Freezing also helps preserve fragile molecules like nucleobases , extending their lifetime from days to centuries and giving them time to accumulate and perhaps organize into something more interesting — like life .
Orgel and his coworkers proposed these ideas in 1966 , when he showed that frozen cyanide efficiently assembles into larger molecules .
Alan Schwartz , a biochemist at the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands , took the idea further when he showed in 1982 that frozen cyanide , in the presence of ammonia , can form a nucleobase called adenine .
And Stanley Miller likely had the eutectic effect in mind when he stowed his now famous samples in a freezing chamber full of dry ice and acetone .
While Miller and Orgel followed their clues in the lab , other scientists pursued their obsession with life ’s chilly origins to the ends of the earth .
In July 2002 a small skiff dropped Hauke Trinks on the beach of Nordaustland , a rocky island encased in glaciers and nearly devoid of plants .
Trinks , then a physicist at the Technical University of Hamburg - Harburg in Germany , had come to Nordaustland — far north of the Arctic Circle — to peer 4 billion years back in time to an era shortly after the end of the bombardment of Earth by asteroids .
According to some solar evolution models , the sun was some 30 percent dimmer at that time , providing less heat to Earth .
So as soon as the hail of asteroids stopped , Earth may have cooled to an average surface temperature of – 40 ° F and a crust of ice as much as 1,000 feet thick may have covered the oceans .
Many scientists have puzzled over how life could have arisen on a planet that was essentially a giant snowball .
The answer , Trinks suspected , involved sea ice .
Trinks had become interested in sea ice 10 years before , while studying its tendency to accumulate pollutants from the atmosphere and concentrate them in liquid pockets within the ice .
He set out to explore whether a layer of ice covering early Earth ’s oceans might have gathered and assembled organic molecules .
With a few crates of supplies and two sled dogs , Trinks and his partner , Marie Tieche , hunkered down in a cabin on Nordaustland for 13 months .
Each morning they monitored the temperature of the ice and prepared the day ’s experiments .
To study the networks of liquid pockets , Trinks injected dyes into the ice and watched through a microscope as they spread .
Winter deepened , 24 - hour darkness descended , and the mercury plummeted to – 20 °F .
Trinks continued his experiments , sometimes banging pans together to chase polar bears away .
Once a walrus lunged up through the ice and dragged several of Trinks ’s instruments into the ocean .
He built a makeshift lab table from planks of wood and discarded gasoline cans .
He examined slices of sea ice under the microscope , his hood pulled tight around his eyes .
Turning a knob with a gloved hand , he nudged a metal electrode nearly as fine as a red blood cell closer to an ice crystal .
The needle on his voltmeter jerked sideways , registering a sharp drop in voltage on the crystal ’s surface — evidence of a microscopic electric field that might arrange and orient molecules on the ice ’s surface .
By the time Trinks returned to Hamburg in 2003 , he had formulated a theory that ice was doing much more than just concentrating chemicals .
The ice surface is a checkerboard of positive and negative charges ; he imagined those charges grabbing individual nucleobases and stacking them like Pringles in a can , helping them coalesce into a chain of RNA .
“ The surface layer between ice and liquid is very complicated , ” he says .
“ There is strong bonding between the surface of the ice and the liquid .
Those bondings are important for producing long organic chains like RNA . ”
At a lecture in Hamburg in 2003 , Trinks met up with chemist Christof Biebricher , who was studying how the first RNA chains could have formed in the absence of the enzymes that guide their formation in living cells .
Trinks approached Biebricher with his sea ice theory , but to Biebricher , the experiments to test it sounded messy — more like a margarita recipe than a serious scientific investigation .
“ Chemists , ” says Biebricher , “ do not like heterogeneous substances like ice . ”
But Trinks convinced him to try it in his laboratory at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen , Germany .
Biebricher sealed small amounts of RNA nucleobases — adenine , cytosine , guanine — with artificial seawater into thumb - size plastic tubes and froze them .
After a year , he thawed the tubes and analyzed them for chains of RNA .
For decades researchers had tried to coax RNA chains to form under all sorts of conditions without using enzymes ; the longest chain formed , which Orgel accomplished in 1982 , consisted of about 40 nucleobases .
So when Biebricher analyzed his own samples , he was amazed to see RNA molecules up to 400 bases long .
In newer , unpublished experiments he says he has observed RNA molecules 700 bases long .
Biebricher ’s results are so fantastic that some colleagues have wondered whether accidental contamination played a role .
Orgel defended the work .
“ It ’s a remarkable result , ” he said .
“ It ’s so remarkable that everyone wants better evidence than they would for an unremarkable result .
But I think it ’s right . ”
Biebricher had loaded the deck somewhat , because he was n’t growing RNA chains from nothing .
Before he froze his samples , he added an RNA template — a single - strand chain of RNA that guides the formation of a new strand of RNA .
As that new RNA strand grows , it adheres to the template like one half of a zipper to the other .
This must be how the first genes , made of RNA , would have copied themselves .
But the first step was the formation of the original RNA molecule that served as a template , and how that step happened remains a mystery .
Ice may prove the crucial ingredient here , too .
Deamer and his former student Pierre - Alain Monnard ( now at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico ) have run experiments frozen at 0 °F for a month , without the aid of templates .
In those relatively brief experiments they already see RNA molecules up to 30 bases long , at least as long as other researchers have seen in similar experiments without ice .
That is a good start , but it leaves unanswered the question :
How do you get from tiny snippets of RNA to longer , well - crafted chains that could have acted as the first enzymes , doing fancy things like copying themselves
The shortest RNA enzyme chains known today are about 50 bases long ; most have more than 100 .
To work effectively , moreover , an RNA enzyme must fold correctly , which requires exactly the right sequence of bases .
A young scientist named Alexander Vlassov stumbled upon a possible answer .
He was working at SomaGenics , a biotech company in Santa Cruz , California , to develop RNA enzymes that latch on to the hepatitis C virus .
His RNA enzymes were behaving strangely :
They normally consisted of a single segment of RNA , but every time he cooled them below freezing to purify them , the chain of RNA spontaneously joined its ends into a circle , like a snake biting its tail .
As Vlassov worked to fix the technical glitch , he noticed that another RNA enzyme , called hairpin , also acted strangely .
At room temperature , hairpin acts like scissors , snipping other RNA molecules into pieces .
But when Vlassov froze it , it ran in reverse :
It glued other RNA chains together end to end .
Vlassov and his coworkers , Sergei Kazakov and Brian Johnston , realized that the ice was driving both enzymes to work in reverse .
Normally when an enzyme cuts an RNA chain in two , a water molecule is consumed in the process , and when two RNA chains are joined , a water molecule is expelled .
By removing most of the liquid water , the ice creates conditions that allow the RNA enzyme to work in just one direction , joining RNA chains .
The SomaGenics scientists wondered whether an icy spot on early Earth could have driven a primitive enzyme to do the same .
To investigate this , they introduced random mutations into the hairpin RNA , shortened it from its normal length of 58 bases , and even cut it into pieces — all in an effort to produce RNA enzymes that were as dodgy and imperfect as early Earth ’s first enzymes likely were .
These pseudoprimitive RNA enzymes do nothing at room temperature .
But freeze them and they become active , joining other RNA molecules at a slow but measurable rate .
These findings inspired a theory that the first , extremely inefficient RNA enzymes got help from ice , which created an environment that encouraged short segments of RNA to stick together and behave as a single , larger RNA molecule .
“ Freezing stabilizes the complexes formed from multiple pieces of RNA , ” concludes Kazakov .
“ So small pieces of RNA could be enzymes , not just large 50 - base molecules . ”
Equally telling , the pseudoprimitive RNA enzymes that Vlassov made grabbed and joined just about any other molecule .
Enzymes on early Earth might have done the same , joining random segments of 5 or 10 RNA bases to form a variety of sequences .
All these processes would occur in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice .
“ You have billions and billions of different possibilities , ” Trinks says , “ because you have billions of these small channels , ” each like a microscopic test tube containing a unique RNA experiment .
On the young Earth , pockets of liquid could have expanded into a network of channels that mixed their contents during freeze - thaw cycles , like day - night temperature changes in summer .
In winter , the liquid pores would have contracted and become isolated again , returning to their separate experiments .
With all the mixing , something special might eventually have formed : an RNA molecule that made rough copies of itself .
And as Earth warmed , these molecules might have found a home in newly thawed seas or ponds , where something even more complex might have emerged — such as a cell - like membrane .
“ You have something that is multiplying itself , and you have variation that is inherited , ” says Antonio Lazcano , a biology researcher and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico , in Mexico City ?.
“ There you have the onset of Darwinian evolution .
I ’m willing to call that living . ”
No one can really know if this is how life began .
Other theories posit that mineral surfaces organized key molecules or volcanic sources synthesized amino acids .
These theories need not be mutually exclusive .
Glaciers on early Earth could have scooped up mineral dust ; volcanoes could have rained ash onto nearby sea ice .
Primordial ice “ must have been full of impurities , ” Lazcano says , “ and those impurities must have had catalytic effects , enhancing the synthesis or destruction of some compounds . ”
Shortly after Miller finished his 25 - year experiment , he suffered a stroke that ended his career .
His laboratory , with 40 years of samples , was emptied in 2002 to make way for a building renovation .
Experiments that had run for years or decades were discarded without ever being analyzed .
As Bada rescued a few items from his mentor ’s freezer , safety personnel stood by in hazmat suits , sent by university officials concerned about rumors of toxic cyanide .
Any sample that could n’t be identified was incinerated .
Miller was present for a few hours of this ordeal , struggling to find words to identify the vials that he had known so well .
Miller died on May 20 , 2007 , but the provocative theory he helped nurture lives on .
In the latest twist , Miller ’s ideas are influencing not just theories about life ’s origin on Earth but also investigations about the potential for life elsewhere in the solar system .
In fact , it was a dinner conversation with Bada regarding Jupiter ’s moon Europa that prompted Miller to open his 25 - year - old samples back in 1997 .
While most scientists were focusing on the possibility of life in Europa ’s ocean , he and Bada had been talking about what biochemistry might happen in the 10 - mile - thick layer of ice atop the ocean .
Those speculations are more relevant than ever , with recent discoveries of geysers on Saturn ’s icy moon Enceladus and elaborate organic molecules on Titan , another Saturnian moon .
Recent studies show that Mars too has vast quantities of buried ice , especially at its poles .
If life arose in one of these frozen zones , it might still exist there .
Although life as we know it requires liquid water , there are places where life survives well below freezing .
In the microscopic veins that permeate Arctic ice , for example , the high concentration of salt can maintain traces of water in a liquid state down to – 65 °F .
Bacteria and diatoms inhabit those liquid veins , and Hajo Eicken , a glaciologist at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks , suspects that similar habitats could exist in the lower , warmer layers of ice on Europa , and perhaps on the other moons as well .
“ There ’s potentially hundreds of meters of ice , if not maybe a few kilometers , that may well be quite habitable , ” Eicken says .
Liquid water — and life — occurs in other cold places , too .
Films of liquid water persist far below freezing , like coatings of condensation , on the surfaces of some minerals .
Under some conditions , these films may stay liquid down to – 90 °F .
Bacteria beneath films of liquid water only several molecules thick have been found clinging to microscopic grains of clay in ice cores from Greenland .
Slowly consuming the iron in a single grain , these bacteria could get by for a million years before exhausting their food supply ; at colder temperatures , where metabolic demands are lower , they might survive hundreds of millions of years .
If life arose in ice on Earth , then why not on Mars , Europa , or Enceladus ?
“ You ’ve got to keep an open mind in this business , ” Bada says .
“ If I were going to make a bet about what we ’d find if we discover life elsewhere in the universe , I would suspect it would be more cold - adapted than hot - adapted . ”
Shawn Taylor , in his article Mismatching workers , jobs a costly mistake , ( free registration required ) has an astounding US statistic : employers lose a total of $ 105 billion a year by failing to recognize the talent that 's in front of their face .
That 's a lot of money .
Taylor 's article goes on to discuss the usage of tests to match candidates with jobs .
I asked about the tests , and he said the tests identify core competencies and assess soft skills , such as personality tests .
I do n't recommend personality testing .
Personality testing provides an indication of preference for a particular kind of behavior , not the only behaviors a person can choose to use .
And , based on personal experience , not the behaviors people necessarily exhibit at work .
And , I think you can use behavior - description questions to determine cultural fit better than a test does .
I 'm not aware of standardized tests that adequately test technical competencies .
But I know just what will test technical fit : auditions .
See these links about auditions :
Candidates , if you 're faced with a test , offer to also perform an audition .
You can even say something like this : “ I 'm glad to see that you think cultural fit is so important that I 'm taking this test ( or assessment ) .
Can I also showcase my technical skills for you by performing an audition ? ”
( See Faced With a Riddle or a Puzzle : Offer Problem Solving or an Audition . )
Matching candidates to jobs is important .
As a hiring manager , it 's your most important decision .
Even if you find test useful , do n't solely rely on them .
Also consider which kinds of auditions and which kinds of questions you 'll use when phone - screening and interviewing .

In this week ’s eSkeptic Will Dowd takes a look at what science really says about The Mozart Effect .
Dowd is a science writer based in New York City .
He received an M.S. in Science Writing from MIT .
He has written about neuropharmacology and the intersection of neuroscience and culture .
The Myth of the Mozart Effect
by Will Dowd
Whenever stalled on an intractable problem , Einstein reportedly reached for his violin .
He played to disentangle his brain and clarify the question at hand .
Mozart especially did the trick .
Einstein loved Mozart ’s highly organized , intensely patterned sonatas .
He felt , as many before him , that music and the reasoning intellect were linked .
Music and his scientific work , he said , were “ born of the same source . ”
It was with this same belief that Dr. Gordon Shaw , a University of California ( Irvine ) psychologist , corralled 36 undergraduates for a research experiment in February 1993 .
The students were given three spatial - reasoning tasks from the Stanford - Binet intelligence tests .
Before each task , they listened to ten minutes of either silence , a relaxation tape , or Mozart ’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major .
According to a paper published later that year in Nature , listening to Mozart boosted the students ’
IQ by an average of eight to nine points .
The improvement , researchers said , lasted between ten and fifteen minutes .
The results were widely reported as evidence of what the press dubbed “ the Mozart Effect . ”
The International Herald Tribune , for example , proclaimed “ Mozart ’s Notes Make Good Brain Food . ”
Don Campbell , a classical musician and former music critic , was the first to recognize the research ’s commercial potential .
Campbell expanded the definition of the Mozart Effect to include all music ’s influence on intelligence , health , emotions , and creativity .
In 1996 , he trademarked it .
Today , the Mozart Effect™ boasts the lateral spread typical of any successful brand .
Campbell has authored 18 books , a series of spoken tapes , and 16 albums incorporating Mozart ’s music .
The small commercial empire includes the recently published Mozart Effect for Children , which explains , in a chapter entitled “ Twinkle Twinkle , Little Neuron , ” that Mozart ’s music enhances the network of connections forming in the infant brain .
His recordings , one of which features Don Giovanni for the developing fetus , have sold over two million copies .
Since the U.C. Irvine study , the Mozart Effect has become fixed in the public consciousness .
Zell Miller , while governor of Georgia , earmarked $ 105,000 of the state ’s annual budget to supply every newborn with a cassette or CD of classical music .
“ No one doubts that listening to music , especially at a very early age , affects the spatial - temporal reasoning that underlies math , engineering and chess , ” he explained to the Georgia legislature .
In Florida , a bill was passed requiring all state - funded education and child - care programs to give a daily dose of classical music to children under five years old .
Recently , the coach of the New York Jets , Eric Mangini , began playing classical music to help his football players concentrate at training camp study sessions .
It remains to be seen whether Mozart ’s melodies will affect this season ’s record .
What the Science Really Says
While the Mozart Effect flourishes commercially , the U.C. Irvine study that launched the phenomenon has been widely criticized .
The startling results announced by the initial paper were misleading .
First , the researchers claimed that the undergraduates improved on all three spatial - reasoning tests .
But , as Shaw later clarified , the only enhancement came from one task — paper folding and cutting .
Further , the researchers presented the data in the form of Stanford - Binet IQ scores ; yet the study only measured spatial - reasoning , one - third of a complete IQ test .
To arrive at the full scores , the students ’ partial results were inflated by a factor of three .
The methodology of the study has also come under fire .
According to some critics , the test group of 36 psychology undergraduates may not have been large or varied enough to produce credible results .
Even Don Campbell has criticized the experiment ’s lack of controls .
In the endnotes to his 1997 bestseller , The Mozart Effect , Campbell observes that the U.C. Irvine researchers “ did not administer listening tests before testing , as many researchers in the field recommend .
Nor did they examine how posture , food intake , or the time of day modified their listening . ”
Naturally , Campbell believes that had these controls been in place , the Mozart Effect would have been more dramatically evident .
Many scientists have proposed alternative explanations for the study ’s results .
Who ’s to say that Mozart ’s sonata caused the difference in scores ?
Maybe listening to an annoying relaxation tape or ten minutes of dead silence impaired the students ’ performance .
Or perhaps the students experienced a change in mood and arousal rather than a fluctuation in intelligence .
One study found that listening to a Stephen King short story had a comparable effect on spatial - reasoning scores , but only for those who enjoyed what they heard .
Is it possible that Mozart ’s sonata had simply stimulated or uplifted the subjects in the U.C. Irvine study ?
After all , Shaw selected that particular sonata not just for its organized , cerebral quality , but because it is “ riveting ” and “ never boring . ”
But the most damaging blow to the Mozart Effect has been the failure of other researchers to reproduce the Irvine results .
Psychologist Kenneth Steele and his colleagues replicated the experiment in 1999 and found no trace of the Mozart Effect .
“ A requiem may therefore be in order , ” Steele wrote in Nature .
Dr. Frances Rauscher , co-author of the Irvine study , countered that the Mozart Effect cannot be found under all laboratory conditions .
“ Because some people cannot get bread to rise , ” she wrote , “ does not negate the existence of a ‘ yeast effect . ’ ”
But that same year , a Harvard psychologist analyzed 16 studies on the Mozart Effect , including the original experiment and concluded that any cognitive enhancement was small and within the average variation of a single person ’s IQ - test performance .
In 2007 , the German Ministry of Education and Research conducted a similar meta-analysis .
Their findings were unambiguous : passively listening to any kind of music , whether by Mozart or Madonna , does not increase intelligence .
The German report did , however , propose a link between musical training and IQ development .
According to recent studies , the motor and auditory skills developed for musical performance may have a long - term influence on intelligence .
In fact , brain mapping has revealed that professional musicians have more grey matter in their right auditory cortex than nonmusicians , as if practicing an instrument flexed a muscle in the brain .
It seems increasingly likely that the long - term practice of playing music , rather than merely listening , can have the kind of impact suggested by the Mozart Effect .
Einstein , after all , organized his mind by playing the violin , not listening to a recording .
Ironically , the U.C. Irvine researchers had initially planned to test whether music training for young children would increase higher brain function .
When Shaw , a particle physicist , developed an interest in neuroscience later in his career , U.C. Irvine gave him the freedom to research what he wanted .
But , according to his book Keeping Mozart in Mind , he had to make do with “ extremely limited resources . ”
So Shaw scaled down his ambition .
He thought , “ if music training might yield a long - term enhancement of spatial - temporal reasoning , then perhaps even listening to music might produce a short - term enhancement ! ”
Fourteen years and dozens of studies later , it is clear this analogy was off the mark .
Magic Mozart
What can explain the Mozart Effect ’s persistent hold on the public consciousness despite the lack of solid scientific evidence ?
No art - lover expects to absorb a better memory by staring at a Renaissance painting .
No reader hopes to pluck IQ points from a classic novel .
So why are Mozart Effect™ products snatched up by the millions ?
Perhaps it ’s unsurprising that Mozart , a historical figure enveloped in myths , should be at the center of yet another .
According to the most recent spate of biographies , the real Mozart was an incessant reviser addicted to his work .
Yet the details of the Mozart legend — his astonishing prowess as a child prodigy , his immaculate first drafts — have bolstered the popular belief that the composer was a fine - tuned antenna picking up snatches of celestial song .
Einstein did n’t help matters .
He described Mozart ’s music as “ so pure that it seemed to have been ever - present in the universe , waiting to be discovered by the master . ”
The creators of the Mozart Effect have eagerly traded on the composer ’s lingering mystique .
Campbell traces the source of Mozart ’s talent to his time in the womb : his father ’s violin playing “ almost certainly enhanced his neurological development and awakened the cosmic rhythms in utero . ”
Shaw also portrays Mozart as supernaturally gifted .
Keeping Mozart in Mind is packaged with a CD of the Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major .
“ Before you read further , ” Shaw writes in the Preface , “ I suggest that you slip the CD out of the book , make yourself comfortable , and listen to the magic genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . ”
To Shaw , Mozart is not a musical genius ; he ’s a magic genius whose music rains down brief moments of enhanced brainpower .
But Mozart is not the only magic genius .
The transformation of a dubious psychology study into a multi-million dollar industry also has a touch of the miraculous .
In The Mozart Effect , Don Campbell summarizes Shaw and Rauscher ’s conclusions — the scientific backbone of his brand — when he writes : “ Listening to music , they concluded , acts as ‘ an exercise ’ for facilitating symmetry operations associated with higher brain function .
In plain English , it can improve your concentration , enhance your ability to make intuitive leaps , and , not incidentally , shave a few strokes off your golf game ! ”
Campbell ’s translation of the U.C. Irvine study into “ plain English ” is inaccurate and insincere — an abracadabra that replaces questionable research with fantasy .
The Mozart Effect™ has carried on long after the initial study has been discarded because it was never about science to begin with .
If the Mozart Effect teaches us anything , it ’s that the results of a flawed study are always at risk of becoming a common expression , a copyrighted product , a popular belief infused with a magic that is difficult to dispel .
BERTIE AHERN , Ireland 's taoiseach ( prime minister ) , has good reason to smile .
He recently accepted his 26th pay rise in ten years , taking his annual salary to € 310,000 ( $ 446,000 ) .
He is now better rewarded for leading a country than most of his counterparts , including George Bush .
Nicolas Sarkozy 's pay increase this week of around 140 % only bumps France 's president up to $ 346,000 a year .
Heading a small , rich country is the best bet .
Earlier this year , Singapore 's prime minister was awarded a 26 % rise to some $ 2.1 m .

This afternoon , before the Times story came out , I was working on a post about national political reporters ’ tendency not to give much of any scrutiny to various McCain flipflops , contradictions and bamboozlements .
Obviously , the terrain has changed a bit since I started writing that one ( I ’d hoped to finish it up this evening ; either tonight or tomorrow early ) .
This is an odd story for a couple reasons .
We know that the McCain Camp went to the mattresses to get this story spiked back in December .
And some heavy legal muscle was apparently brought to bear .
When a story has to go through that much lawyering it often comes out pretty stilted and with some obvious lacunae .
And this one definitely qualifies .
Reading the Times piece it struck me as a bit of a jumble .
The reference to a possible affair is there in the lede .
But then most of the piece is a rehash of a lot of older material about McCain ’s record before getting back to the relationship with Iseman .
In terms of a relationship between the two , the Times piece seems quite hedged .
According to two staffers , staffers became concerned there was a romantic relationship .
They took steps to protect McCain from himself .
According to the Times sources , after being confronted by staffers , McCain “ acknowledged behaving inappropriately and pledged to keep his distance from Ms. Iseman . ”
The Post did a quick follow up in the wake of the Times piece .
But the emphasis is significantly different — suggesting the ‘ concern ’ on the part of the McCain staff was not so much about a potential affair but rather having McCain too close to a lobbyist while running a reformist insurgent presidential campaign , a suggestion that strikes me as rather dubious .
( Note the role of John Weaver in the Post story and possibly in the Times story too .
Weaver is a key figure in McCain ’s turn toward reformism and then turn back away from it . )
At the moment it seems to me that we have a story from the Times that reads like it ’s had most of the meat lawyered out of it .
And a lot of miscellany and fluff has been packed in where the meat was .
Still , if the Times sources are to be believed , the staff thought he was having an affair with Iseman and when confronted about it he in so many words conceded that he was ( much of course hangs on ‘ behaving inappropriately ’ but then , does n’t it always ? ) and promised to shape up .
And whatever the personal relationship it was a stem wound about a lobbying branch .
I find it very difficult to believe that the Times would have put their chin so far out on this story if they did n’t know a lot more than they felt they could put in the article , at least on the first go .
But in a decade of doing this , I ’ve learned not to give any benefits of the doubt , even to the most esteemed institutions .
Equally telling , though , is the McCain camp ’s response and their clear unwillingness to address or deny any the key charges of the piece .
( Read the statement closely .
It ’s all bluster . )
When it comes to sex stories even falsely accused politicians have some reluctance to get into nitty gritty denials .
But McCain — or rather McCain ’s communications office since it ’s in their name not his — does n’t even address it .
That tells you something .
So too does the Post ’s decision to jump in very quickly .
Charles Kaiser , at Radar , gives some of the backstory on the other publications that were in the hunt and why the Times may have pulled the trigger when they did .
Apparently some others were about to jump in too .
Reading all of this stuff I have the distinct feeling that only a few pieces of the puzzle are now on the table .
Given unspoken understandings of many years ’ duration , a lot of reporters and DC types can probably imagine what the full picture looks like .
But we ’re going to need a few more pieces before the rest of us can get a sense of what this is all about .
Barack Obama was trading at $ 7.12 a share , down one cent , in prediction markets yesterday , but still well ahead of Hillary Clinton , who was down a penny at $ 2.91 .
Could the markets know more about politics than the polls ?
Opinion polls show a tight race between the two candidates for the Democratic nomination .
But in the prediction markets , where investors stake their money on the candidate they believe will win -- and face a loss if they are wrong -- Sen. Obama is far ahead .
On the Iowa Electronic Markets , operated by the University of Iowa , Sen. Obama pulled ahead of Sen. Clinton in trading last week after Super Tuesday .
Meanwhile , on Intrade.com , which offers online trades in such diverse markets as Academy Awards and chances the U.S. will capture Osama bin Laden , Sen .
Obama 's recent wins have pushed him to a commanding lead .
Like bets on the Super Bowl , the odds set by the elections markets " reflect the wisdom of crowds , " says University of Pennsylvania business professor Justin Wolfers , who studies predictive markets and also writes about them for the online edition of The Wall Street Journal .
If the odds are wrong , investors will bet against them , reap a profit and cause a market correction .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A chain of retail stores in Britain has withdrawn the sale of beds named Lolita and designed for six - year - old girls after furious parents pointed out that the name was synonymous with sexually active pre-teens .
Woolworths said staff who administer the web site selling the beds were not aware of the connection .
In “ Lolita , ” a 1955 novel by Vladimir Nabokov , the narrator becomes sexually involved with his 12 - year - old stepdaughter -- but Woolworths staff had not heard of the classic novel or two subsequent films based on it .
Hence they saw nothing wrong with advertising the Lolita Midsleeper Combi , a whitewashed wooden bed with pull - out desk and cupboard intended for girls aged about six until a concerned mother raised the alarm on a parenting website .
“ What seems to have happened is the staff who run the website had never heard of Lolita , and to be honest no one else here had either , ” a spokesman told British newspapers .
“ We had to look it up on ( online encyclopedia ) Wikipedia .
But we certainly know who she is now . ”
Woolworths said the product had now been dropped .
“ Now this has been brought to our attention , the product has been removed from sale with immediate effect , ” the chain said .
“ We will be talking to the supplier with regard to how the branding came about . ”
Take it as a sign that Windows Vista failed to capture the imagination of Windows users , or take it as a sign that sensationalism sells .
Either way , the rumor mill is heating up with claims that the successor to Windows Vista — currently dubbed Windows 7 — could be released as early as next year , as opposed to sometime in 2010 , as currently expected .
The scuttlebutt ( condensed ) : some users have seen early builds of Windows 7 , including a poster at Neowin .
Ars Technica has also seen an older build , as we told you about more than a month ago .
A more recent build was reportedly described as Milestone 1 .
APC
Magazine claims to have seen a roadmap which puts M2 in an April / May timeframe , and a M3 in the third quarter of this year .
All of this points to a late 2009 release , they say , which is indicated by this " road map . "
Arguing about whether or not Windows 7 will ship in late 2009 is pointless .
No one can predict the future , and Microsoft 's own history shows that its roadmaps and predictions are not to be trusted .
A more interesting question is : should Microsoft be aiming for late 2009 ?
Should the company be aiming at a date , or should it be aiming at an experience ?
To be sure , a software company can't develop without some kind of general timeframe .
The question is what 's most important : the date or the product ?
Microsoft , please take your time
In its early days as Longhorn , perhaps the project was too ambitious .
But once Microsoft rebooted Longhorn 's development more than two years into the process , the company made a critical error : in a panic , it focused on when the product would ship , not when it would be ready .
Gates originally had it right .
In the thick of Longhorn development problems in 2004 , Gates tried to reassure everyone that the release would not become date - driven .
To this day , it remains a literary classic to me ( and , well , probably only to me ) :
This Is Not a Date - Driven Release
We have things where we say
The train is leaving on this date
Whoever has their act totally together
By that date the train will leave
And the train could have a lot of people on it
Or it could be
Fairly empty
— W.H. Gates III
Unfortunately , Vista did become date - driven , and even Gates seemed to admit that Vista shipped before it was ready when Gizmodo talked to him at CES this year .
Admission or not , it 's quite clear that things that were not " totally together " where included on the " shipping train , " and that the departure time became more important than the quality of the release .
With Windows 7 , Microsoft needs to deliver in a big way .
I personally would n't call Windows Vista a bomb , but Microsoft has lost serious mindshare and respect in the many years since Windows XP , primarily on account of Vista .
Vista will still sell well , if only because the momentum of the growing PC market will not allow otherwise .
It does not appear that Vista is driving PC growth , however , and even among Vista fans , the mood is somber .
What 's Microsoft to do ?
If you can't avoid a mistake , then you do the next best thing and learn from it .
You do n't want to move too quickly in an effort to fix your mistake , because you can end up making another , potentially costlier one .
In Microsoft 's case , the company can easily weather the trials and tribulations that Vista has brought it .
But should the company release another operating system that fails to gain a critical , but positive reception , it will signal a true crisis for the company 's desktop business .
While Microsoft can't wait until 2012 to release a new version of Windows , it should n't be putting a shipping date before the need to make this release rock solid .
Of dates and timeframes
Once launched in a couple of weeks , it will have taken Microsoft about 16 months to deliver the first Service Pack for Windows Vista ( Vista was released for businesses in November of 2006 ) .
A November 2009 release of Windows 7 would have afforded roughly 36 months of time between Vista and Windows 7 , or a little more than twice the time consumed by Vista SP1 efforts .
Sounds doable , eh ?
Keep in mind that a Windows 7 Milestone 3 in Q3 2008 leaves about a year for beta testing ; by this time , the build should be very close to feature complete .
As such , this would mean that Windows 7 would need to reach feature - complete status over the next nine months ( or , within ~ 24 months of Vista being released to manufacturing ) .
There was once a time when Microsoft could accomplish quite a lot in such a short timeframe .
Windows 98 was released in June 1998 , and within only 40 months ' time , Microsoft had released two major desktops OSes : Windows 2000 in February of 2000 and Windows XP in October of 2001 .
( Not to mention Windows ME in 2000 , as well . )
Sure , there were two separate teams involved back then , when there was a bifurcation between NT and the consumer desktop .
The point is , Microsoft could do it back then , but I 'd argue that company was a lot stronger then .
To regain its strength , Microsoft has to do two things .
First , it cannot let Windows 7 ship without the spit and polish that Windows Vista did n't get .
When time has n't been spent on refining the experience , the rough edges come to annoy customers .
Everything put in the OS needs to be ready for prime time , or be left out .
That 's not a timing issue , but a philosophical one .
Related to this , Microsoft must therefore not bite off more than it can chew .
Second , and more importantly , Windows 7 's milestones , beta process , and release to manufacturing should not be date - driven , but by the company determining what Windows 7 needs to be a truly worthy release .
Rather than worry about Software Assurance customers , Microsoft needs to worry about righting its ship .
If Windows 7 is a bomb , there wo n't be many Software Assurance customers left to worry about appeasing .
Windows 7 needs to bring with it the redemption of Microsoft .
That , my dear reader , cannot and should not be rushed .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke tells Congress he supports economic stimulus efforts .
Quick Vote Should President Bush 's tax cuts of '01 and '03 be made permanent ?
Yes
No or View results
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress Thursday that legislators should enact a fiscal stimulus package in order to help beleaguered consumers as recession fears grow .
The comments by Bernanke , who testified before the House Budget Committee , came as a cascade of more bad news about the housing , financial and manufacturing sectors stoked calls for decisive action .
" To be useful , a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as much as possible within the next twelve months or so , " Bernanke said .
Some economists have suggested that the economy is heading into a recession or may already be in one .
Stocks have plummeted this year , and big banks Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) reported huge quarterly losses this week resulting from bad mortgage investments .
Bernanke said that current losses from the subprime mortgage mess were probably about $ 100 billion but cautioned that this figure could wind up being higher .
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told lawmakers on Tuesday that Congress should consider a stimulus package of up to $ 150 billion .
He proposed an immediate injection of $ 50 billion to $ 75 billion through a combination of tax cuts and increased spending on unemployment benefits and other programs .
He also advocated that another $ 50 billion to $ 75 billion be set aside in case economic conditions weaken further .
During Thursday 's hearing , Bernanke said he thought a fiscal stimulus package of up to $ 150 billion , would be " reasonable . "
A spokesman for President Bush said Thursday that the White House also supports a short - term stimulus package .
Bernanke cautioned though that any stimulus " should be explicitly temporary " in order " to avoid unwanted stimulus beyond the near - term horizon and , importantly , to preclude an increase in the federal government 's structural budget deficit . "
The Fed chairman said that extending some of the tax cuts engineered by Bush in 2001 and 2003 , which are set to expire in 2010 , could have a positive impact on the stock market today .
He singled out the cut on dividend taxes as particularly key to stimulating the economy .
Bernanke stopped short of suggesting that the Bush tax cuts should be made permanent .
He said he 's most in favor of the " law of arithmetic " - regardless of what Congress spends on fiscal stimulus , it should make sure that it had the resources to support the package .
Rep. John Spratt , D - S.C. , the chairman of the House Budget Committee , said during opening remarks that he and other members of Congress would heed Bernanke 's warning about the budget deficit .
But Spratt maintained that something must be done to help consumers now .
He said the economy is in a " slump " - if not an outright recession - and cited concerns about " meager " jobs growth in December .
Bernanke said " it would be a mistake to read too much into one month 's data " but conceded that " developments in the labor market will bear close attention . "
Nonetheless , Bernanke said a stimulus package , in addition to further actions by the Fed , could help jumpstart the economy again .
" Fiscal action could be helpful in principle , as fiscal and monetary stimulus together may provide broader support for the economy than monetary policy actions alone , " Bernanke said .
The Fed has already cut its key federal funds rate three times since September and is widely expected to slash this rate , which impacts how much consumers pay on credit card debt , home equity lines of credit and auto loans , by another half of a percentage point on Jan. 30 .
The central bank has also loaned a combined $ 70 billion to banks since December through a series of three auctions .
But Rep. Paul Ryan , R - Wisc. , said in an opening statement that he is concerned that further interest rate cuts could " lead to further inflation down the road " and this could be costly to the long - term health of the economy .
To that end , Bernanke said the Fed continued to remain on inflation watch .
" Some important developments have occurred on the inflation front .
Most notably , the same increase in oil prices that may be a negative influence on growth is also lifting overall consumer prices , " Bernanke said , adding though that " overall and core inflation should moderate this year " as food prices and energy prices ease .
Those comments echoed remarks Bernanke made last week about inflation during a speech in Washington .
Bernanke , during the question and answer session , reiterated that he did not believe the economy would enter a recession , but he did say he expected the economy to grow at a " slow pace " this year and possibly into the beginning of 2009 .
But he added that the contraction in the housing market should finally begin to " wane " later this year .
Bernanke 's appearance on Capitol Hill failed to impress Wall Street , however .
Bonds rallied Thursday , pushing the yield on the benchmark 10 - year U.S. Treasury close to its lowest level in nearly four years .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions and low yields are typically an indication of a sluggish economy .
And stocks fell once again after the Philadelphia Fed released a report that pointed to more weakness in the manufacturing sector , adding to recession fears .
The government also reported Thursday that new home construction plunged last year .
" Bernanke did n't really say anything new today except for his emphasis on getting Congress to enact fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later .
That 's about the only new aspect of it , " said Hank Smith , chief equity investment officer with Haverford Investments , a money management firm with $ 6.5 billion in assets .
Many investors are hoping that the Fed would cut rates before its Jan. 30 meeting , Smith noted .
" The market is correct in reacting this way . " he said .
" They want less talk and more action . "
About two weeks ago , a Swiss wealth management firm filed suit in a federal court to have the Wikileaks site shut down .
The judge went along , entering a temporary restraining order that ordered the site 's domain registrar to eliminate the record for Wikileaks .
It was perhaps the most ineffective court order in recent memory , given that Wikileaks entries exist in many national top - level domains , and the site was still being served from its numerical IP address .
Its ineffectiveness , however , may be the least of its problems .
A hearing on the renewal of the restraining order is scheduled for Friday , and the EFF , ACLU , and Project on Government Oversight have joined forces to file a request to intervene in the case .
Their argument is that it violates the constitutional rights of a broad swath of the public .
" The public has a right to receive information and ideas , especially ones concerning the public interest , " stated Aden Fine of the ACLU .
" This injunction ignores that vital First Amendment principle . "
Further arguments focused on the fact that taking down an entire site to protect a small fraction of the material it hosted was a gross overreaction .
In a statement , EFF attorney Matt Zimmerman noted , " The First Amendment rights of readers who have a legitimate interest in the materials posted on the website simply cannot be treated as acceptable collateral damage to the bank 's claims . "
Steve Mayer , one of the pro bono lawyers involved , phrased it more colloquially : " The Supreme Court has warned against ' burning down the house to roast the pig . ' "
Public Citizen and the California First Amendment Coalition filed a separate brief ( PDF ) , arguing that the whole issue is moot .
In their view , the court had no jurisdiction to intervene in what 's essentially a legal disagreement between a Swiss bank and its Swiss employee .
Their brief also argues that the case is unlikely to succeed on its merits , so the injunction should not remain in place .
All these efforts were supported by a friend of the court brief signed by both corporate and public media organizations that include the Los Angeles Times , the Hearst Corporation , Gannett , the Associated Press , Scripps , the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , and Citizen Media Law Project .
It 's pretty clear that the initial court order was quite broad , given that the disputed documents represent a small subset of the content at Wikileaks .
The clumsy silencing of the site clearly had wider implications , and those have attracted some heavy legal guns to the fight .
While everyone waits for Friday 's hearing to address them , Wikileaks continues to serve content .
Comcast has acknowledged hiring people to fill seats before the start of a contentious federal hearing on how the company manages its broadband network , allowing its employees to take those seats when the filled - to - capacity hearing started …
Comcast said it hired people to hold seats only after an advocacy group called Free Press urged its backers to attend …
The practice of hiring people to fill seats in advance of public hearings is n’t unknown in Congress and other forums , but Comcast critics said this case was unique .
“ First , Comcast was caught blocking the Internet .
Now it has been caught blocking the public from the debate , ” said Timothy Karr , director of an advocacy campaign …
“ The only people cheering Comcast are those paid to do so . ”

Advocare Spark is claimed to be the latest formula that combines perfect ingredients to speed up energy gain for better endurance during the day .
However , to achieve positive results you will need to use the product as directed .
The company also claims that the product helps to boost the growth of the lean muscle mass of the user .
It also increases strength and improves health for those who rely on the product .
The official website of the company is low - informative .
Money payback guarantee is not clearly defined on the product .
It can be concluded that there is no chance to return the product back to the company since .
It is high time to discuss the ingredients found in the supplement .
Ingredients of Advocare Spark - Does It Really Work ?
Is It a Scam ?
The company 's site does not say much about the components of the product , so we had to do our own deep review .
Vitamin A ( Beta Carotene ) is the ingredient responsible for providing the user with healthy bones , eyes , and skin .
It boosts user 's health in general .
Since we are not aware of this ingredient 's amount used in the product , it is difficult to say whether it is safe or effective .
Vitamin C ( Ascorbic Acid ) comes in a water - soluble state .

There is a great number of customer reviews about Advocare Spark online .
Let us take a look at least at some of them .
" I have tried Advocare spark many times but every time I was disgusted with its taste .
I was constantly shaking my drink before sipping it .
Then I would get headaches and my belly seemed to swell .
I did not notice any increased energy levels from this drink .
I was disappointed that I spent $ 55 on one container and was n't even able to use it .
I can hear many positive things about this product but I did n't have any of the benefits . "
" I loved Advocare cleanses , but I hate AdvocareSpark .
This product is advertised to boost energy without any crash but I did not feel energized a bit .
I had more intense jitters than with any other energy drinks .
It made me feel terrible .
I experienced bloating , rash , and severe light headedness .
Be aware that this supplement is not regulated by the FDA so it can be harmful to use .
I would not recommend this drink to anyone . "
" Unfortunately , I did not like Advocare Spark , neither its taste , nor the effects .
It has a sweetener that can be very dangerous for the human gut , according to the research .
It is better to get energy in a natural way - by helping your body to work more effectively with safe and healthy foods .
I cannot recommend this supplement for anyone . "
Where To Buy Advocare Spark ?
You can buy the supplement from the official website of the product or some retail stores .
One canister of the product costs $ 99.99 on Amazon .
My Final Summary
Advocare Spark has too many disadvantages .
It contains ingredients that can be potentially harmful for the human health .
Caffeine is not suitable for people who are allergic to this compound , as well as those with heart or psychic disease .
There are many reports about experiencing side effects from actual users of the product .
A lot of users have complained that the supplement does nothing for them .
It means that it is not as effective as claimed by the manufacturer .
Advocare Spark acts as a laxative , so you are going to lose water , not fat .
This may lead to dehydration .
One can easily become addicted to this product .
There is risk of overdosing .
If you are looking for a supplement that would increase your energy levels and help you to lose weight , I do n't think that Advocare Spark will be of any help .
I cannot recommend this product to usage .
Affordable Alternative
I study a lot of different supplement designed for boosting endurance , physical performance and muscle growth .
And I can say that there is one worthy alternative on the market .
It is called CrazyBulk Winsol ( Winidrol ) .
It is one of the best supplements for body builders available in present day market .
This supplement claims to build lean muscle in a short period of time and without any side effects which usually occur when using similar products .
The best part about it is that you do n't have to take it too excessively but still you will be able to achieve the desired body shape with better stamina faster .
Winsol also improves vascularity and blood circulation , provides a lot of energy and decreases the recovery time after a workout .
I recommend reading my review about Winsol .

RIZLA cigarette papers are to carry warnings that excessive cannabis smoking makes you incredibly boring and likely to bore others around you .
The warnings follow new research into the dangers of so - called ' passive tedium ' which show that people exposed to cannabis smokers are often incredibly bored by the experience .
Professor Henry Brubaker , of the Institute for Studies , said : " You may think that your incoherent theories about the nature of music are interesting .
But the fact is , they are unbelievably boring and you have to shut up . "
He added : " The danger is other people become so bored they start to throw up and before you know it you have to make yourself look interesting by growing dreadlocks .
" It 's about as cutting edge and rebellious as my Gran .
Reggae ?
Thump , thump , thump .
Batty boys , Mr Bombastic .
What a lot of pish . "
A series of warnings will be printed on each individual Rizla paper including :
Smoking cannabis while pregnant will make your baby boring
Cannabis smoking will lead to a slow and painful conversation
Do n't stab people in the eye when you go all psycho and shit
Health minister Alan Johnson said that every day cannabis smoking bores 19,000 Europeans who do n't smoke cannabis .
He added : " We 're urging moderation .
There 's no need to roll a really fat one first thing in the morning , unless you have a stressful job like driving a train . "
The one thing worse than genocide .
One must first have no shame .
Then he / she must use a newspaper to find the obituary of a recently deceased man or woman .
Then must find a buddy , with no shame , who will aid them in this act .
The partners then go to the cemetary where they dig up their victim , and flip a coin .
The loser , ( or winner depending on how sick you are ) , applies his / her lips to the genitals or anus of the corpse , while the other partner procedes to climb the nearest tombstone and elbow drop the corpse 's stomach .
Thus forcing out a blend of rich bodily fluids and embalming materials onto the partners .
This blend is called mung .
The act of getting this blend on your face is called munging .
Chicks 'll dig this one .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Scientists can now tell where in the United States a person may have been by analyzing a single strand of hair , offering a new tool for crime investigators trying to identify a body or track criminals .

They said variations in hydrogen and oxygen isotopes found in hair could be matched to the regional tap water people drank , providing clues about where a person had been living .
“ In people with very long hair , you could get quite a long history , ” said University of Utah geologist Thure Cerling , whose findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday .
The tool would work best on hair samples taken from the head because hair grows continuously there .
Cerling and University of Utah biology professor James Ehleringer developed an elaborate map that details regional differences in the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes based on tap water samples from 65 cities in the United States .
To do that , Ehleringer sent his wife and a friend on a road trip to collect water and hair samples from barbers in towns in southern , central and southwestern states .
Cerling ’s children covered the northern United States .
They only gathered samples from cities with 100,000 or fewer people to ensure that hair samples were from local residents rather than tourists .
“ With the whole U.S. blanketed with samples of drinking water , we can see in the drinking water where the big gradients are , ” Cerling said in a telephone interview .
Then they looked to see if the same isotope patterns matched the hair samples .
“ We were pleased that they did , ” Cerling said .
ISOTOPE SIGNATURE
He said drinking water left an isotope signature in the growing hair .
Even people who drink bottled water still use tap water to make coffee or tea or cook pasta , he said .
“ You really do use a lot of local water in your everyday activities . ”
The researchers said isotope concentrations in drinking water varied because of regional differences in rainfall and evaporation .
Cerling said researchers could probably tell the difference between Utah and Texas , but not necessarily between Chicago and Kansas City .
Police officers are already using the tool to help identify a possible murder victim .
Todd Park , a sheriff ’s detective in Salt Lake County , Utah , sent Ehleringer hair samples from a woman whose remains were found near the Great Salt Lake in October 2000 .
An isotope analysis of the victim ’s hair showed she had moved around several states in the Northwest .
The researchers plan to do an analysis of her teeth to see if the isotopes can reveal where she grew up when the teeth were forming .
“ Every little bit helps , ” Park said in a statement .
“ This is definitely something that will give us a piece of the puzzle . ”
The researchers said the work had generated a lot of interest from police , but Cerling said the tool could also be used in anthropology and archaeology .
“ I also think it will have some interesting applications in wildlife conservation , ” he said .
Plans are afoot to build a manned base on the Moon .
As you probably would have guessed , there are quite a few hazards and dangers with sending humankind back to establish lunar “ real estate ” .
However , once our intrepid lunar colonists begin to build , the hazards will become less and development will accelerate .
This is all very well , but how will we gain that first foothold in the lunar regolith ?
What will be the best form of habitat structure that can be built to best suit our needs ?
These questions have some obvious and not - so - obvious answers from the structural engineers already publishing their ideas and building prototypes …
In Part 1 of this mini series on “ Building a Moon Base ” , some of the dangers facing astronauts and future colonists were outlined .
Moon dust could ( in all probability ) be a health risk , micrometeorites and other speeding projectiles could burst pressurized structures , highly energetic particles from the Sun could irradiate unprotected settlements , damage to machinery could be caused by the vacuum … generally a mixed bag of bad news .
But if anything else , we humans have the ability to beat the odds and succeed ( if politics and finances allow of course ! ) .
This second installment deals with the habitat structural concepts that are being planned to best serve the first , interim and permanent settlements on the Moon when we overcome all the odds .
“ Building a Moon Base ” is based on research by Haym Benaroya and Leonhard Bernold ( “ Engineering of lunar bases “ )
Many types of structure have been proposed for lunar colonies .
However , the main focus for mission planners center on cost and efficiency .
Structures fabricated on Earth , while viable , would have to be very lightweight to allow for easy launch out of the Earth ’s deep gravitational well .
It is generally envisaged that the first bases to be established on the lunar surface will be built on Earth , but once a base of operations is set up , with a contingent of human ( and perhaps robot ) workers / settlers , local materials should be mined and habitats fabricated in - situ ( i.e. built on the Moon ) .
Some of the structures currently being considered are detailed below .
Inflatable designs
Inflatable habitats have always been a favorite , optimizing living space whilst using lightweight materials .
As the Moon has no atmosphere ( apart from some very tenuous gases being “ outgassed ” from its surface ) , any habitat would need to be highly pressurized to simulate the terrestrial atmosphere ( to approximately 1 atmosphere or 101,325 Pa ) and atmospheric gas quantities .
Due to the high forces acting outwards ( by the maintained gas pressure ) , structural integrity of an inflatable can be assured .
Assuming the membrane of the inflatable is strong enough , risk of depressurization should be low .
There is however a massive problem with inflatables .
In an environment as vacuum - like as the Moon ’s , there is little protection from micrometeorites ( small , natural space rocks or manmade space debris ) .
Catastrophic depressurization could occur if a high velocity projectile causes a weakness in the membrane .
There are some solutions , such as covering the inflatable habitats with a layer of protective regolith , and extensive fail - safes will need to be put in place .
One design ( pictured left ) uses inflatable “ pillows ” to create a cuboid shape ( rather than the more natural spherical shape ) .
Many of these pillows can be aligned and added on to create a growing settlement .
They would maintain their shape by using high - tensile beams to battle against the bellowing membrane material .
Protection from micrometeorites and solar radiation would be provided by regolith .
Erectables
Classic erectables have been extensively tested and are an established form of construction .
With a focus on ease of assembly , one plan involves sending components into a low Earth orbit .
A frame can be easily erected and act as a tetrahedral , hexahedral or octahedral shape by which to base the design of a simple habitat module .
Once complete , the module could be shipped to the Moon where it will be controlled into a soft landing .
This method uses existing technology and may be one of the more feasible concepts of beginning a Moon base .
A basic structure could also be constructed on the lunar surface in a similar fashion .
Local materials
Ultimately , it is hoped that a settlement on the Moon will have an infrastructure capable of mining local materials , fabricating basic quantities and constructing structures with little or no input from Earth .
This degree of autonomy would be required if a thriving Moon base is to succeed .
However , to maintain airtightness within the habitats , a new form of concrete would need to be manufactured .
All components for a lunar concrete mix can be found on the Moon , although water ( and therefore hydrogen ) will be at a premium .
As the Moon is sulphur - rich , a different type of concrete ( minus the need for water ) may be created to aid with the construction of arced and domed habitats .
Some “ geotextiles ” may also be made via some advanced refining , creating filmy materials to seal habitat interiors .
Building using locally mined materials will most likely be one of the more advanced methods of construction on the Moon , so in the first stages at least , settlers will be dependent on the Earth for support .
Lava tubes
Ancient lava tubes under the lunar surface exist and may be utilized by colonists .
Using natural cavern systems will have many benefits , principally that minimal construction would be required .
Many advocates for this plan point out there are too many risks associated with above surface structures , why not use natural shelter instead ?
Lava tubes may be interconnected , allowing sizeable settlements , also they may be easily sealed , allowing for pressurized habitats .
Lunar colonists will also be sufficiently protected from micrometeorites and solar radiation .
Rovers
To bridge the gap between an immobile base and a highly mobile rover , the first base may consist of settlers living and traveling in a roving Moon base .
In fact , many designers suggest this solution may be a long - term answer to the future of a colony on the Moon .
Unlike the current lunar “ Moon Buggy ” ( pictured ) , future rovers would be large , accommodating several people within a pressurized cabin .
Using rovers as a base may negatively affect processes only static , permanent bases can achieve ( i.e. farming activities ) , but a roving base would allow settlers the freedom to move when and where required around the lunar landscape .
“ Building a Moon Base ” is based on research by Haym Benaroya and Leonhard Bernold ( “ Engineering of lunar bases “ )
Court Finds Model Innocent Based on Breast Size
Serena Kozakura , a Japanese pin-up model , has probably had her way numerous times based on the size of her breasts , but this has to be the first time they have ever helped her overturn a court ruling .
Serena , 38 years old , was charged and found guilty of breaking into a man ’s apartment by kicking in a hole in his door and crawling through because he was with another woman .
The bikini model was cleared of all charges after the defense council help up a plate showing the size of the hole that Serena was accused of kicking in .
It was clear that the hole in the door was not large enough for the 44 - inch bust model to squeeze through .
“ I used to hate my body so much , but it was my breasts that won in court ” , Serena said .
Judge Kunio Harad of the Tokyo High Court threw out the guilty verdict , saying there was reasonable doubt over the man ’s story .
Video showing Serena trying to squeeze through a hole in the door as well as other parts of the story can be viewed below :

By the time you finish this column you will be able to destroy huge buildings , kill hundreds of people in a few minutes , and strike terror into your enemies .
And all you need is stuff that I guarantee you already have around the house .
Sound too good to be true ?
Well , hold on to your hard - ons , because there 's more !
This weapon is so impossible to trace that well - trained terrorists all over the world use it to clean up evidence after an operation .
When you realize its potential , you 'll wonder why more irregular armies are n't using it already .
If you 're me , you 'll wonder why you have n't done it yourself .
You 've probably figured out what I 'm talking about by now .
It 's our oldest weapon : fire .
Beavis ' dream come true I got the idea watching Malibu burn .
Oh , man , that was the best day off I 've had in years .
Regular porn does n't do much for me , but those clips of " heartbroken house owners " sobbing — man , I was just about creaming in my expand - o - waist black slacks .
And talk about guilt - free porn !
There 's no downside to watching movie producers ' mansions turn into toxic smoke .
Do n't tell me I 'm the only Inland Californian who laughed his head off at those follow - up pictures of the Prez hugging teary - eyed billionaires .
They all looked like my bank manager .
I can't think of anybody whose houses I 'd like to see burned up more , and I would n't mind if their precious purse dogs happened to get forgotten in the big BMW bug - out once the flames made it past those " This Property Protected by .... oooh owww hot ! " signs .
Those properties were protected by zip , nada , a whole lotta nuthin ' .
You can't scare a fire , you can't shoot it .
The Mongols and Wehrmacht combined would have to run from a good ol ' SoCal brushfire .
That 's a weapon , baby .
And there 's Bush streaking cross-continent on Air Force
One to hug the " victims , " with his aides hissing into the ear unit : " Psst ! Do ' compassion ' !
Squirt some tears , dammit ! "
Some websites are already saying what went through my head the second I saw those flames : somebody got smart and stopped playing with bombs and went back to basics , back to what works .
Mighta been al Quaeda , but might just as well have been some nut who got fired for not showering because God told him not to .
Lotta what they call " agendas " out there .
Lotta Bic lighters too .
Which means about half the population of this nuthouse qualifies as a suspect .
That 's the beauty of fire : anybody can do it .
Actually that 's just one of about a dozen advantages that arson has over bombs .
Let 's run 'em down , info - mercial style , Bomb vs. Arson : Bomb : very tricky to make ; easy to score an " own goal " ( blow yourself up learning the trade ) ; requires a detonator , very tightly controlled — " not sold at any store " as they say on those sad Oldies Compilation ads ; requires electrical expertise , the one thing even most handyman types can't handle ; leaves traces on bomber 's hands , clothes and car ; often fails to work ; takes a truckload of fertilizer to bring down big buildings ; can't spread beyond immediate target area .
In an infomercial , this is where Christie Brinkley pops up to say , " Gosh Chuck , that sounds way too complicated for me !
Is n't there an easier way for me to lay waste to an enemy city with no risk or obligation ? "

Mississippi House Representative W.T. Mayhall , Jr. introduced a bill during the legislative session on Friday that would ban restaurants from serving obese people in the state of Mississippi .
The proposal , Bill 282 , would require scales to be placed outside of restaurants and people with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) above 30 would be refused service .
Records of customers BMI ’s would be kept on file and the restaurants would be tasked with enforcing and complying with the bill or risk loss of their license from the State Department of Health .
While Mr. Mayhall is certain the bill will not pass into law , he along with the bill ’s co-writers , Bobby Shows , a businessman and John Read , a pharmacist , believe the situation concerning obesity in Mississippi to be dire .
Their intention is to call attention to the increasing epidemic of obesity and the cost to the Medicare system .
Mississippi continually ranks as one of the fattest states in the country by the Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) .
The state boasted a 31.4 average BMI rate for the year 2006 , garnering them the top spot with Alabama in second at 30.5 .
Mississippi also holds the highest rate of death from cardiovascular disease ; a disease with a major risk factor of obesity .
See where your state ranks here .
While a BMI of 30 is considered obese , keep in mind that the index does not take into account skeletal frame , musculature or fitness – all factors in determining your overall health with concern to your weight .
Obesity has ranked among top concerns for health professionals and lawmakers alike over the past ten years .
We have reached a staggering milestone , six of every ten adults are considered obese in this country .
According to the Surgeon General , in 1999 13 % of children aged 6 to 11 years were facing weight issues .
Approximately 14 % of adolescent ’s ages 12 to 19 were overweight that same year – a number nearly tripled over the past two decades .
The obesity epidemic is not new .
As health care providers we are seeing drastic increases in diseases and conditions strongly linked to obesity .
Diabetes is on a sharp rise , primarily in children .
Insulin - dependent diabetes is now being seen in obese children , a disease that was solely found in adults a short time ago .
Cardiovascular ( CV ) disease is the leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in our country .
Obesity ranks as a top cause of CV disease .
Finding a solution to the problem of obesity in America is proving difficult because the etiology is not fully understood and what can change obesity largely depends on an individual ’s choices and choices that families are making together .
Education of patients and their families regarding positive health habits should be a primary concern for health care providers regardless of alleged prior knowledge or perceived existence of weight issues .
Teaching our patients and their families how to better care for their bodies is of utmost importance and of greater value than judgment and ridicule that proposals like Bill 282 risk perpetuating .
a three - dimensional online society where publicity is cheap and the demographic is edgy and certainly computer - savvy -- should be a marketer ’s paradise .
But it turns out that plugging products is as problematic in the virtual world as it is anywhere else .
At www.secondlife.com -- where the cost is $ 6 a month for premium citizenship -- shopping , at least for real - world products , is n’t a main activity .
Four years after Second Life debuted , some marketers are second - guessing the money and time they ’ve put into it .
“ There ’s not a compelling reason to stay , ” said Brian McGuinness , vice president of Aloft , a brand of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. that is closing its Second Life shop and donating its virtual land to the nonprofit social - networking group TakingITGlobal .

Linden Lab , the San Francisco firm that created Second Life , sells companies and people pieces of the landscape where they can build stores , conference halls and gardens .
Individuals create avatars , or virtual representations of themselves , that travel around this online society , exploring and schmoozing with other avatars .
Land developed by users , rather than real - world companies , is among the most popular places in Second Life .
But the sites of many of the companies remaining in Second Life are empty .
During a recent in - world visit , Best Buy Co.'s Geek Squad Island was devoid of visitors and the virtual staff that was supposed to be online .
The schedule of events on Sun Microsystems Inc.'s site was blank , and the green landscape of Dell Island was deserted .
Signs posted on the window of the empty American Apparel store said it had closed up shop .
McGuinness said Starwood ’s venture into Second Life did accomplish something .
Feedback from denizens gave Aloft ideas for its physical hotels .

The suggestions included putting radios in showers and painting the lobbies in earth tones rather than primary colors .
But now that the design initiative is over , he said , it ’s difficult to attract people to the virtual hotel to help build the real - world brand .
For some advertisers , the problem is that Second Life is a fantasyland , and the representations of the people who play in it do n’t have human needs .
Food and drink are n’t necessary , teleporting is the easiest way to get around and clothing is optional .
In fact , the human form itself is optional .
Avatars can play games , build beach huts , dress up like furry animals , flirt with strangers -- sometimes all at once .
Their interests seem to tend toward the risque .
Ian Schafer , chief executive of online marketing firm Deep Focus , which advises clients about entering virtual worlds , said he recently toured Second Life .
He started at the Aloft hotel and found it empty .
He moved on to casinos , brothels and strip clubs , and they were packed .
Schafer said he found in his research that “ one of the most frequently purchased items in Second Life is genitalia . ”

Another problem for some is that Second Life does n’t have enough active residents .
On its website , Second Life says the number of total residents is more than 8 million .
But that counts people who signed in once and never returned , as well as multiple avatars for individual residents .
Even at peak times , only about 30,000 to 40,000 users are logged on , said Brian Haven , an analyst with Forrester Research .
“ You ’re talking about a much smaller audience than advertisers are used to reaching , ” Haven said .
Some in the audience do n’t want to be reached .
After marketers began entering Second Life , an avatar named Urizenus Sklar -- in the real world , University of Toronto philosophy professor Peter Ludlow -- wrote in the public - relations blog Strumpette that the community was “ being invaded by an army of old world meat - space corporations . ”

He and other residents accused companies of lacking creativity by setting up traditional - looking stores that did n’t fit in .
His column was reproduced in the Second Life Herald .
Nissan Motor Co. , a subject of such protests , has since transformed its presence in Second Life from a car vending machine to an “ automotive amusement park , ” where avatars can test gravity - defying vehicles and ride hamster balls .
Sun Micro has made its participation more interactive and fanciful , Chief Gaming Officer Chris Melissinos said .
Ludlow is n’t impressed .
He said most firms were more interested in the publicity they received from their ties with Second Life than in the digital world itself .
“ It was a way to brand themselves as being leading - edge , ” he said .
Angry avatars have taken virtual action .
Reebok weathered a nuclear bomb attack and customers were shot outside the American Apparel store .
Avatars are creating fantasy knockoffs of brand - name products too .

Some buying and selling does go on in Second Life .
An avatar can acquire currency -- called Linden dollars -- by earning it or buying it with U.S. dollars .
( The exchange rate is 268 Lindens to $ 1 . )
With a stack of Linden dollars , an avatar can spice up his or her look or while away the time in a casino .
Only a few other virtual worlds allow avatars to create and sell content as Second Life does .
But users are flocking to the other worlds , in part because some do n’t require people to download software to take up residence .
Others just want to access a larger community than Second Life offers .
Between May and June , the population of active avatars declined 2.5 % , and the volume of U.S. money exchanged within the world fell from a high of $ 7.3 million in March to $ 6.8 million in June .
Companies are following them .
IBM Corp. , which has an extensive presence in Second Life , is expanding into the other environments , including There , which features a digital version of the popular TV show “ Laguna Beach , ” and Entropia Universe , which pits users against one another in a sci-fi civilization .

Consulting firms that were set up to bring brands into Second Life are busy helping clients explore other worlds .
One such agency , Millions of Us , recently announced that it had formed a partnership with Gaia Online , a site popular with teenagers , and CEO Reuben Steiger said it would be unveiling more soon .
Millions of Us had previously worked only with Second Life .
“ It ’s not about whether Second Life is good or bad , ” Steiger said .
“ It ’s just that there are a lot of alternatives . ”

Asus has announced it intends to begin shipping the ultra low - cost EEE PC in September .
According to Asus , the E's in the title stand for " Easy to learn " , " Excellent Internet " , and " Excellent mobile computing experience . "
Asus reportedly plans to ship up to 500,000 of these systems in 2007 , and up to 3 - 5 million in 2008 .
As Digitimes reports , the EEE PC will be available at multiple price points , from $ 199 - $ 369 , with the $ 349 model targeting the US mainstream .
Overall specifications on the EEE are as follows :
7 " LCD Display
900MHz Celeron -M ULV ( Ultra Low Voltage ) 353
Intel 910 Chipset
512MB DDR2-400 RAM
4 , 8 , or 16GB solid - state storage
ASUS - customized , Xandros - derived Linux OS
Dimensions : 225x165x21-35mm
Weight : ~ 2 lbs
Colors : White , Black
The variations in price are almost certainly due to the size of the solid state storage drive available within the unit .
At a potential $ 199 price point , the EEE PC could offer some significant competition to the OLPC initiative , but we won't
be able to directly compare the two units until we have shipping hardware available .
By concentrating on the $ 349 model
first , Asus seems to be focusing on establishing a brand and market presence in the sub - notebook market first , rather than
attempting to go head - to - head with the OLPC 's mandate of providing a useful computer to the developing nations of the
world .

says that his students typically think that about 20 % of the American labor force is employed at the minimum wage , when the actual percentage of minimum wage workers ( 1.7 million ) was only 2.2 % of all hourly - paid workers ( 76.5 million ) in 2006 ,
according to the BLS
.
However , hourly - paid workers ( 76.5 million ) in the 2006 BLS study are only about half of the total labor force of about 146 million , and therefore minimum wage workers represent fewer than 1.2 % of all workers ( not just hourly workers ) .
In other words , only about 1 out of every 86 American workers receives the minimum wage .
Apparently , Ron Paul has hired the son of legendary tax protester notorious crank Irwin Schiff as his tax advisor :
Representative Ron Paul , the Texas doctor with the libertarian streak who is seeking the Republican nomination , has taken on an economic adviser with very close ties to people who assert that the income tax is illegal .
Dr. Paul announced that his new economic adviser is Paul Schiff , who runs Euro Pacific Capital Inc. , an investment fund .
He is also the author of “ Crash Proof , ” a book about a coming economic collapse that on Friday was listed as # 224 at Amazon.com .
Not mentioned by the Paul campaign is that Mr. Schiff is the son of Irwin Schiff of Las Vegas , now serving his third federal prison sentence for tax crimes .
He is also the author of such books as “ The Federal Mafia , ” which asserts that federal judges are paid off by the Internal Revenue Service , and other books describing the federal government as a criminal organization that illegally extracts income taxes .
(…)
The son , in interviews , has said he thinks his father is correct in asserting that there is no law to make most Americans liable for income taxes and so they can legally put zeroes on their tax returns .
Peter Schiff , however , said that he pays his taxes .
Well , they can put zeros if they want to , but they ’d better plan on some time in prison if they do .
Let ’s be blunt about , there is no legal merit to the arguments that Schiff and the other tax protesters , such as Wesley Snipes , make .
The 16th Amendment was legitimately ratified and is blindlingly clear :
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several States , and without regard to any census or enumeration .
And the Internal Revenue Code clearly defines income :
Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle , gross income means all income from whatever source derived , including ( but not limited to ) the following items : ( 1 ) Compensation for services , including fees , commissions , fringe benefits , and similar items ; ( 2 ) Gross income derived from business ; ( 3 ) Gains derived from dealings in property ; ( 4 ) Interest ; ( 5 ) Rents ; ( 6 ) Royalties ; ( 7 ) Dividends ; ( 8 ) Alimony and separate maintenance payments ; ( 9 ) Annuities ; ( 10 ) Income from life insurance and endowment contracts ; ( 11 ) Pensions ; ( 12 ) Income from discharge of indebtedness ; ( 13 ) Distributive share of partnership gross income ; ( 14 ) Income in respect of a decedent ; and ( 15 ) Income from an interest in an estate or trust .
Schiff is a scam artist and he ’s serving time in jail because he broke the law .
And the Paul campaign has hired his son , who apparently agrees with his father but apparently is n’t stupid enough to actually put his ideas into practice .
You can argue that the law is unjust , or that we should repeal the income tax , but the argument that we are n’t legally required to do what the law allows is just plain nonsense and it ’s truly unfortunate that the libertarian movement is becoming associated with nonsense like this .
The Times article goes on :
Dr. Paul has not criticized the tax protesters among his supporters , even ones who deny the legitimacy of the tax laws .
While he has said that the income tax law is valid , he has also said that rules requiring people who make more than minimal income fill out income tax returns violates the 13th Amendment ’s prohibition against involuntary servitude .
I have n’t heard Dr. Paul make this argument , but if he has he ’s just plain wrong .
When was the last time the U.S. Postal Service upped the price of stamps ?
Like , last month ?
We all know that USPS is in a bit of a dire situation , and I know from personal experience that it likes doing big business any chance it gets .
That 's more money for USPS and a chance to steal market share from UPS , FedEx and DHL .
But in the case of Netflix and those darn flimsy envelopes , the DVD rental company has cost the USPS a reported $ 41.9 million in the past two years .
To make matters worse , USPS is forecasting costs of $ 61.5 million over the next two years to process Netflix DVD mailers .
They jam up machines and require a lot of manual processing .
How time consuming and laborious !
So USPS has extended two options for Netflix — change the envelopes so that they can be machine - processed , or pay the standard 17 - cent surcharge for non-machinable packages .
I 'm guessing that when Netflix first spoke with USPS about its master plan for mailing out DVDs , USPS did n't think those envelopes would be much of a problem .
Two years later , and the Post Office wants more money .
What does that mean for Netflix ?
Higher subscription rates to compensate for the improved mailers — or a bigger push for download rentals ?
With Blockbuster having found a way to fight Netflix with a triple threat of options for consumers ( it 's also important to note that Tech Trader reports Blockbuster 's mailing packages cause no qualms for USPS ) , Netflix probably can't afford to raise subscription prices , and I do n't think a bigger push for web downloads would compensate for the changes that need to be made .
Perhaps Netflix will have to take a bit of a loss in order to get new mailers .

After Sept. 11 , 2001 , Cai ’s large - scale work took on a darker tone .
( On the day of the terrorist attacks , he was working in Italy , but his wife and daughter remained in downtown New York .
He and Wu now have two daughters , 18 and 4 . )
One of the most striking pieces in his current retrospective is “ Inopportune : Stage One , ” from 2004 .
As recreated for the Guggenheim , “ Inopportune : Stage One ” consists of nine white American cars suspended vertically in the rotunda .
Flashing light tubes protrude from the cars like arrows .
Even without appreciating the grisly contemporary allusion to car bombs , you can respond to the savage beauty of “ Inopportune : Stage One . ”
Indeed , Cai maintains that the specific references underlying his art are secondary to the feeling evoked .
He argues that an artist in Beijing would typically depict political themes explicitly , but the southern Chinese favor an oblique approach .
As an example , he cites a great ink - brush painter who lived in Nanchang in southeastern China in the 17th century .
“ Bada Shanren always chose to paint weird rocks and orchids , ” he explained .
“ Because this artist is a prince of the Ming dynasty , which was overthrown by the Qing dynasty , he wanted to express his frustration and depression .
The tragedy of the conquered Ming dynasty and the loss of his family will pass away in time .
What will stay is the spirit of sadness and frustration in his work . ”
In 2006 Cai did a rooftop installation , “ Transparent Monument , ” at the Metropolitan Museum ; in it , he erected a large sheet of glass , through which the skyline was clearly visible , and placed replicas of dead birds at its base .
“ Some people are aware that it implies the planes going into the World Trade Center , but a lot of people do n’t know that , ” he told me .
“ For me it is not important .
What is important is that the event inspired me to do this .
I use that kind of sense to make the echoing of the tragedy longer but less dramatic . ”
The most elaborate installation in the Guggenheim exhibition is “ Venice ’s Rent Collection Courtyard , ” the piece that won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1999 and secured Cai ’s international prominence .
“ I was thinking , Why could n’t traditional sculpture be presented in the modern arena ? ”
Cai recalls .
“ I thought I would present it as performance art and allow people to experience the creation of the sculpture .
And I was thinking , Why could n’t the last Venice Biennale of the 20th century contain socialist work ?
Those sculptures are like haunting spirits . ”
The original “ Rent Collection Courtyard ” was a tableau of more than a hundred life - size clay figures , created by the Sichuan Institute of Fine Arts in 1965 to depict the oppression of peasants by a cruel landlord in pre-Communist China .
Copies were exhibited throughout China during the Cultural Revolution .
As a schoolboy , Cai saw it in a Confucianist temple in Quanzhou .
“ I still remember how the sculptures were placed and following the story , and tearing up and crying , ” he told me .
“ I thought , The Communist Party is remarkable , because it can make people cry looking at a static sculpture ! ”
For his Venice installation , he brought over some Chinese artists , including one who worked on the Sichuan original .
Visitors to the exhibition could walk among the sculptors and watch them create the finished figures .
Left unfired , the clay over time crumbled .
After the conclusion of his New York retrospective , “ Rent Collection Courtyard ” will travel with the show to the Guggenheim Bilbao .
But in the exhibition ’s intermediate venue , at the National Museum in Beijing during the summer Olympics , this installation will not appear .
“ It still has its own power and ca n’t be consumed , ” Cai said , with apparent pride .
“ There are a lot of paintings that make fun of Mao , like putting flowers on his head or making a female version .
Those works can be exhibited in China .
But the Rent Collection Courtyard ’ is still forbidden in China .
That implies there is a power in it , people do n’t want to touch the tragedy or the historical scar .
You will offend a lot of people .
That is the charm of it , and that is why I wanted to do it .
Although the work ca n’t be shown in China , people in China pay a great deal of attention to it .
Probably when one day the work can be shown in Beijing , I wo n’t want to do that . ”
Nothing better expresses the duality of Cai ’s nature than his attitude toward his country .
While he delights in the discomfort that “ Rent Collection Courtyard ” causes the Chinese authorities , he is dedicating two years to planning Olympic ceremonies that , whatever their specific content , will glorify the state .
“ Some parts of Cai Guo - Qiang I do n’t really understand very well , ” Fei Dawei , the Paris - based curator who in 1990 gave Cai his first exposure in the West , told me when I met him in Beijing in December .
“ This part is very patriotic , and it shows in the Olympics work .
I feel that deep in his heart , Cai is very proud to be Chinese .
So I think he is very sincere about this work . ”
The “ Chineseness ” in his art is a subject on which Cai is characteristically ambivalent .
“ Western people will use their own culture , and they wo n’t worry about being too Western , ” he told me .
“ So of course we do n’t need to worry about being too Eastern . ”
Yet when he was working with the Taiwanese choreographer Lin Hwai-min on the dance “ Wind Shadow , ” they agreed that the piece should seem modern .
“ He said , ‘ Yes , no Chineseness , ’ ” Lin recalled .
“ Then at the dress rehearsal I said , ‘ I think we failed . ’
He said : ‘ Why ?
It looked good . ’
I said , ‘ The whole aesthetic behind the stage is of ink and water . ’
Although we tried not to look like Chineseness , the touch was Chinese .
It ’s a different sense of time , a different sense of space .
Behind all of that is calligraphy and landscape painting . ”
Despite what some ignorant politicians and journalists might tell you , video games are fairly bland when it comes to how “ adult ” their content is .
In fact they are usually too bland to emotionally engage and would be far better if they moved a bit in the “ adult ” direction .
This blandness comes partly from their heritage of being seen as children ’s entertainment when , in fact , far more adults than children play video games and the median game player is in their late twenties .
Another reason for the blandness is the dull censoring hand of the platform holders who are amazingly prudish .
The fact is that established old media have vastly more shocking content than video games .
This is an irrefutable fact .
And often that shocking content has no age rating and is available to children from birth .
Books are a prime example of this .
And a prime example of a book that children are encouraged to read is the Bible .
There is a handy website that allows you to search the bible for content .
Using this we find that the King James version has “ harlot ” in it 48 times , “ sodomite ” 5 times , “ fornicator ” 5 times , “ smite ” 133 times , “ kill ” 208 times and “ maim ” 7 times .
This is shocking , you have to wonder what any right minded parent is doing exposing their children to this stuff .
What we need here is a level playing field .
For books , television , video , film and games all to be age rated by the same people using the same criteria .
Then the vocal anti gamers would be in for a big shock .
Most games would be available much younger and many books would find themselves with an adult rating .
Including many classics of literature .
And possibly the Bible .
Over the past weeks more and more Comcast users started to notice that their BitTorrent transfers were cut off .
Most users report a significant decrease in download speeds , and even worse , they are unable to seed their downloads .
A nightmare for people who want to keep up a positive ratio at private trackers and for the speed of BitTorrent transfers in general .
ISPs have been throttling BitTorrent traffic for almost two years now .
Most ISPs simply limit the available bandwidth for BitTorrent traffic , but Comcast takes it one step further , and prevents their customers from seeding .
And Comcast is not alone in this , Canadian ISPs Cogeco and Rogers use similar methods on a smaller scale .
Unfortunately , these more aggressive throttling methods ca n’t be circumvented by simply enabling encryption in your BitTorrent client .
It is reported that Comcast is using an application from Sandvine to throttle BitTorrent traffic .
Sandvine breaks every ( seed ) connection with new peers after a few seconds if it ’s not a Comcast user .
This makes it virtually impossible to seed a file , especially in small swarms without any Comcast users .
Some users report that they can still connect to a few peers , but most of the Comcast customers see a significant drop in their upload speed .
The throttling works like this : A few seconds after you connect to someone in the swarm the Sandvine application sends a peer reset message ( RST flag ) and the upload immediately stops .
Most vulnerable are users in a relatively small swarm where you only have a couple of peers you can upload the file to .
Only seeding seems to be prevented , most users are able to upload to others while the download is still going , but once the download is finished , the upload speed drops to 0 .
Some users also report a significant drop in their download speeds , but this seems to be less widespread .
Worse on private trackers , likely that this is because of the smaller swarm size
Although BitTorrent protocol encryption seems to work against most forms of traffic shaping , it does n’t help in this specific case .
Setting up a secure connection through VPN or over SSH seems to be the only solution .
More info about how to setup BitTorrent over SSH can be found here ( sorry , the link is dead now ) .
Last year we had a discussion whether traffic shaping is good or bad , and ISPs made it pretty clear that they do not like P2P applications like BitTorrent .
One of the ISPs that joined our discussions said : “ The fact is , P2P is ( from my point of view ) a plague – a cancer , that will consume all the bandwidth that I can provide .
It ’s an insatiable appetite . ” , and another one stated : “ P2P applications can cripple a network , they ’re like leaches .
Just because you pay 49.99 for a 1.5- 3.0 mbps connection does n’t mean your entitled to use whatever protocols you wish on your ISP ’s network without them provisioning it to make the network experience good for all users involved . ”
Customers on the other hand like to fully use their connection , and do n’t agree that traffic shaping is the correct solution .
One reader commented : “ If you pay for an internet connection , that ’s what you should get from your ISP â€ ” an internet connection .
Not a connection that will let you browse the web and check email , but little else .
If an ISP has issues with the amount of data a customer is transferring , then the ISP needs to address that issue with that customer , and not restrict every user in one class of traffic . ”
I guess this battle will go on for a while and I would advise Comcast users to try setting up a VPN connection to get around the traffic shaping , other users who find out that they are throttles might try BitTorrent encryption first , that seems to work quite well in most cases .
ED #64 : Intel SkullTrail Details

After reading xkcd ’s blog , I went to LimerickDB.com .
It looks and works just like bash.org , but for limericks .
Quite amused with some of the limericks available , I wanted to try and compose my own .
The first one came out fine , but I got stuck without a rhyme for the second one :
a man named guido once thought
he ’d invent a language well wrought
indentation as tabs
Uhm , no luck there … “ tabs ” does not rhyme well .
Then an idea came …
I could create a rhyme index !
How to do it ?
First , I took my already written word index .
Last time I used it was to solve a substitution cipher for my crypto homework .
Then , I looked for the phonemes for each word , using espeak – a text to speech program :
lorg@kild : ~$ espeak -q -x hello h@l 'oU
After doing so , I collected words that had similar phonemes endings , and there it was , a rhyme index :
In [ 84 ] : words .
get_word_rhymes ( " tabs " , word_index , rhyme_index ) [ : 10 ] Out [ 84 ] : [ ' crabs ' , ' stabs ' , ' macnabs ' , ' dabs ' , ' cabs ' , ' scabs ' , ' slabs ' , ' arabs ' , ' snobs ' , ' thebes ' ]
In [ 84 ] : words.get_word_rhymes(" tabs " , word_index , rhyme_index ) [ : 10 ] Out [ 84 ] : [ ' crabs ' , ' stabs ' , ' macnabs ' , ' dabs ' , ' cabs ' , ' scabs ' , ' slabs ' , ' arabs ' , ' snobs ' , ' thebes ' ]
Note that better rhymes are listed first – according to the length of the match .
To create this list I did n’t use stress information , although with some more work it may be done .
Back to our limerick , we can see that “ tabs ” does not have really good rhymes .
Better luck with indentation maybe :
In [ 86 ] : words .
get_word_rhymes ( " indentation " , word_index , rhyme_index ) [ : 20 ] Out [ 86 ] : [ ' kishion ' , ' alleviation ' , ' expostulation ' , ' machination ' , ' syrophenician ' , ' proposition ' , ' infatuation ' , ' computation ' , ' mansion ' , ' meditation ' , ' aggression ' , ' anticipation ' , ' clarification ' , ' logician ' , ' gratulation ' , ' discretion ' , ' quotation ' , ' presentation ' , ' dissolution ' , ' deprecation ' ]
In [ 86 ] : words.get_word_rhymes(" indentation " , word_index , rhyme_index ) [ : 20 ] Out [ 86 ] : [ ' kishion ' , ' alleviation ' , ' expostulation ' , ' machination ' , ' syrophenician ' , ' proposition ' , ' infatuation ' , ' computation ' , ' mansion ' , ' meditation ' , ' aggression ' , ' anticipation ' , ' clarification ' , ' logician ' , ' gratulation ' , ' discretion ' , ' quotation ' , ' presentation ' , ' dissolution ' , ' deprecation ' ]
And we get ( not the best limerick I admit ) :
a man named guido once thought
he ’d invent a language well wrought
with space indentation
and good presentation
we all got the language we sought
My original ending line was “ it left all the perl hackers distraught ” … but it ai n’t true , so I gave it up .
The ‘ distraught ’ was found with my script as well .
If you want to look for your own rhymes , then you can use my hacked - up script , although it is n’t written well enough for my taste .
( For example , do n’t expect to see documentation :)
I ’ll upload a better version once I refactor it .
To save you the trouble of generating the word index and the rhyme index from scratch , I used cPickle to store them .
You can use them for lookups regardless of the script .
President Bush insists that the US does not use torture
The CIA says it wiped two tapes of interrogations of al - Qaeda suspects to protect the identities of its agents .
But human rights groups accuse it of destroying evidence of practices that may be tantamount to torture .
A US Senate committee has promised a thorough investigation into the history of the making and wiping of the tapes .
Mr Bush continued to have confidence in CIA Director Michael Hayden , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
The president " did not remember " being told of the tapes prior to Thursday , she said .
The CIA confirmed on Thursday allegations in the New York Times that two tapes were destroyed in 2005 .
Officials feared the tapes could have raised doubts about the legality of the CIA 's techniques , the newspaper says .
' CIA ENHANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES '
Water boarding : prisoner bound to a board with feet raised , and cellophane wrapped round his head .
Water is poured onto his face and is said to produce a fear of drowning Cold cell : prisoner made to stand naked in a cold , though not freezing , cell and doused with water Standing : Prisoners stand for 40 hours and more , shackled to the floor Belly slap : a hard slap to the stomach with an open hand .
This is designed to be painful but not to cause injury Source : Described to ABC News by un-named CIA agents in 2005
CIA boss faces credibility test
The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman , John Rockefeller , a Democrat , called for a thorough investigation into the tapes and their destruction .
Gen Hayden said House and Senate intelligence committee members had been informed of the tapes and the decision to wipe them .
Jane Harman , a senior Democrat who was on the House Intelligence Committee at the time , said she had been informed of the decision , but was opposed to it .
" I told the CIA that destroying videotapes of interrogations was a bad idea and urged them in writing not to do it , " she told the Associated Press .
Pete Hoekstra , a Republican who was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee at the time , told the news agency he did not recall being briefed on the matter at all .
Separately , Assistant Senate Democratic Leader Dick Durbin asked the Attorney General to request an investigation into whether the CIA broke obstruction - of - justice laws by destroying the footage .
' Disingenuous '
The CIA revelation has drawn criticism from civil liberties and human rights groups .
Jennifer Daskal , senior counsel with Human Rights Watch , said the wiping of the tapes was " destruction of evidence " , and described the reasons given by the CIA as " disingenuous " .
The damage is compounded when such actions are hidden away from accountability
Senator Patrick Leahy
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman

" The destruction of these tapes appears to be a part of an extensive , long - term pattern of misusing executive authority to insulate individuals from criminal prosecution for torture and abuse , " an ACLU statement said .
Gen Hayden explained why the footage was destroyed in an internal memo sent to CIA employees and obtained by the Associated Press .
He said the CIA had begun taping interrogations as an internal check in 2002 and decided to delete the videos because they no longer had " intelligence value " and posed a security risk .
" Were they ever to leak , they would permit identification of your CIA colleagues who had served in the programme , exposing them and their families to retaliation from al - Qaeda and its sympathisers , " he said .
Harsh techniques
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says the news is likely to trigger more questions about the interrogation techniques used by the CIA and whether they amounted to torture .
Michael Hayden wrote to all CIA employees about the tapes
According to our correspondent , those techniques are alleged to have included water - boarding , a method in which a suspect is made to feel he is drowning .
Human rights groups say that water - boarding - and other techniques allegedly used by the CIA - can be defined as torture under various international treaties to which the US is a signatory .
Gen Hayden says that the CIA 's internal watchdogs saw the tapes in 2003 and verified that the techniques used were legal .
The Bush administration has always maintained that it does not allow the use of torture .
The tapes are thought to have shown the interrogation in 2002 of a number of terror suspects , including Abu Zubaydah , who had been a chief recruiter for the al - Qaeda network .

Sam Penrod reporting A group of college students in Utah County has reached a truce with a popular health club .
The agreement comes the day before they planned to protest over the showing of what they call " objectionable music videos and movies . "
The students say the protest tomorrow will now be a rally of support for Gold 's Gym .
" They 've decided to make the changes we 've asked them to make , and so tomorrow we want everyone to know we 're thrilled with Gold 's Gym .
We 're thrilled with the response we 've had with them , " said Nathaniel Gardner , spokesman for the student group Standing for Decency .
It appears to be a compromise between the student organization and Gold 's Gym .
Gold 's executives say they reviewed the students ' complaints and will filter out the most objectionable videos shown in their gyms .
It 's an attempt to make as many of their customers as satisfied as they can .
The group of college students objected to several music videos shown in the gym .
They specifically listed five videos which they say they considered to be pornographic .
The students had started a petition drive against the gym and were planning to picket outside of the Provo Gold 's tomorrow .
" They 've changed the music videos so they are less explicit , and it's a more conservative mix of the music videos there , " Gardner said .
The students say the gym will now review every movie before it is shown in the gym 's cardio cinema and not show any film that could have content that some could find objectionable .
Gold 's executives told Eyewitness News today that after the students brought the videos to their attention , they realized some of them did not fit their corporate values either , and they are taking a balanced approach about what is shown on the TV monitors in the gym .
" We 're just thrilled with Gold 's Gym .
We support them all the way and just glad , you know , this is America in action , listening to the voice of the people and hoping we 've inspired people to stand for something as well , " Gardner said .
The students plan to protest other businesses in the community that they believe promote indecency .
" We do have some other ideas .
We 're not ready publicly to announce what they are , but Standing for Decency , we have a lot of plans to do as much as we can , " Gardner said .
Again , if you see the students outside of the Gold 's Gym in Provo tomorrow morning , they are not protesting but showing support for Gold 's Gym .

The advantages of amnesia From the Internet to the iPod , technology is bringing rapid advances in memory .
What society needs now are new ways to forget .
IMAGINE CARRYING AROUND an entire research library on an iPod .
Such a feat suddenly seemed feasible as of earlier this month , with the news that IBM physicist Stuart Parkin is close to perfecting an advance called " magnetic random access memory , " or MRAM , which will enable us to store exponentially more data on the tiniest of hard drives .
Parkin 's development , which should reach consumers within a few years , is the latest installment in our eternal quest to preserve and supplement the human memory , which has taken us from the cuneiform slab to the cassette tape to the Ginkgo biloba tablet washed down with the day 's first cup of coffee .
As digital - storage capacities reach seemingly boundless proportions , however , some thinkers are becoming nervous about the unintended consequences of memory technology .
Certainly Google 's enormous reserves of user information , stored in dozens of secretive data centers across the world , and the literally photographic memory of the Internet Archive , which preserves billions of defunct Web pages for posterity , are enough to leave anyone rattled .
New forms of memory are permanent and accessible from anywhere .
As their reach grows , scholars are asking if now - perhaps for the first time in human history - we need to find ways to forget .
" We used to have a system in which we forgot things easily and had to invest energy in remembering , " says Viktor Mayer - Schönberger , an associate professor of public policy at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government .
" Now we 're switching to a system in which we remember everything and have to invest energy in order to forget .
That 's an enormous transformation . "
Jorge Luis Borges envisioned the risks of perfect memory in his famous story " Funes the Memorious , " about a man gifted with unlimited recall , and paralyzed by it .
Perhaps not even Borges , however , could have imagined our present capacity to accumulate and preserve memory in digital form - or the powerful impact it is already having on individual lives , as temporary indiscretions become part of the permanent record .
" What you do online is potentially there forever , " says Coye Cheshire , an assistant professor at the School of Information at the University of California , Berkeley .
" Delete if you want ; ask Google to take down that one unflattering photo - but it 's still saved , archived , somewhere . "
The personal costs of this reality are clear , but there may be broader social costs as well .
" What a lot of people forget - no pun intended - is that forgetting is hard - wired , " says Mayer - Schönberger .
" Cognitively and sociologically , we 've never had to develop the capacity to forget or to put things in temporal perspective , because forgetting was built in biologically . "
In a working paper posted online last spring , " Useful Void : The Art of Forgetting in the Age of Ubiquitous Computing , " Mayer - Schönberger hypothesized a number of future big - picture costs of an unforgetting era .
The assumption that every online comment and transaction is preserved somewhere , never to be forgotten , could suppress public speech and civic participation in ways that we could never calculate .
There is also the contradiction whereby " personal " information - from private e-mails to sensitive identifying data - is indefinitely available on a remote server .
In " Useful Void , " Mayer - Schönberger argues that we can - and should - retrain ourselves to forget .
He argues in support of " data ecology , " whereby a combination of law and software would apply an expiration date to certain types of sensitive data .
Search engines , online vendors , cellphone companies , surveillance - camera services - all would operate under a legal obligation to wipe their data after a certain span of time .
Of course , such rules come with a significant loophole : if data can be copied , it can live forever .
" My solution is not based on perfect technology , " Mayer - Schönberger says .
" What I want is for people to think about the life span of the information that surrounds us , to reintroduce into our consciousness the importance of forgetting . "
Mayer - Schönberger is not the first scholar to argue that forgetting matters .
A decade ago , sociologists Donald MacKenzie and Graham Spinardi suggested that human society might " forget " how to make nuclear weapons because , even if the technical information required to build them could not be eliminated , the tacit knowledge required ( " embodied in people rather than words , equations , or diagrams " ) could wither and die .
The case for forgetting , however , presents significant practical and moral dilemmas .
To " forget " how to make nuclear weapons " might sound promising , but the point is that we could also forget how to make medicines and other technologies , " Cheshire says .
" There are trade - offs associated with ' forgetting , ' or with not even having to remember in the first place . "
Codified forgetting also carries ugly associations of book - burning and other totalitarian cultural purges .
But Mayer - Schönberger 's proposal addresses a very specific , very recent phenomenon : the blurring of public and private space on the Web .
Data ecology would , among other things , enable people to use the Internet without leaving a long - term trail of their every click and search query - acts that feel private , unrecorded , but are anything but .
" Consumers of Internet - based services do need to press for more humane uses of data retention , " says Dan Visel , a fellow at the Institute for the Future of the Book in New York .
This summer , Google , Microsoft , Yahoo , and Ask.com yielded to such pressure and announced various plans to wipe IP addresses and cookie data after a certain period of time .
Ask went furthest by introducing the AskEraser tool , which users can click to ensure their search history is not recorded .
The other companies , however , will hang onto most data for anywhere from 13 months to two years - a lifetime in the computer age .
According to Danah Boyd , a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School , the solution is not to fight the ubiquity of memory but to adapt .
" No amount of structural intervention is going to combat this , " Boyd says .
" People , particularly younger people , are going to come up with coping mechanisms .
That 's going to be the shift , not any intervention by a governmental or technological body . "
Alessandro Acquisti , an assistant professor of information technology and public policy at the Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University , points out that as digital memory accumulates , the problem of over - remembering might take care of itself .
" The cost of downloading and storing digital information keeps decreasing ; the cost of analyzing it is also decreasing through data - mining technologies , but the big question is whether these costs are decreasing at the same rate , " Acquisti says .
" If there 's no incentive to analyzing the information , it still exists , but it 's basically protected by information overload .
" And then , " he says , " we go back to forgetting , the way our ancestors did . "

Following up on an item from yesterday , the White House officially made a ridiculous argument about officials ' missing emails .
The White House is currently under fire for allegations that it violated the Presidential Records
Act by failing to archive official e-mails .
Facing a court order , the White House yesterday acknowledged that it recycled its “ backup computer tapes of e-mail before October 2003 , ” raising the possibility that many messages “ have been taped over and are gone forever . ”
Yet when asked about the missing e-mails in today ’s White House press briefing , spokesman Tony Fratto inexplicably tried to claim that the White House has “ absolutely no reason to believe that any e-mails are missing . ”
He argued that these scurrilous charges of missing e-mails “ came from outside the White House . ”
Fortunately , we have Henry Waxman to set the record straight .
The White House possesses no archived e-mail messages for many of its component offices , including the Executive Office of the President and the Office of the Vice President , for hundreds of days between 2003 and 2005 , according to the summary of an internal White House study that was disclosed yesterday by a congressional Democrat .
The 2005 study -- whose credibility the White House attacked this week -- identified 473 separate days in which no electronic messages were stored for one or more White House offices , said House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif . ) .
Did Fratto not realize he'd be called on such a blatant falsehood ?
Or does the Bush White House simply no longer care ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - About a fifth of U.S. college students are taking painkilling pills and other prescription drugs to get high , a study published on Monday showed .

And students who take prescription drugs for non-medical reasons are at least five times more likely to meet the definition of having a drug abuse problem than students not misusing them , the researchers reported in the journal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine .
The findings by researchers at the University of Michigan were based on a survey of 3,639 U.S. college students whose average age was just under 20 .
“ It ’s very easy to get addicted , ” Carol Boyd of the University of Michigan ’s Substance Abuse Research Center , who helped conduct the study , said in a telephone interview .
“ They perceive prescription medications as safer than street drugs such as cocaine and heroin despite the fact that the stimulants and the opioids ( painkillers ) are just like cocaine and heroin .
And they ’re very easy for them to get , ” Boyd added .
Students were asked if they had taken four types of prescription drugs : opioids ; stimulants ; sleeping pills ; and sedative or anti-anxiety pills .
About 60 percent said they had used such drugs with a prescription for medical reasons , while 20 percent said they had taken such drugs for non-medical reasons .
The students also were asked whether they had done anything illegal to get drugs , whether they had blackouts due to drug use , felt guilty about drug use , or felt sick after stopping taking the drugs .
If they answered yes for three or more of the 10 questions on the screening test , they were classified as having a drug abuse problem .
“ A typical scenario that we hear from our focus groups and our students is : they go to the dentist to have their wisdom teeth taken out , and the dentist gives them 30 Vicodin ( a powerful painkiller ) and a refill , ” Boyd said .
Many use the pills to manage the pain after the procedure then get rid of the unused ones when they are no longer needed , she said .
But others keep them and use them to get high .
The findings are the latest evidence of an ongoing problem involving abuse of prescription drugs by U.S. young people .
A December report , also by University of Michigan researchers , showed that while overall use of illicit drugs by U.S. teenagers dropped in the past decade , abuse of prescription medications has not .
Fifteen percent of 12th graders reported using a prescription drug for non-medical reasons in the prior year , that report found .
“ It is the major emerging problem among teens , ” said Sean Clarkin of the advocacy group Partnership For a Drug - Free America , who was not involved in the new study .
“ Their perceptions of the risks involved are pretty low . ”
1996 : " Cyberspace " is not yet a household word but is about to get a big boost in the public consciousness with an international , one - day event , 24 Hours in Cyberspace .
Top editors , photographers , computer programmers and designers , contributing from all over the world , collaborate to document a single day on the internet .
It becomes not only a digital time capsule but a coming - out party , of sorts , for a medium whose impact was as dramatic in its day as television was a half century earlier .
24 Hours in Cyberspace was the inspiration of photographer Rick Smolan , who created the " Day in the Life " photo - essay series .
Smolan used the same formula as " Day in the Life , " recruiting 150 photojournalists to go out and chronicle a slice of everyday life , in this case as it pertained to the then - counterculturish phenomenon of the web .
The technology of the internet was not the subject : Smolan wanted ( and got ) pictures of how different people in different cultures were using the internet , and the effect that the medium of cyberspace was having on their lives .
The resulting work was edited and then displayed on a website .
It also appeared as the cover story of that week 's edition of U.S. News and World Report and , soon thereafter , as a coffee - table book .
Vice President Al Gore , already a vocal defender of the environment , wrote the foreword .
His wife , Tipper , was one of the photographers .
The project , billed as the " largest one - day online event , " cost around $ 5 million and was bankrolled by companies with a vested interest in the internet 's growth , companies like Sun Microsystems and Adobe , as well as by individual contributors .
As it turned out , Feb. 8 , 1996 , fell on the very day that President Bill Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act ( later overturned in court ) .
Many activists turned their websites black that day , a protest mentioned briefly on the 24 Hours website and in the book .

Do n’t bother trying to persuade your boss of a new idea while he ’s feeling the power of his position – new research suggests he ’s not listening to you .
“ Powerful people have confidence in what they are thinking .
Whether their thoughts are positive or negative toward an idea , that position is going to be hard to change , ” said Richard Petty , co-author of a new study * and professor of psychology at Ohio State University .
The best way to get leaders to consider new ideas is to put them in a situation where they do n’t feel as powerful , the research suggests .
“ If you temporarily make a powerful person feel less powerful , you have a better chance of getting them to pay attention , ” said Pablo Briñol , lead author of the study and a social psychologist at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in Spain .
Briñol is a former postdoctoral fellow at Ohio State .
This research looks at an issue that has been largely ignored by social scientists , Petty said .
Many studies have looked at how the power of a person delivering a message impacts those who receive it .
But this appears to be the first study that looks at how the power of the message recipient affects persuasion .
In several related studies , the researchers told college students they would be participating in two supposedly separate experiments .
In one experiment , the students role - played in a situation in which one was a boss – in other words , had a position of power – and the other was an employee who simply took orders .
advertisement
In the second experiment , the participants viewed a fake advertisement for a mobile phone .
The ad was designed to see if participants were paying attention to the message , so half the participants received ads with particularly weak arguments for buying the phone ( for example , touting that it had a broad currency converter ) , while the others received strong arguments ( the phone could be recharged in just 5 minutes ) .
Participants were then asked to rate how favorably they viewed the phone .
When the role - playing exercise was conducted before viewing the phone ad , those who played boss were more likely than those playing employees to rate the phone similarly -- whether they received the strong or the weak arguments .
“ The strength of the argument made no difference to those who played the boss – they obviously were n’t paying attention when they felt powerful , ” Petty said .
“ Those who played the employee , who were made to feel powerless , paid a lot more attention to the arguments .
They were n’t as confident in their own initial beliefs and weighed the arguments more carefully . ”
In a related study , the order of the experiments was essentially reversed .
Participants first read the mobile phone ads , and were presented with either the strong or the weak arguments , and wrote down their thoughts while reading it .
However , before they actually rated the phones , the same participants took part in the role - playing exercise in which some were the boss and some the employee .
Later , they went back and rated the phones .
The results showed that the bosses in the role - playing exercise were now more influenced by the quality of the arguments in the ads ..
Those who were low - power employees were not as influenced by the ad quality .
advertisement
“ When power was experienced after the ads had been processed , it gave people confidence in their most recent thoughts , so if they read strong arguments , they rated the phones more favorably .
If they read weak arguments , they were much more negative toward the phone , ” Petty said .
“ Those who were feeling less power were n’t as confident about the validity of their thoughts to the ads , so the strength of the arguments did n’t matter as much . ”
What this all means is that it matters when people are feeling powerful – before or after they receive a persuasive message .
If the message comes right after their power is made relevant to them , then powerful people will be difficult to persuade because they are confident in their existing opinions .
However , if people can be made to feel powerful right after a strong persuasive message , attitude change is more likely because powerful individuals will feel confident in the positive thoughts they generate to the message , Petty said .
For example , if you have strong arguments to get a raise , try not to ask the boss in her office , where she is surrounded by the trappings of power .
Bring up the topic in a lunch room or somewhere where there are n’t reminders of who is in charge .
But if you do have to talk in the boss ’s office , try to say something that shakes his or her confidence .
“ Our research shows that power makes people more confident in their beliefs , but power is only one thing that affects confidence , ” Petty said .
“ Try to bring up something that the boss does n’t know , something that makes him less certain and that tempers his confidence . ”
But once you do make your argument , assuming it is cogent , it is good to remind the boss that he is in charge .
“ You want to sow all your arguments when the boss is not thinking of his power , and after you make a good case , then remind your boss of his power .
Then he will be more confident in his own evaluation of what you say .
As long as you make good arguments , he will be more likely to be persuaded , ” Petty said .
Petty said the research casts doubt on the classic assertion that power corrupts people and leads them to negative actions .
Instead , what power does is make people more likely to unquestionably believe their own thoughts and act on them , he said .
Both low - and high - power people may have negative thoughts at times , and think about doing something bad .
But because high - power people are more confident in their thoughts – and less susceptible to countering views – they are more likely to follow through into action .
“ A lot of people may have a momentary thought about doing something bad , but they do n’t do it because they can inhibit themselves .
A powerful person is more likely to follow through on the negative thoughts , ” Petty said .
By the same token , if a powerful person has a positive , pro-social thought , she may be more likely to follow through on that thought and turn it into reality .
“ Powerful people are more likely to act on what they are thinking – good or bad – without second guessing themselves , ” Petty said .
* The study was published in a recent issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
Other co-authors of the study included Derek Rucker of Northwestern University , Carmen Valle of Universidad San Pablo CEU de Madrid and Alberto Becerra of Universidad Autónoma de Madrid .
WESTVLETEREN , Belgium -- The Trappist monks at St. Sixtus monastery have taken vows against riches , sex and eating red meat .
They speak only when necessary .
But you can call them on their beer phone .
Monks have been brewing Westvleteren beer at this remote spot near the French border since 1839 .
Their brew , offered in strengths up to 10.2 % alcohol by volume , is among the most highly prized in the world .
In bars from Brussels to Boston , and online , it sells for more than $ 15 for an 11 - ounce bottle -- 10 times what the monks ask -- if you can get it .
For the 26 monks at St. Sixtus , however , success has brought a spiritual hangover as they fight to keep an insatiable market in tune with their life of contemplation .
The monks are doing their best to resist getting bigger .
They do n't advertise and do n't put labels on their bottles .
They have n't increased production since 1946 .
They sell only from their front gate .
You have to make an appointment and there 's a limit : two , 24 - bottle cases a month .
Because scarcity has created a high - priced gray market online , the monks search the net for resellers and try to get them to stop .
" We sell beer to live , and not vice versa , " says Brother Joris , the white - robed brewery director .
Beer lovers , however , seem to live for Westvleteren .
The DUI Exception to the Constitution

... been a law professor .
He specializes in drunk driving as an attorney .
Welcome Larry .
Thank you , Gene .
Thank you .
Thank for the invitation to speak and to appear and take part in this really exciting gathering .
I ’ve been looking forward to this for quite a time .
Particularly , I ’ve been looking forward to coming and listening to my — one of my personal heroes , Charles Murray , speak .
And I did listen to him this morning and I was certainly not disappointed — well , maybe a little disappointed .
After 27 years of being an attorney and finding out I have absolutely no social value is disappointing , but then I guess Abraham Lincoln would have been disappointed too .
We can all just hope and pray very strongly that Mr. Murray is never arrested by a police officer , wrongly or otherwise and forced to confront the powers , overwhelming resources of the state in front of a jury of his peers .
Or if he does , let us hope and pray that he knows a very good physician or accountant to defend him .
I hope to convin — is this working ?
It does n’t sound like it — I ’m getting any — I hope to convince you in the next hour , some of you , convince some of you , in the next hour that the greatest single threat to our freedoms , the freedoms set forth in our Bill of Rights to our constitution .
The single greatest threat is not from China .
I do n’t think it ’s from Choostan .
I do n’t think it ’s from the extremists of the Muslim world .
The threat as it has always been throughout history is internal .
It is from within .
I do not think it is from the American Communist party or extremists on the right .
I hope to convince a few of you the greatest single threat to our freedoms today is a group of American housewives .
They call themselves the Mothers Against Drunk Driving , MADD .
I am fully aware that some of you belong to MADD .
And I am certainly not here to make fun .
Many of you who are in MADD are — have had tragic losses at the hands of drunk drivers .
Others of you here do not belong to MADD , but you have contributed to MADD and many more of you here , perhaps most of you here , are in complete sympathy with their goals and their activities .
But I hope to convince you after one hour that you might want to reassess your view of that particular organization .
And I do not take them lightly in terms of their intentions .
But we know that throughout history it is the well - intentioned zealots — those who believe strongly in the rightness of their cause — that are most willing to impose those ideas upon others .
I do not , by the way , for a moment suggest that we should legalize drunk driving .
I 'm going to make that clear at the outset .
But it is the true believer who is the greatest threat .
And I should at the outset acknowledge my tremendous debt to Mr. Eric Hoffer who wrote that book , The True Believer .
He was a longshoreman when I was going to school at Berkeley in the 60’s .
Did not have a high school education , but he was teaching Philosophy at the University of California Berkeley and wrote this tremendous little jewel of a book that has been terribly influential in my own thinking .
I would like you to imagine for a moment that you ’ve gone to a friend ’s house for dinner .
In the course of a very good dinner you ’ve had a couple of glasses of a good Petit Serah and it is now time to drive home .
I would like you to imagine that you are on your way home — and , I will tell you parenthetically , by the way , that two glasses of wine will not , in any state , put you under the influence of alcohol or over the legal limit of .08 , or .10 depending on your home state .
As you are driving along the highway , you see ahead of you some flashing lights and barricades and police cars accordioned across the highway , with flashing lights directing you into an increasingly small channel .
And , as you go in , you are stopped and two police officers approach you and stick a flashlight in your face and say , " Breath on me .
Have you been drinking tonight ?
Please step out of the car . "
Some of you say , " Well that ca n’t happen in the United States .
We have the Fourth Amendment to the constitution , which says , ' police officers have to have probable cause to stop you .
They have to have a reason to believe you ’ve done something criminal before they can stop and detain you . ' "
And so said the Michigan Supreme Court in the case of Sitz vs. Michigan .
The Supreme Court of Michigan said , " The Fourth Amendment does not permit these types of roadblocks . "
And reversed the DUI conviction .
They went up to the United States Supreme Court , unfortunately and that august body decided 5 to 4 that somewhere in the constitution there is something called a DUI Exception .
And in a 5 to 4 vote sent it back to Michigan saying there is no violation here .
What ’s interesting is the Michigan Supreme Court , bless them , for there are fewer and fewer of them , said , " Well , if you will not protect our citizens in the state of Michigan from this kind of police conduct , we will .
And we again reverse the conviction and this time we rely upon our own state constitution . "
( Applause )
The state of Washington and three other states have followed suit .
In 46 states today it is legal to stop you for absolutely no reason other than the fact that you are driving a car .
But only to check you out for drunk driving .
You have been stopped , you have been taken out of the car and you have been handcuffed .
You are placed in a police vehicle and you are on your way back to the police station .
About this time you ’re probably wondering —
I ’ve seen this TV show somewhere — they ’re supposed to read me something are n’t they ?
Something called Miranda ?
Are n’t I supposed to have a right for an attorney ?
A right to remain silent ?
Because , as you ’re driving , the officer 's asking you all kinds of questions .
Like , " Where have you been ? " " Where are you coming from ? "
" How much have you had to drink ? " " How long ago was it ? "
" When was the last drink ? " " Do you feel the effects ? " " Where are you now ? " " What time is it ? "
Well , again , a state Supreme Court said , " Hey , this person ’s handcuffed under arrest , you ’ve got to advise him of his constitutional rights under Miranda . "
And again , it went to the United States Supreme Court in the case of Birkemer vs. McCarty in 1984 .
The Michigan vs. Sitz case was 1990 , by the way .
In Birkemer vs. McCarty , the [ United ] States Supreme Court fooled around for about 20 or 30 pages of opinion and finally concluded that there was a DUI exception to the constitution .
And that , " Well , we really ca n’t tell you when you ’re supposed to give Miranda in a DUI case .
We do know that it is later than in other types of criminal investigations . "
So , U.S. Supreme Court has told us we do n’t know when Miranda is supposed to be given in DUI cases , but it is clearly some time later .

Here 's another week of noteworthy updates on the Rails trunk .
Thanks once again to the Rails Envy podcast for featuring my updates , and even bigger thanks to the Rails contributors and committers who make things happen .
This week 's Living on the Edge was covered in Rails Envy podcast # 17 .
The company I work for , Bezurk ( yeah we know some of you hate the name " Bezurk " - that 's going to change ) , is currently looking for a Ruby developer to join our ranks .
This person will be working mainly on Ruby - based web development projects .
As we all know , " Rails does n't scale " ( delivered in Jason Seifer - style - meaning it 's just a joke ! ) so we 'd love anyone who 's up for a challenge and who 's also willing to work outside the Rails comfort zone ( our current favorite : Ramaze ) .
Our Ruby team currently comprises 3 experienced developers and 1 up and coming Rubyist .
We 're active Open Source contributors ( Arun released ActiveCouch recently ) , while I am a Rails contributor ( I'm ' chuyeow ' on the Rails Trac ) myself .
If all this sounds interesting enough to you , do check out the full job description and drop us an email .
Yes , we 're serious when we said " +1 for DotA / Counterstrike skills ) " .
There 's a catch though - you have to work on location at our office in Singapore .
Anyway , let 's get back on topic - this weeks ’ report covers changes from 28 Jan 2008 to 3 Feb 2008 ( the day the Rails Envy podcast was recorded ) .
Saving , creating and updating ActiveRecord objects is more efficient
Thanks to Gleb Arshinov and Alexander Dymo with their blog post and patches about improving Rails performance by approaching it via minimizing garbage collection , saving , creating , and updating ActiveRecord objects is now significantly more efficient .
The expensive ActiveRecord : : Base # attributes method is no longer called internally , so there 's no unnecessary cloning of attribute values .
Less memory usage means less garbage collection , which means better performance !
Related changeset : http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8770
SQL calls and rendering are faster
This patch is courtesy of Gleb Arshinov and Alexander Dymo too .
Rails surrounds every SQL call and ActionView : : Base #render with the ruby method Benchmark # realtime so that it can print out some benchmarking numbers .
Benchmark # realtime allocates an unnecessary 45 k of memory per call ( who knew ! ) .
This has been monkey patched in Rails to a leaner implementation , reducing memory usage and increasing performance .

MySQL adapter slight optimization
Table and column names in the MySQL adapter are now cached in instance variables , reducing memory allocations ( and thus the need for GC ) .
Related changeset : http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8794
script / generate does Git !
script / generate now allows you to pass the ' - - git ' ( or ' - g ' ) option to add the generated files to git ( much like how you could do the same with Subversion with ' - c ' or ' - - svn ' ) .
This patch is the work of Steven Soroka so nice work Steven !

so that you can keep having your model names independent of what URLs you 'd actually like to appear on the site .
The above map .resources means that you can keep your resource and model names in English ( Comment ) , while having URLs like this : / comentarios / 123 .

: index option for form_for and fields_for to simplify multi-model forms
Inspired by a Railscasts episode where Ryan Bates mentions how ugly it is to have to pass : index => nil to prevent # text_field ( and other form helpers ) from inserting the model 's ID in the input name ( e.g. project [ task_attributes ] [ 123 ] [ name ] when what you really want is project [ task_attributes ] [ ] [ name ] ) .
Meaning instead of
< % fields_for " project [ task_attributes ] [ ] " , task do |f| %> <%= f.text_field : name , :index => nil %> <%= f.hidden_field :id , :index => nil %> <% end %>
you can now do :
< % fields_for " project [ task_attributes ] [ ] " , task , : index => nil do |f| %> <%= f.text_field : name %> <%= f.hidden_field :id %> <% end %>

No more emails in your production logs
You 'd probably have noticed that ActionMailer logs entire email messages in the log , even in production .
Well , it 's been changed to be less verbose now .
At the : info log level , only the recipients are logged .
You can still see the entire email at the : debug log level ( which is the default for development environment ) .

The Drosophila experiment conducted by Diane Dodd in 1989
" The best - documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s .
William Rice and G.W. Salt bred fruit flies , Drosophila melanogaster , using a maze with three different choices such as light / dark and wet / dry .
Each generation was placed into the maze , and the groups of flies which came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups .
After thirty - five generations , the two groups and their offspring would not breed with each other even when doing so was their only opportunity to reproduce .
Diane Dodd was also able to show allopatric speciation by reproductive isolation in Drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types , starch and maltose .
Dodd 's experiment has been easy for many others to replicate , including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods "

US - Russia Relations Cold War Tension , Reloaded
George W. Bush once thought he could look into Vladimir Putin 's eyes and see his soul .
But now that the Russian leader has tightened his grip on power , the strained friendship between these two major statesmen could turn to outright enmity .
The conflict over Iran is just one example .
An American soldier , serving in World War II , had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the German front lines .
He had finally been granted R&R and was on a train bound for London .
The train was very crowded , so the soldier walked the length of the train , looking for an empty seat .
The only
unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog .
The war weary soldier asked , “ Please , ma’am , may I sit in that seat ? ”
The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier , sniffed and said , “ You Americans .
You are such a rude class of people .
Ca n’t you see my Little Fifi is using that seat ? ”
The soldier walked away , determined to find a place to rest , but after another trip down to the end of the train , found himself again facing the woman with the dog .
Again he asked , “ Please , lady .
May I sit there ?
I ’m very tired . ”
The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted , “ You Americans !
Not only are you rude , you are also arrogant .
Imagine ! ”
The soldier did n’t say anything else ; he leaned over , picked up the little dog , tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat .
The woman shrieked and railed , and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier .
An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up , “ You know , sir , you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing .
You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand .
You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road .
And now , sir , you ’ve thrown the wrong bitch out the window . ”

このプロジェクトは、かつて私自身も担当していたプロジェクトなので、感慨深く記事を読みました。
当時をふりかえると、実装で苦労したのは、ワークフロー処理（承認とか公開とか）と、非同期処理（音声ファイル作成とか）の二つです。 今はともかく、当時はRubyやRuby on Railsで使えるまともなワークフローエンジンや非同期処理ライブラリが無かったので、一から開発していました。
その後、ERP5の開発に参加するようになった時に、ERP5ではZopeの既存の資産を元に既にワークフローも非同期処理も実装されていて、かつ実際に長く使われていて、「こ、こんなにいいものがあったのか！」とショックを受けたのを覚えています。 そういえば「 Zopeの導くところへ 、Pythonはついて行く」にこんな記述が...

An estimated 49,500 votes were cast incorrectly in Los Angeles County by nonpartisan voters in the presidential primaries and cannot be counted because the voters ’ intentions are unclear , acting Registrar Dean Logan said Monday .
The mismarked ballots were the result of a confusing ballot design and poor education of poll workers and the public , Logan said .
That left many decline - to - state voters unaware of the need to fill in a bubble indicating whether they were voting in the Democratic Party or American Independent Party primary .
The Republican Party did not allow nonpartisans to vote in its primary .
“ Unfortunately we are not in a position to count those votes because of the limitations of the system and the ballot layout itself , ” Logan said .

“ We want voters to know that we hear loud and clear that this ballot layout is confusing and we need to identify a less confusing method for crossover voting for future primaries . ”
Logan released a report of the Feb.
5 voting based on a manual survey of nonpartisan ballots cast in 1 % of the county ’s precincts .
It found that 26 % tried to vote in one of the two party primaries but neglected to mark a party bubble on the ballot .
Although their votes in the presidential race cannot be tabulated , their votes on the propositions will count .
About 50 % of the voters successfully cast crossover ballots , and 24 % of the independents intended to vote nonpartisan , the survey found .

Logan said the lost votes would not affect the outcome of the presidential races or the allocation of Democratic Party delegates by congressional district because in each case the margins were too large .
Logan , who took over Jan. 4 , said the survey also showed that the training of poll workers was uneven .
In some precincts , the voting went smoothly and independents who wished to cross over marked their ballots properly .
But in other precincts a high percentage of nonpartisan voters cast ballots incorrectly .
Logan said the number of votes that could not be counted was significantly less than the 100,000 votes he earlier had feared were marked incorrectly .
But despite his hope that the ballots could be counted , he said he had now concluded that the ballot design made it impossible to determine voters ’ intent .
One problem is that ballots do not contain the names of any of the candidates and some of the same ballot positions were used for both Democratic Party candidates and American Independent Party candidates .
Advertisement
Adding to the confusion of overlapping ballots , Logan said , some nonpartisan voters were incorrectly directed to Republican Party polling booths and marked presidential candidates in that primary .
Logan said he understood the anger and frustration that many voters have expressed over the ballot confusion .
“ Any time a vote is not counted because of an administrative burden it is significant , ” he said .
Voter advocates challenged Logan ’s decision and said he should examine each nonpartisan ballot .

“ Mr. Logan and the county have at their disposal the means to count the votes and ascertain voter intent in nearly all cases , ” said Rick Jacobs , chairman of the Courage Campaign .
“ Anything short of that is unacceptable disenfranchisement of L.A. County voters . ”

Posted on January 2 , 2008 , Steve Starcraft in 3D – Project Revolution Demo Released
If you ca n’t wait for Blizzard to release Starcraft 2 and / or are sick and tired of playing the ol ’ 2D Starcraft at a tiny 640×480 resolution , here ’s something that might raise an eyebrow ( or two ) .
The team over at Snowflake Entertainment have been working ( for three years ) on a Starcraft total conversion using the Warcraft III engine .
It seems ( as of late ) they have put together something they feel is worthy of public release :
Finally !
After more than 3 years in development , Snowflake Entertainment ( a modding community ) has announced that Project Revolution demo is now downloadable .
This demo allows you to play Starcraft Terran race in 3D using the Warcraft III Engine .
You must have the Starcraft : Brood War and Warcraft III : Frozen Throne CDs installed and updated with the latest patches ( All English - version ) and load the CDs on your CD - Drive when asked by the installer in order to play this demo .
Installation wo n’t work on non-English versions of the Game CDs .
No Mac installer at this time .
Windows Vista is not supported .
Project Revolution mod is meant only as a preview of what Snowflake Entertainment has done thus far .
It ’s not a complete or debugged demo .
There are many bugs , and adjustments that will be fixed in the final version of the demo .
In this demo , Terran race is around 90 % done ( lot of bug fixes not implemented ) .
Zerg is very incomplete ( 60 % ) .
The demo offers you a taste of what has been done in the past 3 years , and to show the potential the full mod will have when it is released in the future .
So yeah , it ’s an unfinished mod – albeit , a pretty good looking one .
However , the chance to play Starcraft at a scalable resolution sounds mighty enticing .
With Blizzard being a complete tease with Starcraft 2 media and Starcraft 2 ‘s release date yet to be announced , this might satiate your hunger – at least for a while .
You can download the installer for the mod from the link below .
You can also read a checklist of ( important ) requirements , install instructions , and a brief FAQ after the break .
If reading is n’t your thing , here ’s a link to an install tutorial as a nifty YouTube video .

FAQ !
1 . It wo n’t install ?
First make Sure Install.exe and Revolution .mpq are in the same directory .
Secondly SC CD must be in the CD Drive with Scand BW already installed on the computer .
2 . It wont run .
First off Wc3 and TFT must be installed for it to run .
Turn off your Virus scanners .
Best bet if this still does not work is a fresh install of XP .
Vista has been reported to work with PR however the developers of the Loader Andy , Mike , and I Never intended it for Vista .
The base code was created over three years ago and many changes in standard included libraries may have occurred .
Hence no vista support will be provided .
3 . I type “ yes ” and it just exits .
You have to type yes exactly how you see it on the screen .
Same capitalization and everything .
4 . What path should I use ?
This is up to you .

Honorata Barinjibanwa , an 18 - year - old woman with high cheekbones and downcast eyes , said she was kidnapped from a village that the Rastas raided in April and kept as a sex slave until August .
Most of that time she was tied to a tree , and she still has rope marks ringing her delicate neck .
The men would untie her for a few hours each day to gang - rape her , she said .
“ I ’m weak , I ’m angry , and I do n’t know how to restart my life , ” she said from Panzi Hospital in Bukavu , where she was taken after her captors freed her .
She is also pregnant .
While rape has always been a weapon of war , researchers say they fear that Congo ’s problem has metastasized into a wider social phenomenon .
“ It ’s gone beyond the conflict , ” said Alexandra Bilak , who has studied various armed groups around Bukavu , on the shores of Lake Kivu .
She said that the number of women abused and even killed by their husbands seemed to be going up and that brutality toward women had become “ almost normal . ”
Malteser International , a European aid organization that runs health clinics in eastern Congo , estimates that it will treat 8,000 sexual violence cases this year , compared with 6,338 last year .
The organization said that in one town , Shabunda , 70 percent of the women reported being sexually brutalized .
At Panzi Hospital , where Dr. Mukwege performs as many as six rape - related surgeries a day , bed after bed is filled with women lying on their backs , staring at the ceiling , with colostomy bags hanging next to them because of all the internal damage .
“ I still have pain and feel chills , ” said Kasindi Wabulasa , a patient who was raped in February by five men .
The men held an AK - 47 rifle to her husband ’s chest and made him watch , telling him that if he closed his eyes , they would shoot him .
When they were finished , Ms. Wabulasa said , they shot him anyway .
The 1 in 5 figure was the number that had received at least one instance of unwanted sex talk ( including from other teenagers ) , or sex talk from an adult ( whether wanted or not ) , in the past year .
The proportion of respondents who received a sexual flirtation from an adult , followed by a request to talk on the phone or meet in person , was about 1 % .
The number of survey respondents who actually befriended an adult online and then met the adult in person for sexual purposes , was zero .
1 in 7 respondents received unwanted sex talk or sex talk from an adult , at some point in the past year .
The proportion of respondents who received a sexual flirtation from an adult , followed by a request to communicate offline , was again about 1 - 2 % .
( 4 % of respondents reported a sexual flirtation plus a request to correspond offline .
The new study reported that 39 % of all sexual solicitations were made by adults , but did not say what proportion of " aggressive sexual solicitations " -- which included requests for offline contact -- were made by adults . )
Out of 1,501 respondents surveyed in 2005 , two did report an in - person meeting that led to a sexual crime -- one was a 15 - year - old girl who met a 30 - year - old man in person and had consensual sex with him , and another was a 16 - year - old girl who went to a party with an older male she met online who later tried to rape her .
But even these incidents ( which were both reported to law enforcement ) do not mean that the Internet is a more dangerous environment for youth with regard to interaction with adults .
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 's own Web site links to a study -- also by one of the authors of the " Online Victimization " report -- which found that when all types of abuse are counted , 20 % of females experience some type of sexual victimization before adulthood , compared to 2 out of 750 female survey respondents in the " Online Victimization " study who reported sexual abuse by someone they met online .
I have no doubt that on balance , the world is a better place because of the NCMEC and what they 've done , and God knows how I 'd feel about them if they 'd helped me find a lost child .
But the good things they 've done should n't be viewed as political capital that they can withdraw against in order to be above criticism for spreading the " 1 in 5 " meme .
The longer they go on implying to parents that there is a 1 - in - 5 chance their kid will be asked by an adult to meet in person for sex , the more I think it tarnishes their whole legacy .
( The NCMEC did not respond to contact requests for this article . )
First , what the 1 - in - 5 number actually means .
It originated with a study done in 2000 by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire , which surveyed 1,501 Internet - using youth age 10 through 17 .
The actual relevant findings of the study were as follows : Specifically : About 19 % of respondents said had received a " sexual solicitation or approach " ( my emphasis ) , and " sexual solicitations and approaches " were defined as : " requests to engage in sexual activities or sexual talk or give personal sexual information that were unwanted or , whether wanted or not , made by an adult " .
That means any unwanted sex talk , including from other teens , even if limited to one occurrence in the entire previous year , would cause a respondent to be included in the 19 % figure ( which , when you define it that broadly , actually sounds pretty low ) .
To say that those 1 in 5 minors were " sexually solicited " -- literally , asked for sex -- is simply false .
The actual proportion of respondents who reported that someone made sexual overtures and asked to talk on the phone or meet in person -- what the study called an " aggressive sexual solicitation " -- was 3 % , and 34 % of those requests were known to have been made by adults .
And even this overestimates the proportion of minors who were truly " sexually solicited " , because all it means is that an adult started out by talking to them sexually , and then made some request for offline contact , which could have merely been asking for a phone number .
So the scenario that comes to mind when hearing that " 1 in 5 children is sexually solicited online " -- of being approached sexually by an adult and asked for an in - person meeting -- had actually happened to no more than 1 % of respondents , and probably much fewer than that .
And this is just considering the percentage of youth who received solicitations , not taking into account how they responded .
Out of 1,501 youth surveyed , none of them reported actually meeting an adult in person for anything that they described as sexual contact .
Two teens in the study had " close friendships " with adults that the authors wrote " may have had sexual aspects " .
One 17 - year - old boy had a relationship with a woman in her late twenties that he described as " romantic " but not sexual , and they never met in person .
Another 16 - year - old girl became close to a man in his thirties , and they met in a public place , but she described the relationship as non-sexual , and she declined to spend the night with him .
( While these could still be considered " close calls " , it 's worth noting that even if the 16 - and 17 - year - olds had actually had a sexual relationship with their adult friends , that would have in fact been legal in many U.S. states , and in any case it's not what most people think of when they hear about " children " being " sexually solicited online " . )
Of course all of this depends on the accuracy of the answers that the youth gave to the surveyors .
But the " 1 in 5 " figure was based on the youths ' stated responses as well .
People who cite the study can't have their cake and eat it too , taking the " 1 in 5 " number as accurate but discounting the fact that none of the teens surveyed reported a sexual relationship with an adult they met online .
These were the data that were available in 2000 , when the " 1 in 5 " number started being spread .
The authors of the original study followed up with a 2005 report , " Online Victimization of Youth : Five Years Later " , in which the corresponding statistics were :
The NCMEC has updated their Web site to say that " one in seven youths ( 10 to 17 years ) experience a sexual solicitation or approach while online " , although the banner ads still say 1 in 5 .
But I think the 1 - in - 7 versus 1 - in - 5 is hardly worth nit-picking , when the real problem is that the statement " 1 in 5 children is sexually solicited online " is written in a way that virtually guarantees it will be mis-heard and passed along as a statement involving " online predators " or " pedophiles " .
" Authorities Say 1 in 5 Children Has Been Approached By Online Predators " reads the sub - heading of a story on ABC news .
" 20 % of children who use computer chat rooms have been approached over the Internet by a pedophile " says an online safety site sponsored by the Albemarle County government in Virginia .
" One in five kids in America are approached by online predators " says a Congressman 's press release .
The NCMEC itself never says that 1 in 5 or 1 in 7 children is " approached by a pedophile " , merely that they are " sexually solicited online " .
I still think this is false because that is not the proportion of minors who are literally solicited for sex , but suppose that you expanded " sexual solicitation " to include all sex talk , so that the statement was " technically true " .
That still misses the point , because the issue should n't be seen as a game where sides try to make their statements as alarmist as possible while still being " technically true " , like the kid with his petition to ban " dihydrogen monoxide " .
If you say something that is virtually guaranteed to get passed along as a wrong and alarmist statement about " pedophiles " , are n't you at least partly responsible ?
Why , then , does the NCMEC do it ?
Their site does have a " Donate " link , but it 's very low - key , and the site generally seems to steer first - time visitors towards actions that they can take with regard to their own children .
So I 'm not cynical enough to think the " 1 in 5 " statistic is a campaign to scare up donations ; I think they really do believe they are doing good by getting people to believe that number and to take action based on it .
The problem is that there is such a thing as too much worrying and too much overprotection .
Sites like Facebook are often used to organize parties and events and send out venue changes , just because that 's the most efficient way to do it , and if your parents ban you from getting on Facebook , you 'll miss out on simple things like that .
What good does that do for anybody ?
Critics of overprotection often say that overly sheltered kids may rebel later on and get themselves in worse trouble , and that 's often true , but so what even if they do n't ?
Your quality of life is still worse off if you 're the only one in your peer group who can't get updates about your friends ' parties .
And your parents ' quality of life will be worse if they 're constantly wringing their hands thinking that there is a 1 in 5 chance their kid will be propositioned online by a pedophile .
So I would urge the NCMEC to reconsider what they 're telling people .
Regarding the " 1 in 5 " meme that 's already out there , it 's spread so far that it 's probably too late for the NCMEC to put the genie back into the bottle .
But any anti-censorship group participating in a debate about online safety should put the real statistics forward , and since many in the audience will have heard the " 1 in 5 " figure somewhere , take a minute to knock it down as well .
You do n't have to commit political suicide by calling out the NCMEC specifically for spreading the " 1 in 5 " number , but put the right numbers out there .
Unfortunately the subject of child safety is such that wrong information , from any source , is unlikely to be criticized if it 's erring on the side of caution , but some memes die faster than others .
Microsoft 's resource page about " online predators " says that " if you find pornography on the family computer " -- not child porn , but regular pornography -- that could be a warning sign that " your child is the target of an online predator " .
I think that 's a wildly irresponsible thing to be telling parents , but fortunately the meme does not seem to have spread beyond that one page , which probably not one parent in a thousand will ever actually read .
Astronomers of SRON have discovered a new cluster of galaxies , hidden behind a previously identified cluster of galaxies .
The recently exposed cosmic giant is apparently just as bright as the first group , but is six times further away .
The astronomers made the discovery as part of an international team using the space telescope XMM - Newton .
Being fooled by a cosmic giant is no laughing matter for an astronomer .
For years astronomers racked their brains over the relation between two in X - rays equally bright and large regions in the cluster of galaxies known as Abell 3128 .
‘ That is the charm of science ’ , says Norbert Werner , PhD student at SRON .
’ You are always finding things that you did not expect . ’
Clusters of galaxies are the largest structures in the universe .
They consist of tens to hundreds of massive galaxies , of which each in turn consists of hundreds of billions of stars .
Gravity is the binding factor .
The hot gas of tens of millions degrees Celsius , present in the clusters , emits X - rays , which renders the cluster visible for space telescopes such as XMM - Newton .
Detailed analyses of these X - rays tell astronomers more about the composition of the gas and accordingly , its origin .
What was so intriguing about the two X - ray spots in cluster Abell 3128 was the fact that although they had the same size and brightness , the gas clouds seemed to have completely different compositions .
Werner : ‘ While one spot was clearly caused by a hot gas cloud rich in metals released by supernova explosions in the galaxies , the other spot seemed to contain a much lower amount of metals than any other cluster previously observed .
What we observed completely contradicted the current theories about how large structures in the universe arise . ’
The observations with the XMM - Newton made the surprise complete .
The gas cloud behind the puzzling X - ray spot was found to be 4.6 billion light years away , at least six times further than cluster Abell 3128 .
‘ We were therefore looking at two completely different objects , which from our perspective were in exactly the same line of sight ’ , says Norbert Werner .
‘ The research into this large cluster of galaxies mainly centres on the question as to how the large structures of the universe have been formed ’ , explains project leader Jelle Kaastra .
According to current insights , material is spread throughout the universe as a web of thread - like structures of rarefied hot gas : the cosmic web .
Between these threads are cavities that are becoming increasingly larger as the universe expands .
‘ Compare it to bubbles in a bubble bath ’ , says the astronomer .
The density of the material is highest at the intersections in the web .
Therefore that is where clusters of galaxies develop .
Due to their enormous mass and attractive force , the clusters have their own dynamics .
Kaastra :
‘ They attract each other , collide and fly through each other ; a whole host of things happen that we can study with X - ray telescopes such as the XMM - Newton . ’
XMM -Newton is the X - ray telescope of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) for which SRON built an instrument capable of analysing the X - rays in detail .
XMM -Newton was launched in 1999 from French Guyana and still functions superbly .
ESA recently extended the operation of the satellite for a further 5 years .
The results from the research of Norbert Werner and Jelle Kaastra were recently published in the scientific journal Astronomy & Astrophysics .

As yet another example of how insane the drug war has become , cops in Nebraska have seized $ 69 K in “ suspected drug money ” from a driver who was not arrested , ticketed , nor in any way proven to be involved in criminal activity :
Deputy Chris Engel , 25 , had been on the job just two weeks when a routine traffic stop Dec. 20 turned into the biggest cash seizure the Nebraska county has ever seen .
Engel pulled over a Salt Lake City , Utah , resident whom he suspected of speeding on Interstate 80 near the town of Kimball .
The driver ’s story did n’t add up , Engel said , so he did a little more investigating .
In the end , $ 69,040 in cash was taken from the car .
Officials suspect the money is connected to a drug - trafficking operation , he said .
The driver was not arrested — or even ticketed for going 10 mph over the 75 mph speed limit .
( He was warned . )
But the investigation is ongoing , Engel said .
The Nebraska State Patrol and the Drug Enforcement Agency are assisting in the investigation .
It was the first big cash seizure Kimball County has seen , said Sheriff Tim Hanson .
With Interstate 80 running through the Panhandle county , he believes there are ample opportunities to make a dent in drug operations .
But in such a sparsely populated county with few resources , it has been difficult to devote deputies ’ time to patrolling the Interstate , he said .
“ Chris is a very aggressive young deputy , ” Hanson said .
Investigators do n’t know if they will be able to connect the money to a drug operation , Hanson said , but the important work already has been done .
“ The big thing is he grabbed 69 ( thousand dollars ) and took it away from them , ” Hanson said of the money seized .
“ That ’s going right straight to the heart of the matter . ”
As I found this story through Radley Balko , I ’m going to apply one of his general rules of drug raids .
If the cops have evidence against someone in a situation like this , they ’ll immediately state that as justification for their actions .
Silence is most often to be interpreted as a lack of evidence .
But look at what the Sheriff says .
They do n’t know whether they can connect the money to drugs , but the “ important work ” is done .
Would n’t it be important to prove that the money was obtained illegally ?
Would n’t be important to prove that the driver was doing something wrong which would justify the seizure of his money ?
Do n’t they need to satisfy any due process ?
Sadly , the answer is no .
As we learned a year and a half ago , simply having large amounts of cash is a crime .
And because they charge the money with the crime , not the owner of the money , they do n’t need to assume that the owner of the money is innocent until proven guilty .
Rather , the money is assumed to be drug - related , and the owner must sue to prove its legitimacy .
I ’ve often said that government is thinly - veiled thievery .
Now they ’re so confident in themselves that they ’re removing the veil .
GOP ' discouraged ' at lack of telecom donations to reward immunity support Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 28 , 2008

Print This Email This Congressional Republicans have been among the most vocal proponents of a plan that would spare telecommunications companies from paying millions -- perhaps billions -- of dollars in litigation costs and potential penalties for their participation in President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , which critics say was illegal .
One might think that those expected savings would find their way into GOP campaign coffers , but party aides are griping to Roll Call that a surge in donations from telephone and Internet providers has failed to materialize .
" It 's quite discouraging , " one Republican aide laments to the subscription - only Capitol Hill newspaper .
Since Democrats took over Congress last year , donations from telecoms have followed those from several other business sectors into the campaign coffers of the new majority party .
House Democrats have refused to blink in their showdown with President Bush over his demand for retroactive telecom immunity as part of an updated surveillance law , but those companies have done little to boost the fortunes of the GOP as it continues to push Democrats to approve the immunity plan .
 These companies just wont do anything ,  the GOP aide told Roll Call 's Tory Newmyer and Lauren W. Whittington .
 Even when you have the Democrats working against their bottom line .
No Republicans would speak to the reporters on the record , wary of the impression that their immunity support is little more than a legislative shake - down for campaign donations .
But plenty proffered private complaints about the telco 's shifting support .
While Democrats often benefit from heavy outside spending and advocacy campaigns from labor unions and other ideologically aligned groups , telecoms and others in the business community are wary to mount such a similarly partisan effort because they need to maintain good relationships with both parties .
 Theres no question that from time to time staff , and maybe some Members , say to fellow travelers :  Are you giving us some air cover ?
Are you helping us help you ? one Republican lobbyist told Newmyer and Whittington .
Another lobbyist told them of a " growing frustration " among Republicans " that a lot of these guys getting screwed by Democratic leadership are continuing to load their coffers . 
Although the telecoms have not inserted themselves into the immunity debate , some interest groups have tried to push Democrats on the issue , which has been before Congress for months as it works to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
One ostensibly bipartisan group , the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , is running an ad targeting 15 House Democrats , but the tone of the 24 - themed ad caused several Democrats to leave the group , as TPM Muckraker reported this week .
Pro-war activists at Freedom 's Watch also are lobbying for telecom immunity .
The House Republican conference has produced its own FISA ad , as well .
Newmyer and Whittington trace the shift of telecom dollars :
Of the four major phone companies , only Sprint is now favoring Democrats overall , giving the majority party about 57 percent of their PAC contributions , according to CQ MoneyLine .
The other three companies , AT&T , Verizon and Qwest , still give a majority to Republicans but by slimmer margins than in years past .
AT&T gave Democrats 38 percent of their PAC dollars last year , up 8 percentage points from the 2006 cycle ; Verizon gave them 47 percent , up 10 percentage points from the last cycle ; and Qwest gave them 49 percent , a 22 percentage - point boost over 2006 , according to records from the FEC and CQ MoneyLine .
The griping over telco dollars comes as the GOP finds itself struggling to keep up with Democratic fundraising before this year 's elections , which observers predict will expand Democratic control of Congress .
The National Republican Congressional Committee has $ 29 million less than the Democrats campaign as of Jan. 31 , according to Roll Call .
Frustration bubbled over at a closed - door GOP session this week , according to the paper .
House Republican Leader John Boehner told members of his party to get off their " dead asses " and start fundraising .

10 .
It is Absurd :
This may seem like I am re-stating what this list sets out to show .
However , this is misleading .
When someone comes to us with an extravagant claim the most common reason we may discount the claim is because , to put it curtly , we find it absurd .
The reason why the majority of people do n’t believe in Scientology , reincarnation , Mormonism , Greek Gods , etc. is not because they have extensively researched the historicity and veracity of the claims , it is because they do n’t believe such things happen in the world .
In other words , common sense tells us that when someone claims the absurd almost anything is more likely to be the case ( e.g. they are lying , they are delusional , they are relying on misinformation ) than for the absurdity to be real .
Men do not miraculously heal the sick , raise the dead , cure the blind , and rise from the grave .
The claims of Christianity are prima facie absurd .
The burden of proof is on them .
9. Jesus Has Not Returned :
This , also , may seem a soft point .
However , for 2000 years – 80 generations–a substantial number of every single generation of Christians has whole - heartedly believed that Jesus ’ return was imminent .
This often included exact dates that , when they came to pass , did not cause the believers to toss their erroneous ideologies aside .
And this perennial incorrectness goes back to the beginning .
One can only understand the earliest Christians –the generation immediately following Jesus ’ death–as a group who were expecting Jesus to return at any moment ( I Thess 4:15 - 17 ) .
Why did they believe this ?
Because , on more than one occasion , Jesus unequivocally said so ( Mark 9:1 , Matthew 26:64 , Mark 13:30 ) .
Christians have proven to be resolutely imperturbable and incorrigible to their continued failures .
8. God Does n’t Care : Most people believe in God .
And , when asked why they believe in God , the most common answer is taken from the argument from design : the universe is too ordered and beautiful to have arisen without an intelligence behind it .
Whether or not this is true , this claim has little to do with Christianity .
Christianity claims that God not only created the world but also takes an active part in its management , in our moral choices , and in our fates .
In other words ; He cares .
It is this conception of God that bends credulity to the breaking point .
God as essence –that is a “ first cause ” God or a “ higher power ” God–is a far less difficult concept than God as being .
First of all , according to centuries old Christian dogma , God is immutable .
In other words
He is a static , non-changing “ being ” that cannot create new beliefs , make inferences , or adjust desires .
Secondly the idea of an omniscient , omnipotent “ being ” having desires borders on the nonsensical .
If all things are known–all that ever was , is , or will be–what would be the point of desiring anything ?
This is not just a simple word game .
Christians consistently claim that God “ wants ” us to believe in him and follow his commandments .
However , they also claim that he knows whether we will do so or not .
So , what is the point of Him wanting anything ?
God as essence is palatable .
God as a being is not only ridiculous but likely impossible .
( P.S. This one is for the non-predestinarians .
If you are a pre-destinarian there are other reasons you are wrong : see below .
However , most Christians are not predestinarians ; although , if they care about consistency [ not high on the list ] , they should be . )
7. Other Religions :
For most of Christian history the problems caused by other religions were not pressing , if they were considered at all .
In the enclosed world of medieval times –when most people would never travel more than 10 miles from their place of birth–people of non-Christian faiths seemed almost phantasms .
However , in the modern world the pots have been poured together and the faiths now intermingle on a daily basis .
This , of course , brings religious problems to the forefront .
But it also should force Christians ( and other faiths ) to make a few realizations : first , that faiths are conveyed primarily genealogically –from parents to children–as opposed to through dialectical , later - life conversion .
We can never reasonably expect everyone to become Christian .
This is not because Christianity is right or wrong , but because faiths carry their own momentum that is not derived from the truth or falsity of the beliefs .
Secondly , that people of other faiths can live saintly lives of intense moral rectitude that rivals any Christian saint .
And third , that people are exceptionally good at perpetuating , believing in , and dying for faiths that are manifestly false ( as Christians believe ) .
In other words , as Christians must unhesitatingly accept , people are very good at making up fantastic stories about events and figures in the past and then believing in them with fervor .
If Christianity was the only belief system in the world that made extravagant claims , and if its claims resembled none others in the world , then we would have more reason to believe it to be true .
However , this is obviously not so .
In fact , often the claims of Christianity are hopelessly derivative .
Healing and resurrecting god-men have been the objects of stories for millennia ( these god-men were particularly common in the Hellenized world of post - Maccabean Palestine . i.e. Apollonius of Tyana ) .
Also , in addition to sharing many strong features with Mithraism and Zoroastrianism , many early Christians found much distaste with the idea of the virgin birth , finding it too pagan .
Plutarch writes in Convivial Disputations ,
” The fact of the intercourse of a male god with a mortal woman is conceded by all . ”
6 . There is No Soul :
The inexcusable flippancy of the term “ soul ” abounds .
And , although most people believe in it and freely use the term , they have no idea what it means .
The evidence for physicalism –that the mind is the brain –has become nothing less than overwhelming .
This evidence exists not only in the highest levels of research–where scientists can now point to , and manipulate , the exact location in our grey matter where essential characteristics lie–but it exists in the everyday lives of millions of people who take psychotropic drugs on a daily basis .
These users will tell you drugs such as Prozac , lithium , Paxil and Ritalin do n’t just give them a slight pick - me - up , they make them an entirely different person .
Some of them must wonder if their “ soul ” is depressed or happy , anxiety filled or laid - back .
Only by ignoring 200 years of medical progress can we believe that we simply inhabit our bodies –dropping by on the way to something better .
It is n’t “ I have a brain , ” it ’s “ I am a brain . ”
5 . Evil :
The tried and true returns .
If you are a Christian you are probably rolling your eyes because you ’ve heard it time and again .
Why do n’t we atheists understand that : [ A ]
God works in mysterious ways , [ B ]
God gave us free will which allows us to commit evil and good , [ C ] the world is in a fallen state , and [ D ] Satan represents a real presence in the world ?
No , we do n’t understand because : [ A ] clearly God does n’t work in ways that are too mysterious for you to be unhesitant in calling something “ He ” did “ good ” and asking him to do “ good ” things in the world on your behalf .
You can either use moral qualifiers to describe God ’s actions or you cannot ; you ca n’t have it both ways . [ B ]
Not only does this point not jibe with argument “ A ” ( if God works in mysterious ways we could n’t claim that free will is a “ good ” ) it is difficult to see how , if free will is good , the using of free will to take away another ’s free will ( i.e. murder ) is not intensely problematic in God ’s eyes .
Hitler used his free will to take away the free will of 10 million others .
Thus , if , in 1919 , God flipped the “ become an artist ” switch in Hitler ’s mind , the result would have greatly added to the net amount of freedom in the world . [ C ]
This is a non-starter if the Old Testament is not accurate but , even if it is , a God who holds great - great - great … grandchildren responsible for their ancester ’s actions does not pass even the bare minimum test of human morality .
Without a defined concept of desert , morality is a completely empty concept .
It seems God is playing fast and loose on this count . [ D ]
If this objection is forwarded seriously , then it is little more than ditheism ( dual theism ) .
Otherwise , in the Christian universe the only power Satan has is that which God lets him have .
If you believe in the traditional Christian conception of God you must believe that , ultimately , everything is His fault .
Everything .
This in a world where rocks fall out of the sky onto innocent people and babies are eaten by dingoes .
4 . The Bible is Not Consistent : Many , if not most , Christians would say that the Bible is inerrant .
Well , they are wrong .
Saying so does n’t require an appeal to history , science , and / or archaeology ; it only requires a demonstration that the Bible is incoherent –that is , it contains claims that can not be true simultaneously .
In such instances either one claim is false or they are both false–there is no other possibility .
If you wish to throw rationality out the window and claim that a contradiction is possible , then you can just take your ball and go home ; you are now playing a game that you can ask no one else to play with you .
One example of many : Matthew ( 1:1 - 16 ) claims that there are 27 generations between David and Jesus , Luke ( 3:23 - 38 ) claims 41 generations .
These can not be reconciled .
The Bible is not inerrant .
QED
3. Christianity Cannot be the Religion that Jesus Preached :
The story of Christianity is the story of the beliefs that Jesus professed developing into the religion that professes Jesus .
In other words ; dogma .
It is pure folly to believe that Simon Peter , Thomas , Mary Magdalene et.al followed Jesus because , when he died , they would be able to absolve their sins by believing in him .
This later theological construction was created by believers who were searching for a meaning to the seemingly pointless execution of their leader and teacher .
Those who originally followed Jesus did so because of his life –because he was an exemplary teacher who radically reinterpreted the Law in favor of inclusion rather than exclusion .
Those who now follow Jesus do so because of his death .
They turn a man ’s poignant teachings –his life ’s work –into a secondary and near meaningless preface to the panacea of his death .
We primarily have Paul and John the evangelist ( two people who did not know Jesus in his life ) to thank for this inexcusable dumbing - down of Jesus ’ life .
With Paul and John ’s help , what Christianity would become is embodied in the Nicene Creed .
Take a look at it .
Dogmatic fiat has expurgated everything the man stood for .
2 . The Gospels are not Historically Reliable :
We need not demonstrate Biblical errors solely through appeals to internal consistency .
Doing so only tells us that something in the “ word of God ” is awry–but not necessarily which word is wrong .
In order to perform Biblical analysis that actually broadens our view of what is true and false in the “ good ” book we need to bring in external sources .
From these external sources we learn that the Bible makes claims that cannot stand up to even the most cursory historical examination .
In the Gospel of Luke the story is told of a census enacted by the governor Quirinius ( Luke 2:1 - 7 ) .
The census , according to Luke , required everyone to return to their ancestral homes to be counted .
Thus Joseph , being in the line of David , travels from Nazareth to Bethlehem where –after unadvisedly traveling ninety miles with a woman in the final days of pregnancy –Mary gives birth .
The Romans , being meticulous record keepers , did take censuses .
However , because of this meticulous record keeping , we know that the only census conducted during Quirinius ’ governorship took place in A.D. 6 - 7 –a time over ten years after Herod was king of Judea ( Luke claims they are contemporaries ) .
However , aside from this fact we can use common sense to realize that the story is totally unbelievable .
Luke invents an empire - wide migration for a simple tax registration : millions of people traveling hundreds or thousands of miles to go to their ancestral home of a millennium past ( David predates Joseph by approx .
1000 years ) in order to sign a simple form .
Imagine this happening today .
Imagine the cataclysmic disruption of societies resulting from the masses of people crossing boarders and oceans in order to sign a form .
This , of course , supposes you could even find your ancestral home of a millennium past .
No , something is wrong here and it is n’t that the Romans liked to periodically enact sadistically cumbersome legislation .
No , I think our evangelist needs to go back to history class .
But wait …
1 . The Gospels are not History :
This may seem like a paltry excuse for the number one spot on a list that makes such a grandiose claim .
This reason , however , is the lynch pin .
The historicity of the Gospels represents the most crucial element of Christianity –for either its truth or falsity .
Christianity claims a specific historical relationship between God and man .
If that relationship is historically inaccurate then Christianity is wrong .
Or , as Paul memorably put it , “ if Christ has not been raised , our preaching is useless and so is your faith . ” ( 1 Cor. 15:14 ) .
As we ’ve seen the Bible is often contradictory and the Gospels are not historically accurate .
However , the Christian mistake is compounded by believing that the Gospels are even history –that is that they were written or designed to accurately portray historical truths .
The evangelists did not intend their writings to be taken as historical truths .
If they could see modern Christianity they would be shocked at the millions of Christians interpreting their writings as historically authoritative .
Please do n’t misinterpret what I am saying .
I am not saying the Gospels were entirely made up .
I am saying that they were primarily written as myths that forego historical truths ( but use many of them ) in favor of conveying larger , theological truths that the evangelists believed about Jesus of Nazareth .
The evangelists poured through the Old Testament and found “ prophecies ” that predicted Jesus ’ life .
After all , there had to be grander reasons why their great teacher had been executed like a common criminal .
In the pages of Jewish scripture they found those reasons .
They then consciously wrote their gospels in order to retroactively fulfill prophecy .
That this happens at all is beyond dispute .
Sometimes , while stumbling over themselves to “ fulfill ” prophecy , they get it horribly wrong : Mark ( 1:1 - 3 ) , using shoddy sources , begins his gospel with “ prophecy ” that mistakenly conflates two Old Testament versus ; Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 3:1. Matthew ( 1:20 - 23 ) uses a mistranslated Old Testament , in which the Hebrew almah , ( meaning “ young woman ” ) was changed to the Greek parthenos ( meaning a physical virgin ) , as a justification for the immaculate conception .
Matthew ( 21:1 - 7 ) so wants to fulfill a “ prophecy ” from another shoddy source that has combined Isaiah 62:11 and Zachariah 9:9 , that he misinterprets the passage –which only speaks of one animal ( with subsequent qualifiers ) –and has Jesus ride into Jerusalem , in some bizarre act of balance , on two animals .
( The other gospel writers are quick to correct this grievous error . )
Thus , we begin to see that not only is it a manifest absurdity to believe the Gospels are history , it becomes tenuous to believe they are even accurate .
Each evangelist had his own interpretation .
The theology of the evangelists–and specifically their Christology ( the nature of Christ ) –developed into more grandiose claims as Jesus ’ life moved further into the past .
If you wish to discover this for yourself , I advise you to successively read the Gospel of Mark ( almost universally agreed to be the earliest Gospel written between A.D. 65-70 ) and the Gospel of John ( agreed to be the latest Gospel written between A.D. 90 -100 ) in a single sitting .
Ask yourself this question ; are they telling the same story ?
In Mark ’s Gospel , Jesus largely speaks in parables and evasive third - person proclamations about someone called “ the Son of Man . ”
In John ’s Gospel , Jesus tells no parables and spends most of the time talking about himself , his godly status , and what the future will bring .
So , here is a brief lesson in the development of the concept of Jesus as God .
We will only look at the beginning and the end ; Jesus ’ birth and death .
Each historically subsequent evangelist slowly turns Jesus from a wise man contained within a life into a supernatural being who transcends the boundaries of life at both ends .
First the birth narratives .
In Mark there are none .
Jesus is chosen at his baptism .
Matthew and Luke ( written c. 80-90 ) go back to his birth and tell incompatible stories of Jesus ’ miraculous birth to a virgin .
They further cement and establish the status of Jesus .
John , feeling the others were n’t good enough , decides to go back to the beginning of time ( John 1:1 “ In the beginning was the word … ” ) to establish the nature of Jesus .
The later gospels create theological concepts that were not present in the earliest sources .
Likewise , the death of Jesus changes dramatically throughout the gospels .
There are no post - resurrection appearances in the earliest gospel , Mark .
The last 12 verses of Mark are thought by many to be a later addition , added to create more congruence between the later gospels and Mark .
By John ’s Gospel , however , Jesus spends two and a half chapters wandering around post - crucifixion .
The many significant changes in the death / resurrection narratives can be summed up in the three different accounts of the last words of Jesus : Mark 15:34 and Matthew 27:46 “ My god , my god , why have you forsaken me . ”
Luke 23:46 “ Father , into your hands I commit my spirit . ”
John 19:30
“ It is finished . ”
The development of Christianity is encapsulated in the move from the utterance of pain , ignorance , nonacceptance , and suffering seen in Mark and Matthew to the statement of acceptance , foreknowledge , and peace that is seen in John .
These are incompatible interpretations of Jesus .
The character in the gospels may have the same name but it is not the same man hanging on the cross .
The Gospels are guides to belief written by believers .
This is a horribly unreliable way to learn accurate information .
When you already believe “ The Truth , ” distortions that you consciously engage in – that you see as promoting “ The Truth ” – are not seen as lies , but rather , as efficacious ways of getting “ The Truth ” to the hearts of readers .
We do n’t know why the evangelists believed as they did , but in the gospels they do n’t give us the reasons they believe , they give us reasons to believe ; an entirely different matter .
But we do KNOW they invented things .
We KNOW that the theological conception of Jesus changed as the believers grew more distant from his life .
What Christians believe most fervently ( e.g. Jesus being God , appearing after he died , dying for the sins of the world ) are concepts that were developed later .
They are concepts that did not exist in the earliest generations of Christian belief .
They certainly did not exist when Jesus was alive .
Early Christians invented myths to overcome the “ stumbling - block ” ( 1 Cor. 1:23 ) of the cross .
Paul knew that , for the Jews and Gentile Greeks , the execution of Jesus represented a major problem .
The “ king of the jews ” was not supposed to be an executed lowly peasant .
The “ savior of mankind ” was not a common criminal .
Over time , theological concepts developed that explained this hang - up .
Thus , an executed traitor was turned into a victorious Messiah .
Conclusion :
These are some of the reasons that people like me do n’t believe .
Faith , or lack of it , has nothing to do with it .
While none of these reasons is entirely convincing by itself , when taken together they create a strong case for the falsity of Christianity –if not an open - and - shut case .
If you are a Christian and you are reading this ( which I highly doubt ) and if you cannot respond to each of these objections with evidence and coherent argumentation–as opposed to with faith and shouting –then you need to start shopping for a new religion .
When studying religions it may be interesting to learn more about Native American religions since many of them developed with an absence of culture influx compared to the religions that developed in Europe and elsewhere .
This is one of the reasons why many Native American spiritualities seem pretty foreign to many people .
There are a lot of blockbusting TV - series now on air , like Prison Break , Heroes , Lost , Numb3rs , House , CSI , The Simpsons and South Park .
More information about tv-series can be found on TV.com .
It can be very annoying if you missed your favorite TV - program .
Especially when it's a program where you must see all the episodes , otherwise you do n't understand what the story is about .
My personal favorite TV - program has to be Family Guy ( Seriously , how can you not like this ) .
Another program that I really like is 24 .
24 is one of those programs where you have to see all the episodes .
But what if you missed one ?
Or what if the country you live in does n't broadcast that program ?
Here 's the solution :
Watch your favorite program online using streaming media .
Here is a list of websites on the net that allows you to view tv-programs , movies , music video 's etc. streaming online .
Video's are hosted on sites such as YouTube , YourDailyMedia etc .
Ofcourse this is totally free .
Grab a huge bag of popcorn , get your soda 's ready , sit back and enjoy .
Overall note
Most movies require you to have Flash Player installed , others use DivX Player .
Some simply use Windows Media Player or Apple Quicktime .
Most movies are compressed from their original format , so do n't expect high quality .
Ofcourse , if there is any website missing from this list , feel free to post them in the comments .

Pacific Biosciences , or PacBio , is just one entrant in a heated race for the “ $ 1,000 genome ”  a gold rush of activity whose various contestants threaten to shake up the current $ 1 - billion - a - year market for machines that sequence , or read , genomes .
But the company has attracted some influential investors .
And some outside experts say that if the technology works  still a big if  it would represent a significant advance .
“ They ’re the technology that ’s going to really rip things apart in being that much better than anyone else , ” predicted Elaine R. Mardis , the co-director of the genome center at Washington University in St. Louis .
( CNN ) --
The parents of slain Tennessee minister Matthew Winkler on Tuesday asked the state 's Supreme Court to overturn a lower court 's order giving his widow -- who was also his killer -- visitation rights with the couple 's children .
Holding baby Brianna , Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew .
In the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia .
At the least , they want the visits to go on only under a counselor 's supervision .
Mary Winkler was convicted earlier this year in the 2006 shotgun death of her husband , a Church of Christ minister .
She said his slaying came after years of abuse , including physical violence and being forced to dress " slutty " for undesirable sex acts .
Prosecutors were pushing for a first - degree murder conviction , but a jury convicted her on the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter .
Winkler initially received a three - year sentence , but a judge required her to serve only 210 days and gave her credit for the five months she had already served behind bars .
The judge allowed Winkler to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility .
She was released in August .
Since her arrest , the Winklers ' three daughters -- Patricia , Mary Alice and Brianna , who were ages 8 , 6 and 1 at the time -- have been in the custody of Matthew Winkler 's parents , Charles and Diane Winkler .
The Winklers are battling Mary Winkler for custody of the children and have also filed a $ 2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son 's slaying .
In September , a lower court granted Mary Winkler visitation with her daughters , mandating that the visits be supervised by a guardian to represent the children 's interests , as well as by the couple Mary Winkler is living with or her sister .
A subsequent appeal by the Winklers was denied .
The Winklers requested that if a court grants visitation at all , it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor .
Several experts who testified in a September hearing on the matter said as much , the Winklers said in their filing .
Also in September , witnesses testified the children " exhibit fear and confusion " toward their mother " and her role in their father 's death , " the Winklers said .
One expert quoted Patricia as saying her mother killed her father and " I do n't know if she will kill me .
I want to ask her if she would do that to me .
It scares me , kind of ; if she did , well , I guess I would see my father , " according to court documents .
The Winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother , the girls experienced " urination accidents , sleeping problems , graphic nightmares and sleepwalking .
...
It is evident that the children will have difficulty reconnecting with [ their mother ] .
If visitation is determined to be appropriate at all under these circumstances , it is in the children 's best interests to have a professional counselor present . "
The couple said the court made a mistake by not appointing a guardian until after the September hearing .
After the March 22 , 2006 , slaying of Matthew Winkler , Mary Winkler fled with the children to the Alabama coast , where she was arrested .
She said during a September appearance on " The Oprah Winfrey Show " that she never expected to get away with killing her husband and she fled in order to be with her daughters and " have some good times . "
She also said she did not think her sentence was long enough .
" There 's no amount of time I think you can put on something like this .
I was just ready for them to lock the door and throw away the key , " Mary Winkler said .
During the trial , her former father - in - law testified that his son had never been violent .
Diane Winkler chastised Mary Winkler for never apologizing to his parents or children .
During her Oprah appearance , Mary Winkler said she would like a chance to sit down with the Winklers , saying she loves them , misses them and prays for them daily .
Asked what she would say to them , Mary Winkler said she could n't pare it down to two or three sentences .
" Just when that time comes , my heart will tell me what to say , " she said .

March 4 , 2008  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. has battled back from the political brink by defeating Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , in the crucial voting states of Texas and Ohio , where the former first lady fought hard for Latino voters and the white , working class voters who have typically supported her in earlier primaries .
The headline battles in delegate - rich Ohio and Texas were considered crucial primary contests that could cement Obama 's hold on the Democratic presidential nomination , or help Clinton continue to fight on for her party 's nomination .
In her victory speech in Columbus , Ohio , Tuesday night , Clinton claimed a comeback .
" For everyone here in Ohio and across America , who 's ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out and for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up , and for everyone who works hard and never gives up , this one is for you , " Clinton told a cheering crowd of supporters .
" This nation 's coming back and so is this campaign ! " Clinton said .
Clinton Claims a Comeback
A Clinton adviser said the Ohio win would be enough for Clinton to fight on to the next big primary in Pennsylvania on April 22 , nearly six weeks from now — the longest stretch of time without a contest in the nomination season .
" I dont see anyway she does n't go forward now , " a Clinton adviser told ABC News ' Eileen Murphy .
" We were outspent massively .
Ohio clearly augurs well for Pennsylvania .
We 'll see what happens in Texas but in my view there 's no argument for getting out , " the adviser said .
Obama : ' This Is Not The Future We Want '
In a subdued speech to supporters Tuesday night in San Antonio , Texas , Obama maintained he is still ahead in the delegate count and slammed his Democratic rival .
" No matter what happens tonight , we have nearly the same delegate lead as we did this morning , and we are on our way to winning this nomination , " Obama said .
" This is not the future we want .
We want a new course for this country .
We want new leadership in Washington .
We want change in America , " Obama told supporters .
" John McCain and Senator Clinton echo each other in dismissing this call for change . "
McCain : ' The Contest Begins Tonight '
On the Republican side , Senator John McCain , R - Ariz . , swept the March 4 GOP primaries in Ohio , Texas , Rhode Island , and Vermont and now has the 1,191 delegates needed to become the Republican presidential nominee , according to ABC News ' delegate count .
" I am very very grateful pleased to note my friends .
that tonight we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence , humility and a sense of great responsibility that I will be the Republican nominee for President of the United States , " McCain told supporters Tuesday night .
" The contest begins tonight , " he said to cheers and applause .
At McCain 's election night party headquarters in Dallas , a huge banner reading " 1191 " hangs alongside hundreds of red , white , and blue balloons .
McCain will meet Wednesday with President George W. Bush , who is expected to endorse the Arizona senator at an event in the Rose Garden at the White House .
Conceding the race , former Gov. Mike Huckabee , R - Ark. , suggested his candidacy gave a voice to the millions of Christian evangelical voters who supported his campaign .
" Not only have we fought the good fight and finished the race but more importantly , we have kept the faith .
I would rather lose an election than lose the principles that got me into politics in the first place , " Huckabee said .
Clinton Wins Women in Ohio , Blue - Collar Workers
Breaking a 12 contest losing streak , Clinton won Ohio with 141 delegates at stake and won Rhode Island , with 21 delegates up for grabs .
In Ohio , Clinton won women and won white men , with huge margins among women and men without a college degree , according to exit poll results .
Obama , meanwhile , racked up a win in Vermont 's Democratic primary -- a win that was expected by both candidates and credited to that state 's sizeable population of liberal and Independent voters who have typically gone for the Illinois senator .
In Vermont , Obama beat Clinton among senior citizens as well as among white women , two of her core groups .
His focus on " change " prevailed over " experience " by nearly a 40 - point margin .
But it was Clinton 's hold on low - income , low - education Democrats and women -- key demographic groups in Ohio that could help her win in Pennsylvania over a month from now .
Comeback Kid
Clinton had the most at stake coming into the race , facing pressure to cede the nomination battle if she did n't win both Texas and Ohio , with a combined 370 delegates up for grabs .
Even former President Bill Clinton said she must win both states to stay in the race , although a new ABC News / Washington Post poll shows Democrats by a 2 - 1 margin think the former first lady should fight on even if she only wins one or the other .
Some influential Democrats suggested Clinton should drop out of the race if she was n't ahead after Tuesday 's votes .
" We have to have a positive campaign after Tuesday .
Whoever has the most delegates after Tuesday , a clear lead , should be , in my judgment , the nominee , " New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson , a Democratic superdelegate himself , said on CBS 's Face The Nation Sunday .
Outside a Houston elementary school , the voting site for a heavily Hispanic area , Clinton indicated Tuesday morning she planned to stay in the race .
" I do n't pay attention to what people are saying , " Clinton said .
" This is a long process as some of you have heard me say before , " she told reporters .
" My husband did n't get the nomination wrapped up until June .
That has been the tradition — that it usually lasted longer . "
Asked about the ABC News / Washington
Post poll which seems to support Clinton 's perspective , she replied , " Never underestimate the intelligence of the voter . "
Hispanic , Blacks Key Texas
Latinos turned out in big numbers in the Texas Democratic primary , accounting for a record 30 percent of voters , up from 24 percent in 2004 , according to preliminary exit poll results .
Latinos went 63 -35 percent for Clinton over Obama .
Clinton also won white women in Texas by 19 points while white men split evenly between Clinton and Obama .
The Illinois senator won 85 percent of black voters in Texas , who accounted for 19 percent of Democratic primary voters in the Lone Star State .
Many
Texans took advantage of early voting rules ; early voting is expected to account for 50 percent of the total Democratic primary votes , according to the Texas Secretary of State 's office .
But earlier Tuesday Clinton expressed dismay at the peculiar voting rules in Texas , where Democratic delegates are allocated through a combination of the results from primary votes and caucuses .
Texas apportions delegates in a complex system that may yield Obama more delegates from expected wins in Texas ' big cities , while giving Clinton less delegates for expected wins in Latino areas along the border .
" When the dust clears , we have to ask some tough questions , " Clinton told reporters in reference to the Texas voting rules , arguing that the limited window to appear at a caucus makes it difficult for particularly working class voters to participate .
Heated Race Turns to Delegate Count
Obama went into Tuesday 's contest with a 110 - delegate lead , according to the ABC News delegate scorecard .
Clinton has a very serious math problem .
Almost regardless of what happens Tuesday and in the few remaining states left to vote , she will be behind Obama in delegates when the last primary vote is cast in Puerto Rico in June .
That makes the role of superdelegates all the more important .
The Obama campaign issued a statement Tuesday suggesting Clinton must make a significant dent in Obama 's pledged delegate lead -- an unlikely event given state polling and the Democratic Party 's proportional system for according delegates .
" The Clinton campaign said this race was all about delegates and that they would be tied or ahead by morning , " said Obama spokesperson Bill Burton in his statement .
" But despite the 20 - point lead in Ohio and Texas that Senator Clinton had just two weeks ago , we will still be well ahead in delegates tonight and they will have failed at achieving their plainly stated goals . "
Obama : Media ' Bit ' on Clinton 's Complaint
Obama began election day in Houston at a livestock and rodeo exhibit , posing for pictures and climbing on a tractor .
En route to San Antonio , Obama and his wife , Michelle , strolled to the back of the plane , telling reporters he thought the race is " tight " and described Clinton as a " tenacious " candidate .
Obama said he was surprised the media " bit " on her " complaining about the refs " -- referring to Clinton 's complaint during a debate in Ohio that the media was giving preferntial treatment to Obama .
Obama Accuses Clinton of ' Kitchen Sink ' Strategy
With her candidacy at stake , Clinton has turned up the heat on Obama in recent weeks , questioning his national security and foreign policy credentials and his position on trade .
The Clinton campaign launched a television ad on Friday asking voters to consider which candidate they would want to pick up the phone in a time of crisis .
" It 's 3 a.m. , your children are safely asleep .
Who do you want answering the phone ? " it said .
The Clinton campaign also held a conference call to urge reporters to probe more deeply into Obama 's relationship with Tony Rezko , a Chicago real estate developer who is currently on trial in connection with extortion allegations .
On Tuesday as voters headed to the polls , Clinton communications director said Obama 's campaign has n't been transparent with Ohio voters about a conversation Obama 's senior economic adviser Austan Goolsbee had with a Canadian official in Chicago .
A Canadian government memo reports Goolsbee told the Canadians Obama 's anti-NAFTA rhetoric should be taken more as political positioning than an articulation of policy objectives .
The Obama campaign and Goolsbee dispute the Canadian memo .
In Ohio , NAFTA is blamed for job losses .
Obama has accused Clinton of employing a " kitchen sink " strategy , but Clinton 's campaign appeared to succeed in putting her rival on the defensive .
Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson argued Tuesday Clinton is the best candidate ready to be commander - in - chief on " Day One " and deal with a flagging economy , not Obama .
" We are not going to nominate someone to run against McCain who has not passed the commander - in - chief test and not passed the steward of the economy test , " Wolfson said in a conference call with reporters .
The Obama campaign held a competing conference call Tuesday disputing Clinton 's national security and foreign policy creditials , pointing to her vote to authorize President Bush to use force in Iraq .
On Tuesday the Clinton campaign accused the Obama campaign of election day chicanery in Texas , a charge the Obama campaign denied .
The Texas Democratic Party said they have received concerns from both the Clinton and Obama campaigns about the other side improperly padding their caucus vote totals by getting primary voters to fill out sign - in sheets all day long rather than waiting until the primary polls close and the caucus process formally gets underway , but Texas Democratic Party officials tell ABC News they do not have any proof of wrong - doing .
Some polling stations in Ohio stayed open later than expected because they ran out of ballots .
Election officials in Texas and Ohio said voter turnout was high , depite rain , sleet , and flooding in some areas of Ohio .
After her wins in Ohio and Rhode Island Clinton appears ready to fight on , urging supporters to bolster her campaign warchest and donate money online .
Clinton will appear on network televsion news programs Wednesday morning .
The Democratic rivals battle next in Wyoming on March 8 , where 12 delegates are at stake , and in Mississippi on March 11 , with 33 delegates .
The next big prize is Pennsylvania on April 22 with 158 delegates up for grabs .
Many believe that if no clear winner can be determined before the final primary vote is cast in June , the two historic , formidable candidates could fight all the way to the party 's Denver convention in August .
ABC News ' Kate Snow , David Chalian , Rick Klein , Eileen Murphy , Andrew Fies , Kevin Chupka , Karen Travers , Gary Langer , Teddy Davis , Eloise Harper , Lauren Pearle , and Sunlen Miller contributed reporting .
If you ’re paying attention to the current presidential campaign , you ’re also doing your brain a favor regardless of whether you favor Clinton , McCain or Obama , says one neuroscientist .
The brain has hard - wired systems that control attention and learning in processes that motivate us , including hunger , sex drive and social involvement .
An interest in politics can stimulate these systems in the brain , says neuro - pharmacologist John D. Roache of The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio .
" As we listen to the candidates and think about what is being said , the brain processes the information , which grows neural connections and increases the neurochemical signaling that is associated with learning and memory , " Roache said .
Other engaging activities , such as exercise or doing crossword puzzles , can stimulate the brain and protect it against developing dementia , studies have shown .
Even more beneficial than just following the campaigns is active participation , whether by watching a debate or attending a rally , Roache says .
" If we become emotionally engaged and even become politically active by going to a rally or actively campaigning for a candidate , then the greater levels of emotion or commitment further enhance the brain processes and connect them all the more with the emotion and physical activity involved , " he said .
And the benefits come regardless of whether you 're a Republican , Democrat or Independent , Roache adds , so whatever views get you motivated , they 're likely to give your brain a boost .

Microsoft is likely to face a torrid time from European regulators before it can even think of closing its proposed takeover of Yahoo !.
A leading UK competition lawyer told the Reg today : " Any big Microsoft acquisition is likely to be looked at very carefully , especially if it is in an area where they have been complaining about their rivals - I wonder if there is anything in the documents Microsoft filed in its complaint to the EU about Google which they are now regretting . "
" The obvious initial fear could be that Microsoft would bundle search into Windows .
That 's something regulators will have to look at .
It 's possible that Microsoft will make a commitment not to do this before the deal goes ahead in order to head off regulators . "
The lawyer predicted the deal would go straight to the people who deal with Microsoft generally : " Microsoft lost a case on interoperability within the enterprise and it is possible this deal will raise fears for wider interoperability .
Either way , regulators will have a good hard look at this , not least because they will have Google jumping up and down and taking them to court if they do n't . "
Asked about possible conflict with US regulators , our source added : " It is almost inevitable there will be conflict .
I do n't know if there 's any actual case here but there are facts to be looked at and I do n't understand the American hands - off approach . "
Dr Hans Friederiszick , managing director of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin , said : “ This is a two - pronged issue of competition and privacy and will be treated as such by the competition and regulatory authorities both in Europe and the US .
Competition issues will focus on the question of whether this will encourage unilateral price increases for internet advertising via search engines , given the already high level of concentration in this market . "
Friederiszick also noted the takeover would reduce the number of search engines with global audiences from three to two .
US regulators will also be looking at the deal .
The Department of Justice said it would be interested in looking at the competition aspects of the takeover .
Becket McGrath , partner at London law firm BerwinLeightonPaisner , told the Reg : " There 's no doubt US and European regulators will be looking at this closely . "
" In more traditional industries it might be possible to sell off part of the business to reduce the regulators ' concerns .
But it 's difficult to see how that would work - search is not really a different business , it 's part of the portal . "
McGrath also said that the deal could lead to leverage issues - Microsoft 's desktop strength coupled with Yahoo's strength in web services could be seen as providing a stronger competitor for Google .
But it could also be seen as protecting Microsoft 's desktop position and therefore anti-competitive , because it would hinder the rise of other competitors in that market .
Another possible hurdle to the deal is a rival bid .
But private equity groups are mostly licking their wounds from the credit crunch and do n't have much else to add to a deal of this size .
The only other option would be a big media company - but again , in an atmosphere of shrinking advertising spending , few would willingly enter a bidding war with Microsoft . ®

The reason ?
Higher co-payments that took effect January 1 , as employers try to deal with the rising cost of health insurance by making employees and retirees pay more .
But a new study finds that instead of going up , co-pays should go down – at least for some people taking some drugs .
Just by cutting a few dollars off the co-pay , the study suggests , employers could increase the chances that employees with chronic illnesses will take certain preventive medicines .
And that could pay off in the long run , in the form of fewer hospitalizations or emergency room visits for employees with diabetes , high blood pressure , asthma and other conditions .
Specifically , the study showed that a major private employer significantly increased the use of important preventive medicines among its employees by automatically making some medications free , and slashing co-pays for other drugs by 50 percent .
Meanwhile , another employer that kept its co-pays the same did n’t experience the same increase in use of preventive medicines .
The difference in medication use between chronically ill employees at the two companies was sizable -- even though all the employees in the study were also enrolled in special programs designed to help them take control of their diseases .
The study is published in the January / February issue of the journal Health Affairs by a team led by University of Michigan and Harvard University researchers .
It is the first rigorous , controlled trial of a concept called “ value based insurance design . ”
That concept , introduced in the late 1990s by members of the research team , is based on the idea that there should be few barriers standing between a chronically ill person and the medications that can keep them well enough to work and to avoid health crises and complications related to their disease .
Even a barrier of a few dollars is enough to keep people from using the medicines they need the most .
“ All research to this point has shown that individuals will not buy important medical services even if there ’s a small financial barrier : $ 5 or even $ 2 , ” says senior author Mark Fendrick , M.D. , of the U - M Medical School and School of Public Health .
“ This study showed that when you remove those barriers , people started using these high - value services significantly more .
These results bolster the idea that health insurance benefits should be designed in ways that produce the most health per dollar spent . ”
Fendrick and first author Michael Chernew , Ph.D. , of the Harvard Medical School , co-founded the Center for Value - Based Insurance Design , based at U - M .
They conducted the study with co-authors from ActiveHealth Management , which had been retained by both companies in the study to provide voluntary disease - management programs for employees and dependents with 32 medical conditions .
Members of GlaxoSmithKline ’s Health Management Innovations division also took part in the study , which was supported by unrestricted funds from both GSK and Pfizer , Inc .
The employers involved in the study have asked to remain anonymous .
During the study period , ActiveHealth Management was acquired by Aetna , a major insurer , but there was no impact on the study .
The study involved more than 35,000 employees and dependents at the company where co-pays were reduced ( Company A ) , and more than 70,000 employees and dependents at the other ( Company B ) .
All had regular phone contact with nurses in their disease management programs , who offered help based on each person ’s test results , medication use , doctor visits and other health information .
The researchers looked at use of five classes of drugs : heart - protecting ACE inhibitors and angiotensin - receptor blockers ; blood - pressure - reducing beta blockers ; diabetes medicines including blood sugar - reducing drugs and insulin ; cholesterol - reducing statins ; and asthma - calming inhaled steroids .
In the study period , co-pays at Company A went from $ 5 to $ 0 for generic drugs , from $ 25 to $ 12.50 for name - brand drugs on the company ’s preferred drug list , and from $ 45 to $ 22.50 for non-preferred name - brand drugs .
Co-pays at Company B stayed around $ 29 for brand - name drugs and $ 16 for generics .
As part of the disease management program at both companies , people who were n’t already taking preventive medications related to their conditions were contacted automatically to let them know about the importance of those specific medications .
At Company A , they were also informed of the reduced co-pays .
For all Company A employees , the co-pay reductions were made automatically at the pharmacy .
In just one year , the appropriate use of the preventive medicines at Company A increased significantly in four of the five drug classes , with inhaled steroids for asthma being the exception .
The increase in use of statins was more modest than the increases in use of ACEs / ARBs , beta blockers and diabetes drugs .
And , the results show that “ nonadherence ” – a term used to describe a situation when someone should be taking a medicine but is n’t – decreased between 7 percent and 14 percent , depending on drug class .
Chernew notes that the study was not designed to assess whether increased adherence to preventive drugs had a measurable impact on employees ’ and dependents ’ health , or their use of costly services such as hospitalization and emergency care .
“ While future studies need to be done to actually quantify this specifically , there is considerable evidence that use of the classes of medication in this study will reduce the frequency of adverse clinical events and associated hospitalizations and ER visits , ” he says .
“ We believe that tailoring co-pays to the individual patient can improve the efficiency of health care spending when applied to this type of high - value health service . ”
The new data provide the first rigorous , controlled analysis of the impact of a “ clinically sensitive ” health benefit design .
Previously , employers such as office - equipment maker Pitney Bowes and the city of Asheville , NC have reported increased adherence and decreased use of health services among chronically ill employees who had their co-pays reduced .
Meanwhile , other employers have launched their own such programs without waiting for a controlled study to convince them of the potential benefits .
In fact , the University of Michigan is currently offering free or reduced - price medications and tests to more than 2,000 of its employees and their dependents who have diabetes .
That project , called MHealthy : Focus on Diabetes , is being managed by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Transformation and may produce its first data this year .
“ When I told my mother about this study , she turned to me and said ‘ I ca n’t believe you had to spend all that money to show that if you make people pay more for something they ’ll buy less of it , ’ ” says Fendrick .
“ But we needed to show with a carefully done study that if we did lower barriers that people would utilize these essential medical services more .
And as always , my mother was right . ”
