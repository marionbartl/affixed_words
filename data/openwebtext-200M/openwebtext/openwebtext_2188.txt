The news agenda is filled with stories of a global credit crunch .
Banks are hard up for money and customers are finding it more difficult to get credit .
In the Sussex town of Lewes they 're devising a plan which could change all of that .
They want to print their own local money .
Inspired by the Devon town of Totnes which launched its own currency last year , Lewes locals are at the start of the process of re-launching their own cash .
The town did have its own pound before but it was last in circulation in 1895 .
Shop near where you live
The group behind the schemes in both Totnes and Lewes are part of the " Transition " movement which is concerned with the impact of rising oil prices and consumption .
They hope that the new money will encourage shops and customers to buy local produce and reduce their fuel consumption .
It 's also hoped the scheme will encourage a greater sense of community .
Adrienne Campbell , one of the people behind the plan , says : " We 're a group of people who want to re-localise and strengthen the local economy - grow our food locally , have more businesses locally and generate our own energy locally as well . "
Bill Collison who runs the local greengrocer and café says that he 's backing the scheme even though it could mean more paperwork .
He says it 's another coin to count , and then you have to figure out a way of changing your takings back to regular currency at the end of the process .
Local scepticism
Some other locals are n't as keen .
They say that life 's confusing enough and they want to spend their money where they want .
But shopkeepers are keen , with many of the owners of local businesses backing the move .
Whether it 's popular or not , the very question of a town issuing its own currency does stimulate a debate about how money actually works .
It is after all simply paper , which only works because we all agree it has a special value .
The team in Lewes may have a job convincing some of the locals to agree that their pieces of paper carry the same value .
But they are taking their time , and they 're hoping to be ready for a launch by September .
What do you think of having your town having its own local currency ?
Would you use it ?

Following on from the fantastic efforts of the people in Lewes , we are trying to get Eastbourne launched as a Transition Town .
Nationally and globally we are all faced with the prospect of declining fossil fuels availability and climate change .
I think its great that these people are working so hard to get systems put in place that will make their communities stronger and more resilient .
I am sure that if more people had the time to think of how life is going to look without the availability of cheap oil and gas they would be more behind the idea of a local currency .
Things are going to change whether we like it or not so this kind of preparation is essential .
Neil Robinson .
Great idea .
We 're also looking at doing the same thing in Stroud .
People need to realise that oil and food prices will continue to rise , and that we need to change the way we live our lives in order to be more sustainable , both environmentally and financially sustainable .
Jamie Baldwin
It is a great idea for promoting local goods and services .
But is it legal ?
Can a city or town issue currency notes ?
Is it not against the law ?
If the legal issues can be overcome then I think others should also think on the same lines .
It will be good for everybody the locals as well as lead to wellbeing of the nation by reducing demand for fuel for transporation , better employment opportunities for people in their own localities , etc. Balakrishna S.Pai
After reading the article about the local currency , I am forced to think about several issues and wonder exactly how they plan to implement this plan and once in force , how does that effect the towns position within the UK government system ?
I wonder how the money will be issued ?
When you hand over a Queen 's pound in the cafe , will you be given Lewes currency in return ?
What if you do n't want a Lewes penny ... maybe you do n't live there and are just passing through , do you now have to go to the Lewes " bank " and get your money converted ?
Will the Queen be a feature of this currency , it is after all is said and done , her country .
Not that the knights of the round table will come swashbuckling into Town and defend Queen and Country .... but what legal value does this currency have and how devaluing will it be to UK sterling ?
And of course , there is the question of taxes ?
Will the residents be asked to pay Lewes taxes in Lewes currency , or will they exempt themselves from Government Taxes , being as they are exempting themselves from government money ?
I am all about buying locally , growing my own , recycling , supporting local farms , buying from local stores rather than supermarkets , but I wonder if the headache of two currencies in one country is really viable or practical .
Europe had separate currencies for each country not too many years ago .
Driving into France from Spain , or Italy from France was always so time consuming when I had to change the currencies and work out the exchange rates .
I can't imagine what it would be like if every town in the UK started such a scheme .

June 11 , 2008  --
More than a decade and the breadth of a continent stand between Evan Ramsey and the carnage he inflicted on a Bethel , Alaska , high school , but the memories still play vividly through his mind .
It was Feb. 19 , 1997 .
Twelve - gauge shotgun to his shoulder , Ramsey , then 16 , traveled the halls and panicked his classmates as random shots filled the air .
When it was over , when the police had Ramsey shackled in cuffs , and a basketball star and the school principal lay dead .
" I honestly believed that if you shoot somebody , that they would get back up , " Ramsey told ABC News in a recent interview at the Arizona prison where he is serving a 210 - year sentence .
It 's hard to accept , he admits , but Ramsey said his naivete left him unable to grasp that firing a gun in the real world is different from firing one in a video game : " I did n't realize that you shoot somebody , they die . "
Have a tip for ABC News ' Law & Justice Unit ?

Ramsey Says Friends Taught Him About Guns
But two people did die , and what makes their deaths especially tragic is that they probably could have been prevented .
In the days before he opened fire , Ramsey told at least two of his closest friends that he could no longer hold his anger .
He asked one for a gun and the second for advice on how to use it .
The two told other students what Ramsey had in mind , but no one tried to talk him out of the killing spree .
In fact , Ramsey said , they did the opposite .
They said " that while I 'm at it , I might as well go shoot this person and that person and that person , " Ramsey recalled .
One friend " brought up the idea of bringing in a camera and taking pictures so he could save the memory , if you will . "
The morbid encouragement by Ramsey 's friends may be shocking , but their failure -- and that of everyone else -- to warn school officials or police , or to do anything else to stop his deadly plans is far from unusual .
According to a study sponsored by the Secret Service and the Department of Education and obtained exclusively by ABC News , only 4 percent of the people who knew that a student intended to shoot someone tried to dissuade him -- even though previous research found that 81 percent of school shooters told classmates or teachers of their plans .
The problem , concludes the study , is that America 's schools have not made bystanders feel safe about reporting campus shooting threats .
" We found that those who did n't come forward either felt afraid about coming forward , they felt the school climate would n't support them , or they were afraid they'd be made fun of , " said William Pollack , a professor at Harvard Medical School and the author of the study .
Ramsey said that in his case , a warning when he first thought about killing someone would have made all the difference .
" If somebody had said something , " he insisted , " my crime would n't have happened . "
The Bystander 's Role
Researchers have long been puzzled by what provokes students to shoot their classmates and teachers dead , but a clearer picture has emerged from Secret Service and Education Department studies .
Experts have discovered that :
Three - quarters of school shooters were bullied .
A similar proportion were severely depressed and suicidal .
About 93 percent were known by teachers and school officials to have had emotional problems before the shooting .
The shooters came from a range of economic backgrounds , from working class to upper - middle class .
Only recently , though , have researchers turned their attention to the bystanders , the ones who might have prevented the shootings but did n't .
Students like Betina Lynn .
In May 1998 , Lynn was a junior at Thurston High School in Springfield , Ore. , and a teaching assistant for a freshman class .
One day when the teacher was out of the room , Lynn overheard Kip Kinkel , a student in the class , mention that he wanted " to add this kid to his hit list , " she told ABC News .
" I knew something was going to happen , " she said .
" I knew he was angry enough and he was getting tired of the bullying and the teasing , that there was going to be some sort of confrontation . "
But Lynn said nothing about what she had heard .
Days later , after he shot and killed his parents at home , Kinkel went to school with a gun , killed two students and wounded 25 others .
Asked why she had n't shared her fears and Kinkel 's disturbing words with school officials , Lynn responded with her own questions .
" Who knows if the principal would have taken it seriously ?
Who knows if the vice principal would have taken it seriously ?
Who knows if his parents would have taken it seriously ?
What if , what if , what if ? " she asked .
" One lesson you 're taught at an early age is , it 's OK to report but do n't be a tattletale .
Do n't be your little brother 's overseer and do n't run to mommy every time little brother does something wrong . "
Silence may be the most common response to suspicions of an impending school shooting , but it has not been the only one .
In November 2001 , Craig Duquette , a student at New Bedford High School in Massachusetts , had just taken his seat in biology class when he turned to a student who looked as if she had been crying .
She told him that she had heard that a group of students planned to chain shut the school 's doors and " open fire on just about anybody that they could , " he recalled .
After the class , another student passed Duquette in the hallway .
" When he walked by , he said , ' You might want to loosen your backpack before you die , ' " Duquette said .
As the morning wore on , he continued to hear about the elements of an impending massacre : backpacks , duffel bags , guns and bombs .
" It was after the Columbine [ Colorado school shooting ] incident ... and after the comment that had been made to me , I thought that it was real enough that maybe somebody should know about it , " Duquette told ABC News .
" I would have felt terrible if something actually did happen , and then , I could have gone forward and I never did . "
He shared what he had heard with the school 's headmaster and campus police .
The tip led investigators to a group of students who called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia , the name used by the killers at Columbine , and to a stash of ammunition , knives , Nazi photographs , bomb - making recipes and drug paraphernalia at their homes .
Eric McKeehan , a 17 - year - old student at the school , confessed to planning a massacre that would surpass the death toll at Columbine but claimed he had abandoned the scheme after police got wind of it .
Duquette may have saved lives , but he brushes aside any suggestion that he is a hero .
" I just knew what I had to do , and I went and told somebody , " he said .
" It was n't a matter of , you know , if they [ the would - be shooters ] find out , they 're going to kill me or something like that .
... I did n't want something to happen to everybody in the school . "
Persuading Students to Come Forward
Pollack , the author of the new school - shooting study , said Duquette 's modesty is not unusual for students who blow the whistle on would - be shooters , and the New Bedford case is a perfect example of how police and school officials should respond to a student 's warning .
" As you go along , you do n't investigate to create a [ criminal ] case , " he explained .
" You gather more and more names , more and more data .
You open up the circle and then get those in the circle to open up to you .
And then -- poof ! -- right away you know whose house to go to to find out what 's going wrong .
And then you get [ the potential shooters ] evaluated and into a safe space before something happens . "
So how do schools persuade more students to come forward ?
Ramsey said he believes that it 's just a matter of appealing to their better instincts .
" Explain to them the justice that they would be serving , " he said .
" They would be preventing somebody from committing something atrocious like murder . "
But the work of prevention should start well before plans for violence take hold , said Pollack .
Ramsey , like most shooters , was bullied , and until teachers and counselors deal seriously with bullying and other problems by creating " an emotional connection " with students , Pollack said , schools will suffer from the violence of " a meaner , more vicious society . "
" People are mean to each other in the supermarkets and where we work .
People are mean to each other on the streets , " he said .
" So we 're mean to each other in school . "
The study recommends that schools create violence councils for evaluating threats and train teachers and parents to develop trust through one - on - one contact with students , who can then feel comfortable enough to report their suspicions .
The recommendations , pragmatic enough , have nonetheless encountered resistance from schools that view them as too hard to implement , according to Pollack .
He said he has seen such measures work , and with a decade already gone since Evan Ramsey overreacted to bullying and killed two innocent people on the way to class , schools have no time to waste .
" We say we 've heard a wake - up call , but we 've now had 50 wake - up calls in the last 20 or 30 years , " Pollack said .
" How many more do we need ? "
I have absolutely no idea what a 2nd century roman citizen would have done with a D20 Dice , but it seems they were being used WAYYYYY before people started playing Dungeons & Dragons in the 70’s .
Unfortunately , researchers have not yet established the game for which these dice were used , but I really doubt people were playing RPG ’s back then .
This particular polyhedra dice was sold in December 2003 for a paltry $ 17,925 .

Thousands of women worked the land during World War II
The badge is the first official recognition of the contribution made by members of the Women 's Land Army ( WLA ) and the Women 's Timber Corps ( WTC ) .
Members of the WLA - also known as the Land Girls - and the WTC have campaigned for recognition for decades .
Ex -Land Girl Hilda Gibson , 83 , said the badge was a " powerful gesture " .
They were men's jobs we took on , they were heavy jobs and hard work
Hilda Gibson
Former Land Girl
Harsh life of a ' lumberjill '
Badges will be awarded to surviving members of the WLA and WTC , but not to spouses or families of deceased members , except where death has occurred after 6 December 2007 .
That was the date the government made the announcement of the plans for formal recognition .
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said : " This badge is a fitting way to pay tribute to their determination , courage and spirit in the face of adversity .
I hope that as many eligible women as possible will apply for one . "
Hard work
Mrs Gibson , of Huddersfield , worked first in pest control in Lincolnshire and then on a poultry farm in Norfolk , where she had to feed and muck out thousands of birds .
" They were men 's jobs we took on , they were heavy jobs and hard work .
I wanted a job that was important and I felt that it was , " she said .
" It 's taken a long time coming , but you can't blame that on anybody . "
The badge was a " powerful and touching gesture to thank us for what we did " , she added .
Jean Proctor , a former land army girl and chairwoman of the British Women 's Land Army Society , told BBC Radio 5 Live the recognition would mean a lot to Land Girls and their families .
" We have campaigned all this time .... we have got recognition in a lot of places ... and now this badge will be absolutely the icing on the cake . "
Mary Mower , 79 , from Wandsworth , London , was a Land Girl based near Peterborough , in Cambridgeshire , and spent time pruning apple trees and doing other agricultural work such as hoeing .
" The fellows were away on the ships , or fighting or flying and our work was one of those things that did help , " she said .
Mrs Mower said she thought the badge was " a very nice thought " that would be welcomed by the surviving women who had been in the WLA and the WTC .
Poor conditions
" The thought that they are being appreciated will make a lot of difference , " she said .
The WLA had 80,000 members in 1943 and existed until 1950
Land Girls helped run farms and feed the nation on the Home Front while men were fighting in the war .
They undertook work - including milking , harvesting , lambing and ploughing - which was often hard , with long hours , poor conditions and low pay .
There was a strong sense of patriotism and camaraderie .
" I enjoyed my time there and the amount of friends I made was very good , " said Mrs Mower .
At its peak in 1943 , there were 80,000 members of the WLA and the organisation remained in existence until 1950 .
The 6,000 women in the WTC - nicknamed the Lumberjills - felled trees and ran sawmills to provide timber for the war effort .
Former members of the WLA and WTC can apply for a badge through the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) .
Applications forms can be obtained via the Defra website or by calling 08459 335577 .

Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have subpoenaed notes of an FBI interview with George Bush and Dick Cheney in the Oval Office on June 24 , 2004 , about their role in the unmasking of a CIA anti-WMD program administered by Valerie Plame :
The subpoena follows a June 3 letter from committee chairman Rep. Henry Waxman to Attorney General Mukasey , asking for the documents and a June 11 response from Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Keith B. Nelson [ who declined the request due to " separation of powers " issues .
The instigation for the request is information in What Happened , the memoir by former White House Press Sec. Scott McClellan :
Waxman requested the transcripts of the FBI interviews earlier this month , after publication of Scott McClellan ’s tell all memoir revealing Bush administration deception .
A transcript of Cheney ’s interview would be of particular interest because his former aide , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , was the only official convicted of a crime in relation to the Plame probe .
Libby told the FBI that it was “ possible ” Cheney instructed him to leak Plame ’s name , Waxman wrote in his initial letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey .
The question appears to be , if Bush and Cheney lied to McClellan , did they also lie to the FBI that June morning .
Lying to the FBI is illegal , even if the subjects are not under oath .
The Comoros , an unstable archipelago off the coast of East Africa , landed troops early Tuesday on the breakaway island of Anjouan to crush a year - old rebellion , one day after dropping leaflets warning the population .
The government said its forces , backed by larger numbers of African Union ( AU ) troops , had taken control of the island 's airport and main towns , and had urged rebel leader Mohamad Bacar to surrender .
A French - trained former police chief , Mr. Bacar faces federal charges of treason , usurpation of power , torture , and war crimes .
Last year , he refused to step down after an election that authorities ruled illegal and has since continued to govern Anjouan as a separate state .
Authorities have pledged to depose Bacar and install a transitional government to organize fresh elections for the island in May .
A victory for the AU in the tiny archipelago might offset its tattered reputation from largely ineffectual peacekeeping missions in Sudan and Somalia .
About 700,000 people live in the Coromos , an archipelago in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar .
Some 300,000 reside in Anjouan , one of three main islands that make up the Coromos .
The islands declared independence from France in 1975 , and the country has since faced numerous problems arising from tensions between the islands and a central government .
Tuesday 's amphibious assault on Anjouan began at dawn when mortar and machine - gun fire was heard on the island , the BBC reports .
Around 450 Comoran troops supported by up to 1,500 AU military personnel were deployed .
Defense chief of staff Mohamad Dosara said AU troops had entered the capital , Mutsamudu , where Mr. Bacar is believed to have the protection of several hundred armed police .
Bacar 's whereabouts are unknown , phone lines to the island have been cut , and the BBC says authorities have been unable to confirm any casualties .
Agence France - Presse reports from Mutsamudu that Bacar 's forces clashed with AU troops near his residence outside the capital , after apparently abandoning the presidential palace .
In the city , however , Tanzanian soldiers entered without resistance to the cheers of local residents , according to witnesses .
Federal Comoran forces deployed with AU forces in the fight against Bacar , fired from a ship docked off the shore of Ouani , where heavy explosions and rifle fire could be heard , according to an AFP journalist .
Bacar 's forces , tying red ribbons – the colour of the Anjouan flag – around the barrels of their assault rifles , were deployed on the road between Mutsamudu and Ouani and around the cliffs of the capital early Tuesday ....
In an interview ... Thursday , Bacar had taken a defiant stand .
" I am still determined to defend Anjouan despite my concern that people are ready to come here and fire on the Anjouanese .
But I am continuing with my preparations to defend Anjouan , " he said .
The Associated Press says that a resident in Domoni , a coastal Anjouan town , had seen soldiers conducting searches of houses as troops hunt for Bacar and his allies .
AU troops had already taken full control of the main seaport .
At least 80 AU troops from Tanzania were among the landing force , officials said , but only a handful of government soldiers were spotted by reporters .
The troops apparently arrived aboard four ships that cruised earlier in the day along the coast toward the island 's airport and seaport .
The morning 's explosions and gunfire drew hundreds of people into the streets of Anjouan , some of them chanting " Bacar is a dog " and " We have won ! "
A Comoran government official told Reuters that troops had met " a little resistance " in Mutsamudu .
Federal authorities accuse Bacar of trying to secede from the republic , but he has claimed that his battle is for greater autonomy , not outright separation .
The Australian Broadcasting Corp. says that Comoran President Ahmed Mohamad Sambi announced the military operation Monday in a national televised address .
France has also given its support to the seaborne assault on Anjouan .
Agence France - Presse reported Monday that leaflets dropped by Comoran military helicopters over Mutsamudu had warned residents of the imminent invasion .
The National Development Army " informs all the residents of Anjouan that it will be in Anjouan within days or in the coming hours , " read the text , also seen by AFP .
" Residents are also advised not to go far from their homes , " they added , urging pupils , fishermen , traders and farmers not do their daily activities ' until further notice . ' "
Earlier this month , the BBC reported that France had helped transport AU troops to the Comoros in preparation for the assault .
Tanzania , Sudan , Senegal , and Libya have offered troops for the operation .
In February , AU leaders agreed to support Comoros and commit troops to restore control over Anjouan after failed negotiations by Francesco Madeira , an AU special envoy .
Mr. Madeira said time had run out for Bacar .
" I am afraid to say that if he tries to do that , it will be the end of him physically , if necessary , " Mr Madeira said .
" He will be overwhelmed ... and what we are going to do in Anjouan is to take over the island , we will intervene to capture the island . "
IRIN , a UN - run humanitarian news service , says that the republic has suffered 19 successful and attempted coups since 1975 , including island secessions .
After Anjouan and Moheli , another island , rebelled in 1997 , African mediators brokered a new constitutional system that permits each Comoran island to elect its own president and to take turns as federal president .
A diplomat in Moroni , the capital on Grand Comore , the largest island , told IRIN in January that military action against Bacar appeared to have popular support , but said that the current political system may need overhauling , because it 's troublesome and costly for a heavily indebted country .
" If the government regains control , they need to organise elections and then , when a legitimate [ Anjouan ] government is in place , authorities need to sit down together and have dialogue .
They need to look at the current constitution and amend it .
It is clear that it is not working - it leads to too much dispute - and having four governments [ a union government and one for each individual island ] is far too expensive . "

â€ œI thought you didnâ€™t smoke , â€ she asked .
â€ œI did , and I quit , â€  he replied through a bluish cloud , â€ œbut it seems an appropriate time to pick up the habit again.â€ 
â€ œReally , â€  she drew the word out as if stretching it like taffy .
â€ œThat could very well be the most ridiculous statement Iâ€™ve ever heard from you , and thatâ€™s saying something .â€ 
She got out of the bed and walked over to the kitchenette .
She filled a glass with water and drank it , unworried by her nakedness .
The man , also naked , took another drag from his cigarette .
â€ œA cigarette after sex is nice .â€ 
He contemplated the little pillar of ash at its end .
â€ œIâ€™ve found something .â€ 
â€ œOh?â€
She absently picked a feather from the bed off of her right breast .
â€ œYup.â€
â€ œWhat?â€
â€ œAn asteroid.â€
â€ œOh , come on , â€  she sniffed .
â€ œEver since that asteroid missed us a couple of years ago , everybodyâ€™s talking about asteroids .â€ 
She sat down on the edge of the bed and handed him the glass .
He sipped , looked fondly at her body and handed the glass back to her .
â€ œWell , I found one , nevertheless.â€ 
He stubbed out the cigarette in a saucer on the nightstand .
He leaned over and kissed her side where the waistband of pants would normally be .
He kissed his way up her ribcage .
â€ œWhat was it called , Aprophis or something ? â€ she asked .
â€ œApophis was the one that just barely missed us in 2029 , â€  he stopped kissing her body and lay back .
â€ œThis one is not Apophis ; itâ€™s a different one.â€ 
â€ œWhat , is it going to hit us or something ?â€ 
â€ œWell , yes.â€ 
He drew another cigarette out of the pack .
â€ œYouâ€ ™re kidding , right ?â€ 
â€ œIâ€™m sorry , but Iâ€™m not.â€ 
He lit the cigarette and dragged deeply on it .
She put the water glass on the nightstand and rested her hand on his chest .
â€ œWhat will it do ?
They said that last one , Aprophis , I mean Apophis , would have wiped out a big city.â€ 
â€ œYes , but life on Earth would have continued .
This one gives every appearance of being bigger , denser and faster.â€ 
â€ œI thought they were looking out for these things , â€  she furrowed her brow , â€ œI thought they had all these asteroids charted out.â€ 
â€ œThereâ€™s an awful lot of space out there , and an awful lot of stuff flying around .
The prevailing theory around the office is that this is a charted asteroid , but it got close enough to another one for its orbit to change.â€ 
â€ œAround the office !â€ she blurted incredulously , â€ œYou mean other people know about this ?â€ 
â€ œYes .
Weâ€™ve all checked and rechecked the data .
The Director has been informed , too.â€ 
â€ œSo the government knows , too , â€  she got up and grabbed the robe from its hook on the bathroom door .
She wrapped it around her body and held it close as if it were woven of asteroid - proof cotton .
She looked at him again .
â€ œYouâ€ ™re not bullshitting me , are you ?â€ 
Her tone had acquired a bewildered , accusatory edge .
â€ œNo , â€ he shook his head and sat up .
â€ œWell , what are they doing about it ?â€ 
â€ œIâ€™m not sure anything can be done .
There wouldnâ€™t be much point , other than to cause mass hysteria.â€ 
â€ œYou mean they canâ€™t shove it out of the way or dig some shelters underground ? â€ 
She paced and gestured sharply with her hands .
â€ œNot in six hours , no.â€ 
He put out the cigarette .
â€ œWould you take that robe off and come here ?â€ 

A Fish A Fish Tank Water Maybe many more fish Optional : instead of water , use oil or something ... but that 's too easy .
Most of us probably realize that this is quite a challenge .
Simply holding them under for a long period of time will not do the trick .
You can try dropping a freshwater fish in the ocean , but it 's so hard to keep track of them there ; the little buggers swim away !
Since the question " how to drown a fish " is something that keeps everybody up all night , I 've decided to bring you the answer and cure your insomnia .
It is possible .
Drowning in air does n't count .
So , let 's get started .
Put the water in the fish tank , and put the fish in .
They seem to like it that way .
So far nothing out of the ordinary , right ?
Next , put one of those oxygen pumping thingies in the fish tank .
You 'll notice it 's not on the list of things you 'll need .
Why do you think pet stores sell them ?
Fish need them !
( Also , do n't put any plants in the water ; they are also not on the list . )
Finally , to speed up the process , put many more fish in the tank .
Try not to splash the water , and if you can , make sure the fish do n't do it either .
The more fish you put in the tank , the quicker they will use up the oxygen in the water .
It 's quite funny , because many people do this by accident .
People have been drowning fish for years without even knowing it .
You 'll see that after a while , the fish might actually " come up for air " , which is not what most fish are designed for , and eventually they will suffocate in the water .
That means they drown ; I looked it up , and suffocating in the water is a good definition of drowning .
By the way , I have n't actually done this ( on purpose ) , and I also do n't encourage murdering animals , no matter how fun it might seem .
This is a purely educational Rambling .

Palpable Anger Vincent Bugliosi

My anger over the war in Iraq , some will say , is palpable .
If I sound too angry for some , what should I be greatly angry about -- that a referee gave what I thought was a bad call to my hometown football , basketball , or baseball team , and it may have cost them the game ?
I do n't think so .
Virtually all of us cling desperately to life , either because of our love of life and / or our fear of death .
I 'm told there is a passage in a novel by Dostoyevsky in which a character in the story exclaims , " If I were condemned to live on a rock , chained to a rock in the lashing sea , and all around me were ice and gales and storm , I would still want to live .
Oh God , just to live , live , live ! "
So nothing is as important in life as life and death .
We fear and loathe the thought of our own death , even if it 's a peaceful one after we 've outlived the normal longevity .
We fear not only the loss of our own lives , but the lives of our parents and sisters and brothers , as well as our relatives and close friends .
We do n't think of our children too much in this regard because our children , in the normal scheme of things , are supposed to outlive us .
When they die before us , the already hideous nature of death becomes unbearable .
And that 's when they die a normal and peaceful death from illness .
If the death is from an accident , like a car collision , the death of the child , if possible , is even more unbearable .
So one can hardly imagine the gut - tearing pain and horror when the only child of a couple , a nineteen - year - old son , call him Tim , the center of his parents ' lives , whom they showered with their love and lived through vicariously in his triumphs on the athletic field and in the classroom , and who was excited as he looked forward to life , planning to wed his high school sweetheart and go on to become a police officer ( or lawyer , doctor , engineer , etc. ) dies the most horrible of deaths from a roadside bomb in a far - off country , and comes home in a metal box , * his body so shattered that his parents are cautioned by the military not to open it because what is inside ( " our Timmy " ) is " unviewable . "
( To make the point hit home more with you , can you imagine if it was your son who was killed in Iraq and came home " unviewable " in a box ?
Yes , your son Scott , or Paul , or Michael , or Ronnie , Todd , Peter , Marty , Sean , or Bobby . )
No words can capture the feelings , the enormous suffering , of Tim 's parents .
But I think we can say that among a host of other deep agonies , they will have nightmares for the rest of their lives over the horrifying image of their boy the moment he lost his life on a desolate road in Iraq .
As a mother of a soldier who died in Iraq wrote in a May 17 , 2004 , letter to the New York Times : " The explosion that killed my son in Baghdad will go on in our lives forever . "
She went on to say that " seared on " her soul are the " screams and despair " of her family over the loss of her son and the " sound of taps above the weeping crowd at the grave site of my son . "
Just as Tim 's young life ended before he really had a chance to live , so did the lives of thousands of other young men in the Iraq war .
Not one of them wanted to die .
As one wrote in his diary before he was killed in the battle of Fallouja : " I am not so much scared as I am very afraid of the unknown .
If I do n't get to write again , I would say I died too early .
I have n't done enough in my life .
I have n't gotten to experience enough .
Though I hope I have n't gone in vain . "
In letter after letter home by young men who were later killed in combat in Iraq were words to the effect , " I can't wait to get back home and to start my life again . "
All of the young men who died horrible and violent deaths in Bush 's war had dreams .
Bush saw to it that none of them would ever come true .
It is impossible to adequately describe all the emotions and the magnitude of the human suffering that this dreadful war has wrought .
It is not a casket or coffin , which the survivors of course later put the remains in .
The military refers to the aluminum receptacle as a " transfer case , " and the case is draped with an American flag .

CAIR Action Alert # 540
Call Your Senators to Oppose Warrantless Wiretapping
( WASHINGTON D.C. , 6/23/2008 ) – CAIR is urging American Muslims and other people of conscience to call their senators today and urge them to vote against legalizing President Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
The U.S. Senate is likely to vote on such legislation this week .
Concerned citizens should also express strong opposition to any legislation that provides immunity for telecommunications companies , some of which may have reportedly violated customer ’s privacy rights by providing personal information to the government .
By a vote of 293 - 129 , legislation known as the FISA Amendments
Act passed the U.S. House last week .
The bill not only extends the government ’s ability to legally listen in on the telephone conversations of persons of interest , it also effectively grants legal immunity to telecommunications companies that helped in this surveillance .
Leslie Harris , CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology President , said : “ Under this flawed bill , intelligence agencies can authorize themselves to conduct surveillance . ”
According to the New York Times , the legislation confers “ what amounts to legal immunity to the telephone companies that took part in President Bush ’s program of eavesdropping without warrants after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 . ”
SEE : House Passes Bill on Federal Wiretap Powers ( NY Times )
Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin said the bill “ is not a compromise ; it is a capitulation . ”
Representative Zoe Lofgren of California said provisions of the bill “ turn the judiciary into the administration ’s rubber stamp . ”
SEE : Surveillance Bill Offers Protection to Telecom Firms ( Washington Post )
SEE ALSO : House Passes New Surveillance Law ( AP )
“ The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act needs updating , but this bill moves too far in the direction of giving intelligence agencies unconstitutional powers , ” said CAIR National Legislative Director Corey Saylor .
“ Not trusting unchecked authority is what the Constitution is all about . ”
ACTION REQUESTED : ( As always , be POLITE and RESPECTFUL . )
1 ) CALL BOTH OF YOUR SENATORS and politely insist that each senator vote against legalizing warrantless wiretapping and telecom immunity .
Call the United States Capitol switchboard at ( 202 ) 224-3121 .
A switchboard operator will connect you directly with the offices of senators representing your state .
Talking Points :
* As your constituent , I urge you to vote against any legislation that legalizes President Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
* I also want you to ensure that legislation that provides immunity for telecommunications companies , some of which may have violated my privacy rights by providing information to the government , are not granted any form of legal immunity .
2 ) ASK YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY to call their senators and urge them to vote against legalizing warrantless wiretapping and telecom immunity .

ACLU launches online watch list complaint form
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 202 ) 675-2312 or media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON , DC - The nation 's terrorist watch list has hit one million names , according to a tally maintained by the American Civil Liberties Union based upon the government 's own reported numbers for the size of the list .
" Members of Congress , nuns , war heroes and other ' suspicious characters , ' with names like Robert Johnson and Gary Smith , have become trapped in the Kafkaesque clutches of this list , with little hope of escape , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Congress needs to fix it , the Terrorist Screening Center needs to fix it , or the next president needs to fix it , but it has to be done soon . "
Fredrickson and Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU 's Technology and Liberty Program , spoke today along with two victims of the watch list : Jim Robinson , former assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division who flies frequently and is often delayed for hours despite possessing a governmental security clearance and Akif Rahman , an American citizen who has been detained and interrogated extensively at the U.S. - Canada border when traveling for business .
" America 's new million record watch list is a perfect symbol for what 's wrong with this administration 's approach to security : it 's unfair , out - of - control , a waste of resources , treats the rights of the innocent as an afterthought , and is a very real impediment in the lives of millions of travelers in this country , " said Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU Technology and Liberty Program .
" It must be fixed without delay . "
" Putting a million names on a watch list is a guarantee that the list will do more harm than good by interfering with the travel of innocent people and wasting huge amounts of our limited security resources on bureaucratic wheel - spinning , " said Steinhardt .
" I doubt this thing would even be effective at catching a real terrorist . "
Controls on the watch lists called for by the ACLU included :
due process
a right to access and challenge data upon which listing is based
tight criteria for adding names to the lists
rigorous procedures for updating and cleansing names from the lists .
The ACLU also called for the president - if not this one then the next - to issue an executive order requiring the lists to be reviewed and limited to only those for whom there is credible evidence of terrorist ties or activities .
The review should be concluded within 3 months .
In February , the ACLU unveiled an online " watch list counter , " which has tracked the size of the watch list based on a September 2007 report by the inspector general of the Justice Department , which reported that it was growing by 20,000 names per month .
The ACLU is also announcing today the creation of an online form where victims of the watch list can tell us their stories .
We will collect those stories and use them ( with permission ) in various ways to advance our advocacy .
A link to the form is available online at www.aclu.org/watchlist or directly at www.aclu.org/watchlistform.
The watch list counter and other materials are available at : www.aclu.org/watchlist

Highly classified intelligence documents relating to two of the most sensitive issues involving Britain 's security interests - al - Qaida in Pakistan and the situation in Iraq - have been found on a train near London , it was disclosed last night .
The documents , including one marked Top Secret , are believed to be detailed and up - to - date assessments by Whitehall 's Joint Intelligence Committee ( JIC ) .
They were found on Tuesday and handed to the BBC 's security correspondent , Frank Gardner , who reported the loss .
The BBC said the documents were left on the train by a senior intelligence officer .
A Cabinet Office spokesman said last night that the documents ' high security classification meant they would have had a limited circulation .
" There has been a security breach , the Metropolitan police are carrying out an investigation . "
A Scotland Yard spokesperson said its counter terrorism squad would be heading the investigation .
" We can confirm that we are making inquiries in connection with the loss of the documents . "
Gardner said the documents were left in an orange cardboard envelope on a train from London Waterloo to Surrey by a " very senior intelligence official " working in the Cabinet Office .
A police search was launched when it was realised that they were missing , as officials were concerned at the possibility of such sensitive papers getting into the wrong hands , he said .
The envelope was picked up by a fellow passenger , who found a seven - page document inside setting out the latest government assessment on the Islamist terror network al - Qaida , along with a " top secret and in some cases damning " assessment of Iraq 's security forces , said Gardner .
The al - Qaida document , commissioned jointly by the Foreign Office and the Home Office , was classified " UK top secret " , he said .
Each page was numbered and marked : " For UK , US , Canadian and Australian eyes only . "
The document on Iraq was commissioned by the Ministry of Defence .
Gardner said : " This was a clear breach of government rules .
They should be sealed in a briefcase if taken out . "
The BBC said the two reports were JIC assessments .
A British intelligence assessment of the strength of al - Qaida in Pakistan would be sensitive and potentially damaging if read either by hostile interests or the Pakistan government .
An assessment of the efficiency of the Iraqi security forces could be embarrassing if seen by the Iraqi government or insurgents .
The intelligence officer had permission to take the documents out of the office as long as sufficient security was provided , meaning a locked box , Whitehall officials said .
The fact that the investigation is in the hands of the police rather than MI5 suggests the documents were lost or mislaid and the official had not been targeted .
The officer was still at work , Whitehall sources said .
The loss is the latest in a string of recent data security lapses .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Corn prices rose to record highs on Monday and looked set to climb further as torrential rains threatened to reduce further U.S. crop prospects in a market already facing tight supplies and surging demand .

Corn prices rose to record highs on Monday and looked set to climb further as torrential rains threatened to reduce further U.S. crop prospects in a market already facing tight supplies and surging demand .

The lead July 2008 corn futures contract rose as high as $ 6.73 per bushel , up more than 3 percent and a record for a spot contract .
It closed on Friday at $ 6.50 - 3/4 while the July 2009 contract scaled an all - time peak of $ 7.20 .
“ We ’ve got some rain in the United States that could reduce some of the plantings and yields for corn .
Combine that with the drive into ethanol and you can see why corn is going to spike up , ” said analyst David Hart of Fat Prophets .
Strong demand for corn from U.S. biofuel producers has contributed to supply tightness in the corn market .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast about a third of this year ’s crop will be consumed by the biofuel sector .
“ I am still very bullish .
I think $ 7 , $ 8 , $ 9 corn is well within reach , ” said Commerzbank analyst Edward Hands .
“ The mandated biofuel side continues to weigh heavily on the corn balance sheet and the plantings this year seem to be very late , ” he added .
Nobuyuki Chino , president of Unipac Grain Ltd in Tokyo , said any drop in area and yields could lead to a further decline in already low stock levels .
“ It is a very fragile market , and we are now standing at a very crucial point in time , ” he said .
BULLISH CONSENSUS
Others agreed that corn was headed higher .
“ I think the widely held view is that ( corn ) will be rising another notch towards the summer , ” said Kenji Kobayashi , a grains analyst at Tokyo ’s Kanetsu Asset Management .
Soybean , wheat and rice prices also rose sharply on Monday .
July 2008 soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose to a peak of $ 14.89 - 1/2 a bushel , up 32 cents and the highest level for the contract since early March .
Prices for soybeans have been boosted by a prolonged conflict in key exporter Argentina between farm groups and the government which has paralyzed local markets .
“ The Argentinian situation seems to be weighing on the beans at the moment , ” Hands of Commerzbank said .
Soybeans were also buoyed by sharp gains in corn prices .
Wheat price also rose .
July 2008 wheat futures on the CBOT climbed as high as $ 8.38 per bushel , up more than 3 percent from Friday ’s close .
In Europe , the Paris November milling wheat futures contract
rose 9.00 euros to a peak of 199.00 euros a tonne , threatening to break above the key 200 euro level for the first time in a month .
“ We are following the U.S. market but we are slowed down by still bright prospects for the harvest , ” one European grain trader said .
U.S. rough rice , which initially bucked the trend and dipped , recouped earlier losses .
July rice rose more than 2 percent to $ 20.40 per hundredweight , after it ended on Friday at $ 19.96 .

LONDON ( AP ) 
Think of it as a giant tip .
A wealthy widow repaid the kindness shown to her by a family that runs a Chinese restaurant she frequented by leaving them $ 20.3 million in her will — a gesture a High Court judge ruled perfectly legal Friday as he dismissed the objections of relatives .
Golda Bechal 's 1994's will said she wanted Kim Sing Man and his wife , Bee Lian , the owners of a Chinese restaurant northeast of London , to inherit her money .
She died in January 2004 , aged 88 .
Bechal 's five nephews and nieces asked the court to declare the will invalid , claiming their aunt was suffering from dementia .
They had asked the judge to give the inheritance to them .
But Judge Donald Rattee accepted the restaurateurs ' evidence that Bechal , sad and lonely after the death of her husband and the death of her son Peter at the age of 28 , became like a family member to them .
They went on foreign holidays together and regularly got together at their restaurant and at her flat in Mayfair , central London .
" It was not irrational to leave the bulk of her estate to Mrs. Man , the daughter she would dearly wished to have had , and her husband , " Rattee said .
Kim Sing Man remembered Bechal as a classy woman who " always enjoyed her Chinese pickled leeks and bean sprouts . "

We love Starbucks coffee , but during the recession , make your coffee in your own comfy dwelling .
You can still buy ground coffee or beans at Starbucks ( save on your electric bill by having Starbucks grind it for you ) , but do get your lazy Earthling ass out of bed 15 minutes early to prepare it .
If you absolutely have too many lazy bones in your body to do it , then either get your mate to make the coffee or pay yourself a tip after you make it .
Please do not get us wrong .
We are absolutely , positively addicted to Starbucks .
However , $ 4 cappuccinos will cost you $ 120 per month , and $ 1,440 per year just in cappuccinos ... and that does n't count donuts or other delicious cakes .
There is also the cost of gas to get there : one gallon is another $ 3.00 or more .
No wonder Earthlings cannot make their house payments .
Do the math .
Earthlings , reduce your trips to Starbucks if you are going to survive the recession .
Alien calculus is never wrong .
You can buy Starbucks coffee for $ 10 per pound , which makes 256 ounces .
That is 32 eight - ounce cups .
This will save you $ 54 , since a small or what they call " Tall " Starbucks coffee costs $ 2.00 .
It will vary according to whether you drink it strong or on the weak side .
If you are reluctant to reduce your " Starbucks experience " and are wanting , needing and missing going to Starbucks for their trained barista to make it , then pacify your needs and desires by putting the $ 1,440 savings toward a trip to Venice , Italy .
There they are happy to charge you $ 10 per cup of cappuccino .
The simplest solution , only if you are single , is for you to find a mate who works at Starbucks as a barista and marry them or have them live with you .
This will ensure you of high - quality service 24 / 7 .
If you are not single , we highly encourage you not to cheat on your other mate just to be served coffee .
Take classes to become a barista .
If you are not talented at these things , perhaps you can get your mate to take the classes .
Making coffee at home makes you green like us since you are not using gas to go to Starbucks .
Be even GREENER , Earthling , when you purchase Starbucks organic coffee .
Be GREENEST if you use a reusable ceramic cup instead of a throw - away paper cup and sleeve .
Be GREENER -EST-EST
if you use organic milk in your coffee .
If all else fails , plan Starbucks coffee nights at your dwelling .
Ask your human friends to bring Starbucks coffee .
Make sure one of your guests knows how to be a barista .
Please do not tip your friends for making cappuccino , otherwise it will give away your reason for holding the party at your dwelling .
One additional money saving recession tip : use your old coffee grounds for compost in your garden .
Protests have taken place in Paris
Paris protest
The president of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , Jacques Rogge , has expressed concern over recent unrest in Tibet .
Speaking at an IOC meeting in Beijing , Mr Rogge said the IOC " called for a rapid , peaceful resolution of Tibet " .
He also condemned attempts to disrupt the Olympic torch relay , saying violence " is not compatible with the values " of the Olympic Games .
Protests are taking place in Paris in the latest leg of the torch relay .
Sun Weide , a spokesman for the Beijing Olympic organising committee , said demonstrations on Sunday in London - which saw protesters trying to douse and even snatch the Olympic flame - were the work of " a few Tibetan separatists " , the Associated Press reported .
The official Chinese news agency Xinhua says attempts to sabotage the relay " will surely arouse the resentment of peace loving people " .
Map of Olympic torch relay route
The BBC's James Reynolds in Beijing says the Chinese government seems to be adopting a policy of delaying the reporting of protests and then playing down their significance .
Xinhua took six hours to respond to the protests , our correspondent says , and the state - run China Daily newspaper ran the headline " Warm reception in cold London " - together with a picture of Prime Minister Gordon Brown applauding the torch 's arrival .
The Chinese have made sure that for a few hours , Paris will look like Tiananmen Square

Send us your comments
The demonstrations have been sparked by China 's security crackdown in Tibet following a series of protests against Chinese rule which swept the region last month .
Tibetan exile groups say Chinese security forces killed dozens of protesters .
Beijing says about 19 people were killed in rioting .
' No disruption ' Mr Rogge made his comments in a speech at the beginning of a three - day meeting of National Olympic Committee heads in the Chinese capital , Beijing .
Our correspondent in Beijing says that although Mr Rogge has made similar remarks before , the fact that he was speaking in China appears to give his comments extra weight .
The Olympic torch arrived at Paris ' Charles de Gaulle airport late on Sunday after being flown from London with a Chinese security detail .
China has expressed disgust at the torch protests in London Hundreds of police are being deployed on the streets of Paris to protect the Olympic torch relay from opponents of China 's actions in Tibet .
Pro-Tibet activists have said they plan to hold demonstrations in the capital .
However , Jan Willem , spokesman for the International Campaign for Tibet , told the BBC that the protest in Paris will not disrupt the torch relay .
Mr Willem said supporters will gather for a demonstration at the Place du Trocadero , which will include music by French and Tibetan artists , then march together to the Eiffel Tower .
" We have consistently asked our members and supporters to hold peaceful demonstrations which do n't disrupt the torch relay , so we will focus on the issues which matter for Tibetans inside Tibet , " Mr Willem said .
' Head of state ' protection The 80 runners are being guarded on the 28 km ( 18 mile ) route by a cordon of 65 motorcycles , 200 police on rollerblades or running nearby , and 200 riot police .
Police plan to secure a 200 m ( 660 ft ) perimeter around the torch as it is carried from the Eiffel Tower , down the Champs - Elysees towards City Hall , then over the River Seine to the southern Charlety athletics stadium .
A man tried to snatch the torch from TV presenter Konnie Huq in London
Man tries to snatch torch
The Paris police chief has said the flame will be protected like a head of state .
The head of the Paris - based media watchdog , Reporters Without Borders , said it had altered its initial plans for similar demonstrations because of the expected heavy police presence , but nevertheless promised something " spectacular " .
" The Chinese have made sure that for a few hours , Paris will look like Tiananmen Square , " Robert Menard said .
" I think it 's shameful . "
Police hope the elaborate security " bubble " will protect the relay from the persistent pro-Tibet protests which disrupted its passage through London .
Thirty - seven arrests were made in London on Sunday as protesters tried to seize the torch and disrupt the relay .
At one point , the torch was transferred onto a bus to protect it from the demonstrators .
The torch was lit in Olympia , Greece , last week and will go through 20 countries before being carried into the Beijing Games opening ceremony on 8 August .
OLYMPIC TORCH ROUTE
Torch lit in Olympia on 24 March and taken on five - day relay around Greece to Athens After handover ceremony , it is taken to Beijing on 31 March to begin a journey of 136,800 km ( 85,000 miles ) around the world
Torch arrives in Macao on 3 May .
After three - month relay all around China , it arrives in Beijing for opening ceremony on 8 August

McGonagall would be pelted with food when he read his poems A private collector has paid £ 6,600 for poems by the man ridiculed as " the world 's worst poet " .
A total of 35 of William McGonagall 's works - many of them autographed - have been up for auction in Edinburgh .
The ditties by " The Tayside Tragedian " went for more than a collection of Harry Potter first editions signed by author JK Rowling .
McGonagall , who died in 1902 , was often mocked and had food thrown at him during readings in Dundee .
He was born in Edinburgh in 1825 , but spent much of his life in Dundee as a handloom weaver in the jute mills .
He did not start writing poems until he was 47 , but went on to write about subjects including Scottish battles and Queen Victoria 's Golden Jubilee .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He also took pleasure in writing about death and catastrophe , and his most famous work was a poem about the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 .
A section from it reads : " So the train mov'd slowly along the Bridge of Tay ,
Until it was about midway ,
Then the central girders with a crash gave way ,
And down went the train and passengers into the Tay ... "
Alex Dove , from auctioneers Lyon and Turnbull , said : " He was a confident gentleman who thought that his poetry was some of the best .
" He once walked all the way to Balmoral to try to become Poet Laureate .
Unfortunately the Queen was n't in .
" He spent a lot of time on the streets of Dundee trying to sell his poems and performing them , much to the amusement of the residents .
Because some people take offence with it and ridicule it , they fail to realise what McGonagall is trying to say , which is a narrative of all the events he saw
David Kett
Dundee Central Library
" Poet - baiting became quite an activity for the students of the time , where they would encourage him to perform , and then they would throw eggs and vegetables at him .
The new owner 's bid for the poems was £ 5,500 , but once commission is included they will have to fork out £ 6,600 .
The Harry Potter books only brought in £ 6,000 .
David Kett from the library service in Dundee believes much of the criticism McGonagall receives is unjustified .
" He 's really popular because he promoted himself to an enormous extent and he produced this interesting and unique verse , which has resonated down the ages , " he said .
" Because some people take offence with it and ridicule it , they fail to realise what McGonagall is trying to say , which is a narrative of all the events he saw .
" It 's bad in parts , but there are parts of the poetry where he does achieve a certain extent of lyricism , describing one of the country parks he mentions ' the bees buzzing in the lyme trees ' - really conjures up the image . "

Christening a particle is not easy .
Do you name it after the person who proposed its existence , or the person who discovered it ?
Or do you give it a label that is abstract , poetic , whimsical , onomatopoeic , or just plain descriptive ?
Democritus proposed the existence of a particle , so he could have named it the democriton , but instead this modest Greek philosopher decided to coin the word a - tomos , meaning ' not cuttable ' , which explains the origin of the word atom .
Perversely , today we use the word atom to describe something that is ' cuttable ' , because we know that even the smallest atom , hydrogen , has components that can be pulled part .
So we could rename atoms ' aatoms ' , which is to say ' not not cuttable ' .
Inside the atom we find the electron , which also traces its name back to Ancient Greece .
Elektron is Greek for amber , and the ancients knew that rubbing amber with a dry cloth would enable it to attract very light objects .
We now know that this is because rubbing amber can generate a charge , otherwise known as static electricity , so 19th century scientists used the term electron to describe the first particle that was proven to carry a charge .
The rest of the atom is made of neutrons and protons , and in turn these are made of quarks .
The story of quarks dates back to the 1960s when physicists discovered a menagerie of new subatomic particles .
It was Murrary Gell - Mann who proposed that all these particles ( and protons and neutrons ) were made of just three types of quark .
The name was based on a line from James Joyce 's Finnegan 's Wake : " Three quarks for Muster Mark ! " .
In this context , quark is probably a corruption of quart ( as in quarts of beer ) , which means it should not be pronounced to rhyme with Mark .
Gell - Mann had quite a flair for naming concepts in physics .
The existence of three quarks led to composites of quarks being classified into groups of eight , which Gell - Mann dubbed the Eightfold Way .
This was a reference to a Buddhist proverb about the path to nirvana : " Now this , O monks , is noble truth that leads to the cessation of pain ; this is the noble Eightfold Way . "
Gell - Mann 's three quarks were named up , down and strange .
The up and down quarks formed a natural pair , but the strange quark was the odd one out , hence the name .
In 1974 its partner was discovered and to celebrate its welcome arrival it was dubbed the charm quark
Two more quarks were discovered , and were initially called truth and beauty .
They were the focus of my thesis when I worked at Cern in the late 1980s , but sadly I could not boast that I was researching the physics of truth and beauty , because by this time they had been renamed more prosaically as top and bottom quarks
It is unlikely any more quark types will be discovered at Cern when the LHC fires up this summer , but they will be studied in closer detail than ever before .
In particular , physicists will scrutinise the particles that bind quarks together , predictably known as gluons , because they act like a glue .
Sometimes the order of discovery is a factor in the naming of particles .
In the 1960s and 70s , many physicists were trying to predict the particles that might carry the weak nuclear force , which is responsible for radioactivity .
When they formulated a theory , they sensibly named one type of weak - force carrier the W particle .
The other type was given the name Z , partly because physicists believed there would n't be any more particles left to discover .
Of course , the LHC will also be hunting for new particles .
One of the theories being tested is supersymmetry , the idea that every known particle has a partner awaiting discovery in a high - energy collision .
When the idea was proposed , the sudden doubling of the number of fundamental particles could have been a headache for the physicists who named things .
Their solution was to add an s onto particle names to get the supersymmetric " sparticles " .
So the partners of the quark and electron became squarks and selectrons .
The convention has some unfortunate consequences : the family of particles known as leptons have supersymmetric partners called , well , sleptons
Supersymmetric particles could be discovered at Cern in the coming years but other hypothetical particles are much less likely , such as the axion , which was posited in 1977 to solve problems in the way that quarks and gluons interact .
The theorists who came up with it named their proposed particle after an American brand of laundry detergent , because it was supposed to clean up a rather messy problem in fundamental physics .
There is no sign of axions yet , but if they exist they could explain the vast quantity of missing matter in the universe .
There are so many candidates for this so - called dark matter that scientists have coined catch - all acronyms .
One umbrella term suggests the missing matter is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ( WIMPs ) .
Alternatively , the mysterious dark particles may have aggregated into large collections known as MAssive Compact Halo Objects ( MACHOs
If all this makes it sound as if physicists make things up as they go along , wait until you hear my favourite particle moniker .
This acronym encompasses all the dark matter candidates and truly reflects our level of understanding of this particular subject - Dark Unknown Nonreflective Nondetectable Objects , or DUNNOs , a term which should only be spoken by physicists while shrugging their shoulders .
Well , at least they 're honest .

We love our gadgets as much , if not more , than the next guy , but this has to be one of the most ridiculous things we ’ve seen in quite some time .
There ’s currently a massive line forming in front of the 5th Avenue Flagship Apple Store .
According to reports on the ground , the crowd is forming in anticipation of the new 2nd Generation iPhone launch .
Cool , but are n’t you guys a bit early ?
Yeah .
We thought so .
While the 3G iPhone is certainly coming soon , there ’s nothing whatsoever to indicate that today is the drop date .
Sure , Apple might drop a huge surprise on us , but we ’re guessing that the 60 - some - odd folks in line are either casualties of a successful prank , foreigners looking for a “ true American experience ” , or just plain confused .
Sheep mentality is a funny thing , folks .

In July of 2007 , Skype lost a court case over their failure to include a copy of the GPL in their WSKP100 VoIP phone – it ran Linux , GPL software , which means a copy of the GPL license must be included .
The case was started by the gpl-violations.org group .
Skype decided to appeal against the decision , but it has decided to withdraw that appeal .
GPL-violation.org ’s Harald Welte revealed the move in a blog post .
He explained that despite the court suggesting the two parties find middle ground , gpl-violations.org would settle for nothing less but full GPL compliance .
The blog post reads :
The various arguments by Skype supporting their claim that the GPL is violating German anti-trust legislation as well as further claims aiming at the GPL being invalid or incompatible with German legislation were not further analyzed by the court .
The court stated that there was not enough arguments and material brought forward by Skype to support such a claim .
According to Welte , the court hinted twice that if it would come to a judgement , Skype ’s chances of winning would be minimal .
Skype asked for a short break , and when they returned , they withdrew their appeal , meaning the original court decision still stands .
Welte writes : “ we have successfully won what has probably been the most lengthy and time consuming case so far . ”
Less than a week after Los Alamos National Laboratory 's Roadrunner supercomputer began operating at world - record petaflop - per - second data - processing speeds , Los Alamos researchers are already using the computer to mimic extremely complex neurological processes .
Welcome to the new frontier of research at Los Alamos : science at the petascale .
The prefix " peta " stands for a million billion , also known as a quadrillion .
For the Roadrunner supercomputer , operating at petaflop / s performance means the machine can process a million billion calculations each second .
In other words , Roadrunner gives scientists the ability to quickly render mountainous problems into mere molehills , or model systems that previously were unthinkably complex .
Late last week and early this week while verifying Roadrunner 's performance , Los Alamos and IBM researchers used three different computational codes to test the machine .
Among those codes was one dubbed " PetaVision " by its developers and the research team using it .
PetaVision models the human visual system -- mimicking more than 1 billion visual neurons and trillions of synapses .
Neurons are nerve cells that process information in the brain .
Neurons communicate with each other using synaptic connections , analogous to what transistors are in modern computer chips .
Synapses store memories and play a vital role in learning .
Synapses set the scale for computations performed by the brain while undertaking such tasks as locomotion , hearing or vision .
Because there are about a quadrillion synapses in the human brain , human cognition is a petaflop /s computational problem .

To date , computers have been unable to match human performance on such visual tasks as flawlessly detecting an oncoming automobile on the highway or distinguishing a friend from a stranger in a crowd of people .
Roadrunner is now changing the game .
On Saturday , Los Alamos researchers used PetaVision to model more than a billion visual neurons surpassing the scale of 1 quadrillion computations a second ( a petaflop / s ) .
On Monday scientists used PetaVision to reach a new computing performance record of 1.144 petaflop /s .
The achievement throws open the door to eventually achieving human - like cognitive performance in electronic computers .
PetaVision only requires single precision arithmetic , whereas the official LINPACK code used to officially verify Roadrunner 's speed uses double precision arithmetic .
" Roadrunner ushers in a new era for science at Los Alamos National Laboratory , " said Terry Wallace , associate director for Science , Technology and Engineering at Los Alamos .
" Just a week after formal introduction of the machine to the world , we are already doing computational tasks that existed only in the realm of imagination a year ago . "
Based on the results of PetaVision 's inaugural trials , Los Alamos researchers believe they can study in real time the entire human visual cortex - - arguably a human being 's most important sensory apparatus .
The ability to achieve human levels of cognitive performance on a digital computer could lead to important insights and revolutionary technological applications .
Such applications include " smart " cameras that can recognize danger or an autopilot system for automobiles that could take over for incapacitated drivers in complex situations such as navigating dense urban traffic .
Los Alamos National Laboratory 's computation science team working with Roadrunner includes : Craig Rasmussen , Charles Ferenbaugh , Sriram Swaminarayan , Pallab Datta , all of Los Alamos ; and Cornell Wright of IBM .
The PetaVision Synthetic Cognition team responsible for the theory and codes run on Roadrunner includes : Luis Bettencourt , Garrett Kenyon , Ilya Nemenman , John George , Steven Brumby , Kevin Sanbonmatsu , and John Galbraith , all of Los Alamos ; Steven Zuker of Yale University ; and James DiCarlo from Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The Roadrunner is the world 's first supercomputer to achieve sustained operating performance speeds of one petaflop /s .
In partnership with Los Alamos and the National Nuclear Security Administration , Roadrunner was built by IBM and will be housed at Los Alamos National Laboratory , where it will be used to perform calculations that will vastly improve the nation 's ability to certify that the United States nuclear weapons stockpile is reliable without conducting underground nuclear tests .
Roadrunner also will be used for science and engineering such as energy research , understanding dark energy and dark matter , materials properties and response , understanding complex neural and biological systems , and biomedical applications .
Roadrunner was built using commercially available hardware , including aspects of commercial game console technologies .
Roadrunner has a unique hybrid design comprised of nodes containing two AMD OpteronTM dual - core processors plus four PowerXCell 8iTM processors used as computational accelerators .
The accelerators are a special IBM - developed variant of the Cell processors used in the Sony PlayStation ®
3 . Roadrunner uses a Linux operating system .
The project 's total cost is approximately $ 120 million .
It 's been one of the ironies in the energy equation - we have the energy from the sun all around us , many times more than what all of together on earth require , yet capturing and utilising that energy has been much more difficult and costly than one would like .
This has not stopped the solariphiles from looking forward to the day when the sun will power most of , or all , our energy needs .
Well , while that day might still be far off for most of the world , it already has arrived for a small village in South Korea .
This village has achieved what even the most powerful countries in the world are still struggling to accomplish : total energy independence with clean technology .
Donggwang is a village on the western half of the island Jeju - do in South Korea .
On the roof of each of the 40 houses in Donggwang lies a large beds of solar panels .
And this includes even the small , local elementary school !
A typical house roof in the village has a two kilowatt solar installation .
The photovoltaic panels thus fitted produce enough energy to power the entire area .
Now the important question is , how much of this success is translatable to the rest of the world ?
Are there some specific advantages that this tiny South Korean village has that has facilitated it to become 100 % solar ?
I could not see anything unique about this village , so there is hope that this is replicable .
We however have to keep in mind that this is a small village - they are talking about 40 houses in all , certainly small by any standards !
One piece of info gleaned from the articles could provide a hint : " In 2004 , the government helped to install solar systems in Donggwang , paying 70 % of the installation fees . "
Now , this could indeed be a great help as it is well known that installation costs for solar could in fact be a major stumbling block to its widespread adoption .
While we spend our time analysing whether this small success could lead to a big leap for solar energy adoption in the rest of the world , hats off to Donggwang for showing us the light at the end of the tunnel , to use a pun !

So much for Ballmer 's vision of a paperless world -- that is , if the mighty nanofiber paper has anything to do with it .
This new paper is made out of the same cellulose your regulation legal pad , but scientists at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm , Sweden were able to get the fiber so small and defect - free in this version -- about 1,000 times smaller -- that it 's more than seven times as strong .
By breaking down wood pulp with enzymes and beating it mechanically and then treating the tiny fibers with carboxymethanol , they were able to get the new paper to a tensile strength of 214 megapascals ( MPa ) compared with the normal 30 MPa .
So , why should you care ?
It 's entirely possible that this stuff could replace plastic bags at stores without all the petroleum waste .

McCain is arguing for offshore drilling to lower US petroleum prices in the “ short term . ”
It is all a big lie , and a dangerous one at that .
Our marine environment and our fisheries are already at risk .
And the devastation in Wisconsin , Iowa and Mississipi from extreme weather events like flooding is where the US , and the world is going if McCain wins this argument .
And McCain has the gall to say he is worried about global warming !
The world uses on the order of 86 million barrels a day of petroleum .
That figure is expected to veer sharply upward as China and India go in for automobiles and trucking in a big way .
The United States uses nearly 21 million barrels a day of petroleum and liquified hydrocarbon fuel , or nearly 25 % of everything the world produces daily .
The US has 5 % of the world ’s population .
The US produces about 5 million barrels a day of petroleum and another 3 million barrels a day of liquefied fuel .
That 8 million barrels a day is only about a third of what we use , so we import the rest .
The lower 48 states produced about 4.4 million barrels of petroleum a day in 2006 .
If all the known offshore fields were drilled and panned out , the lower 48 ’s oil production would be increased by 7 % .
That would be 300,000 barrels a day .
Millions of barrels of oil a day produced by US and by world , with McCain ’s proposed increase through offshore drilling .
0.3 million barrels a day would make very little difference whatsoever to current oil prices even if it could be brought online right now .
It would be a matter of a few pennies .
And , in fact , if there were to be any impact of all of offshore drilling on prices , it would not come until 2020 or even 2030 .
You will note that the Saudis just offered to increase their production by 0.5 million barrels a day , and the oil futures market just yawned .
And that is in the real world , right now , not in some decade or two - decades - out in the future drilling scheme .
Moreover , US consumption of petroleum is increasing over time , so the extra 300,000 barrels a day would quickly be used up and then some .
McCain is cynically wooing Big Oil in Texas in order to get campaign contributions , while lying to the American people about his offshore drilling plan having a quick impact on oil prices and their quality of life .
Bringing the 300,000 barrels a day on line would make somebody a lot of money .
It will do us no good with regard to energy prices , and in fact will harm our standard of living because drilling for the oil will endanger beaches and the environment more generally , and burning that extra oil will accelerate climate change .
An informed reader writes , “ We can save more than 300,000 barrels a day by everyone in the US using just one sixth of a gallon less a day .
The US did it in WW2 , why not in the War on Oil ? ”
It is n’t even a matter of just voluntarily using less .
If the US depended more on trains and increased automobile and truck fuel efficiency , it could reduce its use of petroleum by millions of barrels a day , which would have a stupendous impact on oil prices compared to what could be achieved from offshore drilling .
Rail is much more efficient at transporting goods than trucking .
Trucking in the US receives very substantial hidden subsidies .
Trucks tear up the highways in ways that passenger automobiles do not , so the hundreds of millions of dollars the government spends on road repair every year , which you pay for with your tax dollars , is effectively a vast subsidy to trucking companies .
If that subsidy were cancelled , or given to the railroads , and trucking companies had to actually pay the cost in carbon production and road repair generated by their industry , the US would be light years closer to energy independence .
It is Congress , which is bribed by campaign contributions from concrete and trucking concerns , that has set up this ridiculous system of hidden subsidies that harms us all .
Moreover , Detroit ’s silly resistance to fuel efficient automobiles will bury the US car industry , as the world turns to vehicles produced by the Japanese or Europeans that are much cheaper to run .
And Congress coddles them on all this .
“ Redshift ” notes below ,
‘ To add to his new energy policy instanity , McCain is a longtime opponent of Amtrak .
He ’s actually worse than Bush in this area .
In the “ differences ” column of the recent NYT chart comparing Bush and McCain on policy , this is noted under “ Federal spending ” : “ Mr. McCain has sought to emphasize his differences with Mr. Bush by portraying himself as a stronger opponent of pork - barrel projects and other wasteful spending .
He says he would not sign any earmarked projects into law and would cut financing for ineffective programs , including Amtrak . ” ‘
McCain is not against Federal subsidies for commuter airlines , on which Arizonans depend .
It is estimated that Federal subsidies for highways annually amount to $ 500 an automobile , while subsidies for Amtrak amount to only $ 40 a passenger .
( Since rail is also more efficient in moving passengers than automobiles , and since automobiles account for a significant proportion of US petroleum use , opposing subsidies for Amtrak while spending billions in public money to build and repair roads for autos is suicidal . )
But I have a sinking feeling that the Democrats will have no effective answer to McCain ’s cynical offshore drilling ploy .
Developing a Green rhetoric that is convincing to the public is the most essential political task of our generation , and of tremendously more import than terrorism or war .
In Mathematica , a core principle is that everything should be scalable .
So in my job of creating algorithms for Mathematica I have to make sure that everything I produce is scalable .
Last week I decided to test this on one particular example .
The problem I chose happens to be a classic .
In fact , the very first nontrivial computer program ever written — by Ada Lovelace in 1842 — was solving the same problem .
The problem is to compute Bernoulli numbers .
Bernoulli numbers have a long history , dating back at least to Jakob Bernoulli ’s 1713 Ars Conjectandi .
Bernoulli ’s specific problem was to find formulas for sums like .
Before Bernoulli , people had just made tables of results for specific n and m .
But in a Mathematica - like way , Bernoulli pointed out that there was an algorithm that could automate this .
For any given n , the answer is a polynomial in m , and the coefficients are constants that Bernoulli showed could be computed by a simple recurrence formula .
It could have been that Bernoulli numbers would be useful only for solving this particular problem .
But in fact over the past 300 years they have found their way into a remarkable range of areas of mathematics .
They appear in the formula for the Riemann zeta function at even integers .
They are in the coefficients in the series expansion for tan( x ) .
They appear in the Euler - Maclaurin formula for approximating integrals by sums and in the Stirling series for the gamma function .
They even relate to Fermat ’s last theorem — which was first proved by Ernst Kummer for “ regular primes ” characterized by Bernoulli numbers .
In 1713 Bernoulli was rather proud of being able to compute the first ten Bernoulli numbers in “ a quarter of an hour ” .
Of course , in Mathematica , it ’s now instantaneous :
But just how far can we go — 295 years after Bernoulli , and now with Mathematica ?
I decided to try scaling up Bernoulli ’s computation — by a factor of a million — and computing the 10 millionth Bernoulli number .
Until recently , doing this would have been impractical , even in Mathematica .
Because Mathematica used essentially the same classic recurrence relation for computing Bernoulli numbers that Jakob Bernoulli himself used , and that Ada Lovelace described programming on Charles Babbage ’s Analytical Engine .
This algorithm has the feature ( already recognized by Lovelace ) that it takes about n^2 steps to compute the nth Bernoulli number .
So even if one could compute the 10th Bernoulli number in a millisecond , it ’d take several thousand years to compute the 10 millionth Bernoulli number .
But a few years ago I programmed a quite different algorithm into Mathematica .
Instead of directly computing the Bernoulli numbers using a recurrence relation , I instead used a trick recently suggested by Bernd Kellner : computing Bernoulli numbers by computing the Riemann zeta function .
It ’s the integrated nature of Mathematica that makes things like this practical .
Without Mathematica , one has to use the simplest building blocks to make efficient algorithms .
But with Mathematica , one can take for granted access to efficient very - high - level operations — like computing Riemann zeta functions .
Bernoulli numbers are related to the zeta function by :
The denominator of a Bernoulli number can be computed using a corollary to the von Staudt - Clausen theorem as :
To get the numerator , one then just has to use the relation to the zeta function .
The right - hand side is , then , evaluated approximately and multiplied by the already - known denominator of the Bernoulli number .
Provided the approximation is done with enough significant digits , the numerator of the Bernoulli number is a mere integer part of the product .
But there ’s still a problem : to get all the digits in a Bernoulli number , one has to compute powers of pi to extreme precision .
Of course , Mathematica can do that — to billions of digits if necessary .
A week ago , I took our latest development version of Mathematica , and I typed BernoulliB [ 10^7 ] .
And then I waited .
Yesterday — 5 days , 23 hours , 51 minutes and 37 seconds later — I got the result !
[ Download 24MB bzip2 file ]
The denominator is simple ; it ’s just 9601480183016524970884020224910 .
But the numerator is not so simple ; in fact it ’s 57,675,292 digits long .
It took less than 1 gigabyte of memory to compute , and required computing pi to about 66 million digits .
The numerator is negative , it begins with -47845869850733698144899338333210878162030638218660 and ends with 57164275665935124168181176013725629647185402960697 .
Its digits seem almost random .
I counted occurrences of all possible k - digit subsequences in the numerator of the 10 millionth Bernoulli number for k=1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .
The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean stays low , though grows with k .
So how can we tell if it ’s correct ?
Bernoulli numbers have lots of interesting properties .
One that ’s particularly revealing was discovered by Kummer in 1843 , and goes by the name of p-adic continuity .
In particular , for two integers n and m , and a prime number p such that neither n nor m is divisible by p - 1 , and a natural number r , such that :
the p-adic continuity asserts that :
This property is completely independent of the way we computed the Bernoulli number .
So let ’s start checking .
Obviously n=10^7 .
I checked the p-adic continuity for p=43 , r=3 , m=59776 ; p=59 , r=2 , m=916 ; p=7919 , r=1 , m=7484 ; and p=27449 , r=1 , m=8928 .
Every one of these congruences is 0 , as it should be .
We ’ve successfully found the 10 millionth Bernoulli number .
We ’ve done what Ada Lovelace believed should be possible : we ’ve mechanized the computation of Bernoulli numbers — so well , in fact , that 295 years after Jakob Bernoulli , its taken us only 500 times longer to compute a million - times - as - large Bernoulli number .
And all with a single line of Mathematica input .
FOR two months , Kenya , East Africa 's most prosperous and supposedly stable country , hovered on the brink of self - immolation as two warring political factions ripped the country apart after a disputed election at the end of 2007 .
Kofi Annan , the former secretary - general of the United Nations , was brought in to try to resolve the conflict between the ruling party , which was accused of rigging its presidential victory , and the opposition Orange Democratic Movement ( ODM ) .
As ethnic violence raged nearby , negotiators from the two sides would sometimes almost come to blows themselves as Mr Annan tried to find common ground between them .
But when deadlock loomed , both sides ' negotiating teams were smuggled off to a secret location in a game park for two days , with just Mr Annan and his secretariat , including a team from a little - known group called the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue ( CHD ) .
There , with no distractions from the media and far from the political circus in the capital , Nairobi , came the vital breakthrough .
The main outlines of a deal between the two sides were talked through in an atmosphere of relative calm ; a new national unity government , comprising both the ruling party and the ODM , was inaugurated a few weeks later .
Originally , Mr Annan had flown into Nairobi with just two people from the CHD , a Swiss - based organisation of mediators .
During his six weeks or so of mediating he drew on the considerable resources of the UN , but he also made constant use of his CHD backup .
They provided him with tactical advice on the mediation process , such as when to take the negotiators on “ retreat ” and how to involve the media .
And they also drafted agreements as the two sides spoke during the negotiations , so that at the end of a day an agreed statement could be issued immediately to the press .
This gave the mediation the vital momentum that Mr Annan wanted .
The Kenyan talks provide a good example of the sort of skills that a new kind of international mediator can bring to the age - old work of conflict resolution .
For as the nature of the world 's conflicts has changed in the past decade or so , so the demand for a new type of mediator has grown too .
The CHD , for instance , founded by just four people only nine years ago , now has a staff of over 70 .
The UN has traditionally provided a forum for the discussion and resolution of international disputes .
However as Kreddha , a Dutch - based mediation group , argues : “ There are no equivalent mechanisms for intrastate dispute resolution ... despite the fact that most violent conflicts today are not international but intrastate in character . ”
The new mediators provide the new mechanisms .
Many of these contemporary conflicts involve insurgents , secessionists or even “ resource - warriors ” , like those in the oil - rich Niger Delta of Nigeria , who clash with governments .
Rival politicians can be brought into open conflict by elections , such as in Kenya , or now Zimbabwe .
The new kinds of disputes involve non-traditional parties such as international mining or oil companies pitched against indigenous people , as well as national governments tackling more established terrorist groups .
One study has shown that over the past 15 years military victories have resolved only 7.5 % of conflicts , while negotiations have prevailed in 92 % of cases ; “ the challenge is thus not being a skilful warrior but a skilful negotiator . ”
The UN might , at best , offer some bureaucratic and political clout , but it is also big , cumbersome and leaky .
In its place , the new mediators operate on a much smaller scale and offer discretion , secrecy and flexibility .
Mr Annan used the CHD in Kenya because it has no political agenda , so could be relied upon not to leak material in order to influence the talks one way or another .
These mediators are ideal for getting involved in highly charged disputes between governments , for instance , and indigenous “ terrorist ” groups ; they can set up back - channels , of the sort that proved vital in bringing about the eventual peace deal between the British government and the Irish Republican Army .
Thus the CHD provided a first conduit between the rebel Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian government , as the Indonesians refused to use the UN because of anger over its role in East Timor .
In Nepal , the CHD established the first links between the government and the Maoist insurgents in 2000 .
Here a key factor was “ plausible deniability ” , as was trust .
Andrew Marshall , who sought out the first Maoist interlocutors , says that “ neither side wanted their own people and cadres to know they were talking to the other side ” , so the leaders of both the government and the rebels invested their trust in the third party , CHD , to keep the talks secret .
Eventually , several countries got involved and this year the Maoists prevailed in elections .
The CHD also acted as a back - channel between the Spanish government and the Basque separatist movement ETA leading up to a ceasefire in 2006 ; it is currently trying to bring together the Darfur rebel groups in Sudan as one negotiating body .
Kreddha has been involved in mediation work in the Niger Delta , and in New Caledonia between a mining corporation , Goro Nickel , and an indigenous environmental organisation called Rheebu Nuu .
Such disputes are often called “ resource conflicts ” , and require specialist mediators with a knowledge of international law .
Another new organisation called Conflicts Forum , founded by a former British intelligence officer , Alastair Crooke , attempts to serve as an interlocutor between militant Islamist groups , such as Hamas and Hizbullah , and the West .
Some mediation work can be instantly glamorous and hugely fulfilling , as in Kenya , but most of it is attritional ; often it is pretty boring .
Negotiations can drag on for years , but here again the small mediators can add a lot of value .
Foreign politicians from America and Britain , for example , may bring a lot of pressure to bear on a dispute for a short amount of time , but inevitably they come and go according to the whims and demands of domestic politics .
Professional mediators can stick with a conflict for years , thus building up a level of trust and knowledge that cannot easily be replicated .
Much of a mediator 's work lies in getting the logistics right ; trusted third - party interlocutors are needed simply to arrange meetings and book hotel rooms which will not be bugged by the other side .
In the case of CHD , it can also get visas and facilitate travel for “ terrorists ” taking part in talks in neutral venues like Switzerland or Norway .
Both are strong financial backers of the centre , and neither is a member of the EU ; they are thus outside the conventions restricting travel for those on some terrorist watch lists .
Small countries backing small mediators can make a big difference ; the betting now is on Mr Annan and his team trying to repeat their Kenya trick in beleaguered Zimbabwe .
Cambridge , Mass . -- May 19 , 2008 -- Engineers and applied physicists from Harvard University have demonstrated the first room - temperature electrically - pumped semiconductor source of coherent Terahertz ( THz ) radiation , also known as T - rays .
The breakthrough in laser technology , based upon commercially available nanotechnology , has the potential to become a standard Terahertz source to support applications ranging from security screening to chemical sensing .
Spearheaded by research associate Mikhail Belkin and Federico Capasso , Robert L. Wallace Professor of Applied Physics and Vinton Hayes Senior Research Fellow in Electrical Engineering , both of Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) , the findings will be published in the May 19 issue of Applied Physics Letters .
The researchers have also filed for U.S. patents covering the novel device .
Using lasers in the Terahertz spectral range , which covers wavelengths from 30 to 300å , has long presented a major hurdle to engineers .
In particular , making electrically pumped room - temperature and thermoelectrically - cooled Terahertz semiconductor lasers has been a major challenge .
These devices require cryogenic cooling , greatly limiting their use in everyday applications .
" By contrast , our device emits T - rays with several hundreds of nanowatts of power at room temperature and microwatts of power at temperatures easily achievable with commercially available thermoelectric coolers , " says Belkin .
" Further , there is the potential of increasing the terahertz output power to milliwatt levels by optimizing the semiconductor nanostructure of the active region and by improving the extraction efficiency of the terahertz radiation . "
To achieve the breakthrough and overcome the temperature limitations of current laser designs , the researchers engineered a room temperature mid-infrared Quantum Cascade Laser ( QCL ) that emits light at two frequencies simultaneously .
The generation of Terahertz radiation occurs via the process of difference - frequency generation inside the laser material at room temperature at a frequency of 5 THz ( equal to the difference of the two mid-infrared QCL frequencies ) .
Mid-infrared QCLs were invented and demonstrated by Capasso and his team at Bell Labs in 1994 .
The compact millimeter length semiconductor lasers operate routinely at room temperature with high optical powers and are increasingly used in the commercial sector for wide range of applications in chemical sensing and trace gas analysis .
The devices , made by stacking ultra - thin atomic layers of semiconductor materials on top of each other , are variable and tunable , allowing an engineer to adjust the energy levels in the structure to create artificial laser medium .
" Terahertz imaging and sensing is a very promising but relatively new technology that requires compact , portable and tunable sources to achieve widespread penetration .
Our devices are an important first step in this direction , " said Capasso .
" We believe our THz source has great development potential because the nanoscale material used was grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy , a commercial and widely used thin film growth technique which ' spray paints ' atoms on a surface one layer at a time . "
The ability of Terahertz rays to penetrate efficiently through paper , clothing , cardboard , plastic and many other materials makes them ideal for use in many applications .
For example , a device emitting T - rays could be used to image concealed weapons , detect chemical and biological agents through sealed packages , see tumors without causing any harmful side effects , and spot defects within materials such as cracks in the Space Shuttle 's foam insulation .

( Natural News ) Biofuel produced from a fast - growing variety of grass can produce 540 percent more energy than is used during its manufacture , according to a study conducted by researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) and published in the Researchers grew switchgrass on 10 different farms , ranging between three and nine hectares in size , for five years .
They calculated the energy used to produce the fertilizers , herbicides , diesel and seeds used in the switchgrass production .
Because no large - scale biorefineries currently exist , the researchers used estimates to calculate how much biofuel could be produced from the switchgrass farms ' output .
In contrast to an earlier study , which found a net energy gain of 343 percent , the researchers found a 540 percent energy gain from switchgrass .
The researchers did not include in their calculations how much energy used to ship the switchgrass to a refinery .
In order to keep these costs low and the energy output high , they recommended that biorefineries be constructed near the fields on which switchgrass is grown .
" A biorefinery will have a feedstock supply radius of about 25 to 50 miles , so the feedstock of any biorefinery needs to be localized , " said co-author Ken Vogel , of the USDA 's Agriculture Research Service .
The United Nations and other organizations have criticized the biofuels industry for taking arable land out of food production and using it to produce fuel instead .
According to Vogel , one of the advantages of switchgrass is that it can be grown on marginal cropland .
" The intent is to have energy crops being grown on marginal cropland , so it would not be in competition with food crops on our best land , " he said .
Another advantage switchgrass has over other oil crops , such as corn , is that the entire plant and not just a seed can be used to produce ethanol , leading to much higher yields per ton .

The Democratic National Committee has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the State Department today related to a fundraiser that John McCain held in Ottawa .
At issue is whether U.S. Ambassador David Wilkins and the McCain campaign violated the Hatch Act by having the Ambassador help to organize a $ 100 a plate luncheon for McCain .
The Hatch Act forbids the engagement in partisan political activity by any ambassador , even if the activity in question occurs on foreign soil .
It appears that McCain advisor Sen. Lindsey Graham used his South Carolina connection with the Ambassador to get advice about logistics , venues , and cities for the event .
Ambassador Wilkins also contacted Thomas d’Aquino , the president of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives , and had him help sell tickets for the event .
All of this violates both the Hatch Act , and State Department ethics rules .
This has been a tough week for McCain as he has also refused to reimburse a private company for use of its corporate jet , and it came out that he withdrew from public financing for the primary after he used the promise of public funds to secure a loan for his campaign , and free national ballot access .

“ By apparently running afoul of the Hatch Act during his trip to Canada today , it appears that Senator McCain is once again putting his political aspirations ahead of following the law , ” said DNC spokeswoman Karen Finney .
“ Between his refusal to pay for his campaign ’s use of a corporate jet and his illegally attempting to withdraw from the primary funds program , this is becoming a disturbing pattern of impropriety on the part of Senator McCain and his campaign .
How can the American people trust John McCain if he is unwilling to follow the law when it gets in the way of his political aspirations ? ”
There is a disturbing trend developing with the McCain campaign .
On one hand they talk about campaign finance reform , but they act like campaign finance rules should apply to everyone else except them .
Things such as this are the reason why we need publicly funded elections .
McCain is no better than any other politician in the current system .
Laws such as the Hatch
Act are in place to separate public service from partisan politics so that the corruption and patronage of a bygone era does not return .
What I would like to see from John McCain are some straight actions to match his “ straight talk . ”

Having always thought it was more racially enlightened than strife - torn America , France finds itself facing the prospect that it has actually fallen behind on that score .
Incidents like the ones over the weekend bring to mind the rioting that exploded across France three years ago .
Since it abolished slavery 160 years ago , the country has officially declared itself to be colorblind  but seeing Mr. Obama , a new generation of French blacks is arguing that it ’s high time here for precisely the sort of frank discussions that in America have preceded the nomination of a major black candidate .
This black consciousness is reflected not just in daily conversation , but also in a dawning culture of books and music by young French blacks like Youssoupha , a cheerful , toothy 28 - year - old , who was sent here from Congo by his parents to get an education at 10 , raised by an aunt who worked in a school cafeteria in a poor suburb , and told by guidance counselors that he should n’t be too ambitious .
Instead , he earned a master ’s degree from the Sorbonne .
Then , like many well - educated blacks in this country , he hit a brick wall .
“ I found myself working in fast - food places with people who had the equivalent of a 15 - year - old ’s level of education , ” he recalled .
So he turned to rap , out of frustration as much as anything , finding inspiration in “ négritude , ” an ideology of black pride conceived in Paris during the 1920s and 30s by Aimé Césaire , the French poet and politician from Martinique , and Léopold Sédar Senghor , the poet who became Senegal ’s first president .
Its philosophy , as Sartre once put it , was a kind of “ antiracist racism , ” a celebration of shared black heritage .

Négritude and Césaire are back .
When Césaire died in April , at 94 , his funeral in Fort - de - France , Martinique , was broadcast live on French television .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , and his rival Ségolène Royal both attended .
Just three years ago , Mr. Sarkozy , as head of a center - right party and not yet president , supported a law ( repealed after much protest ) that compelled French schools to teach the “ positive ” aspects of colonialism .
The next year , Césaire refused to meet with him .
Now here was Mr. Sarkozy flying to the former French colony ( today one of the country ’s overseas departments , meaning he could troll for votes ) to pay tribute to the poet laureate of négritude .
According to Bill Glynn , the founder and Managing Director of Collective IQ http://www.collectiveiq.com, ranked the # 1 Corporate Venture Capital Platform in the world , and author of " Left on Red " http://www.billyg.net the real terrorist threat to America does not come in the form of a suicide bomber or from Islamic extremists .
Rather , the Achilles Heel of the United States is our economy .
According to Glynn , in the aftermath of September 11th almost a trillion dollars was wiped out of the economy , and we are still reeling as a result of it .
" Right now , China , Russia , India and Saudi Arabia basically own the United States .
Our economy is the real target of terrorists and this is our potential downfall , " says Glynn .
His solution is transparent and uncomplicated ... a 10 % solution .
" If we are to prevent another Great Depression we need to pass one simple law :
All pension plans , endowments , 401 ( k ) s and the like will be required to allocate 10 % of their portfolios to buy back U.S. debt and currency . "
With more than 40 trillion dollars currently invested in these types of accounts , Glynn asserts that some four trillion dollars could be freed up in a matter of days to wipe out the national debt , buy back the $ 1.6 trillion in U.S. debt currently owned by China and more .
He suggests that approximately one trillion dollars go into a 10 - year Zero Coupon Bond with the proceeds ultimately going back to the endowments and pension plans .
" Rather than seeing this as simply giving money back to the government , it 's really a 10 - year interest - free loan that has incredible benefits , " he explains .
He believes the immediate increase in world confidence with respect to the United States , the anticipated rise in the value of the U.S. dollar , as well as the boost to the overall economy would have far reaching and dramatic impact on equity prices .
" In the very near term , the 10 % allocation would almost undoubtedly be offset by a corresponding increase in the value of the remaining assets in these portfolios , " Glynn continues .
If this law was enacted there would certainly be resistance at first .
However , Glynn confidently predicts and openly challenges anyone to refute that there would be a massive uptick in U.S. and world markets if the National Debt were paid off .
" It would cause one of the county 's biggest celebrations : Liberation Day !
The day the U.S. took back its economic leadership before it is squandered .
This plan is so simple and powerful - I would be willing to debate any politician , pundit , talk show host or Presidential candidate on its validity , " Glynn says .
Glynn believes that we should be a nation of savers , not borrowers .
He is also calling for an increase in the minimum wage and for 5 % of all wages ( up to $ 50,000 ) to be placed into low - interest bearing " deficit or economy bonds . "
" This would create another account with a surplus of trillions of dollars that could be used to funnel money back into the economy for infrastructure , social security , health care and more .
It would put America back into the hands of Americans ... not foreign entities or governments , " he concludes .

The Debt Slave Act , better known as the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 has at long last blown sky high .
We will get to " how " in just a moment but first let 's review some of the provisions of the bill .
Lenders asked for and received everything on their wish list as follows :
Wish List
A strict financial means test that may prohibit many debtors from filing a liquidation bankruptcy under Chapter 7 ;
A requirement that all debtors must receive a briefing from an approved credit counseling agency at least six months before they can file their bankruptcy case ; Note : Check with your local bankruptcy court to determine if they will waive the time restrictions in the beginning months .
A requirement that debtors take an approved class on debt management techniques before they receive their bankruptcy discharge ;
A provision making it easier for a court to dismiss a bankruptcy case outright or to convert a Chapter 7 case to a Chapter 13 case ; and
A provision permitting a court to impose sanctions on attorneys , or even on debtors , for filing a Chapter 7 case that is dismissed or converted to a Chapter 13 case .
You load sixteen tons , what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter do n't you call me ' cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
Liar Loans Discharged In Bankruptcy
This is a big deal , and will no doubt strike real fear in the hearts of stated - income lenders everywhere .
Our own Uncle Festus sent me this decision , in which Judge Leslie Tchaikovsky ruled that a National City HELOC that had been " foreclosed out " would be discharged in the debtors '
Chapter 7 bankruptcy .
Nat City had argued that the debt should be non-dischargeable because the debtors made material false representations ( namely , lying about their income ) on which Nat City relied when it made the loan .
The court agreed that the debtors had in fact lied to the bank , but it held that the bank did not " reasonably rely " on the misrepresentations .
Tanta Writes :
Nat City gets zero sympathy for me on this one .
Talk about a case of " fool me twice . "
Jas Jain writes :
Tanta : “ I argued some time ago that the whole point of stated income lending was to make the borrower the fall guy : the lender can make a dumb loan -- knowing perfectly well that it is doing so -- while shifting responsibility onto the borrower , who is the one " stating " the income and -- in theory , at least -- therefore liable for the misrepresentation . ”
Uncle Festus writes :
A few random thoughts on things which have been raised in these comments :
1 . I do n't think that the lender will appeal this , because at this point it 's not " binding " precedent on any other court ( though it will be cited as " persuasive " precedent in future similar disputes ) .
I think the lender will not appeal it because there is a real risk that the higher court ( either the 9th Circuit itself or the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel ) could affirm it and it would then become binding on the entire 9th Circuit , which encompasses the whole West Coast plus Arizona and Nevada .
The money at risk in this individual case ( if there is any at all ) is minuscule compared to the risk of this becoming the law in the largest Circuit in the country .
As ye sow so shall ye reap .

Just before dawn , by an empty shingle beach , sinister figures move through the gloom .
Living shadows , they 're dressed all in black , their coats made from long rags , their faces obscured by paint .
But their eyes burn brightly as they gather in a circle .
If some poor insomniac comes walking the dog now – at 5 am on a cold , damp morning – they 'll get a massive fright .
" Hey - ya ! " yell eight men and women as they come together with a loud clash of sticks , and what appears to be a blend of country dancing , martial arts and the mating ritual of raggedy crows .
The dance is about sex , there 's no mistaking that : one partner stands with legs straddling his stick , holding it upwards from the groin , while the other uses his own stick to bash it about .
" It 's so much a fertility dance that you 'd have to really not know what you were looking at to miss the point , " says 47 - year - old Laurence Ranger , the squire ( a kind of road manager ) of Hunters Moon Morris .
Morris dancing is a joke , is n't it , with a hey nonny no ?
Beardy men with beer bellies prancing about in white stockings , waving hankies ?
Very twee .
But try telling that to the men and women of Hunters Moon , here by the Sussex coast looking like the devilish spawn of Hell 's Angels and medieval mummers .
They are part of a secret revolution in morris dancing , transforming the most easily lampooned of English eccentricities .
Fresh rivalries are emerging , as younger men and women reinvent " the morris " in startling ways – including , as we discover during a mad dash around southern England on May Day , the world 's first Gothic morris troupe – or " side " .
Dawn on 1 May is when the season starts for dancers who have been practising in pubs and church halls all winter .
By the beach at Holywell , the site of an ancient spring in Eastbourne , Hunters Moon are doing a dance that is vigorous , noisy and saucy .
And pagan .
" Look at it coming up , " says a female voice , and she 's not talking about her partner 's big stick : the sun is beginning to burn orange through heavy grey clouds on the horizon .
" That is wonderful . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The dancers encircle a woman in a long green velvet cloak , who holds up a silver cup .
" As the sun rises we meet the summer , " she says , beginning a pagan blessing , " and ask that the spirits of the land and sea bring bounty , health and happiness to those within this circle . "
With that , she passes the cup around like a communion chalice .
Later , the remnants of the wine will be poured into the sea , a tribute to the energies of nature , as someone shouts , " I hope that 's not Shiraz ! "
You do n't have to be a pagan to join Hunters Moon , but their symbol is a combination of the moon and the horned man .
" A lot of people within the wider morris do n't like or accept its connection with the pagan , " says Ranger – but for him it is a spiritual experience .
" You are grounding yourself , partaking of yourself as a member of the human race , and partaking of the ground you 're dancing on . "
When this finishes , he will be off to work as an office manager .
" You get so detached from the natural cycle of life that it is nice to be part of events that remind you .
Forming the circle can be quite profound .
More so in a quiet place like this than if you 're in a town centre getting stick from local yobs . "
What about those black faces ?
" They 're a disguise , " he explains .
" These dances would traditionally have been done during winter by itinerant seasonal labourers who had no work and were busking for money to survive .
As they were busking before potential summer employers , or the squire , or the vicar , they did n't want to get recognised . "
That 's one theory ( another links them with Morocco , although everyone agrees it is n't racist ) .
The thing about morris dancing is that everybody thinks they know what it 's all about , but nobody really does .
The version most of us know was defined by the folklorist Cecil Sharp , who started collecting dances and tunes in 1899 , mainly from villages in the Cotswolds .
There are many local variations , from the clog - bashing of the northern industrial towns to the cross-dressing Molly Dances of East Anglia , but Sharp 's work ensured the Cotswold ' tradition became dominant .
Some accuse him of ignoring the sexual and pre-Christian elements of the dance , or cleaning it up for a genteel Edwardian audience – and many sides were sponsored by village churches , whose priests saw them as good , clean fun .
But even if he was a censor , Sharp certainly inspired a revival , with new sides being formed all over the country to dance in the Cotswold way .
Morris dancing flourished between the wars , and again during the folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s .
But now old - fashioned Cotswold morris is in decline , suffering from ageing dancers and a lack of new recruits .
Many of the 800 morris sides in the country are struggling , although they dance on , outside pubs and at festivals every weekend during the summer .
And 10 miles inland from the beach , over the downs at Wilmington , the men of Long Man Morris are dancing " Old Tom " this morning in a country lane .
Here are the hanky wavers , in their white stockings , black cord breeches , and white shirts with green - and - gold sashes .
Behind them is a field of golden rape , and beyond that the 235ft chalk giant drawn on a hill that gives the side its name .
Faces flushed from the exertion , they look like characters from a Thomas Hardy novel .
The biggest surprise is the immense skill of the dance .
For burly men to carry out such sophisticated steps for an hour or so , while getting those oversize hankies waving in perfect time , requires agility and sharp hand - to - eye co-ordination .
So , what do they think they 're up to ?
Norman Hopson , the 56 - year - old squire , is a technical manager for BT but has the no-nonsense manner of a bluff countryman .
" Some say the handkerchiefs are there to frighten away spirits , and the same for the bells , " he says .
" We say they are there to accentuate the movements . "
Nor is there anything mystical about his experience of dancing : " I see myself as a street entertainer . "

The pagans would like the giant for themselves , but Hopson 's men got there first , having been formed 30 years ago .
Hopson does n't see it as a symbol of fertility , or anything else , thank you .
" The Long Man is a local landmark , " he says .
" It 's just a carving on a hill .
I do n't think it has any further significance . "
The side 's bagman , Alan Vaughan , puts it more strongly : " We would go against that pagan idea , " he says .
" Traditionally , morris dancing has been connected with the church .
I personally have danced in Durham Cathedral . "
Long Man Morris has 20 members , all male , but it last had a new recruit two years ago .
He has still to be given the badges that mark him as a full member .
The average age is 50 , about two decades older than the next side we go in search of – Wolfshead and Vixen – two hours to the north in Kent .
Wolfshead and Vixen are extraordinary .
They are also in the pub , The Good Intent , in a less - than - idyllic part of Rochester , where they have been resting all morning since dancing in the dawn with five other sides on Bluebell Hill .
At first sight they look like a boozy , woozy gathering of the Sisters of Mercy fan club .
The Pack In Black , as they call themselves , were the first to adopt that colour alone , when they formed in 1995 .
The men are blacked - up , in black rags , but with Goth touches : joint - squire Daniel Barnet has a pair of skeletal hands around the brim of his top hat , while others wear piratical silver jewellery and mirror sunglasses .
The women are in purple lipstick , black nail varnish and black lace fingerless gloves , with chokers at their throats above bounteous pale cleavages , and flowing dresses made from lace and velvet .
Oh and big , clumpy Dr Martens boots .
" A lot of sides try to maintain a feeling for a rural tradition that just is n't there any more , " says Philip Kane , 48 , a poet and story - teller who founded Wolfshead .
" Our style is quite urban .
That 's why people respond to it . "
Some love the look , others do n't , says Diane Eva , a 55 - year - old probation officer dressed like Morticia from the Addams Family .
" We had a man call our girls – just children – whores of Babylon . "
Like Hunters Moon , their performance is based on dances that come , originally , from the borderlands between England and Wales .
Border morris was not defined as a style until the 1960s but is now the template for most of the new sides .
Wolfshead are the most radical : they do n't use many folk tunes , for example , but write their own music , often in minor keys so it is more soulful .
" The tradition has to mutate to survive , " says Hanna Irwin , who joined at 13 and is now 21 .
" It 's our heritage , but we 're putting a twist on it . "
They 're not all Goths in real life , either .
" This is a costume , " says Mel Barnet , 35 , a pharmacist .
" It 's glamorous , it 's sexy , it appeals to young people .
Waving hankies just makes them feel silly . "
One reason for the recent growth of Border morris is that it is easier to learn ( while more spectacular ) than other forms .
Another is an increase in the number of British neo-pagans , many of whom are drawn to it .
" We quite consciously work with ideas of shamanism , " says Kane .
" It 's a form of ritual theatre , a magical space embracing both dancers and audience . "
There are radical politics at work too : he sees the dance , and " neo-pagan carnivals " such as the Rochester Sweeps , as a way of resisting the " complacent nostalgia " of Englishness " founded on the detritus of imperialism , Christianity , racism and xenophobia " .
His England has more primitive , inclusive roots , and for him the morris is a way of expressing that .
Or maybe it is just street entertainment , as the Long Man traditionalists insist .
Whatever it is , or is becoming , as Wolfshead rouse themselves to dance in the street by broken glass and parked cars , I now know this about the morris : it 's no joke .
Hunters Moon
You do n't have to be pagan to be a member of Hunters Moon morris , but it must help .
Based in Eastbourne , East Sussex , they dance in the boisterous Borders style , with big sticks and lots of whoops .
Hunters Moon will appear at the Chippenham Folk Festival in Wiltshire over the second Bank Holiday weekend , with many other morris sides .
www.huntersmoonmorris.co.uk
Wolfshead and Vixen
Wolfshead and Vixen are the first Gothic morris side .
Members gather at The Good Intent pub in Rochester , Kent , where they practise .
Formed in 1995 , they bring their own sense of ritual theatre and a modern Gothic style to Borders morris .
They will appear around Kent over the summer , but their next major event is the Picnic on the Green in West Peckham , Kent , on 20 July .
They can be contacted via their page on MySpace
Long Man
Long Man Morris
Men dance for fun and to preserve the tradition , rather than for spiritual reasons .
Their style is Cotswold morris , with some local variations .
They will be appearing all over Jersey during the May Bank Holiday weekend , at the invitation of a local side .

Leading professor offers £ 10,000 to first person to prove homeopathy works
Scientists are sceptical about homeopathic treatment
One of the country 's leading professors of complementary medicine is offering a cash prize to anyone who can prove homeopathy works .
Professor Edzard Ernst says he will award £ 10,000 to the first person who can show the controversial treatment is better than a placebo in a scientifically controlled trial .
Calling on homeopaths to ' put up or shut up ' , Professor Ernst said there was still no strong evidence that the method - whose fans include Prince Charles and Hollywood celebrities - was effective .
But furious homeopaths last night attacked the prize as a ' publicity stunt ' and insisted they had ' more than enough proof ' .
Homeopathy , which was developed 200 years ago in Germany , is based on the principle that like cures like :
That an illness can be treated by substances that produce similar symptoms .
For example , it is believed onions , which make eyes itchy and tearful , can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever .
Homeopaths also believe that the greater the dilution of the medicine , the more potent the potion , and so ingredients are mixed in tiny amounts with water or alcohol .
A typical remedy could have one part of an ingredient to one trillion , trillion parts of water .
Although scientists argue the ' cures ' are so diluted they are unlikely to contain any of the original substance , homeopaths claim the water retains a ' memory ' of the active ingredient , which it passes to the body to help fight the illness .
Professor Ernst - a former homeopath himself who now researches complementary medicine at Exeter University - said 200 strictly controlled trials had failed to find any evidence that homeopathy worked .
' If you do a systematic look at all the evidence you fail to demonstrate strong evidence in favour of homeopathy , ' he added .
However , despite the lack of evidence , supporters of the treatment continue to claim there is hard proof , he said .
Some selectively pick studies that support the treatment , but ignore those that do n't , or misquote the findings of trials , or rely on flawed studies , he claimed .
Dr Simon Singh , who co-authored the book Trick or Treatment with Professor Ernst , said homeopathy only worked as a placebo .
' If homeopathy could be proven to be effective it might earn the researcher a Nobel Prize in Medicine , ' he said .
' He or she would also deserve Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics because the laws of science would need to be re-written . '
To win the money , homeopaths will need to publish evidence through the Cochrane Collaboration , a respected UK independent group which investigates medicines .
Last night , the British Homeopathic Association claimed the challenge was nothing more than a gimmick to boost sales of Professor Ernst 's book .
Dr Robert Mathie , of the BHA , said : ' What is needed is more investment in homeopathy research , not facile enticements by scientists who should know better . '

March 24 , 2004 -- “ Every civilised nation has a stake in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction ...
We ’re determined to confront those threats at the source ” , US President George Bush declared in a February 11 speech .
“ We will stop these weapons from being acquired or built .
We ’ll block them from being transferred .
We ’ll prevent them from ever being used .
One source of these weapons is dangerous and secretive regimes that build weapons of mass destruction to intimidate their neighbours and force their influence upon the world . ”
Arguing for combative new “ arms control ” measures that would further entrench the West ’s control over nuclear weapons , Bush casually repeated the now thoroughly exposed lie that the US - led war against Iraq was launched because Baghdad “ refused to disarm or account for ... illegal weapons and programs ” .
Bush used the speech to signal that Iran remains in Washington ’s gun-sights , alleging that Tehran “ is unwilling to abandon a uranium enrichment program capable of producing material for nuclear weapons ” .
Bush also demanded that North Korea “ completely , verifiably and irreversibly dismantle its nuclear programs ” .
The February 11 speech marked a new high for hypocrisy and cynicism .
It was prompted by embarrassing revelations that Washington ’s closet ally , Pakistan , has been the world ’s leading peddler of nuclear weapons technology for more than a decade — and its customers have included Iran and North Korea .
Until 2003 , Washington tolerated the activities of Pakistan ’s state - sponsored nuclear smuggling and spying rings .
US allies
Washington has never opposed “ dangerous and secretive regimes ” developing nuclear , chemical and biological weapons “ to intimidate their neighbours and force their influence upon the world ” — only those that are not US allies .
Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq developed and used its chemical weapons arsenal , and began an effort to build nuclear and biological weapons , while an ally of the US prior to 1991 .
Washington began nuclear cooperation with Iran in 1957 under its “ Atoms for Peace ” program and encouraged US corporations to sell “ dual use ” nuclear technology to the US - backed Shah of Iran ’s dictatorship .
But the most spectacular — and under - reported — example of Washington ’s support for nuclear proliferation is its dealings with Israel .
The corporate press endlessly parrots US ( and Israeli ) charges that “ weapons of mass destruction ” in the hands of Iraq , Iran , Libya and Syria pose a grave threat to peace .
However , Israel is the only state in the Middle East that possesses nuclear weapons and the delivery systems to use them anywhere in the region and beyond .
Israel is the only state in the Middle East that has considered using them , and the only state in the region that refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
It refuses to allow international inspections of its nuclear , chemical or biological facilities .
Yet Israel ’s nuclear monopoly is rarely acknowledged by the capitalist media , and is persistently covered up by Washington .
Israel may well be the world ’s fifth - largest nuclear power , ahead of Britain , and could even rival China for fourth place .
Estimates of its stockpile range from 200 to more than 400 nuclear weapons , including medium - and long - range nuclear missiles , aircraft - mounted nuclear bombs and submarine - based nuclear cruise missiles , as well as sophisticated low - blast , deadly radiation - producing ( “ neutron bombs ” ) nuclear artillery shells and even nuclear land mines .
French role
According to a 1999 research paper prepared for the US Air Force Counterproliferation Center by US army academic Warner Farr , Israel began its quest for nuclear weapons soon after its creation in 1948 .
In 1953 , Israel ’s Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ordered the development of nuclear and chemical weapons as a counter to the Arab countries ’ larger armies .
In 1956 , as quid pro quo for joining the French and British governments ’ invasion of Egypt , France agreed to supply Israel with a large “ research ” nuclear reactor .
France and Israel secretly agreed to pool their efforts to rapidly develop nuclear weapons and associated technologies , including uranium enrichment and plutonium separation .
A reactor and related facilities were secretly built underground at Dimona , in the Negev Desert near Beersheba , using the cover story that it was a “ manganese plant ” .
Hundreds of French technicians helped build it .
Ben-Gurion appeared before the Knesset on December 21 , 1960 , and lied to the world when he stated the reactor was being built “ entirely for peaceful purposes ” .
As Farr notes , the facility ’s sole purpose was to produce nuclear bombs .
The Dimona reactor began operation in 1962 .
The French - built plutonium plant within the complex began production in 1965 .
On the eve of the 1967 “ Six - Day War ” , Israel had enough plutonium to produce at least one working nuclear bomb .
According to journalist Seymour Hersh , in his 1991 book The Samson Option , after 1968 Israel was producing nuclear bombs at the rate of three to five bombs a year .
However , in 1986 , the British Sunday Times published an expert examination of data supplied by former Dimona technician Mordechai Vanunu .
It revealed that Israel possessed 200 highly sophisticated nuclear bombs .
It was estimated that Israel was producing enough plutonium to make 10 to 12 bombs a year .
( By the time Vanunu ’s revelations were published , Israeli agents had lured him to Rome , where he was drugged and shanghaied to Israel .
He was secretly tried and condemned to 18 years ’ jail , most of which has been spent in solitary confinement .
He is due to be released in April . )
US collusion
While Washington was not Israel ’s main collaborator in its first acquisition of nuclear weapons , it made a significant contribution , which has expanded over the years .
Israel ’s original nuclear scientists and technicians were trained in US universities and government weapons labs .
This cooperation continues to this day .
In 1955 , the US supplied Israel ’s Nahal Sorek research reactor , which began operation in 1960 under the Atoms for Peace program .
Farr notes that there is evidence that Israel had access to data from US nuclear tests in the 1950s and ‘ 60s .
On March 7 , Israel ’s Haaretz newspaper reported that the US provided at least six tonnes of weapons - grade uranium under Atoms for Peace .
Considering Israel ’s chronic shortage of uranium in the early years of its weapons program , some of this prized material almost certainly was diverted to Dimona .
The US also supplied Israel with heavy water .
According to British Sunday Times reporter Peter Hounam ’s 1999 book , Woman From Mossad : The Torment of Mordechai Vanunu , Dimona ’s control panels were supplied by Tracer Lab , the company that outfits US military reactors , with the knowledge of US intelligence agencies .
Hersh revealed that US President Richard Nixon ’s administration in 1971 approved the sale to Israel of hundreds of kryptons , high - speed switches used in nuclear weapons , and supercomputers used in the design of nukes .
Jane Hunter reported in the June 24 , 1994 , Middle East International that US President George Bush senior ’s regime sold at least 1500 nuclear “ dual-use ” items in Israel , in defiance of the NPT .
As Stephen Zunes of the liberal US Middle East Policy Council pointed out in a 1997 article : “ Given the enormous costs of any nuclear program of the magnitude of Israel ’s , it would have been very difficult ... without the tens of billions of dollars of direct and unrestricted American financial support .
In effect , the United States has subsidised nuclear proliferation in the Middle East . ”
However , Washington ’s greatest assistance has been to use its political and diplomatic might to shield Israel from demands that it give up its nuclear monopoly in the region .
In his 1998 book , Israel and the Bomb , Avner Cohen , an Israeli working at George Washington University ’s National Security Archive , recounted US President John Kennedy 's 1961 meeting with Ben-Gurion in New York to express Washington ’s concern that , if news of Israel ’s nuclear weapons program ever leaked , Arab states might approach the Soviet Union for nuclear weapons .
However , Kennedy did not demand that Israel abandon its effort , simply that Ben-Gurion agree that Israel will never admit in public that Israel was pursuing atomic weapons .
Ben -Gurion agreed to token annual “ inspections ” by US officials beginning in 1962 .
In return , the US would not press Israel to disarm .
This meant no detectable nuclear tests and no public threats to use nuclear weapons .
This arrangement formed the basis of Washington ’s “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy in relation to Israel ’s weapons of mass destruction , or “ nuclear ambiguity ” as it is referred to in Israel , which remains in effect to this day .
` Apartheid ’ bomb scandal
Washington even permitted the white supremacist regime in South Africa to acquire nuclear weapons with Israeli assistance .
From 1967 , Israel turned to apartheid South Africa for uranium for Dimona and access to secret facilities to test nuclear weapons and nuclear - capable medium - range missiles .
In return for this , and Israel ’s busting of economic sanctions imposed on the pariah state , the racist regime was given the “ apartheid bomb ” .
Hersh detailed how US President Jimmy Carter ’s administration remained silent when US satellites in 1977 revealed that a nuclear test site was being jointly prepared in the Kalahari Desert .
Two years later , on September 22 , 1979 , US satellites observed a joint Israeli - South African nuclear explosion in the Indian Ocean .
Washington kept silent about this disturbing atomic partnership .
In 1997 , South Africa ’s deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad and apartheid - era military chief Constand Viljoen confirmed that the racist regime had accumulated six nuclear bombs via its dirty deals with Israel .
In an unprecedented speech , a member of Israel ’s Knesset , Issam Makhoul , declared in 2000 : “ The crime of manufacturing nuclear weapons in Israel was combined with another crime , the collaboration between Israel and the neo - Nazi apartheid regime in South Africa . ”
In 1981 , Washington went even further to maintain Israel ’s nuclear monopoly in the Middle East by providing Tel Aviv with high - resolution photographs , enabling Iraq ’s incomplete Osiraq nuclear reactor to be destroyed by Israel ’s US - supplied fighter planes .
While the US publically criticised the attack , Hersh reports that in private “ [ US President Ronald Reagan ] was very satisfied ” .
A token ban on the delivery of more US jets to Israel imposed after the attack was lifted just two months later .
The US House of Representatives passed a motion endorsing the Israeli aggression and called for the US to seek the repeal of UN Security Council motion 487 , which had condemned the attack .
The December 26 Haaretz reported that “ former US president Bill Clinton promised two [ Israeli ] prime ministers , Benjamin Netanyahu [ in 1998 ] and Ehud Barak [ in 1999 ] , that the US would ensure that Middle Eastern arms control initiatives did not impair Israel ’s strategic deterrence capabilities ” .
For a nuclear - free Middle East
In Israel and the Bomb , Avner Cohen summed up the Israeli ruling class ’ frightening attitude towards fighting a nuclear war : “ [ Israel ] must be in a position to threaten another Hiroshima to prevent another holocaust . ”
According to Farr , on October 8 , 1973 , Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir , placed Israel ’s nuclear missiles and aircraft on alert during Israel ’s war with Egypt and Syria .
William Burrows and Robert Windrem , in their 1994 book Critical Mass , state that this was not the first time .
They write that in 1967 , two Israeli nuclear bombs were ready for use .
In 1985 , Israeli spy Jonathon Pollard was found to have supplied Israel with US nuclear targeting data on the location of Soviet military targets and information on Soviet air defences .
And during the 1991 Gulf War , Israel ’s nuclear weapons were primed and ready for launch throughout the 43 - day long conflict .
Supporters of Israel ’s policy claim that it requires a nuclear “ deterrent ” to dissuade attacks from the Arab and Muslim states ’ larger armies .
However , Israel long ago achieved superiority over its neighbours in terms of conventional arms thanks to decades of massive US military aid .
More recently , apologists for Israel ’s nuclear might have rested their argument on the claim that Arab countries with “ weapons of mass destruction ” surround Israel .
However , this justification has been weakened by recent events .
It is now confirmed that Iraq totally destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction at least 10 years ago .
Libya has abandoned its feeble weapons programs and Iran has agreed to international inspections of its nuclear energy facilities , which the International Atomic Energy Agency agrees are not part of a program to develop nuclear weapons .
If anything , it is Israel ’s massive arsenal of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons that drives nearby states to seek a military deterrent .
This fact is recognised in Washington , according to a report in the April 17 , 2003 , Washington Post .
Present and former US intelligence officials told the newspaper that the development of Syria ’s chemical weapons and Scud missiles were started more than 30 years ago as “ a force equaliser with the Israelis ” .
Arab and Muslim states have repeatedly urged Israel to join them in creating a WMD - free zone in the Middle East , but this has been stymied by Tel Aviv and Washington .
The 1991 UN Security Council resolution under which the US justified its invasion of Iraq included the goal of “ establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery ” .
Washington has not sought to implement that in relation to Israel .
Since 1987 , Israel has ignored at least 14 resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly and the IAEA General Conference calling on Israel to join the NPT .
In December , the General Assembly passed such a resolution by a vote of 164 - 4 , with 10 abstentions .
In December , Syria asked that a draft resolution be discussed by the UN Security Council calling for the implementation of previous resolutions “ aimed at freeing the Middle East region of all weapons of mass destruction ” and urging all Middle East states to sign international treaties forbidding the spread of WMD .
The US and Britain , permanent members of the Security Council with veto power , disregarded Syria ’s request .
“ We have been pursuing this for years because we believe it ’s the only solution for the Middle East to be truly peaceful and stable ” , Syrian government minister Bouthaina Shaaban told the December 29 Christian Science Monitor .
“ If the US decides ... to take a leading role in the Middle East and treats countries fairly , and the UN takes a strong role , then I do n’t see why Israel should not give up its nuclear weapons .
It ’s up to the international community now to say what ’s right . ”
There is even support for such a zone in the Israeli Knesset .
Haaretz reported on December 26 that United Tora Judaism MP Meir Porush stunned the chamber when he declared : “ The state of Israel should dismantle its nuclear weaponry like Libya is doing . ”
However , despite the mounting pressure , Israel ’s rulers have no intention of giving up their nuclear monopoly .
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the daily Maariv newspaper in October that Israel will not dismantle its “ special measures ” : “ Looking ahead , these things are very important ...
It is impossible to expect that the US will remain [ in the Middle East ] for ever . ”
Nor does the US intend to give up its backing for the Middle East ’s only nuclear outlaw and key strategic ally in the region .
A “ senior American official ” bluntly told the December 26 Haaretz : “ I do n’t think there will be a change in policy toward Israel in the nuclear field .
The Arabs will raise the issue , and Israeli will need to find a way to explain its policy .
But we understand that as long as Israel is facing Arab rejectionism from so many directions , the way to deal with this is via quiet discussions . ”
As Jordan ’s former UN ambassador Hasan Abu Nimah wrote in an article on the Electronic Intifada web site on January 22 , Israel ’s nuclear monopoly and Washington ’s unstinting backing for it have nothing to do with self defence .
Washington and Tel Aviv are pressing for “ the unilateral disarmament of Israel ’s adversaries , not in order to make the region safer , but simply to ensure continued Israeli military hegemony ” of the oil - rich Middle East .
Stephen Zunes notes that “ the primary concern of the United States is not the prospect of horizontal nuclear proliferation per se , but any challenge to its military hegemony in the post - Cold War world .
With [ US planners ] moving away from the prospect of a major East - West confrontation to ones involving medium - intensity warfare against Third World regional powers , the desire for a nuclear monopoly by the major powers and certain allies like Israeli becomes all the more critical . ”

T. Boone Pickens is not giving up his million dollars .
That ’s how much he had offered to pay anyone who could disprove any of the accusations the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth made against Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election – attacks Mr. Pickens , the billionaire Texas oilman , helped finance .
A group of Swift boat veterans sympathetic to Mr. Kerry sent Mr. Pickens a letter last week taking him up on the challenge .
In 12 pages , plus a 42 - page attachment of military records and other documents , they identified not just one but ten lies in the group ’s campaign against Mr. Kerry .
They offered to meet with him to provide Mr. Kerry ’s journals and videotapes from Vietnam and a copy of his full military record certified by the Navy – a key demand of Mr. Pickens and veterans who believe Mr. Kerry lied about his service to win his military decorations .
Mr. Pickens replied with a one - page letter , thanking the veterans for their research and their service , but politely saying there had been a misunderstanding .
“ Key aspects of my offer of $ 1 million have not been accurately reported , ” he wrote .
When he offered the reward at an American Spectator dinner in November , blogs sympathetic to Mr. Pickens reported that he challenged anyone to disprove “ anything ” the Swift boat group said .
In his letter , Mr. Pickens explained that his bet actually applied to only the television ads the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth bought , and not to their bestselling book or the media interviews that generated more attention than the ads themselves .
“ In reviewing your material , none of the information you provide speaks specifically to the issues contained in the ads , ” he wrote , “ and , as a result , does not qualify for the $ 1 million . ”
It was pretty much the same response he had given to Mr. Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat , who seized the challenge immediately after Mr. Pickens made it last year .
He offered more generous compliments in his letter to the veterans , and suggested that they take up their issues with John O’Neill , the founder of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
( Mr. O’Neill , who first debated Mr. Kerry about the war in Vietnam on the Dick Cavett show in 1971 , does not cede anything . )
As for this this presidential cycle , Mr. Pickens says he will not give any money to partisan causes .

Black people are 10 times more likely to be imprisoned for drug offenses than white people in the United States , according to a study conducted by the Justice Policy Institute .
Blacks and whites use illegal drugs at approximately the same rates , yet both arrest and sentencing tends to be stricter for blacks , the study found .
Researchers examined arrest and sentencing data from 198 U.S. counties with the largest populations .
Nearly all counties examined showed large racial distinctions in how drug offenders were sentenced .
This data was consistent with the findings of other studies , although prior studies have not broken down their analysis by county .
The study found that out of an estimated 19.5 million illegal drug users in the United States in 2002 , 1.5 million arrests were made and 175,000 people were imprisoned .
Fifty percent of those imprisoned were black , although only 13 percent of the U.S. ( and the U.S. drug - using ) population is black .
" What you keep seeing is this towering drug admission rate for African - Americans and a very small rate for whites , " said Jason Ziedenberg , executive director of the Justice Policy Institute .
" In many cases , the admission rate for whites is smaller than the ( percentage of whites in the ) whole population .
"
The institute said that selective policing is partly to blame for the disparity , with police departments devoting more resources to arresting purchasers and buyers in inner-city , open - air markets rather than in the suburbs , and college campuses where fewer blacks live .
In addition , research has found that probation officers tend to be more sympathetic to white offenders than to black offenders .
Officers have been found to be more likely to attribute white people 's crimes to their circumstances , and black people 's to moral failings .
In addition , the institute noted that federal mandatory minimum sentencing rules hit blacks harder , with the same jail term being given out for possessing five grams of crack ( which is disproportionately used by blacks ) as 500 grams of cocaine ( disproportionately used by whites ) .

Trucks Reduce Emissions by 83 %
May 15th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
Truck stop electrification is boosting fuel efficiency and minimizing dependence on foreign oil from idling trucks
There are 1.3 million long - haul diesel trucks with sleeper cabs in the United States , with most drivers averaging over 100,000 miles annually .
These trucks are highly affected by skyrocketing fuel prices and are dependent on foreign oil .
As the value of the dollar diminishes , transportation costs are partly to blame .
Idling Trucks Waste Fuel
Truck drivers are required to rest for 10 hours for every 11 hours of driving .
A large amount of fuel is consumed when drivers leave trucks idling to maintain comfort .
85 % of the energy is wasted sleeper cabs are heated by an idling truck .
It is even more inefficient to cool the sleeper cab , wasting 94 % of the fuel ’s energy .
Truck Stop Electrification
Truck stop electrification ( TSE ) reduces fuel use while maintaining comfort for the driver with a heating , cooling and ventilation unit that attaches to trucks through a flexible concentric hose .
Electricity , internet , and television reception are also available .
The Benefits
An impressive 83 % net emissions reduction is achieved after taking into account the electricity required to power these units .
Because most electricity is generated using domestic energy supplies , energy dollars stay closer to home .
Air quality is improved for communities near truck stops as fewer trucks idle .
Trucking companies enjoy lower fuel costs and less wear and tear on engines .
Driver comfort is increased by reducing the noise , pollution and vibration from the idling trucks , while offering more entertainment and communication options .
Now TSE manufacturers just need to figure out how to provide showers and fresh coffee through these units .

An Israeli military court ruled Tuesday that three Israeli soldiers who beat , humiliated and attached electrodes to the faces of two 17 - year old Palestinian detainees would not be demoted to the rank of private .
The two will receive a sentence of 5 months in jail , and will retain their army rank of staff sergeant when they are released .
The judge 's ruling stated , " The humiliation of helpless minors � is an ugly act which badly harms not only the immediate victims of the offense , but the army 's moral strength as well . "
But the judge ruled against a demotion of the three soldiers , stating , " such a heavy punishment does not reflect the many rights accumulated by the three during their service . "
The ruling went against an agreement made between the military prosecution and the soldiers ' attorney that the soldiers would accept a demotion in exchange for a lighter sentence .
In violation of that agreement , the judge ruled to allow both the light sentence and no demotion .
The incident in question took place in the settlement of Shavei Shomron in the occupied West Bank .
The soldiers took two teenagers who were blindfolded and handcuffed , and beat them , forced them to say phrases in Hebrew , and attached a heating electrode to the face of one of the youth .
A fellow soldier who witnessed the incident reported the three soldiers to a superior .
The three soldiers then bullied their colleague to try to get her not to testify about what she saw .
At first , she succumbed to the bullying , but eventually , she told the commander the full version of what happened .
The three soldiers will return to the field after serving their terms , and will be in command of other soldiers charged with attacking and detaining Palestinians in the Israeli - occupied West Bank .
The Indian government has tightened the screw on Canadian push - email pioneer Research In Motion ( RIM ) in the ongoing dispute over official interception of BlackBerry email .
Reports now indicate that if RIM wo n't open up its encypted messaging to Indian spooks , it wo n't be permitted to do business in the subcontinent .
According to India 's Economic Times , a meeting was held last Thursday in New Delhi between RIM representatives , the Canadian High Commission and officials from the Department of Telecoms .
“ We had a meeting [ with the DoT ] today .
It was positive .
The talks will continue , ” a RIM spokesman told the Economic Times .
However , the paper 's sources indicated that the government has become increasingly impatient with the company 's argument that it is unable to provide intercept facilities to Indian law - enforcement and intelligence personnel .
Western governments are widely believed to enjoy such access .
According to many industry experts , however , the simplest means of intercepting BlackBerry encrypted email en masse involves having access to one of RIM 's email servers , at present located in the US and UK .
It appears that RIM may be unwilling to bear the cost of putting more servers in India , and is understandably reluctant to give India remote access to existing installations .
Furthermore , it is feared that other governments might then demand the same level of access .
“ RIM does not want to bear this cost .
Ditto with service providers who offer BlackBerry services , " an unnamed industry figure told the Economic Times .
" RIM feels that if it accepts the demands of the Indian government , it will set a precedent as other countries may demand a similar arrangement , ” added the source .

Spring , which officially starts today , is starting to dissolve as a distinct season as climate change takes hold .
According to documented observations throughout 2007 and 2008 , events in the natural world that used to be key spring indicators , from the blooming of flowers to the appearance of insects , are now increasingly happening in what used to be thought of as mid-winter , as Britain 's temperatures steadily rise .
Although many people may see the changes as quaint or charming – butterflies certainly brighten up a January day – they are actually among the first concrete signs that the world is indeed set on a global warming course which is likely to prove disastrous if not checked .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In fact , the blurring of the seasons in Britain is now as serious a piece of evidence of climate change as the rapidly increasing melting of ice across the globe , in glaciers and in the land - based and marine ice sheets of the Arctic and the Antarctic .
The phenomenon shows that a whole range of organisms is already responding actively to the greatest environmental change in human history , in a way that people – and especially politicians – are not .
Last month , that shift produced its most remarkable image yet – a photograph , taken in Dorset , of a red admiral , an archetypal British summer butterfly , feeding on a snowdrop , an archetypal British winter flower .
Although that is not an event likely to cause alarm among the public , it was quite inconceivable until very recently .
It is undeniable confirmation that a profound alteration in the environment , the consequences of which are likely to prove catastrophic , is already under way .
It is happening so quickly , and without people realising its true significance , because , in Britain , the major effects of climate change are initially being felt as less cold winters , rather than as hotter summers .
That has produced a startling rise in winter temperatures in recent years , clearly visible when current monthly means are compared to the average for 1961 to 1990 .
To take the figures for last winter from the Central England Temperature Record , the world 's oldest , which dates back to 1659 : January 2007 was 3.2C warmer than the 1961 - 90 average , February was 2.0C warmer , March was 1.5C warmer , and April was 3.3C warmer .
So far this year , January has been 2.8C above the 1961 - 90 average for the month , and February , 1.6C
Those are substantial rises .
Although there is always natural variation in temperatures , recent winters taken together show a remarkable warming trend .
It has meant that many of what used to be thought of as the traditional signs of spring are happening very much earlier , causing primroses , for example , spring flowers par excellence , to bloom in some parts of the country as early as November .
Other traditional spring plants , such as dog's mercury and the lesser celandine ( a favourite of Wordsworth 's ) can be seen in January rather than March .
And in what is perhaps an even more vivid change , dandelions and daisies , which used to come into flower in spring on lawns ( where they were permitted ) , now flower in many places all winter long .
Insects are responding similarly .
A number of butterflies that overwinter as hibernating adults can now be seen in January rather than March or April , including the peacock and the comma , and especially the red admiral .
This last species used to be a spring migrant from the Continent but , in the recent warmer winters , it has begun to overwinter here .
Bumblebees have similarly become visible in mid-winter , and frogspawn , usually laid about March , can be seen in December in the South - west and south Wales .
The changes and many others have been monitored in detail because in Britain there has been a renewal of the old discipline of phenology , or the study of the timings of natural events , which was favoured by the Victorians but largely abandoned by the 1950s .
It has been revived by an environmental statistician , Dr Tim Sparks from the Monks Wood wildlife research centre near Huntingdon , part of the Government 's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology ( CEH ) .
Dr Sparks set up the UK Phenology Network , which has been taken over by the Woodland Trust , a charity which runs it in partnership with CEH as Nature 's Calendar , with 40,000 people from all over Britain contributing records .
" We do have problems now recording some of what used to be signs of spring , " Dr Sparks said last night .
" For example , we used to record the first grass cutting of the year .
But in many places now grass grows all year round and so it has to be cut all year round . "
Until 1947 , said Dr Sparks , the Royal Meteorological Society used to produce an annual Phenological Report , the front - page logo of which was a song thrush singing against a background of hazel catkins .
" A major sign of spring used to be the first time a song thrush was heard singing , " he said .
" But now song thrushes can be heard all through the winter , and hazel catkins can be found in December to January , rather than in January to February . "
The shift was largely a phenomenon of southern Britain , he said , and traditional spring signs were still likely to be seen in Scotland .
In southern England , oak leaves are sprouting 26 days before they did in 1950 , while swallows , house sparrows , great tits and robins are laying their eggs a week earlier on average .
Poppies are a fortnight ahead of where they used to be , and stinging nettles 10 days ahead .
Last April , the earliest - ever emergence dates were recorded for 11 species of butterfly : the speckled wood , for instance , was seen in January , seven weeks earlier than ever before .
The irony of course , is that the first days of spring 2008 are likely to be startlingly cold .
But not withstanding the predicted Easter snap , there can be no doubt that spring has already sprung .

There are many causes that require charitable donations , so many that it is impossible to determine which ones to take seriously .
With unprecedented disparity between rich and poor , many at the lower end of the economic spectrum survive off handouts from the well off .
The media industry is no different , and small companies are under threat from corporate conglomerates that can outspend them by millions of dollars .
Responsible and independent outlets have been replaced by ratings driven news media , creating a serious crisis in public awareness and knowledge .
They need outside help , and can only survive because of it .

LONG neglected by development experts , there is now growing enthusiasm over the role that remittances play in shifting wealth to poor countries .
This is partly because of a greater awareness of the scale of the flow .
Some 200 m people are thought to be migrants and many of them send cash to relatives back home .
For some small countries , such as Moldova , repatriated funds account for a large share of GDP , and even for bigger countries , such as Mexico , the billions of dollars received are roughly as sizeable as foreign direct investment .
Rich countries , too , with many migrants abroad , benefit from large flows of remittances .
Some doubt their efficacy , noting that most funds are quickly consumed by recipients rather than invested , but their role in cutting poverty is significant .

Invariably , learning about REST means that you ’ll end up wondering just how applicable the concept really is for your specific scenario .
And given that you ’re probably used to entirely different architectural approaches , it ’s only natural that you start doubting whether REST , or rather RESTful HTTP , really works in practice , or simply breaks down once you go beyond introductory , “ Hello , World ” - level stuff .
In this article , I will try to address 10 of the most common doubts people have about REST when they start exploring it , especially if they have a strong background in the architectural approach behind SOAP / WSDL - based Web services .
1. REST may be usable for CRUD , but not for “ real ” business logic
This is the most common reaction I see among people who are skeptical about REST benefits .
After all , if all you have is create / read / update / delete , how can you possibly express more complicated application semantics ?
I have tried to address some of these concerns in the introductory article of this series , but this point definitely merits closer discussion .
First of all , the HTTP verbs - GET , PUT , POST , and DELETE - do not have a 1:1 mapping to the CRUD database operations .
For example , both POST and PUT can be used to create new resources : they differ in that with PUT , it ’s the client that determines the resource ’s URI ( which is then updated or created ) , whereas a POST is issued to a “ collection ” or “ factory ” resource and it ’s the server ’s task to assign a URI .
But anyway , back to the question : how do you handle more complex business logic ?
Any computation calc ( a , b ) that returns a result c can be transformed into a URI that identifies its result — e.g. x = calc ( 2,3 ) might become http://example.com/calculation?a=2&b=3 .
At first , this seems like a gross misuse of RESTful HTTP — are n’t we supposed to use URIs to identify resources , not operations ?
Yes , but in fact this is what we do : http://example.com/sum?augend=2&addend=3
identifies a resource , namely the result of adding 2 and 3 .
And in this particular ( obviously contrived ) example , using a GET to retrieve the result might be a good idea — after all , this is cacheable , you can reference it , and computing it is probably safe and not very costly .
Of course in many , if not most cases , using a GET to compute something might be the wrong approach .
Remember that GET is supposed to be a “ safe ” operation , i.e. the client does not accept any obligations ( such as paying you for your services ) or assume any responsibility , when all it does is follow a link by issuing a GET .
In many other cases , it ’s therefore more reasonable to provide input data to the server so that it can create a new resource via POST .
In its response , the server can indicate the URI of the result ( and possibly issue a redirect to take you there ) .
The result is then re-usable , can be bookmarked , can be cached when it ’s retrieved … you can basically extend this model to any operation that yields a result — which is likely to be every one you can think of .
2 . There is no formal contract / no description language
From RPC to CORBA , from DCOM to Web Services we ’re used to having an interface description that lists the operations , their names , and the types of their input and output parameters .
How can REST possibly be usable without an interface description language ?
There are three answers to this very frequently asked question .
First of all , if you decide to use RESTful HTTP together with XML — a very common choice — the whole world of XML schema languages , such as DTDs , XML Schema , RELAX NG or Schematron are still available to you .
Arguably , 95 % of what you usually describe using WSDL is not tied to WSDL at all , but rather concerned with the XML Schema complex types you define .
The stuff WSDL adds on top is mostly concerned with operations and their names — and describing these becomes pretty boring with REST ’s uniform interface :
After all , GET , PUT , POST and DELETE are all the operations you have .
With regards to the use of XML Schema , this means that you can use your favorite data binding tool ( if you happen to have one ) to generate data binding code for your language of choice , even if you rely on a RESTful interface .
( This is not an entirely complete answer , see below . )
Secondly , ask yourself what you need a description for .
The most common — albeit not the only — use case for having some description is to generate stubs and skeletons for the interface you ’re describing .
It is usually not documentation , since the description in e.g. WSDL format tells you nothing about the semantics of an operation — it just lists a name .
You need some human - readable documentation anyway to know how to call it .
In a typical REST approach , what you would provide is documentation in HTML format , possibly including direct links to your resources .
Using the approach of having multiple representations , you might actually have self - documenting resources — just do an HTTP GET on a resource from your browser and get an HTML document containing data as well as a list of the operations ( HTTP verbs ) you can perform on it and the content types it accepts and delivers .
Finally , if you insist on using a description language for your RESTful service , you can either use the Web Application Description Language ( WADL ) or — within limitations — WSDL 2.0 , which according to its authors is able to describe RESTful services , too .
Neither WADL nor WSDL 2 are useful for describing hypermedia , though — and given that this is one of the core aspects of REST , I ’m not at all sure they ’re sufficiently useful .
3 . Who would actually want to expose so much of their application ’s implementation internals ?
Another common concern is that resources are too low - level , i.e. an implementation detail one should not expose .
After all , wo n’t this put the burden of using the resources to achieve something meaningful on the client ( the consumer ) ?
The short answer is : No .
The implementation of a GET , PUT or any of the other methods on a resource can be just as simple or complicated as the implementation of a “ service ” or RPC operation .
Applying REST design principles does not mean you have to expose individual items from your underlying data model — it just means that instead of exposing your business logic in an operation - centric way , you do so in a data - centric way .
A related concern is that not enabling direct access to resources will increase security .
This is based on an old fallacy known as “ security by obscurity ” , and one can argue that in fact it ’s the other way round :
By hiding which individual resources you access in your application - specific protocol , you can no longer easily use the infrastructure to protect them .
By assigning individual URIs to meaningful resources , you can e.g. use Apache ’s security rules ( as well as rewriting logic , logging , statistics etc. ) to work differently for different resources .
By making these explicit , you do n’t decrease , you increase your security .
4. REST works with HTTP only , it ’s not transport protocol independent
First of all , HTTP is most emphatically not a transport protocol , but an application protocol .
It uses TCP as the underlying transport , but it has semantics that go beyond it ( otherwise it would be of little use ) .
Using HTTP as a mere transport is abusing it .
Secondly , abstraction is not always a good idea .
Web services take the approach of trying to hide many very different technologies under a single abstraction layer — but abstractions tend to leak .
For example , there is a huge difference between sending a message via JMS or as an HTTP request .
Trying to dumb widely different options down to their least common denominator serves no - one .
An analogy would be to create a common abstraction that hides a relational database and a file system under a common API .
Of course this is doable , but as soon as you address aspects such as querying , the abstraction turns into a problem .
Finally , as Mark Baker once coined : “ Protocol independence is a bug , not a feature ” .
While this may seem strange at first , you need to consider that true protocol independence is impossible to achieve — you can only decide to depend on a different protocol that may or may not be on a different level .
Depending on a widely accepted , officially standardized protocol such as HTTP is not really a problem .
This is especially true if it is much more wide - spread and supported than the abstraction that tries to replace it .
5 . There is no practical , clear & consistent guidance on how to design RESTful applications
There are many aspects of RESTful design where there are no “ official ” best practices , no standard way on how to solve a particular problem using HTTP in a way conforming to the REST principles .
There is little doubt that things could be better .
Still , REST embodies many more application concepts than WSDL / SOAP - based web services .
In other words : while this criticism has a lot of value to it , it ’s far more relevant for the alternatives ( which basically offer you no guidance at all ) .
Occasionally , this doubt comes up in the form of “ even the REST experts can’t agree how to do it ” .
In general , that ’s not true — for example , I tend to believe that the core concepts I described here a few weeks ago have n’t been ( nor will they be ) disputed by any member of the REST community ( if we can assume there is such a thing ) , not because it ’s a particularly great article , but simply because there is a lot of common understanding once people have learned a little more than the basics .
If you have any chance to try out an experiment , try whether it ’s easier to get five SOA proponents to agree on anything than trying to get five REST proponents to do so .
Based on past experience and long participation in several SOA and REST discussion groups , I ’d tend to bet my money on the REST folks .
6. REST does not support transactions
The term “ transaction ” is quite overloaded , but in general , when people talk about transactions , they refer to the ACID variety found in databases .
In an SOA environment — whether based on web services or HTTP only — each service ( or system , or web app ) implementation is still likely to interact with a database that supports transactions : no big change here , except you ’re likely to create the transaction explicitly yourself ( unless your service runs in an EJB container or another environment that handles the transaction creation for you ) .
The same is true if you interact with more than one resource .
Things start to differ once you combine ( or compose , if you prefer ) transactions into a larger unit .
In a Web services environment , there is at least an option to make things behave similarly to what people are used to from 2 PC scenarios as supported e.g. in a Java EE environment : WS - Atomic Transaction ( WS - AT ) , which is part of the WS - Coordination family of standards .
Essentially , WS - AT implements something very similar or equal to the 2 PC protocol specified by XA .
This means that your transaction context will be propagated using SOAP headers , and your implementation will take care of ensuring the resource managers hook into an existing transaction .
Essentially , the same model in EJB developer is used to — your distributed transaction behaves just as atomically as a local one .
There are lots of things to say about , or rather against , atomic transactions in an SOA environment :
Loose coupling and transactions , especially those of the ACID variety , simply do n’t match .
The very fact that you are co-ordinating a commit across multiple independent systems creates a pretty tight coupling between them .
Being able to do this co-ordination requires central control over all of the services — it ’s very unlikely , probably impossible to run a 2 PC transaction across company boundaries
The infrastructure required to support this is usually quite expensive and complicated .
For the most part , the need for ACID transactions in a SOA or REST environment is actually a design smell — you ’ve likely modeled your services or resources the wrong way .
Of course , atomic transactions are just one type of transaction — there are extended transaction models that might be a better match for loosely - coupled systems .
They have n’t seen much adoption yet , though — not even in the Web services camp .
7. REST is unreliable
It ’s often pointed out that there is no equivalent to WS - ReliableMessaging for RESTful HTTP , and many conclude that because of this , it ca n’t be applied where reliability is an issue ( which translates to pretty much every system that has any relevance in business scenarios ) .
But very often what you want is not necessarily some infrastructure component that handles message delivery ; rather , you need to know whether a message has been delivered or not .
Typically , receiving a response message — such as a simple 200 OK in case of HTTP — means that you know your communication partner has received the request .
Problems occur when you do n’t receive a response :
You do n’t know whether your request has never reached the others side , or whether it has been received ( resulting in some processing ) and it ’s the response message that got lost .
The simplest way to ensure the request message reaches the other side is to re-send it , which is of course only possible if the receiver can handle duplicates ( e.g. by ignoring them ) .
This capability is called idempotency .
HTTP guarantees that GET , PUT and DELETE are idempotent — and if your application is implemented correctly , a client can simply re-issue any of those requests if it has n’t received a response .
A POST message is not idempotent , though — at least there are no guarantees in the HTTP spec that say it is .
You are left with a number of options :
You can either switch to using PUT ( if your semantics can be mapped to it ) , use a common best practice described by Joe Gregorio , or adopt any of the existing proposals that aim to standardize this ( such as Mark Nottingham ’s POE , Yaron Goland ’s SOA - Rity , or Bill de hÓra ’s HTTPLR ) .
Personally , I prefer the best - practice approach — i.e. , turn the reliability problem into an application design aspect , but opinions on this differ quite a bit .
While any of these solutions address a good part of the reliability challenge , there is nothing — or at least , nothing that I ’m aware of — that would support delivery guarantees such as in - order delivery for a sequence of HTTP requests and responses .
It might be worth pointing out , though , that many existing SOAP / WSDL scenarios get by without WS - Reliable Messaging or any of its numerous predecessors , too .
8 . No pub / sub support
REST is fundamentally based on a client - server model , and HTTP always refers to a client and a server as the endpoints of communication .
A client interacts with a server by sending requests and receiving responses .
In a pub / sub model , an interested party subscribes to a particular category of information and gets notified each time something new appears .
How could pub / sub be supported in a RESTful HTTP environment ?
We do n’t have to look far to see a perfect example of this : it ’s called syndication , and RSS and Atom Syndication are examples of it .
A client queries for new information by issuing an HTTP against a resource that represents the collection of changes , e.g. for a particular category or time interval .
This would be extremely inefficient , but is n’t , because GET is the most optimized operation on the Web .
In fact , you can easily imagine that a popular weblog server would have scale up much more if it had to actively notify each subscribed client individually about each change .
Notification by polling scales extremely well .
You can extend the syndication model to your application resources — e.g. , offer an Atom feed for changes to customer resources , or an audit trail of bookings .
In addition to being able to satisfy a basically unlimited number of subscribing applications , you can also view these feeds in a feed reader , similarly to viewing a resource ’s HTML representation in your browser .
Of course , this is not a suitable answer for some scenarios .
For example , soft realtime requirements might rule this option out , and another technology might be more appropriate .
But in many cases , the mixture of loose coupling , scalability and notification enabled by the syndication model is an excellent fit .
9 . No asynchronous interactions
Given HTTP ’s request / response model , how can one achieve asynchronous communication ?
Again , we have to be aware that there are multiple things people mean when they talk about asynchronicity .
Some refer to the programming model , which can be blocking or non-blocking independently of the wire interactions .
This is not our concern here .
But how do you deliver a request from a client ( consumer ) to the server ( provider ) where the processing might take a few hours ?
How does the consumer get to know the processing is done ?
HTTP has a specific response code , 202 ( Accepted ) , the meaning of which is defined as “ The request has been accepted for processing , but the processing has not been completed . ”
This is obviously exactly what we ’re looking for .
Regarding the result , there are multiple options :
The server can return a URI of a resource which the client can GET to access the result ( although if it has been created specifically due to this request , a 201 Created would probably be better ) .
Or the client can include a URI that it expects the server to POST the result to once it ’s done .
10 . Lack of tools
Finally , people often complain about the lack of tools available to support RESTful HTTP development .
As indicated in item # 2 , this is not really true for the data aspect — you can use all of the data binding and other data APIs you are used to , as this is a concern that ’s orthogonal to the number of methods and the means of invoking them .
Regarding plain HTTP and URI support , absolutely every programming language , framework and toolkit on the planet supports them out of the box .
Finally , vendors are coming up with more and more ( supposedly ) easier and better support for RESTful HTTP development in their frameworks , e.g. Sun with JAX - RS ( JSR 311 ) or Microsoft with the REST support in .NET 3.5 or the ADO.
NET Data Services Framework .
Conclusion
So : Is REST , and its most common implementation , HTTP , perfect ?
Of course not .
Nothing is perfect , definitely not for every scenario , and most of the time not even for a single scenario .
I ’ve completely ignored a number of very reasonable problem areas that require more complicated answers , for example message - based security , partial updates and batch processing , and I solemnly promise to address these in a future installment .
I still hope I could address some of the doubts you have — and if I ’ve missed the most important ones , you know what the comments are for .

The 5 Worst Reassurances in Tech History
Ever since educational radio broadcasting pioneer Mary Somerville assured listeners that “ Television wo n’t last .
It ’s a flash in the pan ” , gadget gurus have been spectacularly wrong – especially when they have a stake in the issue .
Here we look at five fabulously false assurances made with the best of intentions , the benefit of experience , and less accuracy than a horoscope translated by a barking dog .
1 . “ Thanks to the enthusiastic consumer response to the N - Gage QD and our latest titles , we ’re confident that our success in leading the mobile gaming world will continue ”
Ilkka Raiskinen , Nokia ’s Senior Vice President of Games .
If ever there was proof that gaming executives live in a psychotically self - delusional world that makes the Nixon Administration look like a preschool fingerpainting group , it ’s this statement .
The N - Gage was , is , and ( barring support from Jesus Christ Returned ) always will be a joke in the gaming industry .
The above quote is from a press release from Nokia in September 2004 , celebrating the shipping of their millionth console .
Note the vital word “ shipping ” instead of “ sale ” – Nokia has a habit of acting proud of how many units they build when nobody wants to buy them , which most businesses regard as a “ bad thing . ”
Worse , this is the second time they ’d tried this with the N - Gage – they claimed that four hundred thousand decks had sold in the first fortnight after the systems launch .
They ’d actually only sold six thousand .
That is n’t just bad – that ’ absolutely , staggeringly , face - breakingly bad – so bad that Gamestop and EB started refunding buyers $ 100 per unit three days later .
Understand : this console did so badly that stores refunded money because its entire existence was broken .
The above quote is doubly tragic as it celebrates the N - Gage QD , which was released only six months after the original N - Gage .
When you release an upgrade that quickly you ’re admitting how crappily made the predecessor was , and the original N - Gage was so full of design flaws it seemed to have been built by somebody who ’d heard people talking about a Game Boy in an elevator once but had never actually seen one .
But most people had already utterly dismissed the system , and most of the “ enthusiastic consumers ” never even heard of the QD .
2. Segway to be “ as big a deal as the PC ”
Steve Jobs , who you might have heard of .
This incredible assurance , reported in no less a publication than Time magazine , was typical of the hyper - hype leading up to the release of the Segway .
Pundits and professionals built it up so high the makers used the Empire State building as a footrest , and it became pretty clear that if the cure for cancer was announced on December 3rd 2001 it would have had to wait until Segway Incorporated were finished talking .
Considering the real - world reaction to the “ revolutionary ” product , we can only conclude the preview model Steve Jobs and others were exposed to was coated in LSD - and - sugar frosting .
The fact remains that the Segway should succeed – it ’s a way of getting around cities without having to find a bloody Hummer - sized space somewhere , it features excellent engineering and ingenious innovations .
It Just .
Looks .
Stupid .
The “ cool factor ” cannot be guaranteed ( and if anything could have been , it would have been this homophonous human - helper ) and when the collective “ Hot or Not ? ” verdict came in , it came in the form of ten thousand identical stand - up comic jokes .
Segway Incorporated are still in it for the long haul , researching and releasing improved versions which address every technical issue they find – and simply hoping that people get over themselves and get on the damn thing before the Segway HT is sent to play with the Sinclair C5 .
3 . “ Our consumers , who are utilizing PSP as a video player more than ever , are thirsting for more content , particularly short - form videos ”
Phil Rosenberg , senior vice president of sales and business development , Sony Computer Entertainment America .
Another case of PR - speak that ’s absolutely true as far as it goes and not one micron further .
For example : if all five Atari Lynx users were to start using their antique handsets as bookends , then it may be that “ Atari Lynx consumers are using their system as literary devices more than ever , ” but that still does n’t mean that there are very many or that it ’s a good idea .
UMD Movies have been an unmitigated failure , with even Walmart refusing to stock them anymore – and I do n’t know if you ’ve noticed , but those guys sell everything .
Most of the failure can be attributed directly to Sony .
As per usual they just assumed that people would buy their product ( apparently suffering from amnesia after the Betamax and Minidisc ) and immediately set about crippling their own product to safeguard all the money they were about to earn .
You ca n’t playback UMD movies on a TV because then you would n’t buy a DVD , and then a Blu-ray .
Sony really did expect you to buy every movie three times and were genuinely shocked when users got upset about that .
No blank discs or recorders are available in order to prevent piracy – and I ’m sure that move delayed the pirates cracking UMD discs by three , maybe four whole minutes .
While simultaneously and permanently crippling the entire user base .
The piracy issue went from bad to embarrassingly stupid when it was revealed that not only could games easily by copied onto the PSP memory stick , but they actually worked FASTER than when on the stupid official UMD discs .
Ouch !
The only growth industry in UMD movies is one Sony did n’t want , a market in Japanese porn movies .
Sony described this “ highly undesirable ” , possibly forgetting that adult videos were a big part of why VHS flattened them way back when .
Though why anybody would want to watch porn on a screen where they have to squint to see anything , other than to authentically recreate that “ voyeur ” feeling , it unclear .
4 . “ We are delighted that the HD DVD format has been independently endorsed by Paramount Pictures , Universal Pictures , New Line Cinema , and Warner Bros. Studios . ”
Mr. Tadashi Okamura , President and CEO of Toshiba Corporation .
The HD - DVD : silver medalist the most recent format war , a contest where everybody except gold is taken out back and shot through the head .
It seemed that HD - DVD was off to a flying start – that quote contains some very big names and it was the truth and nothing but the truth .
That just leaves a little thing called “ the whole truth ” , and that ’s where things get interesting .
There are lots of other big names which had pledged Blu - Ray allegiance , like Walt Disney , 20th Century Fox , Buena Vista pictures – and strangely enough Sony Pictures seemed unwilling to produce HD - DVDs .
The stage was set for a pitched battle that could have rocked the ages except for one tiny thing – the customers just did n’t care .
Big business seemed genuinely confused that the peons were n’t lining up , pleading for the chance to buy all their movies again in a slightly different , more expensive format .
Frothing technical analyses raged back and forth across the web starkly ignorant of the fact that unless you ’re a T800 armed with a precision microscope there is absolutely no difference between Blu - Ray and HD - DVD .
In fact , for regular humans , both have to work very hard to prove there ’s anything wrong with the DVDs we already own and “ Because the people selling the new things say so ” does n’t cut it .
Realizing that they ’d thrown a war and nobody was coming Warner Bros took decisive action .
The increasingly expensive and pointless conflict did n’t have to be “ won ” , it had to be OVER and as quickly as possible .
In January 2008 they ended it in the form of a massive , WB - logoed dagger in HD - DVDs back by jumping to the Blu - Ray camp .
From that point on HD - DVD was a fast - motion recreation of the Titanic with extra ice , and a month later Toshiba raised the surrender flag .
5 . “ We will make every necessary resource available to ensure a successful launch . ”
Carl Freer , Co-founder and Chairman , Gizmondo .
When Carl said that , he was n’t messing around .
Elite London launch offices , an entire agency of beautiful models , wrecked Ferarris and the Swedish Mafia – that ’s not just a console launch , that ’s a James Bond movie .
The Gizmondo company , for those of you not already laughing at the memory , became synonymous with “ utterly insane spending ” and it was only a “ successful launch ” in the same way Waterworld was a “ successful money - making movie . ”
The company went bankrupt after racking up well over three hundred million dollars in losses while selling less than twenty - five thousand units .
To put that in perspective , they could have achieved greater sales with lower costs by writing “ Gizmondo ” on cardboard boxes containing ten thousand dollars each and just giving them out on street corners .
( CNN ) -- Hillary Clinton on Wednesday reiterated her vow to stay in the Democratic presidential race , but she said it would be a " terrible mistake " for her supporters to vote for John McCain over Barack Obama .
Sen .
Hillary Clinton vowed to stay in the race , saying she 's " not going anywhere . "
" Anybody who has ever voted for me or voted for Barack has much more in common in terms of what we want to see happen in our country and in the world with the other than they do with John McCain , " Clinton said on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
" I 'm going to work my heart out for whoever our nominee is .
Obviously , I 'm still hoping to be that nominee , but I 'm going to do everything I can to make sure that anyone who supported me ... understands what a grave error it would be not to vote for Sen. Obama . "
Clinton was responding to a question from a CNN iReporter who asked why she thought so many of her supporters would choose McCain over Obama .
Watch the question
Exit polls out of West Virginia indicate that only 36 percent of Clinton 's supporters would vote for Obama if he were the nominee .
A bare majority of Obama 's voters said they would vote for Clinton over McCain .
In response to Clinton 's comments , Republican National Committee Spokesman Alex Conant issued a statement :
" Just as Sen . Clinton herself has questioned Obama 's qualifications to be president and enact change , so do many of her supporters .
The biggest mistake would be to raise taxes and prematurely withdraw from Iraq like Clinton and Obama have proposed , " he said .
Clinton trounced Obama on Tuesday , carrying West Virginia by a 41 - point margin .
Because she trails him in pledged delegates , in superdelegates and in the popular vote , she 's faced calls to drop out of the race .
Despite her campaign being more than $ 20 million in the red , Clinton confirmed that she plans to keep going .
" I 'm not going anywhere except to Kentucky and Oregon and Montana and South Dakota and Puerto Rico , " she said .
Watch what Clinton says about the road ahead »
Those five contests round out the primary season , which ends June 3 .
Kentucky and Oregon hold primaries Tuesday .
Clinton expected to do well in Kentucky , but Obama is the favorite to carry Oregon .
Clinton has continued to do better than Obama with the white working - class voters , and Obama continues to get more than 90 percent of the black vote .
The racial gap has become a key issue in the media , but Clinton said she regrets " people exploding an issue like that . "
" It 's offensive .
I think people vote for me because they think I 'd be the better president .
I think people vote for him because they think he'd be the better president .
...
That 's the way it 's supposed to be . "
Watch the full interview »
Clinton drew criticism last week for comments she made to USA Today about having a broader appeal to white voters .
" There was just an [ Associated Press ] article posted that found how Sen .
Obama 's support among working , hard - working Americans , white Americans , is weakening again , and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me , " she told the paper .
" I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on , " she added .
New York Rep. Charlie Rangel , a Clinton supporter , said " that was the dumbest thing she could have said . "
Clinton conceded Wednesday that " he 's probably right . "
" Obviously , I have worked very hard to get the votes of everyone , and I have campaigned hard .
I understand that we 've got to put together a broad coalition in order to win in the fall .
... I know Sen. Obama has worked hard to reach out to every community and constituency , " she said .
Clinton said the Democrats will have a unified party once they have a nominee , but she shied away from the idea of a joint ticket , saying talks about it would be " premature . "
Obama said the same thing while campaigning in Cape Girardeau , Missouri , on Tuesday .
" Sen . Clinton is still competing ; we have n't resolved this nomination ; I have n't won the nomination yet , " he said .
" I 'm not going to talk about vice president this or vice president that until I 've actually won .
It would be presumptuous of me to pretend like I 've already won and start talking about who my vice president 's going to be . "
Asked how she 's able to keep campaigning each day , Clinton said that something always happens that lifts her spirits .
" A lot of the people who have worked their hearts out for me in this primary season , they 're not quitters in their own lives , " she said .
" It 's been a privilege and an honor to have met so many Americans , been to so many of the beautiful places in this country , and I feel like I 'm doing it for the right reasons . "
Clinton teared up as she described what she called " one of the most incredibly gratifying experiences " of her life : having her 28 - year - old daughter , Chelsea , campaigning for her .
" She is an exceptional person , and she 's worked so hard , and she 's done such a good job that I 'm just filled with pride every time I look at her , " she said .
" She 's doing it because she 's my daughter , but she 's doing it because , as she says , she 's a young American who cares about our future . "

Kucinich : Demand that Congress Issue Subpoenas for Continuity of Government Plans
Congressman Kucinich – who is leading the charge for impeachment – says that the American people must pressure Congress every day to get to find out about continuity of government ( COG ) .
If you do n’t know what COG is , read this .
Kucinich said Congress has tried to find out whether COG plans implemented on 9/11 are still in effect , and what those plans are , but the White House has stonewalled .
He suggests that Americans demand that congress issue subpoenas to determine whether COG plans are currently in effect , and to find out what ’s in the documents .
This is the only way we ’ll find out .
John Conyers has been issuing subpoenas on other issues , which may be important .
However , what could be more important for Congress than determining whether or not the Constitution is still the controlling document for our country ?
What could be more important for Congress than determining whether COG planning documents strip Congress of its power , and give sole power to the executive branch ?
Demand that congress issue subpoenas and — more importantly — hold everyone subpoenaed person — including Buch , Cheney , Mukasey , Chertoff , etc. — in contempt ( and throw them in jail ! ) if they do n’t respond .

Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a low - power microchip which uses 30,000 times less power in sleep mode and 10 times less in active mode than similar chips now on the market .
Named the Phoenix Processor , it is intended for use in cutting - edge sensor - based devices such as medical implants , environment monitors , and surveillance equipment .

In the future , sensors may be implanted in our bodies to measure blood - glucose levels of diabetics or retinal pressure in glaucoma patients .
In practical terms , the chips would have to both be very small and use long - lasting batteries of a similar small size ; however this combination is not commercially accessible today .
Phoenix measures one square millimetre .
The major accomplishment is that the Phoenix is the same size as its thin - film battery .
Current chips are one square millimetre and smaller , but require a significantly larger battery because of their power consumption .
In most cases , batteries are much larger than the processors they power , severely increasing the size and cost of the entire system , said David Blaauw , a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in the University of Michigan .
For example , the battery in a laptop computer is roughly 5,000 times larger than the processor and it offers only a few hours of power .

The Phoenix chip consumes just 30 picowatts during sleep mode .
A picowatt is one - trillionth of a watt .
In theory , the energy used for a watch battery is equivalent to operate the Phoenix for 263 years .
“ Low power consumption allows us to reduce battery size and thereby overall system size .
Our system , including the battery , is projected to be 1,000 times smaller than the smallest known sensing system today , ” Blaauw said .
“ It could allow for a host of new sensor applications . ”
A group of University of Michigan researchers is integrating the Phoenix into biomedical sensors to monitor eye pressure in glaucoma patients .
Engineers imagine that chips like these could also be spread around to create an almost undetectable sensor network to monitor air and water or detect movement .
It could be incorporated into concrete to sense the structural integrity of new buildings and bridges .
It could also power a robust pacemaker that could obtain more comprehensive readings of a patient ’s health .
To attain such low power , Phoenix engineers focused on sleep mode , where sensors can spend more than 99 percent of their lives .
Sensors operate momentarily to handle computation at frequent intervals .
When the system defaults to sleep a low - power timer works as an alarm clock on perpetual snooze activating Phoenix every ten minutes for 1/10th of a second to run a set of 2,000 instructions .
The list is comprised of examining the sensor for new data , processing it , compressing it into short - hand , and storing it before going back to sleep .
The timer is not an atomic clock , but is keeps time to 10 minutes plus or minus a few tenths of a second .
A unique power gate design is a key component of the sleep process .
Power gates impede the electric current from certain sections of a chip not crucial for memory during sleep .
In normal state - of - the - art chips , power gates are wide with low resistance to allow as much electric current to flow when the device is switched on .
These chips wake up promptly and process rapidly , but a considerable amount of electric current leaks during sleep mode .
To overcome this performance issue , the Michigan team amplified the chip ’s operating voltage , boosting the baseline power by nearly 20 percent when the chip is in operation .
However Phoenix still functions at 0.5 Volts , compared to the 1 to 1.2 Volts that are required by conventional chips .
TFOT has previously written about the MIT team who developed an energy efficient microchip that significantly decreases microchip energy consumption to one tenth of the current rates .
You can also check out our article about ultra small switches measuring about one tenth the size of a human hair , which may eventually be used in small consumer devices .
This technology may provide homes and offices with an optical fiber connection that would allow high speed delivery of data such as music files , games , and videos .

A little - noticed civil lawsuit in Florida is shining a light on an unusual but hugely profitable Pentagon contract to ship millions of gallons of aviation fuel to U.S. bases in Iraq through the kingdom of Jordan .
The deal involves a cast of influential characters , including the king of Jordan ’s brother - in - law , who is suing Harry Sargeant III , a top Florida - based fundraiser for Sen.
John McCain 's presidential bid .
Al - Saleh alleges in the lawsuit that after he arranged the deal , he was cut out in a scheme meant to defraud him .
He claims that he and Sargeant and the third partner , Mustafa Abu - Naba'a , a Jordanian businessman , had invested in IOTC Jordan in 2004 .
But , he says , Sargeant and Abu - Naba 'a committed fraud by forming another company called IOTC USA in Florida without informing him and by channeling the Pentagon contracts through that firm .
Al - Saleh is suing Sargeant , Abu Naba ’a and the company for $ 13 million as his share of the profit from the 2005 contract , plus an unspecified amount of profit from the 2007 contract .

… if you can't read the word California ?
And how can you ( despite the above ) read the word California anyway , when you 're expecting to see instances of it ?
I 'm reporting here on a real case , that of my late partner Jacques Transue , who exhibited just this configuration of ( in ) abilities .
Such extremely selective ability constitutes a paradox of neurology ( neurolinguistic division ) , of the sort that Oliver Sacks delights in .
The key idea is some sort of cognitive split between what we know , or are able to do , EXPLICITLY , and what 's there IMPLICITLY .
Background : I meant to post about this material last summer , when I read Sacks 's piece in the New Yorker on amnesiac Clive Wearing ( now in his book Musicophilia ) and Ramachandran 's Brief Tour of Human Consciousness .
I lost several days in recollective despair about Jacques .
( Jacques died in June 2003 ; yesterday was his death day . )
I then worked on sprucing up my my material on Jacques — what can I say , I 'm an academic , scholar , and scientist , and when life presents me with data , I go with it — from earlier Stanford courses on speech errors , courses that included a section on aphasias and other neurological disorders involving language .
( Jacques himself would have approved of my project .
Long before he died , he made me promise that I would okay an autopsy , so that some knowledge might come out of his death . )
This material is now available on my website , in two pieces : a brief medical history and language data from 1998 - 2002 .
And then Emily Transue , Jacques 's daughter , published her second book on her life in medicine ( Patient by Patient , St. Martin 's Press , 2008 — successor to On Call , same publisher , 2005 ) , in which Jacques and his mother Monique , and their deaths , figure very prominently .
[ Advertisement : buy the book ! ]
So now I think it 's time to talk about the California Paradox .
Here 's the story : as a result of radiation therapy in 1980 , many of the neurological connections and small blood vessels in Jacques 's brain were , to speak non-technically , fried , but the consequences did n't appear clearly until 1991 .
Eventually Jacques exhibited a whole textbook of neurological symptoms , one of which was the fascinating condition anosognosia — not knowing you 're impaired .
But the most obvious problem was dementia , functionally similar to Alzheimer 's ( though caused by radiation ) .
The brain is amazing in its ability to work around difficulties .
Faced with a world he increasingly did n't understand , Jacques reconfigured things to fit the world he knew .
He could n't believe he was in California and so hypothesized that he was in Ohio ( several places , including Columbus , where he and I lived for many years ) , Pennsylvania ( where his parents lived , and where he went to college ) , New Jersey , or New York — in what Elizabeth Daingerfield Zwicky and I came to call Newohiolvania .
The technical term is confabulation .
People construct new realities that embrace aspects of what they 're confronted with but do n't threaten their sense of who they are ( even if that 's drastically at odds with what the rest of us experience — with what Elizabeth and I referred to as " consensus reality " ) .
So Jacques , believing that he could n't possibly be in California ( though for twelve years in a row , he and I spent part of the year in Palo Alto ) , erased the problematic word .
We would go out in the neighborhood around his dementia care facility in Menlo Park ( California ) , and he would remark on the information on car license plates : the numbers , the state slogans , the state NAMES .
It was one of his preoccupations , and he was keen to say the data .
But every California car ( and there were of course a great many California cars ) had an illegible state name ; he 'd say that the plate had mud on it , or was n't readable for some other reason .
Oregon yes , Nevada yes , California no .
Nor could he read CALIFORNIA BANK and similar signs on offices .
The word could n't be California , because the place could n't be California .
Now : how could this be ?
How could someone not be able to read California ( on license plates or signs ) but be able to read Oregon and Nevada and all the rest ?
First idea : the patient has a specific deficit .
This is not entirely crazy , given reports of other patients with very specific deficits : for instance , a man who has difficulty in producing or recognizing names of fruits and vegetables , while being able to produce and recognize other nouns with little difficulty .
( Such specialized disabilities have been a particular interest of Alfonso Caramazza and his collaborators .
As a result of this work , some of us have a special place in our hearts for the Fruit and Vegetable Man . )
The usual account of such specializations is that they arise from damage to some very localized area of the brain ; it 's as if ( and I stress the " as if " ) there were a fruit - and - vegetable zone in some people 's brains , and that low blood flow to or nerve damage in that zone leads to a very specific deficit .
It 's hard to credit this proposal for Jacques 's problems with California .
Not only would a brain area have to be devoted specifically to this one lexical item ( this is not preposterous ; after all , lexical items have to be — as we say , metaphorically — stored SOMEWHERE ) , but it would have to be dissociable from all the many connections the rest of us have , in particular , to other state names .
And in fact there is evidence that is not what Jacques was doing ( or what was happening to him ) .
On occasion , I was away for a while , from a day to several weeks .
Then Jacques was faced with the task of searching for me .
I was n't there ( typically , Elizabeth was ) , but I should have been , so he scanned for me .
Crucial fact : for some years , I 'd had license plates for my car from both Ohio and California , and changed them as we went back and forth between the two states .
Jacques knew this .
So when he was out on the street he was looking for my car , and my car might have California license plates .
In this situation he could read California on license plates .
Which led him to detect me in cars of all types , driven by people of all types ( Asian - American women , young black men , whatever ) .
The license plate , formerly incomprehensible , ruled .
I still marvel at all of this .
He could read , implicitly , the word California , and that ability enabled him to reject , explicitly , any perception that he was reading the word California — unless , of course , he was expecting to see this word .
The distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge turns up in lots of places .
For Jacques , it turned up in what happened when he tried to access ( more metaphors ) knowledge about daily life .
If you asked him where his wallet was , he'd have to search through all the possible places his wallet might be .
But if you asked him to give you a dollar , he 'd pull out his wallet ( from his right back pocket , where he'd kept it since he was a child ) , without thinking .
Towards the end of his life , his son Kit visited , and Jacques was delighted to see someone he knew he liked ( though he could n't say who Kit was ) .
At the end of his visit , Kit pushed Jacques 's wheelchair over a bump between the patio and the central part of the care facility .
" Thank you , Kit " , Jacques said .
When he tried to recover names , he could n't , but when he unreflectingly reached for a name , he could sometimes get it .
All this meant that it was hopeless to try to assess his abilities directly , by questioning him or asking him to do things .
In fact , the physicians gave up on such testing early on , in favor of asking for regular reports from me .
In general , dementia patients often exhibit unsuspected abilities in favorable circumstances , and the course of their illness is not uniformly downhill , but something more erratic .
Jacques was not at all unusual in these respects , though the California thing was an extra twist .

Here are six allergies that would probably make you consider investing in one of those huge plastic bubbles .
Allergies are your body 's way of saying it hates you .
About one in five of you are allergic to something , whether you know it or not .
And while those of you who go into sneezing fits around cats or pollen may think you 've got it bad , you have no idea .
6 Electricity
Electrosensitivity ( or the more impressive - sounding Electrical " HyperSensitivity " ) is the term used to describe this growing phenomenon .
In essence , it 's simply an allergic reaction to electricity or electromagnetic fields .
You know , like the ones your entire body is sitting in right now .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Reports about sensitivity to electricity began with the introduction of computer monitors .
People complained about a whole host of symptoms , and this was before the spread of wi-fi and cell phone towers ( which release a related but more powerful type of electromagnetic energy than electrical wiring ) made the whole thing much worse .
About three percent of people complain of electrosensitivity symptoms , though there is no reliable way to test for it so it 's difficult to know how many of those people actually have the allergy and how many just like to bitch .
" What 's it going to do to me ? "
Let 's see , we 've got nausea , fatigue , headaches , sleeplessness , ringing in the ears , depression , difficulty remembering things and skin rashes .
You name it , this allergy has it .
Basically , it can inflict pain on every part of your body with the possible exception of your hair .

Probably best to avoid this thing
And while it 's not listed as an official side effect , the most disorienting side effect may in fact be that it makes the Amish look like sane and reasonable people .
Hell , Ted Kaczynski will probably start to make a lot of sense after your laptop gives you a third degree sunburn all over your groin .
" For the love of God , what do I do ? "
Let 's face it , if you think electromagnetic fields are hard to avoid now , come back in 20 years when everything from your kitchen table to your dog has a flat screen display built into it .
Your only real recourse is installing very expensive EMF filters in your home .
There are companies that specialize in EMF protection , such as LessEMF who sell special electromagnetic field - repelling clothes .
Their catalog does not make it clear if these are all reflective jump suits , so we 'll go ahead and assume they are , and that 1960s science fiction was right about the future .

But more importantly , does any of it actually help ?
Well , that 's where it starts to get weird .
The problem is , since the whole phenomenon is kind of new , we do n't know much about it .
And the long list of varied , seemingly unrelated symptoms have caused some researchers to assert that patients are , " Making shit up . "
In fact , some test subjects apparently showed symptoms even when there was no electrical fields around , or only when they thought there were .
You can tell the sufferers it 's all in their head , but that 's what they say about our fear of clowns and that does n't magically make it go away .

The Minnesota Agri-Growth Council was negotiating with Jakob Dylan ( pictured ) and his band , the Wallflowers , to perform for 5,000 invited guests .
First convention protester : Bob Dylan ?
Has singer Bob Dylan staged the first protest of the 2008 Republican National Convention by persuading his son Jakob Dylan not to perform here in September ?
That 's the talk in the Twin Cities , although neither Dylan was available to comment Monday .

This much is known :
The Minnesota Agri-Growth Council was negotiating with Jakob Dylan and his band , the Wallflowers , to perform for 5,000 invited guests at a nonpartisan industry bash called AgNite on Sept. 2 , the second night of the Republican convention .
Representatives had agreed on a performance fee , although no contracts had been signed , said Daryn McBeth , executive director of the agribusiness trade group .
Then , the deal fell through .
" The lead singer of the band , his dad is Bob Dylan , and I 'm told he ( Bob ) weighed in and encouraged them not to do it because of the political nature of what 's going on in town that week , " McBeth said .
McBeth tried to relay the nonpartisan nature of AgNite , noting it was a celebration of America 's food industry .
GOP conventioneers are definitely welcome , he said , but Democrats and independents are , too .
No matter .
" The deal was dead at that point , " McBeth said .
" I do n't know how Bob got wind of it , or if his son and the band communicated it to him .
But ( the gig died after ) the concern about politics , and maybe Bob Dylan 's feeling about the state of Minnesota and his son's band playing in his home area . "
Still , the AgNite show will go on .
The gala has booked the group Styx , which will perform at the historic Milwaukee Road depot in Minneapolis .
The bash is being produced by event showman Paul Ridgeway and promises a glitzy multimedia celebration of the ag story for delegates , journalists , visiting VIPs and others .
There will be no speeches .
Styx has sold some 17.5 million records , according to the Recording Industry Association of America , and is most famous for such late ' 70s and ' 80s hits as " Come Sail Away " and " The Best of Times . "
The Styx. production and booking firm , Freestyle Productions , had no comment on the Dylan matter .
But the company 's Chris Tahti did note that AgNite is shaping up as " a fantastic event , it should be the afterparty of the convention that night .
It should be the place to be . "
Calls and e-mails to the Dylans ' record company and their publicists were not returned .
Jakob Dylan is scheduled to appear tonight on " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno " to promote his new solo album , " Seeing Things . "
Born Robert Zimmerman in Duluth , the elder Dylan grew up in Hibbing and attended the University of Minnesota before striking out for New York and immortality .
Though noted for his songs of protest , he has largely avoided taking an active role in partisan politics — although last month he spoke admiringly of Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama .
That has n't stopped partisans from trying to tap the Dylan legend .
During the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York , U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman introduced Minnesota 's delegate vote saying , " Minnesota native Bob Dylan said , ' Times they are a - changin ' . '
They are changing in Minnesota , with our great young Republican governor Tim Pawlenty , half of our Washington delegation being Republican .... "
Unlike in years past , even big - name entertainers , including both Dylans , now rent their services to perform at private parties and corporate events .
In 2007 , the Los Angeles Times wrote about the practice , quoting the manager of several top acts , who said that for most bands now , " There are two questions : ' How much does it pay ? ' and ' Where does it fit on my cringe meter ' ? "
McBeth , with the AgriGrowth group , said early negotiations with the Wallflowers seemed encouraging .
" I think it was a fit with where they were touring , " McBeth said .
" And evidently , the venue and nature of our event was fine .
And then , I 'm told , Bob Dylan got them to think otherwise . "

In a new interview Leonard Nimoy talks about photography , aging and Trek .
The 76 year old actor / director / photographer tells Hossli.com that he thinks about death and has even set up a clock that runs backward which tells him how much time he has left .
He also feels that the new Star Trek will ‘ revitalize ’ the Trek franchise .
Excerpts from Nimoy interview
Hossli :
Why is it important for you to know how much time you have left ?
Nimoy : I do n’t want to waste any time .
Even if I ’m not doing anything I want to enjoy that time .
If I ’m conscious of the time , then I do n’t waste it .
I ’m conscious of the time I ’m spending with you .
I ’m giving you time that is part of my life .
I ’m okay about it because it is not wasted .
It ’s a useful conversation .
Hossli : Currently you ´re preparing another “ Star Trek ” movie .
You play Spock as an old man .
What kind of ailments does he have ?
Nimoy : [ laughs , then picks up a photograph ] whenever you go to Rome next time you need to visit Villa Borghese .
You´ll find Canova´s Paulina sculpture .
It ´s simply gorgeous .
Yes , I´m in the new “ Star Trek ” movie .
Let ´s leave it at that .
Hossli : “ Star Trek ” still has tremendous culture resonance .
How has its impact changed over the years ?
Nimoy : I haven´t paid much to what´s been happening to “ Star Trek ” .
I´ve been out of it since 1989 , almost 20 years .
Now were going into a project that in its own way is going to be a very important project if it works .
It will revitalize the entire “ Star Trek ” franchise .
It will be a very big , very expensive movie , much more expansive than any of the movies I was involved with .
I directed two “ Star Trek ” films , the last one I directed , the budget was about 27 million dollar .
With this one , the budget will be about 150 million dollars .

Article about Monsanto was ‘ right thing to do ’
A huge bravo to Lee Cataluna for having the courage to print the other side of the story regarding Monsanto ( “ Those wary of Monsanto ’s aim should tour their property , ” Star - Advertiser , Dec. 20 ) .
Anti-GMO groups use intimidation and bullying to stifle the truth and get their way .
Cataluna could have remained quiet .
She spoke the truth because it was the right thing to do .
From the time that Monsanto acquired its Kunia property , it worked closely with the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii , spending more than $ 1 million and many man-hours to facilitate the adoption of 120 acres of the Honouliuli World War II internment site by the National Parks Service .
President Barack Obama officially proclaimed Honouliuli as a National Monument .
Monsanto did not have to do this and did it with no publicity .
Monsanto did it because it was the right thing to do .

Anti-GMO book might alter Cataluna ’s views
Does Lee Cataluna think you can look at an ear of corn and know anything about the effects of genetic engineering ?
Or listen to the paid programming of Monsanto employees and understand the science ?
It ’s probably too much to ask Cataluna to read something like “ Altered Genes , Twisted Truth : How the Venture to Genetically Engineer Our Food Has Subverted Science , Corrupted Government , and Systematically Deceived the Public , ” by Steven M. Druker .
If she were to , she might be a little less glib about “ the hysterical distrust of science ” and whether distrust of the genetic engineering project is “ fearmongering , ” “ wildly untruthful ” and “ unproductive . ”

Many rail riders will still have to catch buses
Many Ewa commuters will want to go to the University of Hawaii - Manoa or Waikiki , not downtown or Ala Moana , so with the current plans for rail transit , they eventually will have to transfer to a bus .
If we convert the rail guideways to bus guideways and end them at Middle Street or Iwilei , individual buses could continue on surface roads to various express destinations .
Commuters could get over freeway bottlenecks and would have to catch only one express bus to do it .
Modern express buses are far more comfortable than many realize .
Transit time for the existing express bus from Kapolei to Ala Moana is only about 10 minutes more than what is projected for the train , and the articulated buses currently on Honolulu roads have a capacity equal to the planned train cars .
This option could be both better and cheaper than rail .
Both the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation and the Federal Transit Authority should consider it .

Seems like president took Gabbard ’s advice
I have always had great respect for our U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard .
Recently she said the United States should leave Syrian President Bashar Assad alone and let the local people handle the situation .
America must stay out of changing other countries ’ policies , whether democratic or not .
Look at what happened in Iraq , although its leader was insane .
Now it appear that the White House is in agreement .
Good for Gabbard .
I hope she keeps it up .

All admirers of this breed know that the American Pit Bull Terrier is capable of some pretty amazing feats .
The dogs featured in this article are true canine all - stars , risking their lives to save that of their family and using their intelligence , dedication , obedience and loyal nature to protect those they love .
I can only hope that in the same way a few poorly trained , unsocialized Pitbulls are able to stigmatize the entire breed as vicious animals , that featuring a handful of the outstanding pit bull dogs will have the same effect .
Enjoy the stories below featuring these pit bull heroes and be sure to spread the word of their good deeds , the more positive Pit Bull press that is out there , the better is for our dogs .
Cheyenne , Dakota and Tahoe
One of the top rated Search and Rescue ( SAR ) dogs is Dakota , an Am Pit Bull Terrier .
Kris Crawford , who has two other pit bulls that are also certified Search and Rescue dogs , owns Dakota .
Dakota is so good at what she does that NASA requested Kris and Dakota to assist in the recovery of the Astronauts , after the tragic 2003 shuttle disaster .
Kris and Dakota were also involved in the Laci Peterson investigation .
Kris and her team have been involved in many cases and have made national news on several occasions .
Cheyenne , Dakota and Tahoe , in addition to their work as SAR dogs , are also certified hospital therapy dogs .
They can often be seen at pet fairs , shows and schools , informing the public about their work and education about the Pit Bull breed .
It is important to Kris to have the girls out educating the public about the true spirit of the Pit Bull and teaching children canine safety , as most fatal dog bite incidents involve children .
Weela
One day while outside in the yard with one of her “ kids ” , Weela suddenly body - slammed 11 - year - old Gary and sent him flying into the yard .
Gary ’s mom , Lori , who was watching from the window saw the whole thing and was very surprised .
Weela had always played so well with the kids , and she quickly rushed out to see why Weela would have done such a rough move given her usually calm , gentle demeanor .
It was then she saw a big rattlesnake sink its fangs into Weela ’s face , and she immediately understood Weela had saved Gary ’s life by pushing him out of the way !
Weela ’s good deeds did not stop there , a few years later , Weela saved the lives of 30 people , 29 Dogs , 13 horses and 1 cat .
Heavy rains caused a damn to break on the Tijuana River .
Weela pulled 30 to 50lb loads of food across the river to a tiny island to feed the stranded animals the entire month they were there .
Weezie
One night two armed men broke into Melissa Willis ’s home .
They pointed a gun at her while her son stood behind her .
Weezie , their male pit bull , immediatelycame to the rescue .
In addition to growling , barking , snapping and otherwise causing a scene , Weezie placed himself between his family and danger , and with every advance by the men , he pushed his family backwards until they were to the exit .
He kept the armed robbers focused on him so his family would be safe .
Popsicle
The Number 1 United States Customs Dog is an American Pit Bull Terrier named Popsicle .
How did he get that name ?
He was found during a drug bust in a freezer where he had been left to die after being used as a bait dog for dog fighters .
Not soon after his rescue , Popsicle began training at the Canine Enforcement Training Center in Front Royal , VA .
He then went on to work at the Pharr and Hidalgo bridges in Texas .
While working at the Pharr bridge , Popsicle alerted to drugs in a tractor trailer .
It turned out to be a ton and a half of cocaine with a street value of $ 139,605,000 , the largest cocaine seizure in the McAllen area in 10 years .
Popsicle later and went to work at the Port of Roma , Tex .
While working in Roma , Popsicle made 24 seizures of Marijuana : 12,080 pounds with a street value of $ 640,000 ; one cocaine seizure of 148 pounds worth $ 6,719,200 ; and two currency seizures with a total value of $ 65,144 .
Popsicle and Rudy have done more than work hard detecting drugs , they ’ve also made numerous public relations and outreach appearances .
Popsicle is a dog who overcame his abusive start in life and had his chance to get back at the crooks .
While working at Roma , Popsicle suffered a career ending injury to his knee – an injury that required surgery .
Popsicle is now retired and is living a life of leisure at his owner ’s home .
Norton
A little over five years ago , Norton ’s owners heard of this “ loser ” dog needing a home , loser because he was a pitbull that ‘ would n’t fight ! ’
We had two dogs at the time , a Rottie and an Amstaff , so we were n’t looking for another dog , but something made us call these people to find out about Norton .
The owner said thanks but they ’d already found a home for him .
A week or so later the dog ’s owner called back to say Norton was returned and offered for them to come by and take a look .
When they went to visit Norton they found a dog with not only physical scars , but extreme separation anxiety .
They worked with Norton on this but he refused to not be with his people , these people that loved him , cared for him and took him away from his bad situation , so the owners made peace with the fact that Norton would need to be with them at all times .
Little did they know how much this would wind up coming in handy .
One evening while in the bathroom , Norton ’s owner was bitten by a spider .
She was on medication at the time and it inhibited her body from producing any antihistamines , so she went into anaphylactic shock .
She could n’t make it out of the bathroom and could not make a sound to let her husband know she was in trouble .
For some unknown reason , Norton got up from his bed in the closet and went over to her sleeping husband and kept pushing him with him nose until Barrie woke up .
When her husband saw how upset Norton was and realized his wife was not there , he went looking for her and found her almost unconscious .
She spent two days in intensive care and a week at home recovering from a spider bite that would have killed her within a matter of minutes if it were not for Norton .
Finally , we return to the SETI of Cocconi and Morrison 's 1959 theory .
While most astrobiologists study the origins of life and peer through telescopes at wobbling stars , there remains a dedicated core who continue to search the skies for the elusive ET beacon .
Now , finally , they have a home in the Allen Telescope Array — more reliable than the piggybacking they used to cobble together .
A joint project of the University of California , Berkeley and the SETI Institute , the Array is currently 42 20 - foot diameter dishes ( of an eventual 350 to be completed in the next three years ) .
Upon completion , it will be unprecedented in its research capabilities , able to conduct complicated radio astronomy and SETI analysis simultaneously .
The project came out of a series of workshops held by the SETI Institute and UC Berkeley in the late 1990s as frustration mounted over having to use other institutions ' antennas for research .
What the team quickly discovered — and what made the project feasible — was that the cost of the receiver electronics has dropped by a factor of 100 over the previous twenty years .
That put very sophisticated technology into an affordable price point and the Allen Array was born .
Whether the Allen Array will be the telescope to catch the first ET signal is , of course , anybody 's guess .
It will certainly be one of the most powerful when it is completed , able to capture much larger pieces of the sky at one time than previous technologies .
It 's an unfathomably large universe out there and we 're only ever talking about searching our own galaxy , one of an estimated 100 billion .
As the original 1971 Project Cyclops report suggested , the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is not one that can be completed overnight : " The search will almost certainly take years , perhaps decades and possibly centuries .
This . . . requires faith .
Faith that the quest is worth the effort , faith that man will survive to reap the benefits of success , and faith that other races are , and have been , equally curious and determined to expand their horizons .
We are almost certainly not the first intelligent species to undertake the search .
The first races to do so undoubtedly followed their listening phase with long transmission epochs , and so have later races to enter the search .
Their perseverance will be our greatest asset in our beginning listening phase . "
So let us believe .

The most recent changes involve my project / spring seminar , “ Art and Organism “
In recent years our Art & Organism Seminar has had different course epigraphs : 2018 - 2019 : “ Abstraction allows man to see with his mind what he cannot see physically with his eyes … .
Abstract art enables the artist to perceive beyond the tangible , to extract the infinite out of the finite .
It is the emancipation of the mind .
It is an exploration into unknown areas . ” ( Arshile Gorky )

“ Parts and wholes evolve in consequence of their relationship , and the relationship itself evolves .
These are the properties of things that we call dialectical : that one thing cannot exist without the other , that one acquires its properties from its relation to the other , that the properties of both evolve as a consequence of their interpenetration . ”
( Levins and Lewontin 1985:3 ) ​​​​​​ ​

“ The connectedness of things is what the educator contemplates to the limit of his capacity .
No human capacity is great enough to permit a vision of the world as simple , but if the educator does not aim at the vision no one else will , and the consequences are dire when no one does .

The student who can begin early in life to think of things as connected , even if he revises his view with every succeeding year , has begun the life of learning . ” ( Mark Van Doren ) ​​​​​​ ​

Eight miles north of the maritime border with Mexico , in waters a mile and a half deep , Shell Oil Co. is constructing the most ambitious offshore oil platform ever attempted in the Gulf of Mexico .
As tall as the Eiffel Tower , the floating production facility will be anchored to the ocean floor by moorings spanning an area the size of downtown Houston .
Slated to begin operating late next year , this leviathan known as Perdido ( or Lost ) will cost billions and be capable of pumping 100,000 barrels of crude a day .
But Perdido ’s most - notable achievement may be to compel Mexico to loosen its 70 - year government monopoly on the petroleum sector , thanks to a phenomenon Mexicans have dubbed the “ drinking straw effect . ”
Mexicans fear that companies drilling in U.S. waters close to the border will suck Mexican crude into their wells .
Actor Daniel Day - Lewis ’ fictional oilman in “ There Will Be Blood ” likened the concept to siphoning a rival ’s milkshake .

“ When they take petroleum from the American side , our petroleum is going to migrate , ” Sen . Francisco Labastida Ochoa , head of the Mexican Senate ’s Energy Committee , told the newspaper Milenio recently .
Oil is n’t a simple commodity in Mexico .
It ’s a powerful symbol of national sovereignty .
Rancor over foreigners profiting from its hydrocarbons -- namely America ’s Standard Oil -- led Mexico to nationalize its industry in 1938 .
The state - owned oil company Pemex is forbidden by law from partnering with outsiders to exploit a drop of Mexican crude .
But for a growing chorus of Mexicans , sharing a milkshake is preferable to watching your neighbor drink it up .
Mexico has no viable deepwater drilling program to match U.S. efforts near the maritime border .
And it lacks an iron - clad legal means to defend its patrimony .
Some are urging their government to partner with the U.S. to co-develop border fields or risk losing those deposits .
Mexican Energy Secretary Georgina Kessel has spoken repeatedly of her desire to negotiate such a pact .
Cross - border fields are a hot topic in Mexico ’s Congress .
Lawmakers are embroiled in a heated debate on how to strengthen Pemex , which provides 40 % of Mexico ’s tax revenue but whose slumping output is alarming the nation .

Proposed legislation would still ban partnerships .
But the consensus to permit some exception in the gulf region is growing as oil companies move closer to Mexican territory .
The U.S. has issued drilling rights on dozens of parcels less than 10 miles from Mexican waters .
Shell , BP , Chevron and Exxon Mobil , plus independents including Houston ’s Bois d’Arc Energy , have secured acreage adjacent to the boundary .
“ The pressure is forcing [ legislators ] to do something , ” said Mexico City attorney David Enriquez , a maritime law expert who will testify at a Senate hearing today on transborder reservoirs .
“ It ’s the one area where they are unified . ”
It ’s unclear whether big shared deposits even exist in the Gulf of Mexico .
Historically , the region ’s deepwater finds have been isolated pockets of petroleum , not mega - fields .
Officials at the U.S. Minerals Management Service , the federal agency that regulates U.S. offshore production , said they had no knowledge that any gulf reservoirs now under development crossed the international divide .

Shell , which is developing its Perdido platform with Chevron and BP , said the deposits they were targeting were confined to U.S. territory .
Mexicans are skeptical .
A recent editorial cartoon showed a greedy Uncle Sam sucking from a straw plunged deep into the gulf .
But Pemex has n’t done the seismic and drilling work needed to determine if there is crude on its side .
All the more reason , Enriquez said , for Mexico to collaborate with the U.S. to find out what lies near the 470 - nautical - mile gulf border and end all the speculation .
A spokesman for Minerals Management said his agency had worked with Mexico before on boundary issues and was open to discussing cross - border fields .
“ It ’s the neighborly thing to do , ” said Dave Cooke , deputy regional supervisor for resource evaluation for the agency in New Orleans .

Oil and gas fields straddle international borders all over the globe .
Countries typically strike a “ unitization agreement ” to share the costs to extract the deposits and split the proceeds based on how much lies in each nation .
Britain has partnered with the Netherlands and Norway in the crowded North Sea. Australia and East Timor have a unitization agreement .
So do Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea .
But the U.S. and Mexico have long skirted the topic , given their prickly history with oil .
Until recently , such an agreement was n’t necessary .
Both nations had plenty of shallow - water reserves to keep them occupied .
Low oil prices did n’t justify the exorbitant costs of deepwater drilling , where a single well can cost $ 100 million or more .

But exploding crude prices and advances in seismic technology now have oil companies pushing into the farthest reaches of the U.S. gulf .
Private operators snapped up a record $ 3.7 billion worth of leases at Mineral Management Services ’
March auction , virtually all of them in deep water .
Since 1992 , firms have drilled more than 2,100 wells at depths greater than 1,000 feet in the U.S. gulf .
Pemex has drilled seven deepwater wells since 2004 , none of which is producing , and none is likely to for years .
Therein lies the nation ’s predicament .
Mexico is the world ’s sixth - largest crude producer , but production is in its fourth straight year of decline .
Mexico could become a net oil importer within a decade if it does n’t find new reserves fast .
Cantarell , a shallow - water gulf field in southern Mexico , is drying up after more than a quarter - century of production .
April output averaged just over 1 million barrels a day , less than half of its peak in 2003 .

Pemex says there are billions of untapped barrels in Mexico ’s deep waters .
But it lacks the capital and know - how to go after them .
A bill being pushed by President Felipe Calderon ’s administration would make it easier for Pemex to hire the expertise it needs .
But deep - water projects cost billions and can take a decade to come on line .
Oil majors typically want a share of any crude that they find -- a standard industry practice forbidden by Mexico ’s constitution .
It ’s unclear whether a constitutional change would be necessary to let Mexico forge a unitization agreement with the United States .
But industry experts said a deal would make sense for both sides .
Companies working in U.S. waters would n’t have to worry about Mexico taking legal action if it were determined that Mexican crude was ending up in their wells .
International law and commercial custom dictate that communal reservoirs be shared .
But the U.S. has not ratified a key United Nations treaty on maritime law , which could complicate Mexico ’s effort to pursue any complaint over pilfered crude .
Advertisement
Nevertheless , oil companies do n’t like surprises , said Michelle Foss , chief energy economist at the University of Texas at Austin ’s Bureau of Economic Geology .
“ You ’re not going to put a billion dollars at risk if . . . you might have to suspend operations because of an international dispute , ” she said .
A unitization deal would give Pemex a chance to learn from deepwater veterans who have been working the gulf for decades .
There is pipeline infrastructure on the U.S. side , eliminating the need for Mexico to duplicate such a costly effort .
Yet critics such as Mexican opposition leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador say border fields are the first step in opening Mexico ’s energy sector to foreigners and privatizing Pemex .
Calderon denies it .
As Mexico mulls its next move , the U.S. is hitting the gas .
Its gulf crude production averages 1.3 million barrels daily and is projected to rise to as much as 2.1 million barrels a day by 2016 , thanks to Perdido and other deepwater projects .

Shaped like a giant tin can , Perdido will be anchored in 8,000 feet of water , making it the deepest so - called spar in the world .
The movable structure , with up to 150 workers , will tap oil at three fields , Silvertip , Tobago and Great White .
“ The easy oil is gone , ” said Russ Ford , Shell ’s technical vice president for the Americas .

Kanye West Starts Extremely Nerdy Debate About Minutes and Seconds
The aspiring president missed a deadline by 14 seconds — but he says he was n't late , based on the rules of time .
Does he have a point ?
One might think one would have to know what one was talking about to write an op -ed for The Washington Post but of course if that were the case then Robert Samuelson would be unemployed :
Unless we find cost - effective ways of reducing the role of fossil fuels , a cap - and - trade system will ultimately break down .
It would n’t permit satisfactory economic growth .
But if we ’re going to try to stimulate new technologies through price , let ’s do it honestly .
A straightforward tax on carbon would favor alternative fuels and conservation just as much as cap - and - trade but without the rigid emission limits .
A tax is more visible and understandable .
If environmentalists still prefer an allowance system , let ’s call it by its proper name : cap - and - tax .
We 'll turn this over to Ryan Avent :
Yowza .
As any economist worth his or her salt will tell you , a cap and trade plan with auctioned permits is essentially identical to a carbon tax .
That also happens to be exactly what Barack Obama is proposing .
So , another way for Samuelson to have written this column would have been to title it , “ Barack Obama has a good plan to reduce carbon emissions . "
This is , of course , also the view of Hillary Clinton , John Edwards , leading congressional Democrats , and all the main environmental groups .
But of course Samuelson 's the kind of guy for whom environmentalists and Democrats are always wrong , so we have to ignore the facts .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Of course , it 's not a crime , and it's hard to see how , in a free society , it could or should become one .
But the culpability of the energy firms the climate scientist James Hansen will indict in his testimony to Congress today is clear .
If we fail to stop runaway climate change , it will be largely because of campaigning by oil , coal and electricity companies , and the network of lobbyists , fake experts and thinktanks they have sponsored .
The operation sprang directly from Big Tobacco 's war against science .
It has used the same fake experts , the same public relations companies and the same tactics : as I showed in my book Heat , the campaign against action on climate change was partly launched by the tobacco company Philip Morris .
But while the tobacco companies ' professional liars were smoked out by a massive class action in the US , the sponsored climate change deniers still have massive influence over public perception .
A survey published yesterday by the Observer shows that six out of ten people in Britain agreed that " many scientific experts still question if humans are contributing to climate change . "
This is an inaccurate perception , which results from Big Energy 's lobbying .
Almost without exception , the scientists who claim to doubt that manmade climate change is taking place fall into two categories : either they are not qualified in the branch of science they are discussing or they have received money from fossil fuel companies .
Of all the self - professed climate " sceptics " , I have been able to find only one – Dr John Christy of the University of Alabama – who has relevant qualifications and who does not appear to have received fees from lobby groups or thinktanks sponsored by the energy companies .
But even he has had to admit that the figures on which he based his claims were the results of " errors in the … data " .
The others are the very opposite of sceptics .
Many of them are paid to start with a conclusion – that climate change is n't happening or is n't important – then to find data and arguments to support it .
In most cases , they cherrypick scientific findings ; in a few cases , like the fake scientific paper attached to the celebrated Oregon petition , they make them up altogether .
But people who do n't understand the difference between a peer - reviewed paper and a pamphlet are taken in .
The energy companies ' propaganda campaign is amplified by scientific illiterates in the media , such as Melanie Phillips , Christopher Booker , Nigel Lawson , Alexander Cockburn and the television producer ( who made Channel 4's documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle ) Martin Durkin .
I do n't believe that the energy companies should be prosecuted for commissioning the truckload of trash their sponsored experts publish .
But their campaign of disinformation must be exposed again and again .
Like the tobacco lobbyists , they are not only delaying essential public action ; they also create the impression that science is for sale to the highest bidder .
The awful truth is that sometimes it is .
It is well established that the brain uses more energy than any other human organ , accounting for up to 20 percent of the body 's total haul .
Until now , most scientists believed that it used the bulk of that energy to fuel electrical impulses that neurons employ to communicate with one another .
Turns out , though , that is only part of the story .
A new study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA indicates that two thirds of the brain 's energy budget is used to help neurons or nerve cells " fire ' ' or send signals .
The remaining third , however , is used for what study co-author Wei Chen , a radiologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School , refers to as " housekeeping , " or cell - health maintenance .
Researchers reached their conclusions after imaging the brain with magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) to measure its energy production during activity shifts .
Chen says the technology , which has been around for three decades and is used to track the products of metabolism in different tissues , could prove instrumental one day in detecting brain defects or to diagnose tumors or precursors of neurodegenerative diseases ( such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's ) early .
Chen and his colleagues used MRS specifically to track the rate of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) production , the primary source of cellular energy , in rat brains .
MRS employs a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) machine programmed to pick up particular elements in the body — in this case , the three phosphorus atoms in each ATP molecule .
Their goal : to determine whether ATP production is linked to brain activity by measuring the energy expended during different levels of consciousness .
Sure enough , ATP levels appeared to vary with brain activity .
The team noted that when the lab rats were knocked out , they produced 50 percent fewer ATP molecules than when they were mildly anesthetized .
The ATP produced when the brain is inactive , says Chen , seems to go mostly toward cell maintenance , whereas the additional ATP found in the more alert animals fueled other brain functions .
He speculates that only a third of the ATP produced in fully awake brains is used for housekeeping functions , leaving the rest for other activities .
" Housekeeping power is important for keeping the brain tissue alive , " Chen says , " and for the many biological processes in the brain , " in addition to neuronal chats .
Charged sodium , calcium and potassium atoms ( or ions ) are continuously passed through the membranes of cells , so that neurons can recharge to fire .
ATP supplies the energy required for these ions to traverse cell membranes .
Chen says there must be enough energy to maintain a proper ionic balance inside and outside cells ; if too many get stuck inside , it can cause swelling , which can damage cells and lead to strokes and other conditions .
He says the team has since used MRS to study energy demands of a cat 's brain , which they said also jumped when the kitty was visually stimulated .
Next up : humans , which Chen says researchers hope to study " very soon . "
There is a charming anecdote that Marianne Legato , a best - selling American author and the professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University , tells about her father .
He was a short , muscular and fit man , a successful physician like his daughter , who had one other passion in his life apart from medicine : hunting .
He used to take his son on frequent hunting trips and on one occasion they came to the edge of a sunflower field .
" The plants were tall and entangled together , making it very difficult to walk through them .
My father , who was about 70 at the time , bent his head and simply started out , doggedly trudging through the field with no complaint , never pausing to rest and never commenting on how difficult the passage undoubtedly was .
" On another trip , my brother found him sitting on the edge of his bed , smoking , at three in the morning .
' What 's the matter , Dad ? ' he asked .
My father answered , pointing to his head : ' Too much traffic . '
That was all he said .
It would never have occurred to him to confide in one of his sons – or anyone else . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This insight into the family 's modus operandi appears in the opening chapter of Dr Legato 's latest book , Why Men Die First .
It illustrates a truth about the male psyche : a bloody - minded refusal to ask for help .
Dr Legato 's father took risks , had enormous confidence and dismissed anything that might be interpreted as a sign of weakness .
When he died of cancer , 10 years before her mother , it was partly because he had ignored the fact that his urine was blood - tinged for two years before he asked a colleague to examine his bladder .
For Dr Legato , part of the solution is that men need to live more like women .
" Men are told from an early age to ' suck it up ' , " she says .
" They are socialised to get on with it and it is left to women to urge them to go to the doctor , usually ineffectively . "
It is extraordinary , as the opening sentence of her book says , that in a society where health is an obsession , we are not investigating in more detail the most fundamental question of all – why one sex should die before the other .
On average , women live seven years longer than men .
Boys die more frequently than girls in infancy and in childhood .
Between the ages of 20 and 24 , three times more men die than women , and men are twice as likely to die before 65 .
Heart disease , cancer , suicide , accidents and murder are all higher among men .
The difference in death rates between the sexes has puzzled doctors on both sides of the Atlantic .
In Britain , the former chief medical officer , Sir Donald Acheson , has a single word explanation for the gender gap : hormones .
Among younger , testosterone - fuelled men , accidents and violence are the chief cause of death , whereas in later life they are carried off by heart disease – against which women are protected by the female hormone , oestrogen .
Men also die in larger numbers from lung cancer , because they tend to be heavier smokers than women .
It is men's " rash and venturesome natures " that rendered them the weaker sex , he says .
Dr Legato agrees that hormones supply a " tremendous part of the answer " .
But this raises a further question .
" Why are we not looking for an oestrogen - like molecule to protect men from coronary disease ? " she says .
" Men start to die from heart disease from the age of 35 – it should be regarded as important as breast cancer . "
Twenty years ago , men and women were regarded as indistinguishable in terms of the way their bodies functioned .
Gradually , that view has changed as it has become clear that the two sexes are different , not just in the obvious ways , but in every system of their bodies .
In 1992 , Dr Legato wrote The Female Heart , exploring the reasons why heart disease affects men and women differently .
That experience led her to create a discipline of gender specific medicine .
Today , the sexes are becoming homogenised as they exchange roles – she interviewed female soldiers , firefighters and boxers for the book as well as house husbands .
But it is too early to say whether these changes will shift attitudes at a deeper level .
Why is it , for example , that there are more cases of melanoma ( the most serious form of skin cancer ) in women , but more deaths in men ?
Her latest book traces what she calls the " fragility " of men throughout their lives .
As well as biological differences , social pressures on men can be lethal , she says .
Now in her seventies , Dr Legato has two children of her own , a son and a daughter , whom she admits to having treated differently , sending the boy to a tough school renowned for its discipline , while the girl attended a " softer " institution .
The legacy of that decision is still evident .
Her son , a lawyer in his mid-thirties , called her recently to tell her he was sick and would not be going to work .
Three days later he called again and it was clear that he was seriously ill , but had done nothing about it .
She says : " If he had asked for help earlier , I think we could have made him better sooner , but he talked of soldiering on .
I wish he would read my book , but I do n't think he will .
He is not interested in why men die first . "
Health risks every man should know about
Obesity
A waist measurement over 37 inches increases your risk of health problems such as diabetes and heart disease .
Eat healthily and lose that gut .
Unprotected sex
Up to 50 per cent of men ( 70 per cent of women ) with a sexually transmitted infection do n't show any symptoms .
Use a condom
Too little exercise
Staying fit is the key to good health .
Walking is fine ( 10,000 steps burns 500 calories ) and if you jog or swim or play football ( 700 calories an hour ) , you burn more .
Heart disease
There are more than 200,000 deaths a year in the UK from heart disease and stroke and together they account for almost one in three premature deaths ( before age 75 ) in men .
Check your blood pressure ( should be below 160 / 100 mmHg ) and cholesterol level ( ideally less than 5 mmol / litre ) .
Smoking
Men still smoke more and die more frequently from smoking than women .
It increases the risk of heart disease , half a dozen kinds of cancer and other illnesses such as bronchitis .
Half of all smokers will die from their habit if they do not stop .
Give it up .
Drinking
Heavy drinking is common among men .
In moderation alcohol enhances enjoyment and reduces the risk of heart disease .
In excess , it leads to social and psychological distress and physical damage .
Three small glasses of wine or a pint and a half of beer a day is fine – more could be problematic .
Testicular cancer
Although still rare , rates have trebled in the past 25 years and it is the commonest cause of cancer deaths in men aged 15 - 35 .
Check your testicles regularly .
Prostate cancer
The commonest in men with 35,000 cases and 10,000 deaths a year .
Be alert to warning signs ( difficulty peeing or getting up in the night ) .
Other cancers
Do n't ignore symptoms ( persistent cough , blood in the urine or faeces ) – early treatment increases the chance of a cure .

Rogue Government
June 16 , 2008
Essentially what the mainstream press is saying through their coverage is that making politically incorrect statements over the airwaves is more news worthy than somebody soliciting a contract for murder over the airwaves .
What ’s really interesting about Michael Reagan issuing death threats and soliciting a contract for murder on his nationally syndicated radio show is the fact that it has received almost no coverage in the mainstream press .
When Don Imus referred to members of the Rutgers women ’s basketball team as “ nappy headed hoes ” , every major media network dedicated hours upon hours covering it until he was eventually fired .
When Rush Limbaugh made a comment about black quarterbacks not being as good as white quarterbacks on ESPN , he was forced to resign after the resulting media firestorm .
The comments made by Imus and Limbaugh were at worst inappropriate and in poor taste .
Both Imus and Limbaugh had the right to say these things under the protection afforded to them under the First Amendment .
What Reagan did by soliciting a contract for murder is a felony and far beyond anything that Imus and Limbaugh did to warrant the media coverage they received .
Essentially what the mainstream press is saying through their coverage is that making politically incorrect statements over the airwaves is more news worthy than somebody soliciting a contract for murder over the airwaves .
This is of course entirely ridiculous .
What more proof do people need to see that the mainstream press is entirely controlled and that they primarily report on issues that divide people among race , religion , gender and political parties ?
Common sense would dictate that it is far more serious to be soliciting contract murder than making politically incorrect statements over the airwaves .
Considering the coverage given to the Imus and Limbaugh incidents , this incident should have resulted in much greater media coverage .
Both Imus and Limbaugh were eventually forced out from their positions for making politically incorrect statements so it would seem justifiable for Reagan to be fired for doing something much worse .
Not only should Reagan be fired , but he should be arrested for committing a felony .
Reagan who has solicited the contract murder for Mark Dice and other people involved in the 9/11 truth movement appears to have bitten off more than he can chew .
Although the mainstream press has been silent on this issue , the alternative media has covered this extensively .
At least Reagan is going to have Dice on his program to discuss the situation , but that certainly does not make up for his previous actions .
The main problem is that everything is selectively covered by the mainstream press .
Take for example the ridiculous amount of coverage given to Tim Russert ’s death .
It is understandable to cover his death because it is news worthy , but MSNBC was actually transformed into the Tim Russert channel over the weekend as other important news was swept aside .
MSNBC and all of the other major media outlets spent hours upon hours saying how great of a journalist Russert was when in reality he was a media stooge for the establishment .
Russert was a propagandist because he rarely would ask any of the powerful people he interviewed the real tough questions .
Did Russert ever ask any of the people he interviewed about the destruction of U.S. sovereignty , the fraud of the Federal Reserve , the unconstitutional nature of the income tax , the questions surrounding the official 9/11 story and other hard hitting questions ?
He did ask George W. Bush and John Kerry about their affiliation with Skull and Bones but other than that , he did n’t deserve the credit that his fellow mainstream media journalists gave him .
Russert was just another establishment media hack who made sure the status quo remained the status quo .
During an interview with Genesis Communications Network host Jack Blood , Russert was asked about the questions people had about the official 9/11 story .
Russert ’s tone of voice immediately changed when confronted on this issue and he eventually started pushing buttons on his phone to make people believe they were having technical problems .
He proceeded to hang up on the interview in order to avoid answering the tough questions .
Of course , nobody in the mainstream press is going to bring this incident up because Russert was one of them .
This is why all of the coverage on Russert after his death has been completely biased .
There has n’t been anything negative said about Russert anywhere except for in the alternative media .
The bottom line is that the mainstream press is there only to ensure that the establishment remains in power .
That ’s why they promote the fake left versus right political paradigm and that ’s why they provide an ample amount of coverage on issues that divide people instead of issues that unite people .
As a result of this , it is highly unlikely that any real mainstream press coverage will be dedicated to Reagan soliciting contract murder on his nationally syndicated radio show .
Most people would find Reagan ’s behavior reprehensible and that ’s why there has not been the same media coverage on this issue that the Imus and Limbaugh incidents received .
The mainstream press is simply a disgrace .
The majority of people in the mainstream press are cowards who would prefer to keep their six or seven figure salaries than actually stand up and do real journalism .
It is a sad state of affairs when the only real journalists left are in the alternative media .
Fascism has invaded the mainstream press in this country and these large media outlets can no longer be taken seriously to provide the truth about what ’s actually happening .
Further proof of this can be seen with the media blackout on the Bilderberg Meeting .
Simply put , the mainstream press is full of overpaid hacks and propagandists .

Capitalism is the only system that allows for both of these .
We should not stop advocating capitalism , nor should we stop caring about ourselves and others in peaceful , voluntary ways .
I find it no less disturbing when someone says both capitalism and socialism are extreme and they seek a middle ground than if someone were to say both love and cruelty were extreme , and they therefore seek a middle ground .
Some vices or virtues are found in moderation ; some are found in absoluteness .
As Barry Goldwater famously said ,
Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice ! —
Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue .
Capitalism is just .
Socialism is unjust .
There is no " messy middle . "
Retail sales picked up last month as Americans received more than $ 50 billion in stimulus checks .
Investors took the report as an encouraging sign for the resilience of the economy , even as some analysts wondered how long the uptick would last .
Sales of retail goods and services rose 1 percent in May , double what economists had expected , the Commerce Department said on Thursday .
The biggest gains came at gasoline stations , where high prices brought more income to station owners , and at outlets for home and garden supplies .
Wall Street warmed to the strong report , which also revised higher the government ’s original estimates for sales in April and March .
The Dow Jones industrials rose nearly 200 points before falling back in the afternoon ; the index closed up half a percent at 12,141.58 .
But as is usual with economic indicators , the report came with its share of caveats .
Sales were 2.5 percent higher in May 2008 than in May 2007 , but that is less than the rate of increase year over year for April .
On an annual basis , sales have fallen for the last six months when adjusted for inflation .
Electricity at the Iowa Stored Energy Park will be generated by wind turbines .
Excess wind will drive a compressor and be stored in sandstone underground for later use .
2008 HowStuffWorks
The ISEP concept was first proposed in 2003 , when members of the Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities ( IAMU ) formed a study committee to explore how wind energy could be used in creative ways to supplement the state 's power production .
Iowa is the third largest producer of wind energy in the United States , just behind California and Texas .
To advance its leadership position in wind production even more , the IAMU study committee knew that another large wind farm -- even one containing state - of - the - art , super - efficient turbines -- would not be enough all by itself .
They needed a mechanism to store energy .
The committee proposed a power plant that would integrate two key elements : a 100 - megawatt wind farm and a compressed air energy storage facility .

The idea behind ISEP is based on two successful CAES facilities already in operation -- one in Huntorf , Germany , operated by Nordwest Deutsche Kraftwerke since 1978 ; and another in McIntosh , Ala. , operated by Alabama 's Electric Cooperative since 1991 .
Both of these facilities store compressed air underground .
The Huntorf plant uses salt caverns as its storage reservoir .
The McIntosh plant uses preexisting mines .
The ISEP planning committee wanted to experiment with storing compressed air in an aquifer .
An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that is capable of holding water .
The rock can do this because it contains millions of tiny spaces between rock and gravel particles .
These little spaces trap water and hold it .
As it turns out , this highly permeable rock can also be filled with air .
In fact , if you pump air into an aquifer under great pressure , it acts like a giant bubble and displaces the groundwater .
A few months after it initiated the study , the committee found an aquifer near Fort Dodge , Iowa , that seemed ideal .
The aquifer was close to the electric transmission grid and a gas pipeline .
However , the site eventually proved unsuitable for a variety of reasons .
As the team began screening other sites , it also went through some organizational changes .
In 2005 , the IAMU committee passed responsibility for ISEP to the Iowa Stored Energy Park Agency ( ISEPA ) , an Iowa corporation representing more than 130 municipal utilities in Iowa , Minnesota and the Dakotas .
Two years later , in January 2007 , the agency finally completed its screening process and settled on a site just west of Dallas Center in central Iowa .
The site is ideal for a few reasons .
The aquifer , 3,000 feet ( 914 meters ) below the surface , is deep and wide , which means it can store a large amount of air .
Another appealing feature is the site 's geology .
The aquifer is comprised of layers of sandstone capped by dense shale .
Sandstone is very porous and holds both air and water well .
Finally , the site is within 30 miles ( 48.3 km ) of downtown Des Moines , which is good for economic development .
The agency hopes that ISEP will become a tourist destination , and being close to the state capital could bring in more traffic .
The Dallas Center site is not , however , the best wind area in Iowa .
As a result , ISEPA is investigating the possibility of a remote wind farm .
The agency could build the farm or it could contract with an existing privately owned wind farm .
Either way , wind is a critical component of the project .
In fact , using wind as an energy source is one of the main ways in which the ISEP is different from the Huntorf and McIntosh plants .
Both Huntorf and McIntosh use off - peak electricity from traditional nuclear or coal - burning power plants to run the compressor that pumps air underground .
ISEP will use wind - generated electricity to run the compressor and will direct any excess energy back to the grid .
By using CAES and wind power together , ISEP will be able to provide an environmentally friendly , alternative energy source for homes and businesses .
In the next section , we 'll look at how exactly ISEP will make electricity .

Capistrano 2.4.0 is now available .
gem install capistrano
Report bugs to Capistrano ’s Lighthouse project .
And if you have some ideas for patches , please patch against the code at Capistrano ’s GitHub repository .
Here ’s the skinny on 2.4.0 :
death to “ git fetch -- tags “
You git users out there will be pleased to learn that this release will no longer do “ git fetch -- tags ” , meaning your git - based deploys will finally work again .
Sorry that took so long to fix .
It was really ridiculously simple . :(
cap -d
Mark Imbriaco added a debug switch for enabling conditional execution of commands .
This is fantastic for debugging and testing tasks , since you can basically step through your tasks and approve or deny each remote command as it is executed .
Just give cap the “ - d ” switch to enable this .
New and improved sudo helper
No , really .
This time I mean it .
I pulled the version of sudo introduced in 2.3.0 ( where each sudo command was wrapped in an explicit sh invocation ) , and put it back almost exactly as it was .
However , if you call sudo without a command to execute , it will instead return the sudo command to use .
On top of that , if the run ( ) helper detects that you ’re using sudo , it will listen for password prompts .
So you can now do arbitrarily complex sudo commands like this :
1 run " if [ - d / some / directory ] ; then #{ sudo } chmod - R g+w / some / directory ; fi "
In other words , just dump the sudo ( ) call into your command as an interpolated value , and the real sudo command gets substituted .
You can pass options to it as well :
1 run " #{ sudo : as => " bob " } something "
And , naturally , the original sudo ( ) syntax we all know and love remains as before :
sudo " something " , : as => " bo b "
The deployment recipes themselves have been updated to use this new syntax , as needed .
: runner vs. :admin_runner
Some cappers have noted that having deploy : setup and deploy : cleanup run as the : runner user messed up their carefully crafted permissions .
I agreed that this was a problem .
With this release , deploy : start , deploy : stop , and deploy : restart all continue to use the : runner user when sudoing , but deploy : setup and deploy : cleanup will use the : admin_runner user .
The : admin_runner variable is unset , by default , meaning those tasks will sudo as root , but if you want them to run as : runner , just do “ set : admin_runner , runner ” .
deploy : upload with globs
You can now specify glob patterns with deploy : upload :
1 $ cap deploy : upload FILES=" config/apache/*.conf "
As before , you can also specify entire folders to upload , but now the upload is being done via the upload ( ) helper ( introduced in 2.3.0 ) so the behavior is more standardized .
before / after hooks use well - defined server scope
Prior to this release , if you defined a before hook using a block , the block would be executed within the same server scope as the original task that invoked task that this hook was attached to .
( whew ! )
In other words :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 task : first , :roles => :app do # ... second end task : second , :roles => : db do # ... end before : second do # ... end
Prior to this release , when “ first ” calls “ second ” , the before hook at the bottom would get called , but it would get called with the : roles => : app server constraint active , instead of :roles => :db .
This preview release makes those hooks use the server scope of the task they are attached to .
host reported correctly from SCM output
Prior to this release , when any output was processed by the : checkout , : export , or : remote_cache strategies , you ’d not be able to tell what host the output was from ( it ’d just be prefixed [ err ] or [ out ] ) .
With this release , that output is correctly tagged with the host that generated it , making it easier to troubleshoot issues with SCM command execution .
Disable asset timestamp normalization
Some SCM ’s give you the option of forcing the modification times of files that are being checked out to be the time that they were last modified in the repository .
If your SCM gives you that capability , and if you enable it ( however that works in your SCM ) , then you do n’t need the massive touch command that Capistrano ’s default deployment tasks run on each deploy , which is cap ’s way of forcing all assets on all of your servers to have the same timestamp .
To disable Capistrano ’s default timestamp normalization step , just set the : normalize_asset_timestamps variable to false :
1 set :normalize_asset_timestamps , false
You could also do this if you are deploying to a single server only .
Note , though , that if you do this when deploying to multiple servers , and you have n’t configured your SCM to set the timestamps on the files on checkout , then Rails may use inconsistent timestamps on the assets , causing caching of your assets to fail and resulting in longer load times for your users .
Other lesser fixes , straight from the CHANGELOG
Speaking at the United States Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in Colorado Springs on Wednesday , President Bush readied the Class of 2008 for their future in the military by making repeated references to “ the Greatest Generation ” and World War II — oh , and also by body - slamming graduates .
Rocky Mountain News :
“ In the 20th century , air power helped make possible freedom ’s victory in great ideological struggles with fascism and communism , ” Bush said .
“ In those struggles , our nation faced evil men with territorial ambitions and totalitarian aims , who murdered the innocent to achieve their political objectives .
“ Through a combination of military strength and national resolve , and faith in the power of freedom , we defeated these adversaries — and secured the peace for millions across the world . ”
Bush said that in World War II , like today , defeating “ hateful ideologies ” required national power — including military might .
Today , however , fighting men and women have at their disposal technology that makes it possible to wage war “ with greater precision and greater humanity . ”
“ Our new enemies know they ca n’t defeat us militarily .
So their strategy is to cause us to lose our nerve and retreat before the job is done , ” Bush said .
“ They take advantage of the information age and the 24 - hour news cycles , creating images of chaos and suffering for the cameras , in the hope that these images will horrify the American people and undermine resolve and morale here at home .

Collection of confessional sites you can either voyeuristically view stranger ’s admissions or to post your own confession to unburden some of the weight from your shoulders .
Confessionals , generally speaking , provide a cathartic way of relieving some of your inner demons from your shoulders .
In itself , a confession does n’t actually change the events that may have occurred , but provides a pathway for individuals to come to terms with their action or thoughts .
Confessions are wide and varied from the mundane , to merely thoughts , but many are disturbing .
Here is a collection of confessional sites :
I ponder when reading the confessions of random people , whether it speaks of the resiliency or weakness of human nature and people in general .

CENTRAL SQUARE , N.Y . 
On Wednesday , Charlie Price was smoking a cigarette and sitting outside his restaurant , Charlie ’s Place , on a two - lane stretch of highway on the outskirts of town .
He watched as a small group protesting the war in Iraq marched toward him , carrying peace signs and waving at the cars and tractor - trailers whizzing by .
“ I do n’t think it ’s going to do any good , ” Mr. Price said of their efforts .
“ I want to get out of there , too , but I do n’t think this is the way . ”
Yet once the protesters , headed for Fort Drum , more than 50 miles away , reached him , Mr. Price eagerly offered them water and a place to rest  a more pleasant welcome than they had received from many others along the way .
Carmen Viviano - Crafts , 23 , of Syracuse , who was carrying a small cardboard sign that read , “ Bring home my boyfriend , ” said that some people “ gave us the finger and stuff like that . ”
( Fortune Magazine ) --
If Berkshire Hathaway 's annual meeting , scheduled for May 3 this year , is known as the Woodstock of Capitalism , then perhaps this is the equivalent of Bob Dylan playing a private show in his own house : Some 15 times a year Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett invites a group of business students for an intensive day of learning .
The students tour one or two of the company 's businesses and then proceed to Berkshire ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) headquarters in downtown Omaha , where Buffett opens the floor to two hours of questions and answers .
Later everyone repairs to one of his favorite restaurants , where he treats them to lunch and root beer floats .
Finally , each student gets the chance to pose for a photo with Buffett .
In early April the megabillionaire hosted 150 students from the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School ( which Buffett attended ) and offered Fortune the rare opportunity to sit in as he expounded on everything from the Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) bailout to the prognosis for the economy to whether he'd rather be CEO of GE ( GE , Fortune 500 ) - or a paperboy .
What follows are edited excerpts from his question - and - answer session with the students , his lunchtime chat with the Whartonites over chicken parmigiana at Piccolo Pete's , and an interview with Fortune in his office .
Buffett began by welcoming the students with an array of Coca - Cola products .
( " Berkshire owns a little over 8 % of Coke , so we get the profit on one out of 12 cans .
I do n't care whether you drink it , but just open the cans , if you will . " )
He then plunged into weightier matters :
Before we start in on questions , I would like to tell you about one thing going on recently .
It may have some meaning to you if you 're still being taught efficient - market theory , which was standard procedure 25 years ago .
But we 've had a recent illustration of why the theory is misguided .
In the past seven or eight or nine weeks , Berkshire has built up a position in auction - rate securities [ bonds whose interest rates are periodically reset at auction ; for more , see box on page 74 ] of about $ 4 billion .
And what we have seen there is really quite phenomenal .
Every day we get bid lists .
The fascinating thing is that on these bid lists , frequently the same credit will appear more than once .
Here 's one from yesterday .
We bid on this particular issue - this happens to be Citizens Insurance , which is a creature of the state of Florida .
It was set up to take care of hurricane insurance , and it 's backed by premium taxes , and if they have a big hurricane and the fund becomes inadequate , they raise the premium taxes .
There 's nothing wrong with the credit .
So we bid on three different Citizens securities that day .
We got one bid at an 11.33 % interest rate .
One that we did n't buy went for 9.87 % , and one went for 6.0 % .
It 's the same bond , the same time , the same dealer .
And a big issue .
This is not some little anomaly , as they like to say in academic circles every time they find something that disagrees with their theory .
So wild things happen in the markets .
And the markets have not gotten more rational over the years .
They 've become more followed .
But when people panic , when fear takes over , or when greed takes over , people react just as irrationally as they have in the past .
Do you think the U.S. financial markets are losing their competitive edge ?
And what 's the right balance between confidence - inspiring standards and ...
... between regulation and the Wild West ?
Well , I do n't think we 're losing our edge .
I mean , there are costs to Sarbanes - Oxley , some of which are wasted .
But they 're not huge relative to the $ 20 trillion in total market value .
I think we 've got fabulous capital markets in this country , and they get screwed up often enough to make them even more fabulous .
I mean , you do n't want a capital market that functions perfectly if you 're in my business .
People continue to do foolish things no matter what the regulation is , and they always will .
There are significant limits to what regulation can accomplish .
As a dramatic illustration , take two of the biggest accounting disasters in the past ten years : Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
We 're talking billions and billions of dollars of misstatements at both places .
Now , these are two incredibly important institutions .
I mean , they accounted for over 40 % of the mortgage flow a few years back .
Right now I think they 're up to 70 % .
They 're quasi - governmental in nature .
So the government set up an organization called OFHEO .
I 'm not sure what all the letters stand for .
[ Note to Warren : They stand for Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight . ]
But if you go to OFHEO 's website , you 'll find that its purpose was to just watch over these two companies .
OFHEO had 200 employees .
Their job was simply to look at two companies and say , " Are these guys behaving like they 're supposed to ? "
And of course what happened were two of the greatest accounting misstatements in history while these 200 people had their jobs .
It 's incredible .
I mean , two for two !
It 's very , very , very hard to regulate people .
If I were appointed a new regulator - if you gave me 100 of the smartest people you can imagine to work for me , and every day I got the positions from the biggest institutions , all their derivative positions , all their stock positions and currency positions , I would n't be able to tell you how they were doing .
It 's very , very hard to regulate when you get into very complex instruments where you 've got hundreds of counterparties .
The counterparty behavior and risk was a big part of why the Treasury and the Fed felt that they had to move in over a weekend at Bear Stearns .
And I think they were right to do it , incidentally .
Nobody knew what would be unleashed when you had thousands of counterparties with , I read someplace , contracts with a $ 14 trillion notional value .
Those people would have tried to unwind all those contracts if there had been a bankruptcy .
What that would have done to the markets , what that would have done to other counterparties in turn - it gets very , very complicated .
So regulating is an important part of the system .
The efficacy of it is really tough .
At Piccolo Pete's , where he has dined with everyone from Microsoft 's Bill Gates to the New York Yankees ' Alex Rodriguez , Buffett sat at a table with 12 Whartonites and bantered over many topics .
How do you feel about the election ?
Way before they both filed , I told Hillary that I would support her if she ran , and I told Barack I would support him if he ran .
So I am now a political bigamist .
But I feel either would be great .
And actually , I feel that if a Republican wins , John McCain would be the one I would prefer .
I think we 've got three unusually good candidates this time .
They 're all moderate in their approach .
Well , the one we do n't know for sure about is Barack .
On the other hand , he has the chance to be the most transformational too .
I know you had a paper route .
Was that your first job ?
Well , I worked for my grandfather , which was really tough , in the [ family ] grocery store .
But if you gave me the choice of being CEO of General Electric or IBM or General Motors , you name it , or delivering papers , I would deliver papers .
I would .
I enjoyed doing that .
I can think about what I want to think .
I do n't have to do anything I do n't want to do .
It might be wonderful to be head of GE , and Jeff Immelt is a friend of mine .
And he 's a great guy .
But think of all the things he has to do whether he wants to do them or not .
How do you get your ideas ?
I just read .
I read all day .
I mean , we put $ 500 million in PetroChina .
All I did was read the annual report .
[ Editor 's note : Berkshire purchased the shares five years ago and sold them in 2007 for $ 4 billion . ]
What advice would you give to someone who is not a professional investor ?
Where should they put their money ?
Well , if they 're not going to be an active investor - and very few should try to do that - then they should just stay with index funds .
Any low - cost index fund .
And they should buy it over time .
They 're not going to be able to pick the right price and the right time .
What they want to do is avoid the wrong price and wrong stock .
You just make sure you own a piece of American business , and you do n't buy all at one time .
When Buffett said he was ready to pose for photographs , all 150 students stampeded out of the room within seconds and formed a massive line .
For the next half hour , each one took his or her turn with Buffett , often in hammy poses ( wrestling for his wallet was a favorite ) .
Then , as he started to leave , a 77 - year - old 's version of A Hard Day 's Night ensued , with a pack of 30 students trailing him to his gold Cadillac .
Once free , he drove this Fortune writer back to his office and continued fielding questions .
How does the current turmoil stack up against past crises ?
Well , that 's hard to say .
Every one has so many variables in it .
But there 's no question that this time there 's extreme leveraging and in some cases the extreme prices of residential housing or buyouts .
You 've got $ 20 trillion of residential real estate and you 've got $ 11 trillion of mortgages , and a lot of that does not have a problem , but a lot of it does .
In 2006 you had $ 330 billion of cash taken out in mortgage refinancings in the United States .
That 's a hell of a lot - I mean , we talk about having $ 150 billion of stimulus now , but that was $ 330 billion of stimulus .
And that 's just from prime mortgages .
That 's not from subprime mortgages .
So leveraging up was one hell of a stimulus for the economy .
If that was one hell of a stimulus , do you think the $ 150 billion government stimulus plan will make an impact ?
Well , it 's $ 150 billion more than we'd have otherwise .
But it 's not like we have n't had stimulus .
And then the simultaneous , more or less , LBO boom , which was called private equity this time .
The abuses keep coming back - and the terms got terrible and all that .
You 've got a banking system that 's hung up with lots of that .
You 've got a mortgage industry that 's deleveraging , and it 's going to be painful .
The scenario you 're describing suggests we 're a long way from turning a corner .
I think so .
I mean , it seems everybody says it 'll be short and shallow , but it looks like it 's just the opposite .
You know , deleveraging by its nature takes a lot of time , a lot of pain .
And the consequences kind of roll through in different ways .
Now , I do n't invest a dime based on macro forecasts , so I do n't think people should sell stocks because of that .
I also do n't think they should buy stocks because of that .
Your OFHEO example implies you 're not too optimistic about regulation .
Finance has gotten so complex , with so much interdependency .
I argued with Alan Greenspan some about this at [ Washington Post chairman ] Don Graham 's dinner .
He would say that you 've spread risk throughout the world by all these instruments , and now you did n't have it all concentrated in your banks .
But what you 've done is you 've interconnected the solvency of institutions to a degree that probably nobody anticipated .
And it 's very hard to evaluate .
If Bear Stearns had not had a derivatives book , my guess is the Fed would n't have had to do what it did .
Do you find it striking that banks keep looking into their investments and not knowing what they have ?
I read a few prospectuses for residential - mortgage - backed securities - mortgages , thousands of mortgages backing them , and then those all tranched into maybe 30 slices .
You create a CDO by taking one of the lower tranches of that one and 50 others like it .
Now if you 're going to understand that CDO , you 've got 50 - times - 300 pages to read , it 's 15,000 .
If you take one of the lower tranches of the CDO and take 50 of those and create a CDO squared , you 're now up to 750,000 pages to read to understand one security .
I mean , it can't be done .
When you start buying tranches of other instruments , nobody knows what the hell they 're doing .
It 's ridiculous .
And of course , you took a lower tranche of a mortgage - backed security and did 100 of those and thought you were diversifying risk .
Hell , they 're all subject to the same thing .
I mean , it may be a little different whether they 're in California or Nebraska , but the idea that this is uncorrelated risk and therefore you can take the CDO and call the top 50 % of it super - senior - it is n't super - senior or anything .
It 's a bunch of juniors all put together .
And the juniors all correlate .
If big financial institutions do n't seem to know what 's in their portfolios , how will investors ever know when it 's safe ?
They can't , they can't .
They 've got to , in effect , try to read the DNA of the people running the companies .
But I say that in any large financial organization , the CEO has to be the chief risk officer .
I 'm the chief risk officer at Berkshire .
I think I know my limits in terms of how much I can sort of process .
And the worst thing you can have is models and spreadsheets .
I mean , at Salomon , they had all these models , and you know , they fell apart .
What should we say to investors now ?
The answer is you do n't want investors to think that what they read today is important in terms of their investment strategy .
Their investment strategy should factor in that ( a ) if you knew what was going to happen in the economy , you still would n't necessarily know what was going to happen in the stock market .
And ( b ) they can't pick stocks that are better than average .
Stocks are a good thing to own over time .
There 's only two things you can do wrong :
You can buy the wrong ones , and you can buy or sell them at the wrong time .
And the truth is you never need to sell them , basically .
But they could buy a cross section of American industry , and if a cross section of American industry does n't work , certainly trying to pick the little beauties here and there is n't going to work either .
Then they just have to worry about getting greedy .
You know , I always say you should get greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy .
But that 's too much to expect .
Of course , you should n't get greedy when others get greedy and fearful when others get fearful .
At a minimum , try to stay away from that .
By your rule , now seems like a good time to be greedy .
People are pretty fearful .
You 're right .
They are going in that direction .
That 's why stocks are cheaper .
Stocks are a better buy today than they were a year ago .
Or three years ago .
But you 're still bullish about the U.S. for the long term ?
The American economy is going to do fine .
But it wo n't do fine every year and every week and every month .
I mean , if you do n't believe that , forget about buying stocks anyway .
But it stands to reason .
I mean , we get more productive every year , you know .
It 's a positive - sum game , long term .
And the only way an investor can get killed is by high fees or by trying to outsmart the market .
Comes Just 10 Days after House Oversight Committee Subpoenaed CIA Leak Documents
Jon Ponder Byon

Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
On Friday , just 10 days after the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued subpoenas to the Dept. of Justice ( DOJ ) for notes from a June 2004 interview the FBI conducted with George Bush and Dick Cheney regarding their roles in the CIA leak scandal , the House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for documents related to the leak as well as the department 's alleged political prosecutions .
According to a news release from the House Judiciary Committee , " [ Chairman ] John Conyers , Jr. ( D - Mich . ) today issued a subpoena to the [ DOJ ] to provide to the committee a number of previously requested documents by July 9 .
The Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law voted this week to authorize committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. to issue the subpoena at his discretion .
The documents the committee is seeking cover a broad range of issues including the Valerie Plame leak , allegations of selective prosecution , and other matters . "
Last month , the Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Karl Rove 's testimony about his role in orchestrating the DOJ 's alleged political vendetta against former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
Siegelman was convicted on corruption charges in 2006 and sentenced to seven years in prison .
He was released in March while his case is being appealed .
Witnesses have claimed that Siegelman was persecuted by the Bush White House , under the direction of Rove .
Siegelman believes he was targeted because , as a rare popular Democrat in a Republican bastion , he posed a threat to Rove 's quixotic dream of a permanent majority for the GOP .
The House Oversight Committee , chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) was prompted to subpoena the FBI 's Bush - Cheney interview notes after Scott McClellan , the former White House press secretary , said in interviews promoting his book , What Happened , that he was the unwitting conduit of false information about the involvement of Bush officials in the leaking of Plame 's covert identity .
Additionally , testimony in the 2007 perjury trial of Scooter Libby , Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , indicated that Cheney led a conspiracy involving Libby and Rove to divulge Plame 's identity , without regard to the fact the revelation would compromise the secret CIA program and likely put the lives of foreign U.S. operatives in jeopardy .
House investigators want to know if Cheney and Bush lied to the FBI about their knowledge of the conspiracy during the June 24 , 2004 , interview in the Oval Office .
Lying to federal investigators is crime , even when the subjects of the interview are under oath .
A PDF of the subpoena is here .
If you ’re familiar with the Samsung Galaxy J series , the Korean tech giant ’s mid-range smartphone line , then you might know that the Samsung Galaxy J3 first launched way back in 2015 .
However , due to the success the device had on the market , Samsung brought it out again in 2016 in a revamped variant , and it plans to do the same in 2017 .
Naturally , quite a bit of hype has been created around the alleged re-launch already .
Rumor Has It …
… that the new and improved Samsung Galaxy J3 will run on the latest version of Android , the 7.0 Nougat operating system .
This is pretty great news for those of us that want all the benefits of a top - shelf device for only a fraction of the cost .
This has been revealed according to a listing an anonymous internet user found on famed website WiFi Alliance .
The device appeared on the website under model number SM - J330F .
However , nothing official has been announced by Samsung about this alleged re-launch of the Galaxy J3 .
Therefore , it ’s important to remember that this is pure speculation , and there is nothing else to go on except the aforementioned WiFi Alliance listing .
Always take these kinds of rumors with a grain of salt , and do n’t expect them all to come true .
However , if this one does turn out to be true , the specs of the phone will still be nothing spectacular in order to justify its thrifty price tag .
But for those of us out there looking for a cheaper alternative , the new Samsung Galaxy J3 could be exactly what we need : a simple , functioning device that can perform all the functions of a pricier one , and also runs on the latest version of Android .

A flight data file created by the downloaded Flight Data Recorder information of American Airlines flight 77 was created on Thursday , September 13 , 2001 at 11:45 pm .
However , as reported by USA Today , Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col .
George Rhynedance reported that the FDR for AA 77 was recovered on Friday , September 14 , 2001 at 4 am , 4 hours and 15 minutes after the creation of the AA 77 FDR data file .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Searchers on Friday found the flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the hijacked plane that flew into the Pentagon and exploded , Department of Defense officials said .
The two " black boxes , " crucial to uncovering details about the doomed flight 's last moments , were recovered at about 4 a.m. , said Army Lt. Col.
George Rhynedance , a Pentagon spokesman .
http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001/09/14/pentagon-fire.htm
The AA 77 FDR file was contained within a May 2008 release obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request of the National Transportation Safety Board .
After losing both houses of Congress in the 1994 election , Bill Clinton expostulated : The president of the United States is not irrelevant !
On learning his trusted aide from Texas Scott McClellan has denounced as an “ unnecessary war ” the same Iraq war McClellan defended from the White House podium , George Bush must feel as Clinton did .
The synchronized savagery of the attacks on McClellan as turncoat suggests he drew blood .
For what he has done is offer confirmation to the president ’s war critics , from within the White House inner circle , that Bush ’s motive in going to war was not a clear and present danger of attack by Iraq with weapons of mass destruction , but to advance a Bush crusade to impose democracy on the Middle East .
Neoconservative ideology , not U.S. national interests , McClellan is saying , motivated Bush to launch one of the longest and most divisive wars in U.S. history .
When loyalists defect and seek to profit from that defection , it is usually a sign of a failing presidency .
And , indeed , events suggest that history is passing Bush by .
Despite the administration ’s designation of Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations , and of Syria and Iran as state sponsors of terror with whom we do not negotiate , America ’s clients are ignoring America .
Israel has ignored Bush ’s demand that it stop building and expanding settlements on a West Bank that is to be the heartland of a Palestinian state .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been secretly negotiating with Syria for the return of the Golan Heights in exchange for peace .
When America refused to play honest broker between Jerusalem and Damascus , Turkey , at Israel ’s request , stepped into the role .
The pro-American Lebanese government of Prime Minister Siniora has negotiated a truce and power - sharing arrangement with Hezbollah , giving that militant Shiite movement and party veto power in the Beirut government .
Egypt is negotiating with Hamas for a truce in the Israeli - Gaza war and to effect the exchange of a captured Israeli solider held by Hamas for Hamas fighters held in Israel .
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard , designated a terrorist organization by the Senate , helped to arrange the ceasefire between government forces and the Mahdi Army in Basra and Sadr City .
While the United States has used the roughest of language to denounce Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president has been received as an honored guest by the Iraqi government we support and by the Ayatollah Sistani , who has yet to meet a high - ranking American .
When Bush went to the Middle East to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Israel as the Zionist he has become , he was criticized by a Palestinian leader who survives on U.S. aid .
When he went to Riyadh to plead for an increase in the flow of oil , he got a token concession from the king .
In Pakistan , the new government has been negotiating a truce with the radicalized frontier provinces , which would leave the Taliban with a privileged sanctuary from which to prepare their annual offensives to overthrow the government in Kabul and expel the Americans , as their fathers expelled the Russians .
As Russia and China move closer together to oppose U.S. missile defenses and the U.S. presence , military and economic , in the Caucasus and Central Asia , Latin America seems to be going its own leftward way .
The halcyon days of the Alliance for Progress are long gone .
The world seems to be waiting for Bush to depart and for the next American president .
For the foreign policy differences between John McCain and Barack Obama are as real and stark as they have been since the Reagan - Carter election of 1980 , or the Nixon - McGovern election of 1972 .
Looking back on the years since 9/11 , it is hard to give the Bush foreign policy passing grades .
We pushed NATO eastward and alienated Russia .
We have 140,000 Army and Marine Corps troops tied down in Iraq in a war now in its sixth year , from which our NATO allies have all extricated themselves .
We have another war going in Afghanistan , where the situation is as grave as it has been since we went in .
The Bush democracy crusade was put on the shelf after producing election triumphs for Hamas , Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt .
And the Bush Doctrine of preventive war , after Iraq , appears to be headed there , as well .
America remains the first economic and military power on earth .
But after seven years of Bush , we no longer inspire the awe or hopes we once did .
We are no longer the world hegemonic power of the neocons ’ depiction .
And the reason is that Bush embraced their utopian ideology of democratic empire and listened to their siren ’s call to be the Churchill of his age .
Of Bush , it may be said he was a far better politician and candidate than his father , but as a statesman and world leader , he could not carry the old man ’s loafers .
Silikone bryster
Mange kvinder over hele verden , også i Danmark , vælger at få lavet en brystforstørrende operation , og her er det især silikone bryster , der er populære .
Der er hovedsagligt to faconer af silikone implantater .
Man kan få det anatomiske ( dråbeformede ) og runde implantat .
Det dråbeformede implantat vil se helt naturligt ud , men har desværre den ulempe , at hvis implantatet skulle ske at rotere , så vil brystet få en meget speciel facon , og dette kan måske resultere i endnu en operation .
Ved det runde implantat gør det ikke noget , hvis det drejer sig , dog vil bryster ikke se så naturlige ud .
Med silikone implantater er man sikret en investering for hele livet .
Man kan være så uheldig , at der går hul på implantat , men så skal dette såmænd bare byttes ud .
Silikone implantat er en rigtig god metode for dem , der ønsker sig større bryster , hvad enten det er meget større eller lidt større .
Prisen på silikone implantater varierer en del , men ligger typisk omkring 30.000 danske kroner .

There are many other issues that have been raised as well ; the issues given in this document are not the only known issues !
There are also some spec - wide issues that have not yet been addressed : case - sensitivity is a very poorly handled topic right now , and the firing of events needs to be unified ( right now some bubble , some do n't , they all use different text to fire events , etc ) .
It would also be nice to unify the rules on downloading content when attributes change ( e.g. src attributes ) - should they initiate downloads when the element immediately , is inserted in the document , when active scripts end , etc .
This matters e.g. if an attribute is set twice in a row ( does it hit the network twice ) .

Icahn Getty Images YAHOO STOCK YAHOO STOCK Yahoo stock over 5 years .
SAN FRANCISCO  Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn 's latest salvo in his escalating war against Yahoo's board put a new price tag on the embattled company , and intensified pressure on Yahoo as it approaches its annual shareholders meeting .
In a scathing letter he sent to Yahoo ( YHOO ) Chairman Roy Bostock on Friday , Icahn wants Yahoo to tell Microsoft ( MSFT ) it 's willing to be sold for $ 49.5 billion , about $ 2 billion above Microsoft 's last offer for the Internet pioneer .
" Why do n't you stop dancing around the subject and publicly offer to sell the company to Microsoft for $ 34.375 per share and promise to cooperate completely ? "
Icahn said in a strongly worded letter .
Yahoo said declaring an acceptable sales price for the company would be " ill - advised . "
Microsoft declined comment .
It withdrew an oral offer of $ 47.5 billion , or $ 33 a share , last month after Yang asked for $ 37 per share .
Icahn 's letter was the latest volley in an increasingly nasty campaign to force Yahoo's sale .
In another letter on Wednesday , Icahn made it clear he wants Yahoo's board replaced and CEO Jerry Yang fired unless the company works out a deal with Microsoft before Yahoo's annual shareholders meeting on Aug .
1 . Icahn , who carved a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider in the 1980s and later reinvented himself as a shareholder activist in recent years , was particularly miffed by what he claimed was a provision by Yahoo that would add more than $ 2 billion to the cost of a takeover .
In his letter Wednesday , Icahn accused Yahoo's management and board of putting themselves ahead of their shareholders .
Some tech analysts say Icahn is merely softening up Yahoo in the weeks leading up to its shareholders meeting in San Jose , Calif .
If Yahoo staves off Icahn , it faces a torrent of lawsuits from disgruntled shareholders , says Jonathan Yarmis , an analyst at AMR Research .
" I 'll bet after the shareholders meeting — if there 's no deal done — you 'd have a hard time booking a hotel room in Wilmington , Del. , as plaintiffs lawyers line up to file their lawsuits , " Yarmis says .
Ultimately , Icahn 's end game is simple , Yarmis and others say .
" It 's quick money .
Nothing more , nothing less , " Yarmis says .
" ( Icahn ) has to make Yahoo think that the path of least risk is doing something large with , or selling to , Microsoft .
I still do n't think a deal for the whole enchilada is out of the question . "
Yahoo shares inched up 8 cents to $ 26.44 in trading Friday .
Microsoft shares slipped 81 cents to $ 27.49 .

During an appearance today on CNN’s “ Late Edition ” program , Barack Obama supporter Chris Dodd made the case that Barack Obama ’s lack of experience could help instead of hurt him in the general election .
Host Wolf Blitzer asked Dodd about experience after previous guest Rep. John Murtha ( D - PA ) said that he was supporting Clinton based on her experience .
Dodd said , “ Well , if experience were the deciding factor , Joe Biden and I ought to be leading the race right today , I suppose , in terms of years of experience .
Experience is important , but it should n’t be viewed , Wolf , in isolation .
There are other qualities and characteristics that I think we pay as much attention .
The moral values , the character of an individual , where they come from , who they are as individuals . ”
Dodd continued , “ I can go back in history — I wo n’t bore you with it — with people who have been — had a lot of experience , did n’t end up being very good presidents .
Those that arguably had limited experience , at least what we think of in terms of elective office , who turned out to be very good presidents . ”
He discussed Obama ’s ability to attract Republicans and Independents , “ I think one of the most important things to look at here , in terms of winning this election , has been the numbers of people who have been attracted to Barack Obama ’s campaign who are independents and Republicans .
There are almost a million more people , if you add independents and Republicans , who have voted or supported Barack Obama in the 44 caucuses and primaries that we ’ve had already over the last three months . ”

He contrasted Obama with Hillary Clinton ’s limited appeal to only Democrats .
“ You ’re not going to win the election by just appealing to your own base .
You ’re going to win it because you appeal to independents or like - minded people of the other party .
Barack Obama has a huge advantage when it comes to that .
There are literally people talking about themselves as Obama Republicans .
The last time you and I heard words like that was when people talked about Reagan Democrats .
So , I believe his experience is important , but there are other qualities here besides experience , which ought to matter . ”
Hillary Clinton ’s negatives are so high among Republican voters that she would probably unify the party against her .
Her appeal with Independents is also very limited to point where many of them would drift towards McCain .
In some elections , there are more important things than experience .
The American electorate is craving a new voice , and a fresh start .
They want to push the Bush years into the past and move forward .
Both Clinton and McCain are old voices on the national scene .
Neither one of them offers anything fresh and new , Obama represents a fresh start while Clinton represents a return to the 1990’s , and McCain embodies continuing the status quo .
Dodd realizes this , as do a growing number of his fellow Democrats .

Just days after clinching the Democratic presidential nomination , Senator Obama is naming as his economic policy director an economist who has clashed with critics of Wal - Mart by defending the company as a boon to poor Americans .
Click Image to Enlarge Sara D. Davis / Getty Senator Obama addresses a face the crowd during his first stop on his " Change That Works For You " campaign at Raleigh , North Carolina yesterday .
The appointment of Jason Furman , 37 , a former Clinton administration official who is a visiting scholar at New York University , immediately met with skepticism from some who have faulted Wal - Mart for being stingy toward its workforce .
RELATED : McCain Warns of Broad Tax Hikes Under Obama | Obama - Nomics .
" It 's surprising because this guy seems to feel that Wal - Mart 's low - wage , low - benefit business model is good for America .
That 's just flat - out wrong , " the executive director of Wal - Mart Watch , David Nassar , said .
" This guy helped to lend credibility to the Wal - Mart business model .
That was disappointing then and it's disappointing now given this position , " said Mr. Nassar , whose group is backed by a board that includes the president of the Service Employees International Union , Andrew Stern .
Mr. Nassar quickly added that he was " not critiquing the Obama campaign . "
A New York - based labor organizer and writer , Jonathan Tasini , said he was puzzled by the selection of Mr. Furman .
" It 's legitimate to give you pause , " Mr. Tasini , who ran an unsuccessful primary challenge to Senator Clinton in 2006 , said .
" There have been concerns raised about where Obama 's economic policies will trend , " the writer said .
Mr. Tasini noted that , while Mr. Obama spurned labor groups by voting for a free - trade agreement with Peru , his past suggests he would be an ally of labor .
" It 's hard to believe that during his community organizing work in the poorest neighborhoods of his own city he did n't have something sink into him about income inequality .
There 's no way to read anything he has put out there as anything but rejection for the Wal - Mart model , " Mr. Tasini said .
As the company became a pariah in Democratic circles , Mr. Furman stepped out on the issue in 2005 by publishing a 16 - page paper titled , " Wal - Mart : A Progressive Success Story . "
He argued that the huge cost savings the company has delivered to its customers , who tend to have low incomes , far outweighed any impact the chain may have had on wages .
In a debate on Slate.com in 2006 , Mr. Furman took on the tactics of the anti-Wal - Mart movement , which include trying to block new stores in places like New York .
" If I heard that Wal - Mart was coming to my neighborhood , New York 's West Village , I might rush for my mouse .
But I would n't kid myself into thinking that my opposition had anything to do with helping the poor .
If anything , I would feel guilty that I was preventing moderate - income New Yorkers from enjoying the huge benefits that much of the rest of the country already knows so well , " he wrote .
" The collateral damage from these efforts to get Wal - Mart to raise its wages and benefits is way too enormous and damaging to working people and the economy more broadly for me to sit by idly and sing ' Kum - Ba - Ya ' in the interests of progressive harmony , " Mr. Furman added .
A spokesman for Mr. Obama , Joshua Earnest , said the candidate and Mr. Furman have not discussed Wal - Mart .
During the primary campaign , Mr. Obama was sharply critical of the company .
He has said he will not shop there and that Wal - Mart should pay " a living wage . "
At a January debate , Mr. Obama seemed to play to Wal - Mart 's critics when he suggested that Senator Clinton 's six - year stint on the company 's board paled in comparison to his record as a community organizer in Chicago .
" While I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas , you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal - Mart , " Mr. Obama said , in one of his sharpest jabs at Mrs. Clinton .
One economist who has disputed some of Mr. Furman 's findings on Wal - Mart said the disagreement should n't disqualify him .
" That 's small potatoes .
Jason 's economic agenda goes way beyond that , " Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute said .
" That 's not anything close to a deal breaker . "
Mr. Furman had been affiliated with the Brookings Institution as director of its Hamilton Project , an economic policy project whose advisory council includes executives of Citigroup , as well as prominent hedge fund executives such as Eric Mindich of Eton Park Capital Management , Richard Perry of Perry Capital , and Thomas Steyer of Farallon Capital ,
Teach for America , the program that recruits top college graduates to teach for two years in public schools that are difficult to staff , has experienced a year of prodigious growth and will place 3,700 new teachers this fall , up from 2,900 last year , a 28 percent increase .
That growth was outpaced , however , by a surge in applications from college seniors .
About 24,700 applied this spring to be teachers , up from 18,000 last year , a 37 percent increase , according to figures released by the organization on Wednesday .
The nonprofit program sent its first 500 recruits into American public school classrooms in 1990 .
It has a large recruiting staff that visits campuses , contacting top prospects and recruiting aggressively .
Founded by a Princeton graduate , it has always carefully sifted through applicants ’ grade - point averages and other data in recruiting .
But with the numbers of applicants increasing faster than the number of teachers placed , it was even more selective this year than before , the organization said .
About 11 percent of the graduating class at Yale applied , 10 percent at Georgetown and 9 percent at Harvard , said Amy Rabinowitz , a spokeswoman .

Editors ' note :
As of September 23 , 2010 , this product has been discontinued and replaced by the similar Roku XDS .
Originally introduced in May 2008 as the " Netflix Player , " Roku 's little video - streaming box had one mission : allow Netflix subscribers to view that company 's small stable of on - demand videos on their TVs .
The box worked well enough , and as the year progressed , subsequent software updates and -- most importantly - - expanded program offerings and more HD content made the $ 100 Roku Netflix Player an even better deal than when it was initially launched .
Eighteen months later , the Roku Player is now a family of products with programming choices that go far beyond just Netflix .
In addition to the original $ 100 product ( now dubbed the Roku HD Player ) , there 's a step - down entry - level model that loses the HD video output -- the $ 80 Roku SD Player -- and the step - up Roku HD XR Player reviewed here .
This $ 130 model adds state of the art dual - band 802.11n Wi -Fi and a USB port for future expansion .
More importantly , though , is a November 2009 software update delivers upwards of a dozen programming channels to all of the Roku boxes .
Panoply of content
All of the programming on the Roku Player is available a la carte via the Roku Channel Store ( see the setup section below for details ) .
As of November 2009 , there are 12 " channels " to choose from .
Netflix ( paid subscription ) : Access approximately 12,000 movies and TV shows on - demand .
The service is available to all Netflix subscribers on plans that allow one disc or more at a time , which costs as little as $ 9 per month .
Some content is available in HD .
You create an instant viewing queue with your PC's Web browser , and those titles are then accessible on the Roku .
Amazon Video - on - Demand ( pay - per- view ) : Amazon offers 40,000 - plus movies and TV shows for sale or rent a la carte , for anywhere from $ 2 to $ 4 ( rentals ) to $ 6 to $ 15 ( purchases ) .
Titles can be queued up via a Web browser , or you can search via an on - screen keyboard and / or lists of hot titles .
Some content is available in HD .
MLB TV ( paid subscription ) : MLB TV enables access to live and prerecorded Major League Baseball games -- with the major caveat that it only works for out - of - area teams .
You can choose the home or away video feed , which is available in standard or high - def ( bandwidth permitting ) .
Pandora ( free ) :
The popular free streaming audio service is available through the Roku Player .
" Stations " you set up in advance can be accessed onscreen , and songs can be skipped or voted as " thumbs up " or " thumbs down . "
Mediafly ( free ) :
The online content aggregator allows you to access a wide variety of audio and video broadcasts from pros and amateurs .
Popular programs are instantly accessible via genre , and Mediafly subscribers can line up customized feeds as well .
While the programs are ostensibly " podcasts , " Mediafly content includes some full - length TV programming as well , such as news and public affairs shows from NBC , CNBC , MSNBC , ABC , and CBS .
Flickr ( free ) : Photos on Yahoo's Flickr service can be accessed onscreen via the Roku .
Revision3 ( free ) :
The full range of programs from this tech - centric video provider -- including Tekzilla and Diggnation -- is available on the Roku .
TWiT ( free ) : Similar to Revision3 , Leo Laporte 's TWiT is a provider of techie video and audio programming , including the eponymous This Week in Tech show .
Blip.tv ( free ) : Blip.tv aggregates and distributes a variety of independent Web video programs .
FrameChannel ( free ) : Like Flickr , FrameChannel ( which is used on some digital photo frames ) allows you to access and share photos you 've uploaded to the Web .
Motionbox ( free ) : Motionbox is a YouTube - like site that lets you access home movies you 've uploaded .
MobileTribe ( paid subscription ) : MobileTribe aggregates information from a variety of your existing social network accounts , including Facebook , MySpace , and Plaxo .
The Roku Channel Store allows you to surface or hide the exact channels you wish to see on the main menu .
The box
The Roku HD XR Player looks all but identical to the other two models in the Roku Player line .
Measuring 1.75 inches tall by 5.25 inches wide by 5.25 inches deep , the box is slightly smaller than your typical cable modem , but instead of having just an Ethernet port on the back , it 's equipped with all manner of audio and video outputs : HDMI , component video , S - Video , and composite video ports , as well as digital optical or the standard red / white analog stereo outputs .
( The HDMI and digital audio connections support stereo and surround sound . )
So you ’ve taken your project to 100 % code coverage , you ’ve configured your continuous integration system to fail the build if that coverage ever drops below 100 % , and you ’re ready to enjoy the fearless refactoring and the rock solid regression testing suite that your software engineering rigor has now earned you .
But are you really covered ?
What does 100 % code coverage mean in your project ?
Is it enough to know that your test suite encounters every line of code ?
Or do n’t you want to be sure that it exercises every line ?
If you simply encounter the line without asserting that it produces the correct results , are you any better off ? [ 1 ]
Failure to assert
Just achieving 100 % code coverage is the easy part .
Making it mean something : that ’s where the real value kicks in .
Consider the ease with which we can get to 100 % line coverage on the following code ( generated using Rails 2.1 scaffolding ) .
class ProductsController < ApplicationController # GET / products # GET / products.xml def index @products = Product . find ( : all ) respond_to do | format | format .
html # index.html.erb format .
xml { render : xml => @products } end end # ... remaining methods omitted end
In order to ensure that the #index method is performing all its proper duties , we ’ll define the following “ test case . ”
require File .
dirname ( __FILE__ ) + '/../test_helper ' class ProductsControllerTest < ActionController :: TestCase def test_should_get_index get : index end # ... remaining tests omitted end
We ’ll use rcov to assess the results .
And just like that , we have 100 % code coverage for the #index method . [ 2 ]
In this case though , that clearly means nothing more than the fact that we encountered 100 % of the lines in the method .
When code coverage is that easily achieved , it hardly seems cause for celebration .
To get any real value from the test , we need to actually assert that we ’re getting the expected results .
Until we do so , we have nothing more than incidental coverage . [ 3 ]
The test code provided by the Rails scaffolding gets us closer to where we want to be .
require File .
dirname ( __FILE__ ) + '/../test_helper ' class ProductsControllerTest < ActionController :: TestCase def test_should_get_index get : index assert_response : success assert_not_nil assigns ( : products ) end # ... remaining tests omitted end
The tests pass , and our code coverage is still at 100 % .
At this point we ’ve significantly increased the value of that particular test .
No longer does the code have to crash spectacularly in order to yield a test error .
Instead , exiting the method with anything other than a success response code will result in a test failure .
Similarly , failure to set the @products instance variable will cause the test case to flunk . [ 4 ]
100 % covered . 50 % tested .
But while we ’ve improved on the initial test case , at best we ’re really only halfway to where we want to be .
What would our test suite tell us if we were to alter line 9 as follows .
class ProductsController < ApplicationController # GET / products # GET / products.xml def index @products = Product . find ( : all ) respond_to do | format | format .
html # index.html.erb format .
xml { raise : fatal_error } end end # ... remaining methods omitted end
$ ruby products_controller_test.rb Loaded suite products_controller_test Started ........ Finished in 0.17716 seconds .
8 tests , 15 assertions , 0 failures , 0 errors
Unfortunately , our test suite still blindly gives a thumbs up , despite the fact that any attempt to access the XML - formatted output would yield an exception .
While our test suite includes assertions for how the application should prepare an HTML - bound response , our coverage of the XML - specific logic in line 9 remains merely incidental .
If we want our automated test suite to ensure that the #index method remains capable of producing an XML - formatted response as our codebase changes over time , we ’d need to add a test case to exercise that code .
class ProductsControllerTest < ActionController :: TestCase def test_should_get_index_formatted_for_html get :index assert_response : success assert_not_nil assigns ( : products ) end def test_should_get_index_formatted_for_xml @request . env [ ' HTTP_ACCEPT ' ] = ' application /xml ' get : index assert_response : success assert_not_nil assigns ( : products ) end # ... remaining tests omitted end
rcov does n’t reward us with any extra credit for writing this test case , but achieving 100 % coverage is not the primary goal of a good test suite . [ 5 ]
The primary goal is to ensure that the code satisfies the requirements .
If the application really is required to provide an XML - formatted list of products , then we should seriously consider defining a test for that functionality in our test suite . [ 6 ]
Size matters
In the examples above , we started off with a 5 - line method that had 100 % line coverage but lacked any assertions .
That scenario provides some insight into other places where we might find a high percentage of incidental coverage .
While long methods are a bad idea in general , the simple act of invoking a method may be enough to register it as having 100 % coverage .
If our test suite results in the execution of a 25 - line method with no branches , all 25 lines are considered to be covered , regardless of whether we perform any assertions to verify the results of those 25 lines .
Even if we refactor the code into smaller methods , if we do n’t unit test those new methods , we ’re still left with nothing more than incidental coverage .
Use it wisely
If your goal is to achieve 100 % coverage , then incidental coverage is your friend , but your test suite will fall far short of its full potential .
You ’ll run the risk of acquiring a false sense of security , and the ability to safely and fearlessly refactor is out the window .
Changes or enhancements to your application will occur without the safety net of a full regression suite .
If your goal is instead to develop a comprehensive test suite to A ) validate your application ’s functionality and B ) ensure that you build just enough software , then test - driven development ( TDD ) is your friend ( as are peer reviews and / or pair programming ) .
And subsequently , you ’ll enjoy the nice side effect of 100 % code coverage , because you ’ll only build the code necessary to satisfy your tests .
Notes
[ 1 ] Sure , you know that the line executes without causing the application to crash ( at least for this set of inputs ) , but does a lack of crashing really constitute success ?
Not likely .
[ 2 ]
While we have 100 % line coverage for the #index method , we do n’t have 100 % coverage for the ProductsController class as a whole .
As the full coverage report shows , the tests provided with the Rails scaffolding do not cover the exception cases in the #create and #update methods .
[ 3 ]
Incidental coverage is just as valuable as that guy that puts in “ face time ” at the office .
He ’s physically present at least 8 hours every day .
People see him there .
He ’s at the office .
He must be doing something .
Right ?
[ 4 ]
At this point we ’ve gone from covering nothing to covering something .
That ’s good , but we should ask ourselves whether we ’re performing the most appropriate assertions for this test case .
For example , is it enough to assert that assigns ( : products ) is not nil , or should we be making a stronger assertion about its value ?
Do we want to ensure that we ’re rendering the intended view templates ?
What about verifying the content of the HTML ( or XML ) that gets rendered ?
Tackling issues specific to testing Rails controllers would take away from the focus of this post , but the strength of assertions and the layers at which we test is surely fodder for future posts .
[ 5 ]
However , with anything less than 100 % coverage , fearless refactoring and full regression testing simply is n’t something your test suite can provide .
In Software Testing Techniques ( 1996 ) , Boris Beizer takes the hardline on anyone that would consider developing a codebase without at least 100 % line coverage : “ [ Line coverage ] is the weakest measure in the family [ of structural coverage criteria ] : testing less than this for new software is unconscionable … ”
[ 6 ]
You could argue that this new test case is too similar to the original test case , that it needs stronger assertions , or that the current functionality is too simple for this new test case to offer sufficient benefit , but it ’s up to you to assess how important automated testing is of that code .
If you opt to not test your application ’s ability to provide an XML - formatted list of products , you must not allow your 100 % line coverage to give you a false sense of security about your code .
That code may be covered , but it ’s not tested .
This post is part of the Testing Anti-patterns series : a series of essays taken from a conference talk titled , How To Fail With 100 % Test Coverage .

From The Prosecution of George W. Bush For Murder
How has George Bush reacted to the hell he created in Iraq , to the thousands of lives that have been lost in the war , and to the enormous and endless suffering that the survivors of the victims -- their loved ones -- have had to endure ?
I 've always felt that impressions are very important in life , and other than " first impressions , " they are usually right .
Why ?
Because impressions , we know , are formed over a period of time .
They are the accumulation of many words and incidents , many or most of which one has forgotten , but which are nonetheless assimilated into the observer 's subconscious and thus make their mark .
In other words , you forgot the incident , but it added to the impression .
" How do you feel about David ?
Do you feel he's an honest person ? "
" Yeah , I do . "
" Why do you say that about him ?
Can you give me any examples that would cause you to say he 's honest ? "
" No , not really , at least not off the top of my head .
But I 've known David for over ten years , and my sense is that he 's an honest person . "
I have a very distinct impression that with the exception of a vagrant tear that may have fallen if he was swept up , in the moment , at an emotional public ceremony for American soldiers who have died in the war , George Bush has n't suffered at all over the monumental suffering , death , and horror he has caused by plunging this nation into the darkness of the Iraq war , probably never losing a wink of sleep over it .
Sure , we often hear from Bush administration sources , or his family , or from Bush himself , about how much he suffers over the loss of American lives in Iraq .
But that dog wo n't run .
How do we just about know this is nonsense ?
Not only because the words he has uttered could never have escaped from his lips if he were suffering , but because no matter how many American soldiers have died on a given day in Iraq ( averaging well over two every day ) , he is always seen with a big smile on his face that same day or the next , and is in good spirits .
How would that be possible if he was suffering ?
For example , the November 3 , 2003 , morning New York Times front - page headline story was that the previous day in Fallouja , Iraq , insurgents " shot down an American helicopter just outside the city in a bold assault that killed 16 soldiers and wounded 20 others .
It was the deadliest attack on American troops since the United States invaded Iraq in March . "
Yet later in that same day when Bush arrived for a fund - raiser in Birmingham , Alabama , he was smiling broadly , and Mike Allen of the Washington Post wrote that " the President appeared to be in a fabulous mood . "
This is merely one of hundreds of such observations made about Bush while the brutal war continued in Iraq .
And even when Bush is off camera , we have consistently heard from those who have observed him up close how much he seems to be enjoying himself .
When Bush gave up his miles of running several times a week because of knee problems , he took up biking .
" He 's turned into a bike maniac , " said Mark McKinnon in March of 2005 , right in the middle of the war .
McKinnon , a biking friend of Bush 's who was Bush 's chief media strategist in his 2004 reelection campaign , also told the New York Times 's Elisabeth Bumiller about Bush : " He 's as calm and relaxed and confident and happy as I 've ever seen him . "
Happy ?
Under the horrible circumstances of the war , where Bush 's own soldiers are dying violent deaths , how is that even possible ?
In a time of war and suffering , Bush 's smiles , joking , and good spirits stand in stark contrast to the demeanor of everyone of his predecessors and could n't possibly be more inappropriate .
Michael Moore , in his motion picture documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 , captured this fact and the superficiality of Bush well with a snippet from a TV interview Bush gave on the golf course following a recent terrorist attack .
Bush said , " I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers .
Thank you . "
Then , without missing a single beat , he said in reference to a golf shot he was about to hit : " Now watch this drive . "
Before I get into specific instances of Bush laughing and having fun throughout the entire period of the inferno he created in Iraq , I want to discuss a number of more indirect but revealing incidents that reflect he could not care less about the human suffering and carnage going on in Iraq , or anywhere .
1 . The first inkling I got that Bush did n't care about the suffering or anyone , not just those dying in Iraq , was from an article in the September 22 , 2001 , New York Times just eleven days after 9/11 .
Though 3,000 Americans had been murdered and the nation was in agony and shock , the man who should have been leading the mourning was , behind the scenes , not affected in the tiniest way .
The article , by Frank Bruni , said that " Mr. Bush 's nonchalant , jocular demeanor remains the same .
In private , say several Republicans close to the administration , he still slaps backs and uses baseball terminology , at one point promising that the terrorists were not ' going to steal home on me . '
He is not staying up all night , or even most of the night .
He is taking time to play with his dogs and his cat .
He is working out most days . "
So right after several thousand Americans lost their lives in a horrible catastrophe , behind the scenes Bush is his same old backslapping self , and he's not letting the tragedy interfere in the slightest way with the daily regimen of his life that he enjoys .
In fact , he himself admitted to the magazine Runners World ( August 23 , 2002 ) that after the Afghanistan war began : " I have been running with a little more intensity . . .
It helps me to clear my mind . "
( In other words , Bush likes to clear his mind of the things he 's supposed to be thinking about . )
Remarkably finding time in the most important job on earth to run six days a week , Bush added : " It 's interesting that my times have become faster . . .
For me , the psychological benefit [ in running ] is enormous .
You tend to forget everything that 's going on in your mind and just concentrate on the time and distance . "
But even this obscene indulgence after 9/11 and during wartime by the man with more responsibility than anyone in the world was n't enough for Bush .
He told the magazine : " I try to go for longer runs , but it 's tough around here at the White House on the outdoor track .
It 's sad that I can't run longer .
It 's one of the saddest things about the presidency . "
Imagine that .
Among all the things that the president of the United States could be sad about during a time of war , not being able to run longer six days a week is up there near the top of the list .
A New York Times article not long after 9/11 ( November 5 , 2001 ) reported that Bush had told his friends ( obviously with pride ) that " his runs on the Camp David trails through the Maryland woods have produced his fastest time in a decade , three miles in 21 minutes and 6 seconds . "
USA Today ( October 29 , 2001 ) reported that Bush used to run 3 miles in 25 minutes and now he was " boasting to friends and staffers " about his new time , and was " now running 4 miles a day . "
So with his approval rating soaring to 90 percent in the wake of 9/11 -- and with his being the main person in America whose job required that he be totally engaged every waking hour in working diligently on this nation 's response to 9/11 -- Bush , remarkably , was working diligently on improving his time for the mile .
I ask you , what American president in history , Republican or Democrat , would have conducted himself this way ?

2 . One thing about Bush .
He 's so dense that he makes remarks an intelligent person who was as much of a scoundrel as he would never make .
They 'd keep their feelings , which they would know to be very shameful , to themselves .
On December 21 , 2001 , just a few months after 9/11 -- a tragedy that shocked the nation and the world in which 3,000 Americans were consumed by fires , some choosing to jump to their deaths out of windows eighty or more stories high -- Bush , who could only have been thinking of himself , told the media : " All in all , it 's been a fabulous year for Laura and me . "
He said this because that is exactly the way he felt .
What difference does 9/11 make ?
I 'm president .
I love it , and Laura and I are having a ball .
Indeed , on January 20 , 2005 , right in the midst of the hell on earth Bush created in Iraq -- when the carnage there was near its worst and American soldiers and Iraqi citizens were dying violent deaths every day -- Bush , referring to himself and his wife , told thousands of partying supporters at one of his nine inaugural balls : " We 're having the time of our life . "
Can you even begin to imagine Roosevelt in the midst of the Second World War , Truman during the Korean War , or LBJ and Nixon during the Vietnam War , saying something like this ?
3 . Does it not stand to reason that if Bush were suffering over the daily killings and tragedy in Iraq , he would be working every waking hour to lessen the mounting number of casualties as well as find a way to satisfactorily end the terrible conflict ?
I mean , as president , that 's what you 'd expect of him , right ?
Is n't that his job ?
Yet we know that although Bush is still in office , he has already spent far more time on vacation than any other president in American history .
For instance , by April 11 , 2004 ( he was inaugurated January 20 , 2001 ) , he had visited his cherished ranch in Crawford a mind - boggling thirty - three times and spent almost eight months of his presidency there .
Although the office of the presidency follows the president wherever he goes twenty - four hours a day , and at least some part of every day on vacation , no matter how small , was spent by Bush attending to his duties as president , we also know that Bush 's main purpose when he goes on vacation , obviously and by definition , is to vacation , not work .
CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller , who travels with Bush and keeps track of such things , told me that as of January 1 , 2008 , in Bush 's less than seven years as president , he visited his ranch in Texas an unbelievable 69 times , spending , per Knoller , " all or part of 448 days on vacation there . "
As amazing as this is , Bush also made , Knoller says , 132 visits to Camp David during this period , spending " all or part of 421 days there , " and 10 visits to his family 's vacation compound at Kennebunkport , Maine , spending " all or part of 39 days there . "
So the bottom line is that of a total of approximately 2,535 days as president , most of them during a time of war , Bush spent all or a part or 908 days , an incredible 36 percent of his time , on vacation or at retreat places .
Hard to believe , but true .
Nine hundred and eight days is two and a half years of Bush 's presidency .
Two and a half years of the less than seven years of his presidency in which his main goal was to kick back and have fun .
You see , the White House digs , with a pool , theater , gymnasium , etc. , were n't enjoyable enough for Bush .
He wanted a more enjoyable place to be during his life as president . *
My position in life is infinitely less important than Bush 's , yet during the above same period of Bush 's presidency , I not only worked much longer hours every day than Bush , I worked seven days a week , never took one vacation , and only took three days off to go to the desert with my wife to celebrate our fiftieth wedding anniversary .
If it had not been for the anniversary , I would n't have even taken those three days off .
I realize I take working to an extreme , living by the clock each day , always looking up to see how much time I have left , working from morning to morning ( retiring usually around two in the morning and starting my day at ten in the morning ) .
Still , it is striking to consider that in seven years , I took 3 days off and Bush , the president of the United States , took 908 .
Even Americans who lead a more normal life than I , even fat - cat corporate executives , have n't taken anywhere near the time away from their work that Bush has .
Indeed , I think we can safely say that even though Bush has the most important and demanding job in this entire land , he has irresponsibly taken far more time off from his job to have fun during the past seven years than any worker or company executive in America !!!
Is Bush , or is he not , a disgrace of the very first order ?
* * *
* Remarkably , during his campaign for reelection in 2004 Bush very frequently spoke of the " hard work " he and his administration were engaging in .
This was the first time I had ever heard an American president speak of the " hard work " involved in his job .
I have heard them speak of the immense " burden " of the office of the presidency being responsible for the destiny and welfare of millions of people .
But you see , for someone like Bush who was born on home plate and thought he had hit a home run , anything he does , any effort at all , he considers " hard work . "

ECON 101 : Credit Crunch for Dummies
A step - by - step look at what caused the nation 's economic troubles .
March 20 , 2008  --
Is your head spinning these days trying follow what is going on with the economy ?
Subprime .
Collateralized Debt Obligations .
Liquidity .
Every day it seems as if these words -- which nobody you knew was using just a few months ago -- are being thrown around .
The stock market is down .
Government officials are scrambling to find ways to help the economy .
And a lot of people are talking about a recession .
So what does it all mean ?
And how did this all begin , especially when just a few years ago the economy was booming thanks to the red - hot real estate market ?
Well , that 's where the problem starts .
A combination of low interest rates and aggressive new lending practices in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to a buying frenzy .
Many banks were enticing first - time home buyers into the market with pitches of " historically low interest rates " and " no down payment required . "
In June 2003 , the Federal Reserve had lowered its key Fed Funds interest rate to just 1 percent .
Mortgage rates were of course higher , but were still considered a relative bargain .
Banks had also changed the way they made loans , opening up the American dream of homeownership to a whole new group of people who had always considered themselves renters .
The Mortgage Boom
With rising home values , almost everyone believed they could get rich just by buying a home .
And pretty much everyone -- even those with terrible credit histories -- could get a home loan .
Many got adjustable - rate mortgages with low , introductory teaser rates that made their mortgage payments affordable .
Those rates would eventually reset to higher ones , but many owners planned to sell first or refinance .
Even high - risk borrowers -- if they made their mortgage payments on time and built up a good credit history -- could refinance into a more traditional fixed - rate mortgage before their interest rates reset .
And since the home would undoubtedly be worth more than it was just a few years ago , the banks were willing to lend out more money because the collateral for a loan -- the house -- would theoretically be worth even more in a year or two .
How Wall Street Profited
To facilitate some of these new loans to riskier borrowers , lenders and those on Wall Street came up with new ways to package them up and sell them off to big pension funds , private equity firms , mutual funds , foreign investors and any other investors looking to profit from the housing boom .
Gone were the good old days when everything was simpler , where a local bank manager who knew a borrower for years would issue a mortgage .
The idea behind these investments , known as collateralized debt obligations -- or CDOs -- is that by grouping hundreds or thousands of mortgages together the risk of loss because of nonpayment is significantly reduced .
In one group of mortgages -- say 1,000 homes -- 40 or so might not be paying on time .
But the profits you make off the other 960 mortgages will offset any losses you suffer from those 40 bad loans .
So what was once considered an undesirable mortgage to somebody with poor credit -- a so - called subprime borrower -- was now deemed a safe investment .
Wall Street rating agencies gave the investments their blessings , and investors started buying them thinking there was little risk and high reward to buying these mortgages .
But then things changed .
As adjustable mortgages started to reset to higher rates , more people started to default on their loans , making investors uncomfortable .
Two things started to happen .
First , banks and other lenders started to tighten their lending standards , realizing that they had been too liberal in who they lent money to .
Second , the value of these investments started to fall as more people defaulted .
Many banks and investment firms had these investments on their books as assets .
They had taken out various loans using these assets as collateral .
But as these bundles of loans declined in value , the banks decided to make fewer loans .
Simply put , lenders became more cautious .
Not only were they lending out less money for mortgages , they were lending out less money for pretty much everything else .
So if a manufacturing company needed to borrow $ 10 million to add a second assembly line to grow its business , it now found fewer banks willing to lend it the cash .
The same held true for large corporations that wanted to borrow money to buy out other companies .
Starting in September 2007 , the Federal Reserve has tried to make it more affordable for individuals , banks and companies to borrow by lowering interest rates , which also makes it easier for banks themselves to borrow money directly from the Fed .
But there have been many bumps along the way .
Just last week , investors started to question the health of Wall Street brokerage firm Bear Stearns and pulled their money out of investments there .
As everybody pulled their money out at the same time , the investment bank collapsed .
Home Prices
While all of this has been occurring on Wall Street , home prices across the country have been falling .
It started with the rise in foreclosures , which created a surplus of homes on the market .
Further compounding the situation , lenders have now tightened the standards of who can borrow money to buy a home .
So there are more homes now available for purchase and fewer people who can buy them .
That causes prices to fall .
Real estate agents suffered .
So did mortgage lenders , real estate appraisers and everybody else involved with the sale of a house .
Developers stopped building new homes because the demand was no longer there and they could n't get the same price for their products .
But it did n't end there .
The home improvement industry also suffered .
With homes worth less , homeowners no longer have as large home equity lines and can't afford to put in that new deck or buy that new refrigerator .
Additionally , since fewer people were buying homes , there was less renovating .
So that meant decreased sales of paint , new sofas or whatever else people typically buy when moving into a new house .
Recession Watch
So that 's the housing market and the world of Wall Street .
But why are we now talking about a full - scale recession hitting all parts of the economy ?
It all comes down to consumer confidence .
Americans have much of their savings and their sense of wealth tied up in their homes .
When home prices start to fall , that feeling of wealth disappears .
Whether they are really worse off today than than they were a month ago does n't matter .
What matters is that they feel poorer , which in turn leads them to spend less .
While many economists believe that we are already in a recession , the official determination of when a recession begins and ends comes from a committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research called the Business Cycle Dating Committee .
The group 's definition of a recession is : " a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real GDP , real income , employment , industrial production and wholesale - retail sales . "
The widely held maxim of " two quarters of negative growth " is not a requirement for a recession , but that is often the easiest attribute to see when a recession occurs .
Falling wages are not always part of a recession , and inflation - adjusted income has not fallen substantially during five of the past nine recessions .
This was true during the most recent recession in 2001 , when fast growth in productivity and declines in the price of imports , especially oil , raised purchasing power while employment was falling .
It has been almost seven years since the last U.S. recession , which was from March to November 2001 .
Before then , there was a recession from July 1990 to March 1991 , and a previous one beginning in July 1981 and ending in November 1982 .
Caravan World Congress Google Android phones are n't even on vapourware yet , but already Symbian is already welcoming the challenge .
We asked Symbian executives how they propose to fight a free , or even an ad- subsidized , OS rival from Google .
It 's a question everyone 's asking of vendors who go to market with an OS that costs real folding stuff .
EVP of marketing Jorgen Behrens replied that integrating an OS into a consumer product was costly , and that Symbian 's integration costs were lower than rivals .
He also questioned if Google would be there when trouble struck .
" I remember sitting in a room with NTT DoCoMo and for three hours they gave us a very difficult time over a bug in the kernel .
I can't imagine Google sitting in that room , " he said .
Behrens is picking up on Google 's reputation for hands - on support .
Or complete lack of it .

Executives were speaking on the day Symbian released its financial results .
As a private company , it 's not obliged to so , but does anyway .
Really to show off , as much as anything else .
The unaudited figures show that Symbian OS was in 22.4 m phones in the final quarter of 2007 , up from 14.6 m a year ago , and 20.4 m in Q3 .
The company booked £ 56.5 m of turnover , of which £ 52.7 m comes from royalties .
77.3 m Symbian phones shipped last year , giving Symbian revenue of £ 194.3 m for the full year .
The average royalty per unit was $ 4.30 , down from $ 5.10 a year ago , reflecting Symbian 's new lower royalty rate for high volume phones .
MD Nigel Clifford said there was no point Symbian creaming a profit when it could lower the cost and try and grow the market .
Of course , we do n't know how much profit Symbian makes at the end of the day , because it does n't release the figures .
The company now employs over 1,400 staff , including a development office in China .
( Symbian says it 's stealing market share from Linux in both China and Japan .
The US is the only geographic region where Symbian phones do n't dominate the smartphone segment . )
According to Clifford , China surpassed the USA in smartphones last year .

Importing PDB file into Blender
Because it seems some of the readers may be interested in importing PDB file into Blender , here ’s a short guide how to do it .
Actually , there are two approaches to do it .
First is represented by image of molecular manipulator , the second by image of NspA ( two last pictures above ) .
Use pdb2blend script :
Download pdb2blend converter , open it in Blender and run it ( Alt + P ) .
Now , in the script window you can choose some options , like representation ( balls , sticks and balls or sticks ) or choose level of refinement .
After import , the structure in chosen representation will appear in the 3D window with atoms colored according to schema in the script .
There ’s actually one caveat – spheres prepared with this script when rendered with ambient occlusion exhibit a weird pattern seen below .
I ’m not Blender expert so I have no idea how to solve it .
Second way of importing PDB structure into Blender in almost any representation is to use STL format .
At least two molecular viewers are able to export structure in STL format : VMD and PMV ( Python Molecular Viewer ) .
I use PMV more often because it can export STL file with custom quality .
Unfortunately , colors are not preserved in STL files from both programs ( or Blender cannot read it , I ’m not really sure ) .
So , the you open PDB file in either of this programs , choose representation and then export / save as STL ( in VMD this option is available under “ Render ” ) .
After import the only thing left is to remove double vertices ( edit mode , select all , edit -> vertices -> remove doubles ) .
Voilla .
You have molecular structures inside Blender .
Tonight I spent over an hour learning that there are two functions called “ forM_ ” in haskell .
The first , which I was already familiar with , lives in Control .
Monad .
Its purpose is to take a list of values , apply some function to them all to produce a list of actions , and then run these actions one after the other .
The other one , which I did not know about , lives in Data .
Foldable .
It does exactly the same job , but it works on any “ Foldable ” data type ; ie .
those which can be collapsed / folded in some way to a single summary value .
Lists are foldable .
Maps are also foldable ( across their elements , not their keys ) .
And this was the cause of my perplexification this evening ; I had been storing my data in a list , and using forM_ ( the monadic one , the only which I knew about ! ) to process it .
At some point , I decided to change to storing my data in a map instead , and ran the compiler to see the errors which would point me to the bits of code I needed to fix up .
Except the compiler happily compiled everything without errors .
* confusion *
Much headscratching followed , until eventually I added “ - ddump- tc ” to get ghc to dump out the results of its typechecking pass .
This lead me to the root cause : I had been picking up forM_ from Data .
Foldable all along , not Control .
Monad .
Duh !
Everything had been working fine up until then , since Foldable .
forM_ and Monad.forM_ operate identically on lists .
But the former also works on Data .
Maps whereas the latter does not .
I ’m sure there ’s a moral to this story .
I ’m just not sure what it is yet .

US issues threat to Iraq ’s $ 50 bn foreign reserves in military deal
By Patrick Cockburn
Friday , 6 June 2008
Â© 2008 Independent News and Media Limited
The US is holding hostage some $ 50 bn ( Â£ 25 bn ) of Iraq ’s money in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to pressure the Iraqi government into signing an agreement seen by many Iraqis as prolonging the US occupation indefinitely , according to information leaked to The Independent .
US negotiators are using the existence of $ 20bn in outstanding court judgments against Iraq in the US , to pressure their Iraqi counterparts into accepting the terms of the military deal , details of which were reported for the first time in this newspaper yesterday .
Iraq ’s foreign reserves are currently protected by a presidential order giving them immunity from judicial attachment but the US side in the talks has suggested that if the UN mandate , under which the money is held , lapses and is not replaced by the new agreement , then Iraq ’s funds would lose this immunity .
The cost to Iraq of this happening would be the immediate loss of $ 20 bn .
The US is able to threaten Iraq with the loss of 40 per cent of its foreign exchange reserves because Iraq ’s independence is still limited by the legacy of UN sanctions and restrictions imposed on Iraq since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in the 1990s .
This means that Iraq is still considered a threat to international security and stability under Chapter Seven of the UN charter .
The US negotiators say the price of Iraq escaping Chapter Seven is to sign up to a new “ strategic alliance ” with the United States .
The threat by the American side underlines the personal commitment of President George Bush to pushing the new pact through by 31 July .
Although it is in reality a treaty between Iraq and the US , Mr Bush is describing it as an alliance so he does not have to submit it for approval to the US Senate .
Iraqi critics of the agreement say that it means Iraq will be a client state in which the US will keep more than 50 military bases .
American forces will be able to carry out arrests of Iraqi citizens and conduct military campaigns without consultation with the Iraqi government .
American soldiers and contractors will enjoy legal immunity .
The US had previously denied it wanted permanent bases in Iraq , but American negotiators argue that so long as there is an Iraqi perimeter fence , even if it is manned by only one Iraqi soldier , around a US installation , then Iraq and not the US is in charge .
The US has security agreements with many countries , but none are occupied by 151,000 US soldiers as is Iraq .
The US is not even willing to tell the government in Baghdad what American forces are entering or leaving Iraq , apparently because it fears the government will inform the Iranians , said an Iraqi source .
The fact that Iraq ’s financial reserves , increasing rapidly because of the high price of oil , continue to be held in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is another legacy of international sanctions against Saddam Hussein .
Under the UN mandate , oil revenues must be placed in the Development Fund for Iraq which is in the bank .
The funds are under the control of the Iraqi government , though the US Treasury has strong influence on the form in which the reserves are held .
Iraqi officials say that , last year , they wanted to diversify their holdings out of the dollar , as it depreciated , into other assets , such as the euro , more likely to hold their value .
This was vetoed by the US Treasury because American officials feared it would show lack of confidence in the dollar .
Iraqi officials say the consequence of the American action was to lose Iraq the equivalent of $ 5 bn .
Given intense American pressure on a weak Iraqi government very dependent on US support , it is still probable that the agreement will go through with only cosmetic changes .
Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the immensely influential Shia cleric , could prevent the pact by issuing a fatwa against it but has so far failed to do so .
The Grand Ayatollah met Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , the leader of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) , which is the main supporter of the Iraqi government , earlier this week and did not condemn the agreement or call for a referendum .
He said , according to Mr Hakim , that it must guarantee Iraqi national sovereignty , be transparent , command a national consensus and be approved by the Iraqi parliament .
Critics of the deal fear that the government will sign the agreement , and parliament approve it , in return for marginal concessions .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain this morning categorised the time frame for US troops withdrawal from Iraq as " not too important " and suggested he is prepared for a long - term commitment there .
" We are succeeding " in Iraq , he said .
" And it 's fascinating that Senator Obama does n't realise that . "
The remarks provided an immediate opportunity for presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama 's campaign to bring the war back to the forefront of the race .
He has been a steadfast opponent of the war since 2002 .
His campaign responded immediately and forcefully this morning , lining up a team of surrogates who said McCain 's statements show he does n't understand the nature of the conflict there and is out of touch with the desire of the American people to see an end to the deployment .
" This is yet one further indication of his really striking lack of appreciation of the burden that Iraq is placing on our military , and the fact that we are facing a fundamental problem of strategic overstretch , " Obama foreign policy adviser Susan Rice said during a conference call with reporters .
Former Navy secretary Richard Danzig said McCain 's remarks contribute to the " jihadi narrative " about US ambitions in the region .
" It 's very unfortunate that when we are being accused of planning to have permanent bases and to occupy Arab lands … to have an aspirant for the presidency of the United States to say it would n't be at all important if we stayed there indefinitely , " Danzig said .
Massachusetts senator John Kerry , like McCain a Navy veteran of Vietnam , said the remarks betray " an enormous fundamental flaw in his candidacy for presidency , which supposedly has hung on his strength on foreign policy " .
House speaker Nancy Pelosi , a Democrat , said McCain 's remarks , are " yet another indication how out of touch he is with the effect the war in Iraq is having on the readiness of our military " .
Obama supporters also pointed to what they say are McCain 's shifting proposals on Iraq .
In January , McCain said US forces could be in Iraq as long as 100 years , but recently retreated , predicting most combat troops would be out of the country by 2013 if he is elected .
Also this morning , the Arizona senator also called on the nation 's gas and oil companies to increase investment in alternative energy , saying it would lessen the US dependence on foreign oil and curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" The oil companies have got to be more participatory in alternate energy , in sharing their profits in a variety of ways , " he said on NBC's Today Show .
With average US gasoline prices topping $ 4 a gallon and crude oil breaching $ 120 a barrel , McCain and Obama have begun a robust debate over energy policy .
Both say they are committed to developing alternative energy sources .
McCain promotes nuclear energy , and maintains the free market will encourage innovation in other clean energy sources .
He also favours giving consumers a break on the federal gasoline tax this summer , a proposal that Obama rejects and that economists of all stripes say would be ineffective in reducing prices at the pump .
Obama proposes mandating better fuel efficiency from automobile manufacturers , and investing $ 150 bn over ten years in clean energy research .
He has also called for a windfall profits tax on oil companies , which the McCain camp derides as a return to failed Carter - era energy policy that will harm consumers .
McCain is also seeking to win over environmentally conscious independent voters in calling for increase alternative energy production .
Polls have shown high energy costs are a top issue for voters this year .
" If we 're truly going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country , we have to go to alternate energy , " he said .
" And the technology is there , and the innovation is there , and we can unleash it . "
McCain predicted that the price of gasoline would not drop " much lower " before the November election " and could go higher " .
Meanwhile , a newly released poll shows Obama has gained support among woman voters since Clinton withdrew from the race .
His lead over John McCain among women rose to 13 percentage points from five points since the end of May , according to a new Gallup poll .
MONACO ( Reuters ) - Energy storage is an unglamorous pillar of an expected revolution to clean up the world ’s energy supply but will soon vie for investors attention with more alluring sources of energy like solar panels , manufacturers say .

“ It ’s been in the background until now .
It ’s not sexy .
It ’s the enabler , not a source of energy , ” said Tim Hennessy , chief executive of Canadian battery makers VRB Power , speaking on the sidelines of a “ CleanEquity ” technologies conference in Monaco .
VRB will start mass production this year of a longer - lasting rival to the lead acid battery currently used to store energy for example produced by solar panel , Hennessy said .
Low carbon - emitting renewable energy is in vogue , driven by fears over climate change , spiraling oil prices and fears over energy supply and security .
While the supply of the wind and sun far exceeds humanity ’s needs it does n’t necessarily match the time when people need it : the sun may not be shining nor the wind blowing when we need to cook dinner or have a shower .
Soaring production of solar panel and wind turbines is now spurring a race to develop the winning energy storage technologies which will drive the electric cars and appliances of the future .
The race is heating up as manufacturers with entirely different solutions near the moment of commercial production .
For example , UK - based ITM
Power sees the future of energy storage in the explosive gas hydrogen .
The company is developing a piece of kit called an electrolyzer which uses solar or wind power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The hydrogen is then stored in a pressurized container until it is needed , whether to drive a car , produce electricity or for cooking .
“ With batteries you ’re taking enormous quantities of basic raw materials , ” said Chief Executive Jim Heathcote , referring to cadmium in nickel cadmium varieties .
His company won an award for research at the Monaco conference , organized by corporate finance advisers Innovator Capital .
“ Two things we ’re confident of is the supply of renewable energy and water , ” he said .
ITM Power aims to start production later this year of electrolyzers and next year of hydrogen fuel cells which generate electricity .
“ The one problem everyone ’s had is how to store .
The ability to take ( surplus ) renewable energy and make useful fuel out of it is almost priceless , ” Heathcote said .
RICH
The economic opportunities are highlighted by a third company , U.S. - based EnerDel , which aims to supply batteries for the “ Th!nk City ” electric vehicle , manufactured by Norway ’s Think Global .
In the case of electric cars , cheap , lightweight batteries are needed to power motors , and will eliminate carbon emissions if the batteries are charged using renewable power sources .
EnerDel has patented a lithium - ion battery which it says is lighter and cheaper than the nickel metal hydride batteries currently used in hybrid electric cars such as the Toyota Prius .
“ I think energy storage is the next frontier , ” said Charles Gassenheimer , chairman of EnerDel ’s owners Ener1 Inc .
The “ Th!nk ” car could be the world ’s first mass production electric vehicle , starting in earnest in 2009 .
It will go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in about 8 seconds and have a range of up to 100 miles , said Gassenheimer .
Investors have given their thumbs up to Ener1 , which now has a market capitalization of around $ 700 million , a ten - fold increase over two years ago .
After a long two - week hiatus -- during which I did n't know what to do with myself from 11 pm to midnight -- Jon Stewart and his crack " Daily Show " staff had a lot to catch up on Monday night .
Luckily for them , there was no shortage of absurdities to mock , ranging from Phil Gramm 's demeaning remarks about American " whiners " to the Viagra / birth control conundrum Carly Fiorina got McCain embroiled in .
It 's nice to have you back , Jon .

By the way did you know that while we were gone for two weeks the Presidential race was not suspended ?
Not only that , they ratcheted the f*#%-ups by releasing the surrogates .
As you know only two men can run for President at any one time and obviously they can't be everywhere .
They 're not Mario Lopez for God 's sake .
So they have friends , surrogates , meat - puppets if you will , people who can amplify their message across a broad range of media .

Uh in the case of Senator John McCain , his surrogate 's job , to ease voters concerns over traditional Republican weak spots , like the economy when people are suffering the GOP can occasionally appear callous , dismissive of real people 's needs while seemingly unwilling to lend a helping hand to regular folk because they 're too busy , uh , cupping Exxon 's balls .
So ... they send out people like Phil Gramm , John McCain 's chief economic advisor to talk to an editorial board , as the one at the Washington Times to let Americans know John McCain feels their pain .
[ Cut to video . ]
You read more about the Phil Gramm influenced McCain plan to fix the economy in his new position paper , Walk It Off America , My Ten Point Plan For You P%# %@es To Learn To Suck It Up. Seriously , what Phil , this is ...uh... Phil Gramm 's comment is offensive in two ways .
One , it 's insensitive , and two , how 's an economic expert not understand that most of our whining jobs have already gone to India ?
Now , you know they do n't do it cheaper they do it better .
After something like that the McCain campaign needs another surrogate to go out and kill off the first surrogate .
Uh ..it 's like an adoption .
You adopt a kid it does n't work out you got to adopt a bigger kid to muscle the other kid out of the house .
Am I right is that how it ... wha ... wha...?
I 'm not a good parent .
So here we go former CEO of Hewlitt Packard Carly Fiorina .

In your face Gramm !
Carly Fiorina will be talking for John McCain from now on .
Not just about economic issues .
Issues that are important to women like last Wednesday when she said " There are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but they Wo n't cover birth control medication .
Those women would like a choice . "
She speaks for , she speaks for you .
She speaks for you , right John McCain ?
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton on Saturday will officially suspend her campaign for the presidency and " express her support for Senator Obama and party unity , " her campaign said Wednesday .
Sen . Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that she will let her supporters and party leaders decide her course .
The Clinton campaign said she will make the announcement at " an event in Washington , D.C. , " where she will also thank her supporters .
Sen. Barack Obama and Clinton were in Washington on Wednesday to each address the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
The candidates ran into each other at the AIPAC conference and had a brief chat , Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass said .
" She 's an extraordinary leader of the Democratic Party and has made history alongside me over the last 16 months .
I 'm very proud to have competed against her , " Obama told the Israel lobbying group .
Obama became his party 's presumptive nominee Tuesday and will be looking to unite Democrats divided by the long and contentious primary season .
" I am very confident how unified the Democratic Party is going to be to win in November , " he said in a Senate hallway Wednesday .

Some say that putting Clinton on the ticket might fit the bill for uniting Democrats .

What 's next for Sen. Hillary Clinton ?

Tonight 10 ET see full schedule »
Clinton lavished her opponent with praise Tuesday , saying he ran an " extraordinary race " and made politics more palatable for many .
Watch how the primary played out »
Prominent Clinton backer Rep. Charles Rangel , D - New York , thinks the New York senator could have been " far more generous " during her speech Tuesday night after it was clear that Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination .
Rangel , the senior member of the New York congressional delegation and an early supporter of Clinton 's presidential campaign , said Wednesday that Clinton should have been more clear about what her plans are .
" I would agree that after the math was in before her speech , that she could have been far more generous in terms of being more specific and saying that she wants a Democratic victory , " Rangel said on MSNBC .
" I do n't see what they 're talking about in prolonging this , " Rangel added .
" There 's nothing to prolong if you 're not going to take the fight to the convention floor .
... I do n't know why she could not have been more open in terms of doing up front what she intends to do later . "
But with some Democrats clamoring for her to join Obama on the ticket , and with the Democratic National Convention -- and thus , the official anointment -- still more than two months out , the senator from New York gave no hint as to her plans .
See VP prospects ' pros , cons »
She again invoked the popular vote , saying she snared " more votes than any primary candidate in history , " but primaries come down to delegates , and according to CNN calculations , Obama has her beaten , 2,156 to 1,923 .
Even the White House seemed convinced of Obama 's victory .
White House press secretary Dana Perino said Wednesday that President Bush congratulated Obama on becoming the first black nominee from a major party .
She said his win shows that the United States " has come a long way . "
Clinton vowed to keep fighting for an end to the war in Iraq , for universal health care , for a stronger economy and better energy policy , but she did n't indicate in what capacity she would wage these battles .
That , she said , would be up to her supporters and the party brass .
See what lies in store this fall »
The party 's best interests were high on the minds of party leaders Wednesday , as Sen. Harry Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin and DNC Chairman Howard Dean called on Democrats to focus on the general election .
" To that end , we are urging all remaining uncommitted superdelegates to make their decisions known by Friday of this week so that our party can stand united and begin our march toward reversing the eight years of failed Bush / McCain policies that have weakened our country , " said a statement from the four .
Billionaire businessman Bob Johnson , a close Clinton adviser and friend , said on CNN's " American Morning " on Wednesday that Obama could best forge party unity by offering Clinton the vice presidential slot .
A day after the final two primaries in South Dakota and Montana , Johnson sent a letter to House Majority Whip James Clyburn to lobby the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Clinton as Obama 's running mate .
Saying Clinton would " entertain the idea if it's offered , " Johnson said , " This is Sen .
Obama 's decision .
If the Congress members can come together and agree as I do that it would be in the best interest of the party to have Sen .
Clinton on the ticket , they carry that petition to Sen. Obama . "
Watch how the world reacted to Obama 's win »
" This is not a pressure .
This is elected officials giving their best judgment , " said Johnson , the founder of Black Entertainment Television .
Johnson 's letter to Clyburn says , " You know as well as I the deep affection that millions of African - Americans hold for both Senator Clinton and President Clinton . "
It continues , " But most important , we need to have the certainty of winning ; and , I believe , without question , that Barack Obama as president and Hillary Clinton as vice president bring that certainty to the ticket . "
Watch Johnson urge Obama to pick Clinton »
Johnson is one of many influential Clinton supporters who have raised the prospect of her joining Obama on the ticket .
They say she has solid credentials and wide appeal , exemplified by her popular support in states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio , which will be crucial to a Democratic victory in the fall .
Obama and Clinton spoke by phone for a few minutes Wednesday .
He told her he wants to " sit down when it makes sense " for her , said Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs .
Clinton said that would happen soon , Gibbs said , but he also said Obama did not raise the issue of the vice presidency .
Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe confirmed that there had been " absolutely zero discussions " on the matter .
The Clinton campaign issued a statement saying she was open to becoming vice president .
" She would do whatever she could to ensure that Democrats take the White House back and defeat John McCain , " the statement said .
CNN 's Alexander Mooney and Ed Hornick contributed to this report .

( 1..100 ) .inject ( &:+)

# Turns the symbol into a simple proc , which is especially useful for enumerations .
def to_proc
Proc.new { |*args| args.shift.__send__(self , * args ) }

The Ruby Way is the perfect second Ruby book for serious programmers .
The Ruby Way contains more than four hundred examples explaining how to do everything from distribute Ruby with Rinda to functional programming techniques .
( As someone pointed out , not all languages with centralized control evolve as slowly as Java .
But they still are centralized , they still impose a vision from the top .
The point is about central planning vs. the free market if you to toss another metaphor on the pile . )
The number of readers who seem unable to get past the literal syntax - as - solution of ( 1..100 ) .
inject (&:+) and grasp that the interesting bit is n’t the literal utility of that line of code , or that there are others ways to implement the same functionality , or that pet language X has an easier / smaller / cleaner mechanism for summing integers , or that there are “ better ” lines of “ cooler ” code , is really quite depressing to me .
Is it really so difficult to work out that the interesting bits are in the mere existence — or not — of that code at all , per the developer ’s whim ?
— Chris Cummer
( 1..100 ) .inject ( &:+)
( 1..100 ) .inject ( &:+)
Explanation : ( 1..100 ) creates a Range .
For our purposes , this is equivalent to a collection of the whole numbers from one to one hundred , inclusive ( The major way in which it differs from an array for us is that it does n’t actually require one hundred spots in memory .
Ranges are also useful for matching . )
The #inject method is called fold or reduce in other languages .
Expressed like this , it applies the “ + ” function to the elements of our range , giving us the sum .
Primary school students could tell you an easier way to obtain the sum , of course , but we will ignore that for now .
Ruby does n’t actually have a function called + .
What actually happens is that #inject wants a block .
The & operator converts Proc objects into blocks and block into Proc objects .
In this case , it tries to convert the symbol :+ into a block .
The conversion uses Ruby ’s built - in coercion mechanism .
That mechanism checks to see whether we have a Proc object .
If not , it sends the #to_proc method to the argument to make a Proc .
If the Symbol :+ has a # to_proc method , it will be called .
In Ruby 1.9 it has a # to_proc method .
That method returns a Proc that takes its first argument and sends the + method to it along with any other arguments that may be present .
So , & :+ really means { |x , y| x + y } .
And the whole thing gives us a simple sum , just as ( 1..100 ) .
inject (&:*) would give us the product .
Now that you know that , what does ( 1..100 ) . map ( & : to_s ) . map ( & : size ) do ?
[ back ]
My favourite ?
Really ?
Actually , yes .
Not the most powerful .
Not the most compelling .
Not even the most concise , and I do n’t defend it as being superior to ( 1..100 ) .
inject { |acc , n| acc + n } in any way .
And not my favourite line of code from any language : Ruby is n’t my favourite programming language , so it would be surprising if this were my all - time favourite line of code .
But it is — to me — a totemic line of Ruby code .
A line that demonstrates what a lot of Ruby is all about as a language .
Its good and its bad .
People have written to say that you coul duse sum or whatsis or jeebus to do the same thing in Ruby or in other languages , so this is a bad example .
No it ’s not !
Trying to write an unassailable line of code that everyone will worship for its perfection is a fool ’s errand .
The point is to demonstrate something of Ruby ’s character , especially in its evolution .
As someone wisely pointed out , the equivalent code in other languages need n’t sum the numbers from one to one hundred , it needs to demonstrate something about that language ’s culture and evolution .
Java might show something with generics and type erasure .
C# might do something with LINQ .
[ back ]
I want to show you my favourite line of ruby code :
This code works out of the box in Ruby 1.9 .
This also works in Ruby 1.8 with Rails , thanks to this chunk of code called “ Symbol#to_proc ” :
Now , I should explain what I like about it .
No , we are n’t going to debate whethercontains accidental complexity .
We are not going to talk about why this is better than whatever you would do in PHP or Visual Basic to sum the integers .
Let go of any idea that this article is about golf .
I like this line of code because it says a lot about how the Ruby language works .
I do not want to talk about those other things , they are not interesting to either of us .
The two things I do want to talk about are that : 1 . Somebody made Symbol#to_proc in Ruby 1.8 , and that 2 .
It became part of Ruby 1.9 .
Let ’s start with how it works .
Symbol #to_proc works because Symbol is an Open Class in Ruby .
And Ruby is Dynamically Typed , meaning you can modify classes and objects at run time , thus Symbol gets the to_proc method added when you run the above code .
( You sometimes see the expression “ Dynamic Typing ” used to describe a system where you do n’t need to write the type of an object before using it .
I call that “ Latent Typing ” and use the word “ Dynamic ” to describe a system where types can change thanks to adding or removing methods .
In this case , we are adding a method to every Symbol in a program , which is pretty dynamic . )
One of the things that really intrigues me this little snippet of code , , is that you can tell an awful lot about someone ’s attitude towards programming styles , languages , and cultural bias by asking them what they think of it .
It touches on functional programming , on brevity , and in this case , on open classes .
Take a moment to really think this through .
What do you think of the fact that someone sat down and modified one of Ruby ’s most core classes , Symbol ?
This is a decidedly non-trivial thing to do .
Changing Symbol in any way opens up a Pandora ’s box of risk .
You can break a lot of code .
You can — I beg your pardon , you — confuse people who have never heard of Symbol #to_proc .
Just so you can express “ Fold the numbers from one to one hundred using addition ” in a very direct manner eliminating the boilerplate of If Symbol was n’t an open class , how wouldhave been added to the language ?
Open classes and other “ turtles all the way down ” features are dangerous .
But dangerous features help a language evolve .
Lisp ’s macros are extremely dangerous .
And they are also what made it possible to discover / invent CLOS .
Had there been no macros , the only way to experiment with new ideas in OO would be to create whole new language , an exercise in Accidental Complexity .
When you look at a language like Java , you see this ponderous , bureaucratic process for language change .
Java does not include dangerous features like macros or open classes , and as a result change can only come from the language ’s implementation , not from out on the fringe where people are using it and creating their own features to address their own needs .
Lispers talk about Bottom - Up Programming .
Well , dangerous features enable bottom - up language evolution .
We discovered we like Symbol # to_proc because it bubbled up from the bottom .
Someone invents something .
If other people like it , they use it .
The word gets around .
People improve on it .
Eventually it gains acceptance and becomes the de facto way to write code .
This is true in all languages , but languages — like Ruby — that include dangerous features give the fringe a broader latitude to invent new things .
Of course , they also break things and they invent stupid things and they get excited and write entire applications by patching core classes instead of writing new classes and commit all sorts of sin .
But they will also invent Symbol #to_proc .
The “ marketplace ” has voted very strongly in favour of Symbol # to_proc , so much so that it is now in the next revision of the language .
Maybe you love Symbol #to_proc , maybe you hate it .
But somebody loves it , enough to have created it , and enough other people liked it that you can find implementations everywhere .
So it clearly has some appeal .
But that is n’t the point .
Even if it is a terrible feature , it is a feature invented by the people and for the people , not a feature pushed down from above .
Open classes makes invention possible in real time .
No committee .
No waiting for the next language revision .
If you think of it , you can try it .
Does Symbol #to_proc make it worthwhile ?
How about andand ?
Why do n’t you tell me ?
I was serious when I asked you what you think of it .
For some , languages are best when they are mature , when there is nothing left to discover , when all of the “ best practices ” have been laid down in stone .
There ’s a comforting stability , a knowledge that some hot shot they hire tomorrow will not arrive with a bunch of new techniques you have never heard of .
In mature , stable environments the people around the longest have the most authority .
When anybody can invent a new thing , it ’s the youngsters who hold the power .
If you do n’t like the way Ruby handles nil , you can write your own andand .
Surprise surprise , so did half a dozen other people , so for the moment you ’re going to find that there is no clear standard , no “ One obvious way to do it ” in Ruby .
That kind of thing is painful for a certain type of personality : they want to know “ Which way is the best . ”
Ideally , they want Matz ( or as one person commented , Guido ) to anoint one of these the “ winner ” by building it into the core .
That way the oldsters get the power back , they have the experience so they have memorized more of the core API .
Invention is n’t its own reward .
Creating new stuff for the sake of novelty wears thin pretty quickly .
But when you are making up the rules , you get to stack them in your favour .
If you create it , it works for your needs .
Naturally , there is an argument that the mature , tested heavyweight whatsis is better than your half - baked roll - your - own whatsis .
or at least , there is an argument if we are talking about an Enterprise Transactional Data Processing Platform .
But look at Rails .
It is much smaller than something like Spring .
So it was much better for 37 Signals than Spring , even though they rolled their own .
Rolling your own is a lot harder in a language — like Java — that does n’t let you have the dangerous features .
The trade - offs between using the old and inventing the new are different in a language like Ruby .
You still want to use what already works most of the time .
But there ’re a lot more places where inventing something new makes sense .
Naturally , a lot of people are going to get the trade - off wrong .
They ’ll reinvent something that already exists .
Or they ’ll gratuitously use a dangerous feature when a perfectly serviceable safe feature is easier and faster to use .
That ’s the consequence of giving people a choice , sometimes they choose wrong .
Especially if they are young , especially if they do n’t know any better .
But guess what ?
Not knowing any better is what made David create Rails .
he did n’t know Ruby does n’t work for web applications .
He did n’t know it ’s wrong to create a web framework when there are so many sitting on the shelf waiting for you to use them right out of the box .
When I look at some code like , I see the thing in Ruby that made Rails possible .
I see all of the good things — and all of the bad things too .
In that way , it ’s totemic .
And in truth , I think you can really decide for yourself what you think of Ruby just from looking at that one snippet of code .
If it scares the bejeezus out of you , if you start thinking of rules to impose on your team ( we will use no more than three of the following seven gems on any one project .
You will have an Architect approve any modification to one of the following 132 classes … ) , then Ruby is not for you .
But if you love , if it fires up your imagination , if you think that you might write your own gem one day and see if the community likes your idea for improving the language , then I think you will be able to handle the inevitable snafus with a pragmatic shrug of the shoulders ( Maybe I should n’t have extensively patched the Array class just so that I could steal the { x => y } notation for my pattern - matching DSL ) .
You will evolve your judgement so that you know when to pull out the dangerous features and when to use restraint .
And whether you love open classes or hate them , whether you can think of a way to use them or whether you think there is always a better way , the indisputable truth about them is that Rubyists are using them to evolve the language from the bottom up , to find new ways to do things .
Good things , bad things , beautiful things , ugly things … they are all New Things .
And ultimately , that is what this line of code says to me about Ruby .
It says that this is a language where the fringe is inventing new things .
And to embrace ruby is to embrace the idea of a language being propelled by its user base .
I use the language , so I obviously have some degree of comfort with the idea of a language evolving from the bottom up .
But what do you think ?
It ’s your opinion that really matters , not mine .

Jun 5 ( IPS ) – Climate change is a global problem but individuals and communities can take simple measures to cut their carbon emissions in half , experts said Thursday on World Environment Day .
The U.N. Environment Programme ( UNEP ) launched a “ Kick the CO2 Habit ” campaign in Wellington , New Zealand today to encourage low - carbon lifestyle choices at home and when travelling .
“ The public have the power to change the future — have the power to personally and collectively influence economies to ‘ Kick the CO2 Habit ’ , ” said Achim Steiner , UNEP executive director .
UNEP released a kind of “ Rough Guide ” to low - carbon living , entitled “ Kick the Habit : The UN Guide to Climate Neutrality “ , which is available free online .
The knowledge and technology to dramatically reduce carbon emissions already exist , mainly through improvements in energy efficiency .
What have been lacking in most countries are incentives to make changes .
Now the hard stick of high energy prices has given the public new interest in reducing energy costs , which also reduce carbon emissions .
“ The typical North American family could reduce their energy use by 73 percent , ” said Godo Stoyke , an energy expert in Edmonton and author of “ The CarbonBuster ’s Home Energy Handbook “ .
For an up front investment of 11,000 dollars in energy efficiency measures , the savings over five years would be 17,500 dollars , a 32 percent return on investment , Stoyke told IPS .
And that savings estimate is based on lower energy prices of a couple of years ago .
What ’s involved is pretty simple .
Replace lighting with compact fluorescent or LEDs , install solar water heater , use cold water for washing clothes , hang clothes up to dry , improve insulation , turn off the “ energy vampires ” — electronic devices like a cell phone charger , computer , DVD player and so on that use energy even when not in use .
Switch to a more fuel efficient vehicle — more than half a two - car family ’s carbon emissions are emitted by their vehicles .
“ Half of the money we spend on energy goes into the gas tank , ” Stoyke noted .
There is little new here , and despite the cost - savings , a mania for energy - efficiency has not swept around the world .
Low energy costs were a big reason , another was the initial investment .
“ People seem to focus on the upfront costs and ignore the life cycle cost savings , ” he said .
And there are lots of institutional barriers put up by governments at all levels .
In many North American communities , an outdoor line for drying clothes is illegal .
Local governments and neighbours sue to prevent installation of “ unsightly ” solar panels or wind turbines .
Financing is often another issue although an investment in energy efficiency offers a guaranteed return .
Stoyke operates his Carbon Busters Inc. business of boosting energy efficiency in schools and other institutions on a self - funding model and only takes his profit as a percentage of the energy savings of his clients .
These days he has all the work he can handle , including housing developers and car dealerships .
New buildings offer tremendous opportunities for emissions reductions .
Stoyke is involved in a zero- carbon village project outside Edmonton that will be highly efficient and generate all its own energy sustainably .
In Sweden , for an additional cost of 3,000 dollars in super - windows and extra insulation , new townhouses have been built without a furnace .
Heat from the appliances and the occupants are enough .
Edmonton , with its - 40C winters is too cold to go without a heat source however .
“ In the near future countries and communities with low dependance on fossil fuels will have the most stable and successful economies , ” he said , noting that Sweden has set a target of being oil - free by 2020 .
The village of Ashton Hayes in Cheshire , England is aiming to be the first carbon - neutral community in the England .
In just two years , the 1,000 residents have saved 20 percent on their energy costs and transformed their community .
“ It ’s been great fun and an amazing boost in community spirit , ” said Garry Charnock , who put the idea to some friends in the local pub .
“ I thought they ’d think of me as a bit of a crank , but they were all for it . ”
More than 75 percent of the village showed up for the first meetings , something that had never happened before .
Charnock told IPS that people are worried about climate change and want to do something but are reluctant to do it on their own .
Unwittingly , Charnock ’s notion of a carbon - neutral village unleashed the power of community .
People share ideas and statistics on energy use , and make suggestions for improvements while sitting in the pub .
There ’s been a remarkable transition over a huge range of behaviours , he says .
People are converting their front lawns into vegetable gardens to reduce the carbon used in transporting food .
To reduce car use , they lobbied the local town council to build a footpath to the train station .
One key to Ashton Hayes ’ success has been the philosophy of not blaming anyone or forcing people to participate .
They adopted a “ do what you can ” attitude .
Older residents say the community spirit and common purpose is similar to that during World War II .
“ It was n’t the main idea but people are also saving a lot of money now on their energy costs , ” Charnock said .

Exonerated P2P defendant Tanya Andersen should be awarded $ 107,834 in court costs and attorney fees , a federal magistrate judge ruled yesterday .
It 's the largest attorneys ' fees award to date against the RIAA , but a far cry from both the $ 298,995 sought by her attorney and the RIAA 's reckoning of just under $ 30,000 .
Of course , all the RIAA needs is for 27 college kids to settle at $ 4,000 a pop and it's got the award covered .
The RIAA dropped its case against Andersen in June 2007 after over two years of litigation .
Not long after , the judge ruled that , as the prevailing party , Andersen was entitled to attorneys ' fees .
Just how high that award should be quickly became a point of contention .
Andersen 's attorney Lory Lybeck argued that he was entitled to a multiplier of double the fee amount because of his " high - risk , successful " defense .
The RIAA argued that the nearly $ 300,000 sought by Andersen was " excessive " in numerous respects .
The case was merely a " straightforward copyright infringement claim , " argued the labels in a brief filed in March .
Fairly early on in the case , Andersen filed the counterclaims that ultimately became the basis for her malicious prosecution .
Lybeck 's work related to the counterclaims is not eligible for reimbursement , ruled Magistrate Judge John V. Acosta .
" After carefully reviewing the record here , the court concludes that Andersen 's counterclaims involved the same conduct and were sufficiently related to her defense of the copyright infringement case , " wrote Acosta .
He also ruled that some of Lybeck 's billing entries covering 28.2 hours of work on the case were vague and " too generalized " to be allowed .
The judge also cut Lybeck 's hourly rate , but not as steeply as the RIAA would have liked .
Instead of the $ 375 Lybeck sought , he got $ 325 .
The RIAA also lost on the issues of multiple attorneys and compensation for travel .
The labels argued that there was no need for Andersen to have more than one attorney present at most hearings and depositions — despite having as many as six attorneys of their own in court on occasion .
Both Andersen and the RIAA have until May 27 to file any objections to the award .
Given the back - and - forth in Capitol v. Foster , where exonerated defendant Debbie Foster was awarded over $ 68,000 in attorneys ' fees , it 's likely that there will be a few more rounds of filings before the RIAA cuts a check for Andersen 's legal defense .
Once the RIAA cuts a six - digit check , the book will be closed on Atlantic v. Andersen , but her malicious prosecution lawsuit against the RIAA and record labels will move ahead .

Mozilla released Firefox version 1.0 to relative obscurity in November of 2004 , and four short years later , the much - anticipated Firefox 3.0 will hit the streets with ambitions of setting a new world record tomorrow .
In honor of tomorrow 's 3.0 release , let 's take a look back at a visual history of Firefox , version 1.0 to 3.0 .

The Themes
The most significant change you 'll notice in Firefox 3 off the bat is the new themes .
Mozilla has skinned Firefox 3 to integrate with your operating system of choice .
Firefox 3.0 in Vista now fits more into the aesthetic of Vista , Firefox in OS X likewise fits more with the look and feel of native OS X apps , and so on .
Here 's a quick look back at the changes from the Firefox 1.0 to 3.0 chrome .

The biggest change in Firefox 3's Options window comes through re-thinking the Feeds tab as a complete application - management tab .
You can now easily set how you want Firefox to handle any filetype through this interface as opposed to just tweaking how it handles feeds .

Add-ons Management
In Firefox 1.0 , extensions were extensions , themes were themes , and you managed them separately .

In Firefox 3 , the Add - ons dialog hit the weight room , beefed up , and added a Plug-ins tab and the Get Add - ons tab , an add - ons store of sorts .
Instead of searching the depths of the internet when you 're looking for a new extension , you can go straight to the Get Add - ons tab , search for it , and install it without ever opening a web page .

Bookmarks Management
There 's very little difference — if any — between the bookmarks management in Firefox 1 and 2 .

Firefox 3 , on the other hand , has completely revamped the look of the bookmarks manager and included support for some of Firefox 3's newer bookmark features , like smart folders and tags .
( As you can see , I have n't tagged many bookmarks yet . )

In Firefox 3 , you can easily add or edit any bookmark while you 're visiting a bookmarked page by clicking the new star in the address bar .
Clicking it automatically bookmarks an unbookmarked page or provides you a simple avenue for removing a bookmark or adding tags .
Download Manager

Password Management
Like bookmarks , we did n't see any change in the way that Firefox 1 and 2 handled saving new passwords when you logged into a site .

Firefox 3 provides a much less intrusive mechanism for asking you what you 'd like to do with the login credentials you use to log into a site .
Rather than triggering a pop-up window that requires a response before you can continue , the new password bar allows you to continue on your merry way without attending to it immediately .
You can even ignore the prompt altogether if you prefer .

During his 22 - year Air Force career , Col. Bowman also served as the Head of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering and Assistant Dean at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology .
He also flew over 100 combat missions in Viet Nam as a fighter pilot .
Criticism of the official account also extends to government scientists .
“ The issue of knowing who was really behind the 9/11 attacks is of paramount importance to the future of our country , because the ‘ official ’ assumption that it was the work of 19 Arab amateurs does not match the available facts , ” writes David Griscom , PhD , a retired government research physicist . [ 2 ]
Dr. Griscom continued , “ I implore my fellow physicists and engineers who may have the time , expertise , and ( ideally ) supercomputer access to get to work on the physics of the World Trade Center collapses and publish their findings in refereed journals …
Surely [ the ]
Orwellian consequences of public ignorance constitute more than sufficient motivation for any patriotic American physicist or engineer to join the search for 9/11 Truth ! ”
A highly esteemed researcher , Dr. Griscom spent 33 years at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , D.C. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society .
He was the recipient of the 1993 N.F. Mott Award sponsored by the Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids , the 1995 Otto Schott Award offered by the Carl - Zeiss - Stiftung ( Germany ) , a 1996 Outstanding Graduate School Alumnus Award at Brown University , and the 1997 Sigma Xi Pure Science Award at NRL .
He is the principal author of 109 of his 185 published works , a body of work highly cited by his peers .
The improbability of the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 is a major concern of scientists , engineers and architects .
The building was 610 feet tall , 47 stories , and would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 .
In the 6 years since 9/11 , the Federal government has failed to provide any explanation for the collapse .
In addition to the failure to provide an explanation , absolutely no mention of Building 7 ’s collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's “ full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . ”

Another senior Federal engineer who seriously questions the official account of 9/11 is Joel Hirschhorn , PhD , former Senior Staff Member , Congressional Office of Technology Assessment 1978 – 1990 and former Professor of Mechanical Engineering .
Earlier this year , he wrote , “ Many technical analyses cast doubt on the official explanation of the collapse of three World Trade Center buildings , including those presented by an impressive new group : Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth .
... “ When it comes to 9/11 , we face the strong belief that only al - Qaeda caused 9/11 .
But analyses by many experts reveal the collapse of the three WTC buildings was not caused by the two airplanes exploding into the twin towers .
Without getting into details that one can spend many hours examining on a number of websites , the general view is that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition . ” [ 3 ]
Dr. Hirschhorn also served as Director of Environment , Energy and Natural Resources for the National Governors Association .
He ’s testified more than 50 times before Congress on technology , science , and environmental issues .
Prior to his government services , he was Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin , Madison 1965 - 1978 .
Dr. Hirschhorn continued , “ Like other groups , Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth wants a new , honest and comprehensive study that considers all the evidence for controlled demolition .
As a former engineering professor with growing skepticism about the official WTC story I share their concerns .
First , let the technical truth emerge .
Then , if necessary , cope with the inevitable political , conspiracy and other questions .
But let us not allow a possible painful truth block the primary task of determining once and for all what caused the collapse of the WTC towers and building number 7 . ”
Another senior Federal engineer who questions the official account of 9/11 is Enver Masud , MS , PE , former Chief of the Strategic and Emergency Planning Branch , U.S. Department of Energy .
An expert in electrical power grid management , he has consulted for the World Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , and the United States Agency for International Development in Albania , Czech Republic , Egypt , Ghana , Indonesia , Latvia , Norway , Pakistan , Russia , Tanzania .
Prior to his employment by the DOE , he served as Director of the Office of Engineering at the Public Service Commission in Washington , D.C.
In a statement to this author , Mr. Masud wrote , “ The 9/11 Commission Report is fatally flawed .
The major conclusions of the 9/11 Commission Report -- the official , conspiracy theory -- are false .
Among its many problems ; 1 . ) It is entirely silent on the collapse of WTC Building 7 .
2 . ) The FBI has admitted it has no hard evidence that Bin Laden was responsible for the attacks of 9/11 .
3 . ) To this day , the hijackers ' identities remain in doubt .
4 . ) Evidence , including the lack of adequate debris , at both the Pentagon and Shanksville contradicts the official theory of Flights 77 and 93 .
5 . ) There is prima facie evidence of the controlled demolition of the WTC Twin Towers and Building 7 . ”
Another prominent skeptic of the official account of 9/11 is James Quintiere , PhD , former Chief of the Fire Science Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , who has publicly called for an independent review of NIST ’s investigation into the collapses of the World Trade Center Towers on 9/11 .
Dr. Quintiere made his plea during his presentation , “ Questions on the WTC Investigations ” , at the 2007 World Fire Safety Conference .
“ I wish that there would be a peer review of this , ” he said [ 4 ] , referring to the NIST investigation .
“ I think all the records that NIST has assembled should be archived .
I would really like to see someone else take a look at what they ’ve done ; both structurally and from a fire point of view . ”
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
“ I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is questionable , ” explained Dr. Quintiere .
“ Let 's look at real alternatives that might have been the cause of the collapse of the World Trade Towers and how that relates to the official cause and what 's the significance of one cause versus another . ”
Dr. Quintiere , one of the world ’s leading fire science researchers and safety engineers , also encouraged his audience of fellow researchers and engineers to scientifically re-examine the WTC collapses .
“ I hope to convince you to perhaps become ‘ Conspiracy Theorists ’ , but in a proper way , ” he said .
Dr. Quintiere also expressed his frustration at NIST ’s failure to provide a report on the third skyscraper that collapsed on 9/11 , World Trade Center Building 7 .
“ And that building was not hit by anything , ” noted Dr. Quintiere .
“ It ’s more important to take a look at that . ”
Earlier this year , Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth created an online petition [ 5 ] urging Congress to immediately reinvestigate 9/11 .
More than 230 architects and engineers have signed the petition as of the date of this publication .
Among the signers are Joel Hirschhorn and Enver Masud ( both mentioned above ) , Dwain Deets , MS , and Edward S. Munyak , MS , PE .
Dwain Deets , MS , former Director , Aerospace Projects at NASA ’s Dryden Flight Research Center , wrote in support of the petition , “ The many visual images ( massive structural members being hurled horizontally , huge pyroclastic clouds , etc. ) leave no doubt in my mind explosives were involved [ in the destruction of the World Trade Center ] . ” [ 6 ]
Mr. Deets also served as Director of the Research Engineering Division at Dryden .
He is the recipient of the NASA Exceptional Service Award and the Presidential Meritorious Rank Award in the Senior Executive Service ( 1988 ) .
He served at NASA for 37 years .
Edward S. Munyak , MS , PE , has over 20 years experience as a Fire Protection Engineer for the U.S. Departments of Energy , Defense , and Veterans Affairs .
He is a contributing Subject Matter Expert to the U.S. Department of Energy Fire Protection Engineering Functional Area Qualification Standard for Nuclear Facilities .
He serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the Northern California - Nevada Chapter of the Society of Fire Protection Engineers .
A Licensed Professional Mechanical Engineer and Fire Protection Engineer in the State of California , Mr. Munyak currently serves as Fire Protection Engineer for the city of San Jose , California , the 10th largest city in the United States .
In his presentation at the 2007 National Fire Protection Association World Fire Safety Conference , “ High Rise Buildings and Large Fires - Structural loads & thermal strain - What can happen ” [ 7 ] , June 4 , 2007 , Mr. Munyak wrote , “ We will find that the government investigations into building collapse [ at the World Trade Center ] must consider controlled demolition as far more probable since fire effects collapse could never be duplicated .
...
The concentric nearly freefall speed exhibited by each building was identical to most controlled demolitions .
The aircraft impact and fire severity effects were magnified in the NIST reports .
Collapse of WTC 1 , 2 & 7 were not caused by fire effects .
...
The official reports and conclusions had many technical distortions and obfuscations of the excellent research input in arriving at a flawed , politically driven conclusion of building performance . ”
The architects and engineers petition has now been signed by more than 230 architects and engineers .
It reads ,
“ On Behalf of the People of the United States of America , the undersigned Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and affiliates hereby petition for , and demand , a truly independent investigation with subpoena power in order to uncover the full truth surrounding the events of 9/11/01 - specifically the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and Building 7 .
We believe that there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore that the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers and WTC Building 7 . ”
For more information about the petition , please visit the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth website , http://www.AE911Truth.org/joinus.php
Critically important questions about 9/11 still remain unanswered six years after the terrible events of that day .
As the statements of these seven senior Federal government engineers and scientists demonstrate , the need for a new thorough , and independent investigation of 9/11 is not a matter of partisan politics , nor the demand of irresponsible , deranged , or disloyal Americans .
It is instead a matter of the utmost importance for America ’s security and the future of the entire world .

U.S. Marine helicopters will land at the old Eastgate Consumer Mall , Brookside Park and other Indianapolis locations when the city becomes a mock battlefield next week .
About 2,300 Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit , based at Camp Lejeune , N.C. , will conduct urban warfare training from Wednesday through June 19 in and around Indianapolis .
Most of the troops will be deployed at the Indiana State Fairgrounds and the Raytheon facility on Holt Road , said Debbi Fletcher of the Indianapolis / Marion County Emergency Management Agency .
“ We do n’t want anyone thinking that there ’s an invasion happening or that we declared martial law or something like that , ” Fletcher said .
The Marines have been cleared by state , federal and local authorities , Fletcher said .
The unit ’s commander promised to try to keep noise to a minimum and give neighbors plenty of warning .
“ Our aim in Indianapolis is to expose our Marines to realistic scenarios and stresses posed by operating in an actual urban community , thereby increasing their proficiency in built - up areas , ” Col. Mark J. Desens , commander of the 26th MEU , said in a statement .
“ While some of the activity will take place around Camp Atterbury , residents in many areas can expect to see helicopters flying overhead , military vehicles on the roads and Marines patrolling on foot , ” Desens said .
The Marines will practice firing weapons , conducting patrols , running vehicle checkpoints , reacting to ambushes and employing nonlethal weapons , according to a statement .
In addition to Eastgate and Brookside Park , Indianapolis offered the Marines 24 other training sites , including Raymond Park Middle School , Ellenberger Park , Christian Park , Southeastway Park , the old Bush Stadium and Douglass Park .
However , not all cities are so open to the training .
In February , after first canceling scheduled training , Toledo ( Ohio ) Mayor Carty Finkbeiner invited the Marines to train in the city , but outside the downtown area .

Note :
This was written in real time during the debate .
Moderator Charles Gibson started by asking Clinton and Obama why they would n’t team up and run together in the fall , and they both dodged the question .
Obama is asked about the bitter remarks and once again tried to clarify his answer .
Clinton tries to exploit the opening , by using the word cling several times in her answer .
Clinton was asked if she thinks Obama can win .
She said yes , but she thinks she is the better candidate .
The question was reversed and posed to Obama .
He said he thinks that Clinton can win , but he is the better candidate .
Advertisements
Obama said Clinton is n’t helping when she calls him an elitist .
Obama blames today ’s politics , “ The problem that we have in our politics , which is fairly typical , is that you take one person ’s statement , if it ’s not properly phrased , and you just beat it to death , and that ’s what Senator Clinton ’s been doing over the last four days , ” Obama said .
He turns the tables on Clinton by bringing up Clinton ’s should I be home making muffins remark in 1992 .
Obama gets asked about Rev. Wright and gives his standard answer .
Almost a half hour into the debate and Obama has had to deal with both “ bitter ” and Rev. Wright , what ’s next , Clinton ’s Bosnia exaggerations ?
We are one third of the way through this debate and the candidates have not been asked about a single issue .
This is terrible coverage by ABC .
Clinton is asked about her honesty and the Bosnia story ( surprise..surprise ) .
Clinton apologized for her Bosnia exaggeration , and she tried to turn the question around and highlight her international experience .
Obama was asked if Clinton has been truthful about her past , and he says Clinton deserves the ability to make a few mistakes .
Obama is asked by a Latrobe , PA woman if he believes in the American flag ?
( Great , she just made everybody in Latrobe look like morons ) .
Obama said , “ I revere the American flag , and I would not be running for president if I did not revere this country . ”
Obama talked about taking care of veterans and restoring economic equality .
Obama called the flag pin a manufactured issue .
A question about Obama being affiliated with one of the former Weather Underground members provokes an answer that clearly shows his frustration with the lack of issues being discussed tonight .
We are almost halfway through this thing , and still not a single question about an issue has been asked .
ABC is doing their best to spark some fireworks .
Obama fights back by pointing out that President Clinton pardoned two members of the Weather Underground .
Finally an issue question was asked about the candidates ’ plans to get out of Iraq .
Clinton said she will take the troops out of Iraq no matter what the military advises .
Clinton sticks to starting withdrawal within 60 days .
She said we need to get out of Iraq so that we can address our other problems .
Obama gave the same pledge to get the troops out , and pointed out that the president sets the mission .
Obama said he will listen to commanders about tactics , but he sets the mission .
Obama was asked if an Iranian attack on Israel should be treated like an attack on the U.S.
He said we should prevent Iran from getting the bomb and that he believes in carrot and stick approach .
Obama said an attack on Israel is an attack on one of our strongest allies in the region .
Clinton said an attack on Israel would result in massive retaliation .
Clinton called for diplomacy with Iran and also a region wide security agreement .
Finally a question about the economy , both candidates are asked if they will raise taxes .
Clinton said that she will roll back taxes to the 1990s levels on those making $ 250,000 + .
Clinton said she wo n’t raise a single tax on the middle class .
Obama said he will cut their taxes .
People making $ 75,000 or less will get a break on their payroll taxes .
Obama and Clinton both agreed on raising the capital gains tax back to 20 % .
Clinton said she does n’t want to raise taxes on anyone .
Both candidates were then asked about gun control .
Clinton said she will bring back the COPS program , work to restore the assault weapons ban , and give law enforcement more ability to track guns used in crimes .
Clinton said she will strike the balance between protecting rights , and keep guns out of the wrong hands .
Obama was asked about the Washington , D.C. gun law case .
Obama said we need a common sense approach to illegal guns , and the purchase of guns by the mentally ill .
Clinton said she supports sensible regulations .
Obama got a question about poor whites being included in Affirmative Action .
He said that Affirmative Action should not be based on a quota system , but should be used to provide opportunity for those who overcome struggles regardless of race .
On the topic of gas prices , Clinton said we should have a federal gas tax holiday , but combine it a windfall profit tax on the oil companies .
Obama said we need a long term energy strategy including increasing fuel efficiency and investing in alternative energy technology .
Overall this debate was a waste of time that probably did n’t change any minds .
Both candidates were hampered by ABC ’s lousy coverage .
Few real issues were discussed .
What stood out to me was how much better both of these candidates are than John McCain .
Neither Clinton nor Obama was sharp tonight , but either could easily defeat McCain .
Democrats are lucky to have two great candidates .
I think that is what we need to be focusing on instead of non-issues like bitter and Bosnia .

Konishi polis , Earth
23 387 025 000 000 CST
15 May 2975 , 11:03:17.154 UT
The conceptory was non-sentient software , as ancient as Konishi polis itself .
Its main purpose was to enable the citizens of the polis to create offspring : a child of one parent , or two , or twenty — formed partly in their own image , partly according to their wishes , and partly by chance .
Sporadically , though , every teratau or so , the conceptory created a citizen with no parents at all .
In Konishi , every home - born citizen was grown from a mind seed , a string of instruction codes like a digital genome .
The first mind seeds had been translated from DNA nine centuries before , when the polis founders had invented the Shaper programming language to recreate the essential processes of neuroembryology in software .
But any such translation was necessarily imperfect , glossing over the biochemical details in favour of broad , functional equivalence , and the full diversity of the flesher genome could not be brought through intact .
Starting from a diminished trait pool , with the old DNA - based maps rendered obsolete , it was crucial for the conceptory to chart the consequences of new variations to the mind seed .
To eschew all change would be to risk stagnation ; to embrace it recklessly would be to endanger the sanity of every child .
The Konishi mind seed was divided into a billion fields : short segments , six bits long , each containing a simple instruction code .
Sequences of a few dozen instructions comprised shapers : the basic subprograms employed during psychogenesis .
The effects of untried mutations on fifteen million interacting shapers could rarely be predicted in advance ; in most cases , the only reliable method would have been to perform every computation that the altered seed itself would have performed … which was no different from going ahead and growing the seed , creating the mind , predicting nothing .
The conceptory ’s accumulated knowledge of its craft took the form of a collection of annotated maps of the Konishi mind seed .
The highest - level maps were elaborate , multi-dimensional structures , dwarfing the seed itself by orders of magnitude .
But there was one simple map which the citizens of Konishi had used to gauge the conceptory ’s progress over the centuries ; it showed the billion fields as lines of latitude , and the sixty - four possible instruction codes as meridians .
Any individual seed could be thought of as a path which zig - zagged down the map from top to bottom , singling out an instruction code for every field along the way .
Where it was known that only one code could lead to successful psychogenesis , every route on the map converged on a lone island or a narrow isthmus , ochre against ocean blue .
These infrastructure fields built the basic mental architecture every citizen had in common , shaping both the mind ’s overarching design and the fine details of vital subsystems .
Elsewhere , the map recorded a spread of possibilities : a broad landmass , or a scattered archipelago .
Trait fields offered a selection of codes , each with a known effect on the mind ’s detailed structure , with variations ranging from polar extremes of innate temperament or aesthetics down to minute differences in neural architecture less significant than the creases on a flesher ’s palm .
They appeared in shades of green as wildly contrasting or as flatly indistinguishable as the traits themselves .
The remaining fields — where no changes to the seed had yet been tested , and no predictions could be made — were classified as indeterminate .
Here , the one tried code , the known landmark , was shown as grey against white : a mountain peak protruding through a band of clouds which concealed everything to the east or west of it .
No more detail could be resolved from afar ; whatever lay beneath the clouds could only be discovered firsthand .
Whenever the conceptory created an orphan , it set all the benignly mutable trait fields to valid codes chosen at random , since there were no parents to mimic or please .
Then it selected a thousand indeterminate fields , and treated them in much the same fashion : throwing a thousand quantum dice to choose a random path through terra incognita .
Every orphan was an explorer , sent to map uncharted territory .
And every orphan was the uncharted territory itself .
The conceptory placed the new orphan seed in the middle of the womb ’s memory , a single strand of information suspended in a vacuum of zeros .
The seed meant nothing to itself ; alone , it might as well have been the last stream of Morse , fleeing through the void past a distant star .
But the womb was a virtual machine designed to execute the seed ’s instructions , and a dozen more layers of software led down to the polis itself , a lattice of flickering molecular switches .
A sequence of bits , a string of passive data , could do nothing , change nothing — but in the womb , the seed ’s meaning fell into perfect alignment with all the immutable rules of all the levels beneath it .
Like a punched card fed into a Jacquard loom , it ceased to be an abstract message and became a part of the machine .
When the womb read the seed , the seed ’s first shaper caused the space around it to be filled with a simple pattern of data : a single , frozen numerical wave train , sculpted across the emptiness like a billion perfect ranks of sand dunes .
This distinguished each point from its immediate neighbours further up or down the same slope — but each crest was still identical to every other crest , each trough the same as every other trough .
The womb ’s memory was arranged as a space with three dimensions , and the numbers stored at each point implied a fourth .
So these dunes were four - dimensional .
A second wave was added — running askew to the first , modulated with a slow steady rise — carving each ridge into a series of ascending mounds .
Then a third , and a fourth , each successive wave enriching the pattern , complicating and fracturing its symmetries : defining directions , building up gradients , establishing a hierarchy of scales .
The fortieth wave ploughed through an abstract topography bearing no trace of the crystalline regularity of its origins , with ridges and furrows as convoluted as the whorls of a fingerprint .
Not every point had been rendered unique — but enough structure had been created to act as the framework for everything to come .
So the seed gave instructions for a hundred copies of itself to be scattered across the freshly calibrated landscape .
In the second iteration , the womb read all of the replicated seeds — and at first , the instructions they issued were the same , everywhere .
Then , one instruction called for the point where each seed was being read to jump forward along the bit string to the next field adjacent to a certain pattern in the surrounding data : a sequence of ridges with a certain shape , distinctive but not unique .
Since each seed was embedded in different terrain , each local version of this landmark was situated differently , and the womb began reading instructions from a different part of every seed .
The seeds themselves were all still identical , but each one could now unleash a different set of shapers on the space around it , preparing the foundations for a different specialised region of the psychoblast , the embryonic mind .
The technique was an ancient one : a budding flower ’s nondescript stem cells followed a self - laid pattern of chemical cues to differentiate into sepals or petals , stamens or carpels ; an insect pupa doused itself with a protein gradient which triggered , at different doses , the different cascades of gene activity needed to sculpt abdomen , thorax or head .
Konishi ’s digital version skimmed off the essence of the process : divide up space by marking it distinctively , then let the local markings inflect the unwinding of all further instructions , switching specialised subprograms on and off — subprograms which in turn would repeat the whole cycle on ever finer scales , gradually transforming the first rough - hewn structures into miracles of filigreed precision .
By the eighth iteration , the womb ’s memory contained a hundred trillion copies of the mind seed ; no more would be required .
Most continued to carve new detail into the landscape around them — but some gave up on shapers altogether , and started running shriekers : brief loops of instructions which fed streams of pulses into the primitive networks which had grown up between the seeds .
The tracks of these networks were just the highest ridges the shapers had built , and the pulses were tiny arrowheads , one and two steps higher .
The shapers had worked in four dimensions , so the networks themselves were three - dimensional .
The womb breathed life into these conventions , making the pulses race along the tracks like a quadrillion cars shuttling between the trillion junctions of a ten - thousand - tiered monorail .
Some shriekers sent out metronomic bit - streams ; others produced pseudo - random stutters .
The pulses flowed through the mazes of construction where the networks were still being formed — where almost every track was still connected to every other , because no decision to prune had yet been made .
Woken by the traffic , new shapers started up and began to disassemble the excess junctions , preserving only those where a sufficient number of pulses were arriving simultaneously — choosing , out of all the countless alternatives , pathways which could operate in synchrony .
There were dead ends in the networks - in - progress , too — but if they were travelled often enough , other shapers noticed , and constructed extensions .
It did n’t matter that these first streams of data were meaningless ; any kind of signal was enough to help whittle the lowest - level machinery of thought into existence .
In many polises , new citizens were n’t grown at all ; they were assembled directly from generic subsystems .
But the Konishi method provided a certain quasi- biological robustness , a certain seamlessness .
Systems grown together , interacting even as they were being formed , resolved most kinds of potential mismatch themselves , with no need for an external mind - builder to fine - tune all the finished components to ensure that they did n’t clash .
Amidst all this organic plasticity and compromise , though , the infrastructure fields could still stake out territory for a few standardised subsystems , identical from citizen to citizen .
Two of these were channels for incoming data — one for gestalt , and one for linear , the two primary modalities of all Konishi citizens , distant descendants of vision and hearing .
By the orphan ’s two - hundredth iteration , the channels themselves were fully formed , but the inner structures to which they fed their data , the networks for classifying and making sense of it , were still undeveloped , still unrehearsed .
Konishi polis itself was buried two hundred metres beneath the Siberian tundra , but via fibre and satellite links the input channels could bring in data from any forum in the Coalition of Polises , from probes orbiting every planet and moon in the solar system , from drones wandering the forests and oceans of Earth , from ten million kinds of scape or abstract sensorium .
The first problem of perception was learning how to choose from this superabundance .
In the orphan psychoblast , the half - formed navigator wired to the controls of the input channels began issuing a stream of requests for information .
The first few thousand requests yielded nothing but a monotonous stream of error codes ; they were incorrectly formed , or referred to non-existent sources of data .
But every psychoblast was innately biased towards finding the polis library ( if not , it would have taken millennia ) and the navigator kept trying until it hit on a valid address , and data flooded through the channels : a gestalt image of a lion , accompanied by the linear word for the animal .
The navigator instantly abandoned trial and error and went into a spasm of repetition , summoning the same frozen image of the lion again and again .
This continued until even the crudest of its embryonic change - discriminators finally stopped firing , and it drifted back towards experimentation .
Gradually , a half - sensible compromise evolved between the orphan ’s two kinds of proto- curiosity : the drive to seek out novelty , and the drive to seek out recurring patterns .
It browsed the library , learning how to bring in streams of connected information — sequential images of recorded motion , and then more abstract chains of cross-references — understanding nothing , but wired to reinforce its own behaviour when it struck the right balance between coherence and change .
Images and sounds , symbols and equations , flooded through the orphan ’s classifying networks , leaving behind , not the fine details — not the spacesuited figure standing on grey - and - white rock against a pitch black sky ; not the calm , naked figure disintegrating beneath a grey swarm of nanomachines — but an imprint of the simplest regularities , the most common associations .
The networks discovered the circle / sphere : in images of the sun and planets , in iris and pupil , in fallen fruit , in a thousand different artworks , artifacts , and mathematical diagrams .
They discovered the linear word for “ person ” , and bound it tentatively both to the regularities which defined the gestalt icon for “ citizen ” , and to the features they found in common among the many images of fleshers and gleisner robots .
By the five - hundredth iteration , the categories extracted from the library ’s data had given rise to a horde of tiny sub-systems in the input - classifying networks : ten thousand word - traps and image - traps , all poised and waiting to be sprung ; ten thousand pattern - recognising monomaniacs staring into the information stream , constantly alert for their own special targets .
These traps began to form connections with each other , using them at first just to share their judgments , to sway each other ’s decisions .
If the trap for the image of a lion was triggered , then the traps for its linear name , for the kind of sounds other lions had been heard to make , for common features seen in their behaviour ( licking cubs , pursuing antelope ) all became hypersensitive .
Sometimes the incoming data triggered a whole cluster of linked traps all at once , strengthening their mutual connections , but sometimes there was time for over - eager associate traps to start firing prematurely .
The lion shape has been recognised — and though the word “ lion ” has not yet been detected , the “ lion ” word - trap is tentatively firing … and so are the traps for cub- licking and antelope - chasing .
The orphan had begun to anticipate , to hold expectations .
By the thousandth iteration , the connections between the traps had developed into an elaborate network in its own right , and new structures had arisen in this network — symbols — which could be triggered by each other as easily as by any data from the input channels .
The lion image - trap , on its own , had merely been a template held up to the world to be declared a match or a mismatch — a verdict without implications .
The lion symbol could encode an unlimited web of implications — and that web could be tapped at any time , whether or not a lion was visible .
Mere recognition was giving way to the first faint hints of meaning .
The infrastructure fields had built the orphan standard output channels for linear and gestalt , but as yet the matching navigator , needed to address outgoing data to some specific destination in Konishi or beyond , remained inactive .
By the two - thousandth iteration , symbols began to jostle for access to the output channels , regardless .
They used their traps ’ templates to parrot the sound or image which each had learnt to recognise — and it did n’t matter if they uttered the linear words “ lion ” , “ cub ” , “ antelope ” into a void , because the input and output channels were wired together , on the inside .
The orphan began to hear itself think .
Not the whole pandemonium ; it could n’t give voice — or even gestalt — to everything at once .
Out of the myriad associations every scene from the library evoked , only a few symbols at a time could gain control of the nascent language production networks .
And though birds were wheeling in the sky , and the grass was waving , and a cloud of dust and insects was rising up in the animals ’ wake — and more , much more … the symbols which won out before the whole scene vanished were : “ Lion chasing antelope . ”
Startled , the navigator cut off the flood of external data .
The linear words cycled from channel to channel , distinct against the silence ; the gestalt images summoned up the essence of the chase again and again , an idealised reconstruction shorn of all forgotten details .
Then the memory faded to black , and the navigator reached out to the library again .
The orphan ’s thoughts themselves never shrank to a single orderly progression — rather , symbols fired in ever richer and more elaborate cascades — but positive feedback sharpened the focus , and the mind resonated with its own strongest ideas .
The orphan had learnt to single out one or two threads from the symbols ’ endless thousand - strand argument .
It had learnt to narrate its own experience .
The orphan was almost half a megatau old , now .
It had a vocabulary of ten thousand words , a short - term memory , expectations stretching several tau into the future , and a simple stream of consciousness .
But it still had no idea that there was such a thing in the world as itself .
The conceptory mapped the developing mind after every iteration , scrupulously tracing the effects of the randomised indeterminate fields .
A sentient observer of the same information might have visualised a thousand delicate interlocking fractals , like tangled , feathery , zero - gee crystals , sending out ever - finer branches to crisscross the womb as the fields were read and acted upon , and their influence diffused from network to network .
The conceptory did n’t visualise anything ; it just processed the data , and reached its conclusions .
So far , the mutations appeared to have caused no harm .
Every individual structure in the orphan ’s mind was functioning broadly as expected , and the traffic with the library , and other sampled data streams , showed no signs of incipient global pathologies .
If a psychoblast was found to be damaged , there was nothing in principle to stop the conceptory from reaching into the womb and repairing every last malformed structure , but the consequences could be as unpredictable as the consequences of growing the seed in the first place .
Localised “ surgery ” sometimes introduced incompatibilities with the rest of the psychoblast , while alterations widespread and thorough enough to guarantee success could be self - defeating , effectively obliterating the original psychoblast and replacing it with an assembly of parts cloned from past healthy ones .
But there were risks , too , in doing nothing .
Once a psychoblast became self - aware , it was granted citizenship , and intervention without consent became impossible .
This was not a matter of mere custom or law ; the principle was built into the deepest level of the polis .
A citizen who spiralled down into insanity could spend teratau in a state of confusion and pain , with a mind too damaged to authorise help , or even to choose extinction .
That was the price of autonomy : an inalienable right to madness and suffering , inseparable from the right to solitude and peace .
So the citizens of Konishi had programmed the conceptory to err on the side of caution .
It continued to observe the orphan closely , ready to terminate psychogenesis at the first sign of dysfunction .
Not long after the five - thousandth iteration , the orphan ’s output navigator began to fire — and a tug - of - war began .
The output navigator was wired to seek feedback , to address itself to someone or something that showed a response .
But the input navigator had long since grown accustomed to confining itself to the polis library , a habit which had been powerfully rewarded .
Both navigators were wired with a drive to bring each other into alignment , to connect to the same address , enabling the citizen to listen and speak in the same place — a useful conversational skill .
But it meant that the orphan ’s chatter of speech and icons flowed straight back to the library , which completely ignored it .
Faced with this absolute indifference , the output navigator sent repressor signals into the change - discriminator networks , undermining the attraction of the library ’s mesmerising show , bullying the input navigator out of its rut .
Dancing a weird chaotic lockstep , the two navigators began hopping from scape to scape , polis to polis , planet to planet .
Looking for someone to talk to .
They caught a thousand random glimpses of the physical world along the way : a radar image of a dust storm sweeping across the sea of dunes ringing the north polar ice cap of Mars ; the faint infrared plume of a small comet disintegrating in the atmosphere of Uranus — an event that had taken place decades before , but lingered in the satellite ’s discriminating memory .
They even chanced upon a realtime feed from a drone weaving its way across the East African savanna towards a pride of lions , but unlike the library ’s flowing images this vision seemed intractably frozen , and after a few tau they moved on .
When the orphan stumbled on the address for a Konishi forum , it saw a square paved with smooth rhombuses of mineral blues and greys , arranged in a pattern dense with elusive regularities but never quite repeating itself .
A fountain sprayed liquid silver towards a cloud - streaked , burnt - orange sky ; as each stream broke apart into mirrored droplets half - way up its arc , the shiny globules deformed into tiny winged piglets which flew around the fountain , braiding each others ’ flight paths and grunting cheerfully before diving back into the pool .
Stone cloisters ringed the square , the inner side of the walkway a series of broad arches and elaborately decorated colonnades .
Some of the arches had been given unusual twists — Eschered or Kleined , skewed through invisible extra dimensions .
The orphan had seen similar structures in the library , and knew the linear words for most of them ; the scape itself was so unremarkable that the orphan said nothing about it at all .
And the orphan had viewed thousands of scenes of moving , talking citizens , but it was acutely aware of a difference here , though it could not yet grasp clearly what it was .
The gestalt images themselves mostly reminded it of icons it had seen before , or the stylised fleshers it had seen in representational art : far more diverse , and far more mercurial , than real fleshers could ever be .
Their form was constrained not by physiology or physics , but only by the conventions of gestalt — the need to proclaim , beneath all inflections and subtleties , one primary meaning : I am a citizen .
The orphan addressed the forum : “ People . ”
The linear conversations between the citizens were public , but muted — degraded in proportion to distance in the scape — and the orphan heard only an unchanging murmur .
It tried again .
“ People ! ”
The icon of the nearest citizen — a dazzling multihued form like a stained - glass statue , about two delta high — turned to face the orphan .
An innate structure in the input navigator rotated the orphan ’s angle of view straight towards the icon .
The output navigator , driven to follow it , made the orphan ’s own icon — now a crude , unconscious parody of the citizen ’s — turn the same way .
The citizen glinted blue and gold .
Vis translucent face smiled , and ve said , “ Hello , orphan . ” A response , at last !
The output navigator ’s feedback detector shut off its scream of boredom , damping down the restlessness which had powered the search .
It flooded the mind with signals to repress any system which might intervene and drag it away from this precious find .
The orphan parroted : “ Hello , orphan . ”
The citizen smiled again — “ Yes , hello ” — then turned back to vis friends .
“ People ! Hello ! ” Nothing happened .
“ Citizens ! People ! ”
The group ignored the orphan .
The feedback detector backtracked on its satisfaction rating , making the navigators restless again .
Not restless enough to abandon the forum , but enough to move within it .
The orphan darted from place to place , crying out : “ People ! Hello ! ”
It moved without momentum or inertia , gravity or friction , merely tweaking the least significant bits of the input navigator ’s requests for data , which the scape interpreted as the position and angle of the orphan ’s point - of - view .
The matching bits from the output navigator determined where and how the orphan ’s speech and icon were merged into the scape .
The navigators learnt to move close enough to the citizens to be easily heard .
Some responded — “ Hello , orphan ” — before turning away .
The orphan echoed their icons back at them : simplified or intricate , rococo or spartan , mock - biological , mock - artifactual , forms outlined with helices of luminous smoke , or filled with vivid hissing serpents , decorated with blazing fractal encrustations , or draped in textureless black — but always the same biped , the same ape - shape , as constant beneath the riot of variation as the letter A in a hundred mad monks ’ illuminated manuscripts .
Gradually , the orphan ’s input - classifying networks began to grasp the difference between the citizens in the forum and all the icons it had seen in the library .
As well as the image , each icon here exuded a non-visual gestalt tag — a quality like a distinctive odour for a flesher , though more localised , and much richer in possibilities .
The orphan could make no sense of this new form of data , but now its infotrope — a late - developing structure which had grown as a second level over the simpler novelty and pattern detectors — began to respond to the deficit in understanding .
It picked up the tenuous hint of a regularity — every citizen ’s icon , here , comes with a unique and unvarying tag — and expressed its dissatisfaction .
The orphan had n’t previously bothered echoing the tag , but now , spurred on by the infotrope , it approached a group of three citizens and began to mimic one of them , tag and all .
The reward was immediate .
The citizen exclaimed angrily , “ Do n’t do that , idiot ! ” “ Hello ! ” “ No one will believe you if you claim to be me — least of all me .
Understand ?
Now go away ! ”
This citizen had metallic , pewter - grey skin .
Ve flashed vis tag on and off for emphasis ; the orphan did the same .
“ No ! ” The citizen was now sending out a second tag , alongside the original .
“ See ?
I challenge you — and you ca n’t respond .
So why bother lying ? ” “ Hello ! ” “ Go away ! ”
The orphan was riveted ; this was the most attention it had ever received .
“ Hello , citizen ! ”
The pewter face sagged , almost melting with exaggerated weariness .
“ Do n’t you know who you are ?
Do n’t you know your own signature ? ”
Another citizen said calmly , “ It must be the new orphan — still in the womb .
Your newest co-politan , Inoshiro .
You ought to welcome it . ”
This citizen was covered in short , golden - brown fur .
The orphan said , “ Lion . ”
It tried mimicking the new citizen — and suddenly all three of them were laughing .
The third citizen said , “ It wants to be you now , Gabriel . ”
The first , pewter - skinned citizen said , “ If it does n’t know its own name , we should call it ‘ idiot . ’ ”
“ Do n’t be cruel .
I could show you memories , little part - sibling . ”
The third citizen ’s icon was a featureless black silhouette .
“ Now it wants to be Blanca . ”
The orphan started mimicking each citizen in turn .
The three responded by chanting strange linear sounds which meant nothing — “ Inoshiro ! Gabriel ! Blanca ! Inoshiro ! Gabriel ! Blanca ! ” — just as the orphan sent out the gestalt images and tags .
Short - term pattern recognisers seized on the connection , and the orphan joined in the linear chant — and continued it for a while , when the others fell silent .
But after a few repetitions the pattern grew stale .
The pewter - skinned citizen clasped vis hand to vis chest and said , “ I ’m Inoshiro . ”
The golden - furred citizen clasped vis hand to vis chest and said , “ I ’m Gabriel . ”
The black - silhouetted citizen gave vis hand a thin white outline to keep it from vanishing as ve moved it in front of vis trunk , and said , “ I ’m Blanca . ”
The orphan mimicked each citizen once , speaking the linear word they ’d spoken , aping their hand gesture .
Symbols had formed for all three of them , binding their icons , complete with tags , and the linear words together — even though the tags and the linear words still connected to nothing else .
The citizen whose icon had made them all chant “ Inoshiro ” said , “ So far so good .
But how does it get a name of its own ? ”
The one with its tag bound to “ Blanca ” said , “ Orphans name themselves . ”
The orphan echoed , “ Orphans name themselves . ”
The citizen bound to “ Gabriel ” pointed to the one bound to “ Inoshiro ” , and said , “ Ve is — ? ”
The citizen bound to “ Blanca ” said “ Inoshiro . ”
Then the citizen bound to “ Inoshiro ” pointed back at ver and said “ Ve is — ? ”
This time , the citizen bound to “ Blanca ” replied , “ Blanca . ”
The orphan joined in , pointing where the others pointed , guided by innate systems which helped make sense of the scape ’s geometry , and completing the pattern easily even when no one else did .
Then the golden - furred citizen pointed at the orphan , and said : “ Ve is — ? ”
The input navigator spun the orphan ’s angle of view , trying to see what the citizen was pointing at .
When it found nothing behind the orphan , it moved its point of view backwards , closer to the golden - furred citizen — momentarily breaking step with the output navigator .
Suddenly , the orphan saw the icon it was projecting itself — a crude amalgam of the three citizens ’ icons , all black fur and yellow metal — not just as the usual faint mental image from the cross -connected channels , but as a vivid scape - object beside the other three .
This was what the golden - furred citizen bound to “ Gabriel ” was pointing at .
The infotrope went wild .
It could n’t complete the unfinished regularity — it could n’t answer the game ’s question for this strange fourth citizen — but the hole in the pattern needed to be filled .
The orphan watched the fourth citizen change shape and colour , out there in the scape … changes perfectly mirroring its own random fidgeting : sometimes mimicking one of the other three citizens , sometimes simply playing with the possibilities of gestalt .
This mesmerised the regularity detectors for a while , but it only made the infotrope more restless .
The infotrope combined and recombined all the factors at hand , and set a short - term goal : making the pewter - skinned “ Inoshiro ” icon change , the way the fourth citizen ’s icon was changing .
This triggered a faint anticipatory firing of the relevant symbols , a mental image of the desired event .
But though the image of a wiggling , pulsating citizen - icon easily won control of the gestalt output channel , it was n’t the “ Inoshiro ” icon that changed — just the fourth citizen ’s icon , as before .
The input navigator drifted of its own accord back into the same location as the output navigator , and the fourth citizen abruptly vanished .
The infotrope pushed the navigators apart again ; the fourth citizen reappeared .
The “ Inoshiro ” citizen said , “ What ’s it doing ? ” The “ Blanca ” citizen replied , “ Just watch , and be patient .
You might learn something . ”
A new symbol was already forming , a representation of the strange fourth citizen — the only one whose icon seemed bound by a mutual attraction to the orphan ’s viewpoint in the scape , and the only one whose actions the orphan could anticipate and control with such ease .
So were all four citizens the same kind of thing — like all lions , all antelope , all circles … or not ?
The connections between the symbols remained tentative .
The “ Inoshiro ” citizen said , “ I ’m bored !
Let someone else baby - sit it ! ”
Ve danced around the group — taking turns imitating the “ Blanca ” and “ Gabriel ” icons , and reverting to vis original form .
“ What ’s my name ?
I do n’t know !
What ’s my signature ?
I do n’t have one !
I ’m an orphan !
I ’m an orphan !
I do n’t even know how I look ! ”
When the orphan perceived the “ Inoshiro ” citizen taking on the icons of the other two , it almost abandoned its whole classification scheme in confusion .
The “ Inoshiro ” citizen was behaving more like the fourth citizen , now — though vis actions still did n’t coincide with the orphan ’s intentions .
The orphan ’s symbol for the fourth citizen kept track of that citizen ’s appearance and location in the scape , but it was also beginning to distil the essence of the orphan ’s own mental images and short - term goals , creating a summary of all the aspects of the orphan ’s state of mind which seemed to have some connection to the fourth citizen ’s behaviour .
Few symbols possessed sharply defined boundaries , though ; most were as permeable and promiscuous as plasmid - swapping bacteria .
The symbol for the “ Inoshiro ” citizen copied some of the state - of - mind structures from the symbol for the fourth citizen , and began trying them out for itself .
At first , the ability to represent highly summarised “ mental images ’ and ” goals ’ was no help at all — because it was still linked to the orphan ’s state of mind .
The “ Inoshiro ” symbol ’s blindly cloned machinery kept predicting that the “ Inoshiro ” citizen would behave according to the orphan ’s own plans … and that never happened .
In the face of this repeated failure , the links soon withered — and the tiny , crude model - of - a - mind left inside the “ Inoshiro ” symbol was set free to find the “ Inoshiro ” state - of - mind that best matched the citizen ’s actual behaviour .
The symbol tried out different connections , different theories , hunting for the one that made most sense … and the orphan suddenly grasped the fact that the “ Inoshiro ” citizen had been imitating the fourth citizen .
The infotrope seized on this revelation — and tried to make the fourth citizen mimic the “ Inoshiro ” citizen back .
The fourth citizen proclaimed , “ I ’m an orphan !
I ’m an orphan !
I do n’t even know how I look ! ”
The “ Gabriel ” citizen pointed at the fourth citizen and said , “ Ve is an orphan ! ”
The “ Inoshiro ” citizen agreed wearily , “ Ve is an orphan .
But why does ve have to be this slow ! ”
Inspired — driven by the infotrope — the orphan tried playing the “ Ve is — ? ” game again , this time using the response “ an orphan ” for the fourth citizen .
The others confirmed the choice , and soon the words were bound to the symbol for the fourth citizen .
When the orphan ’s three friends left the scape , the fourth citizen remained .
But the fourth citizen had exhausted vis ability to offer interesting surprises , so after pestering some of the other citizens to no avail , the orphan returned to the library .
The input navigator had learnt the simplest indexing scheme used by the library , and when the infotrope hunted for ways to tie up the loose ends in the patterns half - formed in the scape , it succeeded in driving the input navigator to locations in the library which referred to the four citizens ’ mysterious linear words : Inoshiro , Gabriel , Blanca , and Orphan .
There were streams of data indexed by each of these words , though none seemed to connect to the citizens themselves .
The orphan saw so many images of fleshers , often with wings , associated with the word “ Gabriel ” that it built a whole symbol out of the regularities it found , but the new symbol barely overlapped with that of the golden - furred citizen .
The orphan drifted away from its infotrope - driven search many times ; old addresses in the library , etched in memory , tugged at the input navigator .
Once , viewing a scene of a grimy flesher child holding up an empty wooden bowl , the orphan grew bored and veered back towards more familiar territory .
Halfway there , it came across a scene of an adult flesher crouching beside a bewildered lion cub and lifting it into vis arms .
A lioness lay on the ground behind them , motionless and bloody .
The flesher stroked the head of the cub .
“ Poor little Yatima . ” Something in the scene transfixed the orphan .
It whispered to the library , “ Yatima . Yatima . ”
It had never heard the word before , but the sound of it resonated deeply .
The lion cub mewed .
The flesher crooned , “ My poor little orphan . ”
The orphan moved between the library and the scape with the orange sky and the flying - pig fountain .
Sometimes its three friends were there , or other citizens would play with it for a while ; sometimes there was only the fourth citizen .
The fourth citizen rarely appeared the same from visit to visit — ve tended to resemble the most striking image the orphan had seen in the library in the preceding few kilotau — but ve was still easy to identify : ve was the one who only became visible when the two navigators moved apart .
Every time the orphan arrived in the scape , it stepped back from itself and checked out the fourth citizen .
Sometimes it adjusted the icon , bringing it closer to a specific memory , or fine - tuning it according to the aesthetic preferences of the input classifying networks — biases first carved out by a few dozen trait fields , then deepened or silted - up by the subsequent data stream .
Sometimes the orphan mimicked the flesher it had seen picking up the lion cub : tall and slender , with deep black skin and brown eyes , dressed in a purple robe .
And once , when the citizen bound to “ Inoshiro ” said with mock sorrow , “ Poor little orphan , you still do n’t have a name , ” the orphan remembered the scene , and responded , “ Poor little Yatima . ”
The golden - furred citizen said , “ I think it does now . ”
From then on , they all called the fourth citizen “ Yatima . ”
They said it so many times , making such a fuss about it , that the orphan soon bound it to the symbol as strongly as “ Orphan . ”
The orphan watched the citizen bound to “ Inoshiro ” chanting triumphantly at the fourth citizen : “ Yatima ! Yatima !
Ha ha ha !
I ’ve got five parents , and five part - siblings , and I ’ll always be older than you ! ”
The orphan made the fourth citizen respond , “ Inoshiro !
Inoshiro !
Ha ha ha ! ”
But it could n’t think what to say next .

Princess Eugenie Caught in Naked Romp at Private School
, 18 , daughter of Duchess of Yorkand , Duke of York , took part in a naked celebration at her private school outside of London .
The teenage princess is the granddaughter of
Eugenie has attended Marlborough College in Wilts for five years at a reported cost of $ 44,700 per year .
She and a group of students decided to let their hair down and shed their clothing in an impromptu middle of the night romp that involved dancing and nakedness .
The young women had been partying at a local pub prior to returning to campus at the end of the evening according to CNN International .
A senior staff member awoke to shrieks of laughter and witnessed a dozen females dancing nude in the moonlight .
The incident is reportedly the talk of campus .
Those implicated received a stern lecture and were told not to stay at school on weekends .
This incident sounds like something Fergie would have really enjoyed at the same age .
As for the Queen , she 's likely worked herself into a Royal snit .
Eugenie , sixth in line to the royal throne behind several male cousins including Prince William and Prince Harry , celebrated her 18th birthday by doing a Tatler magazine photo shoot .
Check out more photos of Eugenie and her new boyfriend out clubbing in the Mayfair section of London .

Two weeks ago , I wrote a brief article in remembrance of Abdul Rahman al - Amri , a Saudi prisoner at Guantánamo , and a long - term hunger striker , who died on May 30 , 2007 , apparently by committing suicide .
June 10 was another bleak and overlooked anniversary , as it was exactly two years ago that the news was announced that the first three prisoners had died at Guantánamo .
Unlike the death of Amri , which went almost unremarked at the time , the deaths of Ali al - Salami , Mani al - Utaybi , and Yasser al - Zahrani  who , like Amri , were also long - term hunger strikers , and appeared to have taken the only form of protest available to them ( although the suicide notes they reportedly left have never been released )  sparked international outrage after Rear Admiral Harry Harris , the commander of Guantánamo , said , " I believe this was not an act of desperation , but an act of asymmetric warfare committed against us , " and Colleen Graffy , the deputy assistant secretary of state for public diplomacy , described the suicides as a " good PR move to draw attention . "
The administration soon assumed a more placatory role , as Cully Stimson , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs , was pushed forward to say , " I would n’t characterize it as a good PR move .
What I would say is that we are always concerned when someone takes his own life , because as Americans , we value life , even the lives of violent terrorists who are captured waging war against our country . "
However , as I explain in The Guantánamo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America ’s Illegal Prison , the administration soon resumed the offensive , issuing claims about the men  as with Amri a year later  which were not only extraordinarily insensitive , but also undeniably contentious , given that all three men had , like Amri , died without having had the opportunity to test the allegations against them in a court of law :
" In an attempt to stifle further dissent , and to bolster their view that the three men were hardened terrorists , the Pentagon released details of the allegations against them , which served only to highlight almost everything that was wrong with the system at Guantánamo Zahrani was accused of being a Taliban fighter who ‘ facilitated weapons purchases , ’ but it was apparent that he was only 17 years old at the time of his capture [ in Afghanistan ] , and that this scenario was highly unlikely .
In Utaybi ’s case , the only ‘ evidence ’ that he was an ‘ enemy combatant ’ was his involvement with Jamaat - al - Tablighi , the vast [ and apolitical ] worldwide missionary organization whose alleged connection to terrorism was duly exaggerated by the Pentagon , which had the effrontery to describe it as ‘ an al - Qaeda 2nd tier recruitment organization . ’
Heartless to the last , the administration also admitted that he had actually been approved for ‘ transfer to the custody of another country ’ in November 2005 , although Navy Commander Robert Durand said he ‘ did not know whether Utaybi had been informed about the transfer recommendation before he killed himself . ’
In the case of Salami , the Pentagon alleged that he was ‘ a mid- to high - level al - Qaeda operative who had key ties to principal facilitators and senior members of the group . ’
" Although none of the men had taken part in any tribunals , more detailed allegations against Salami surfaced in the ‘ evidence ’ for his CSRT [ Combatant Status Review Tribunal , the military reviews convened to rubber - stamp the prisoners ’ prior designation as ‘ enemy combatants ’ without rights ] , although a close inspection of the allegations reveals that they were mostly made by unidentified ‘ members ’ of al - Qaeda , either in Guantánamo or in other secret prisons : ‘ a senior al - Qaeda facilitator ’ identified him , another senior al - Qaeda figure  a ‘ lieutenant  identified him as being ‘ associated with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , ’ the ‘ al - Qaeda weapons trainer from Tora Bora ’ identified him from his time in Kabul and at Khaldan [ a military training camp in Afghanistan ] , and he was also identified as ‘ an al - Qaeda courier , ’ and as someone who ‘ worked directly for Osama bin Laden ’s family . ’
" Shorn of these allegations  which summon up images of various ‘ significant ’ prisoners being shown the ‘ family album ’ [ of prisoner mugshots , which was shown to all the prisoners in interrogations ] in painful circumstances  the only other allegation was that the ‘ Issa ’ guest house [ in Faisalabad , where he was seized with 17 other prisoners , who are all still in Guantánamo , even though the majority have made viable claims that they were students , seized by mistake ] , received the equivalent of jihadi junk mail : apparently , the residents of the house ‘ routinely received endorsement letters from a well - known al - Qaeda operative ’ to attend the Khaldan camp . "
Although the deaths of the three men  and of Amri a year later  encouraged the Saudi government to apply increased leverage on the U.S. administration in an attempt to secure the return of the remaining Saudi prisoners that was ultimately successful  93 were repatriated from June 2006 ( two weeks after the deaths ) to December 2007 , and only 13 now remain  the repercussions for the majority of the prisoners were truly dreadful .
After riots broke out in Camp IV  the only part of the prison that bore any resemblance to conditions stipulated by the Geneva Conventions , where prisoners shared dormitories and were allowed a fair degree of social interaction  the military shelved plans to open up communal areas in a new block , Camp VI , which opened in December 2006 , and instead held the camp ’s relocated prisoners  including a number from Camp IV , and even the majority of prisoners who had , like Mani al - Utaybi , been cleared for release after military reviews  in strict solitary confinement for 22 or 23 hours a day .
This intolerable situation prevails to this day , as Human Rights Watch conclude this week , in a detailed report , Locked Up Alone : Detention Conditions and Mental Health at Guantánamo [ .pdf ] , which profiles the sometimes chronic mental health problems of a number of prisoners .
Two years on from the deaths of Ali al - Salami , Mani al - Utaybi , and Yasser al - Zahrani , and the U.S. administration ’s disgraceful response , the conditions in which the majority of the 273 prisoners still in Guantánamo are held is a complete disgrace .
At the very least , the administration should immediately move the 70 or so prisoners who have been cleared for release in to Camp IV , and should also reflect if it can find a valid explanation for holding the rest of the prisoners in conditions of such cruel and barbaric isolation that they are literally losing their minds .
The great irony is that those put forward for trial by military commission at Guantánamo  as seen in last week ’s arraignment of self - confessed 9/11 architect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others accused of plotting and facilitating the 9/11 attacks  at least have the opportunity to speak in public .
Those who have been cleared of wrongdoing ( but who cannot be repatriated because of international treaties preventing the repatriation of foreign nationals to countries where they face the risk of torture ) and those who , bizarrely , the administration regards as too dangerous to be released , but not dangerous enough to be charged , remain completely isolated from the outside world , slowly losing their sanity while Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and the few other prisoners facing trial by military commission who openly admit their allegiance to al - Qaeda , are rewarded with the opportunity to challenge the legitimacy of their detention  merrily reconfiguring the trial system as a circus , and defiantly celebrating their desire for martyrdom  in the full glare of the world ’s media .
How much longer , I wonder , before another of these hidden , forgotten prisoners  one of the many innocent men , or one of the purported " minor threats "  takes his own life , joining Ali al - Salami , Mani al - Utaybi , Yasser al - Zahrani , and Abdul Rahman al - Amri in an action that , though proscribed in Islam , is perceived as the only escape from indefinite imprisonment without charge , without trial , and without hope ?
What We Want from the New Punisher - The Superhero Show
About a year ago , we learned in jaw - dropping detail about the questions asked of those seeking employment at Bush ’s Justice Department .
Thanks to Alberto Gonzales and Monica Goodling — remember them ? — job applicants for civil service jobs were quizzed with all kind of personal questions that the DoJ could n’t legally ask .
But what about all of those Justice Department employees who were already on staff when Goodling & Co. got there ?
It was too late to ask them personal questions during their interviews .
How , then , could they ensure that DoJ employees were pure by conservative Republican standards ?
Apparently , they found ways .
( via Paul Kiel )
The Justice Department ’s inspector general is investigating whether a career attorney in the department was dismissed from her job because of rumors that she is a lesbian .
The case grew out of a larger inquiry into the firings of U.S. attorneys and politicization at Justice under former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Several people interviewed by the inspector general ’s staff described the case to NPR and said they came away with the impression that the Attorney General ’s office decided not to renew Leslie Hagen ’s contract because of the talk about her sexual orientation .
Hagen received the highest possible ratings for her work as liaison between the Justice Department and the U.S. attorneys ’ committee on Native American issues .
Her final job evaluation lists five categories for supervisors to rank her performance .
For each category , a neat X fills the box marked , “ Outstanding . ”
And at the bottom of the page , under “ overall rating level , ” she also got the top mark : Outstanding .
The form is dated February 1 , 2007 .
Several months before that evaluation , Hagen was told her contract would not be renewed .
After Hagen won awards for her work as a federal prosecutor , former U.S. Attorney Tom Heffelfinger recruited her to DC for her job , because , as he put it , she was “ the best qualified person in the nation . ”
Everyone Hagen worked with raved about her amazing work and her supervisors were anxious to renew her contract .
But as we know all too well , in the Bush administration , qualifications and outstanding on - the - job performance hardly matter .
Justice Department e-mails obtained by NPR show that Gonzales ’s senior counsel Monica Goodling had a particular interest in Hagen ’s duties .
A few months before Hagen was let go , according to one e-mail , Goodling removed part of Hagen ’s job portfolio — the part dealing with child exploitation and abuse . [… ]
[ B ]y all accounts , Hagen was a GOP loyalist .
So , what was Goodling ’s problem with Hagen ?
The Justice Department ’s inspector general is looking into whether Hagen was dismissed after a rumor reached Goodling that Hagen is a lesbian .
As one Republican source put it , “ To some people , that ’s even worse than being a Democrat . ”
Several people interviewed by the inspector general ’s staff said investigators asked whether people drew a connection between the rumors and Hagen ’s dismissal .
The witnesses , who spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity , said they felt that the rumors led to the decision not to renew Hagen ’s contract .
Someone who worked in Hagen ’s office says that in a 2006 meeting , senior officials were told that Hagen ’s contract would not be renewed because someone on the attorney general ’s staff had a problem with Hagen .
The problem , it was suggested during the conversation , was sexual orientation — or what was rumored to be Hagen ’s sexual orientation .
One person at the meeting asked , “ Is that really an issue ? ”
But the decision had been made .
I realize it ’s foolish of me to be surprised by anything the Bush administration does , but Hagen ’s case is rather extraordinary .
Respected lawyer , impeccable credentials Republican loyalist , outstanding performance evaluations — everything the Bush gang could hope for .
But then the graduate of Pat Robertson ’s college heard Hagen might be gay , and despite the requests of Hagen ’s supervisors , Hagen was gone .
I know a few too many Dems are at each other ’s throats right now over just awful ( fill in the blank with Clinton or Obama ) is when compared to ( fill in the blank with Clinton or Obama ) , but stories like this one are a reminder of why we need a Democratic president in 2009 .
There ’s just too much work that needs to be done , too many agencies that need to be repaired , and too many messes that need to be cleaned up .
What happened to Hagen happened at the Justice Department , for crying out loud .
Mixx , a social media submission site , is a newcomer on the scene , so it understandably will take a while for it to catch up with older sites like Digg , Propeller , Reddit , and StumbleUpon .
That said , this article looks at the current state of Mixx and the potential future of its small but devoted community .
This might come as a surprise , but Mixx serves approximately 500,000 unique visitors per month and is breaking their engagement record every month , even though the site is barely 6 months out of its private beta .
One of the reasons for this is that so much of the activity takes place in the form of conversations ( in the private groups as well as user - forums ) that is n’t reflected in the metrics .
The Value Of Mixx
Mixx , like many of its compatriots , such as Thoof , Streamy , Plime , Shoutwire , has n’t gotten the attention of Digg and StumbleUpon .
But why does it deserve this attention ?
On a very basic level , Mixx does everything you would expect from your typical social news site .
It ’s completely user - driven , and all content is submitted , voted upon , and commented on by the site ’s users .
Content can be submitted to three different categories based on content type – News , Pictures , and Video .
What sets
Mixx apart from many of the other popular sites is that not only has the site incorporated some of the best features from the many other popular social news sites and aggregated them , but the team behind the site has left the keys to the kingdom in the hands of the community .
Community Recognition
Mixx includes an abundance of innovative and differentiating features .
You can create and edit your own custom homepage ( not only which categories you want to display but what order ) .
You can create groups and participate in discussions away from the comment threads ( both privately and publicly ) .
Unlike Digg ( which stopped recognizing the contributions of its community members long ago ) , Mixx routinely awards the community with badges in a wide array of categories ( not in an elitist fashion but in an appreciative fashion – from top submitter to hyperactive , enthusiast , and curmudgeon ) .
You can even keep track of all the movers and shakers on the site through The Mixx Lounge .
In - Depth Features
There ’s also fairly well - implemented content localization , alerts that actually work and can be useful , a Facebook application , user - edited categories as well as tags , and a budding user - forum created by Mixxers for Mixxers .
This forum is only moderated by other users and the Mixx staff routinely interacts with users , addresses their concerns , and takes their ideas for how Mixx should evolve next ( the forum has almost 200 users , over 600 topics , almost 10,000 posts ) .
Founding Interest
If that is n’t enough for you , the site has a company blog where Chris ( the founder ) writes at least once a week and responds to user emails and talks about upcoming features .
Multiple users have told me that Chris , Kerry , and Kori Hill reply to users emails very promptly and address even the minutest concerns .
The site also has relationships with multiple news outlets , including the LA Times and the NY Times .
There is a beautifully designed iPhone version of the site , a Twitter account that micro-blogs about the site , a robust related - content implementation that helps reduce redundancy , and may I add , the site is spearheading breaking news through social media .
Sounds like a lot , does n’t it ?
That ’s because the site is really doing so much more than it gets credit for .
Even I , who wrote a fairly unimpressed review of the site when it first launched , have rethought my take on Mixx and am looking forward to participating more on the site and better understanding this largely unappreciated audience .
Why Has n’t Mixx Gotten More Attention ?
The feature implementation as well as the partnerships that the site is working on really show everything that Chris McGill and his team are bringing to social news , but all this brings us to our original question :
Why is Mixx not getting the attention it deserves ?
To answer this question we have to look at the reasons why people participate in social news .
As I outlined back in January , there are 5 reasons why people participate in social news :
Status and reputation : Just because we want to climb to the top of the leader board and be recognized for our efforts .
Monetary reward : Because we can make money through it .
In this case the money is n’t coming from the site , rather from someone on whose behalf you ’re participating .
Self - promotion : Because we want to be in a position to push our own content and build traffic to our own site / product / service .
Helping others : Because we can help other people out .
Part of the reason why I continue to participate on Digg is because I know how much value the site can create for a content producer , and if I can help someone get closer to that goal , that ’s enough for me .
Idealism : Because we believe in the principle of socially driven news and want to be a part of the movement .
Let ’s add one more point to that list : Enjoyment : Because a particular social news site brings us new , interesting , and engaging content from niches that mainstream news outlets would n’t otherwise be highlighting .
Not to marginalize the Mixx community , but a large part of it is comprised of users who were previously active at Digg and left after increasing frustration with the former site , and then found a much more welcoming home at Mixx .
( For more , check out the Digg Refugees group in the Mixx forums ) .
While this is great for Mixx as it gives the site some incredibly active participants and evangelists , it does create some problems .
Incentive is an incredibly important aspect of any social news site , and right now , while there is incentive for these ex-Diggers to participate ( since they get to establish themselves as Mixx early adopters and get the status and reputation ) , there is n’t much reason for anyone else to participate – yet .
Let me explain .
Why More People Have n’t Moved to Mixx
General submitters :
As a submitter , if you have the option to submit your content to one site , you ’re probably most likely to submit it to Digg ( because it is the largest and most active site and you can get the most attention to your submission on that site ) .
Even if you submit to multiple sites , Mixx is quite far down the list for some people and the exposure simply is n’t there .

Even if you submit to multiple sites , Mixx is quite far down the list for some people and the exposure simply is n’t there .
General readership : Until very recently , Mixx was n’t breaking any news or finding exceptionally better content .
The site has added a new ‘ breaking news ’ feature that allows them to address that concern , and when the news of Charlton Heston ’s death broke , Mixx had the news five minutes later ( this feature is very similar to what Propeller does ) whereas it can take most sites hours to get such content enough votes and be promoted .
That said , there is n’t only more content at Digg , Propeller , Reddit , and StumbleUpon , but the content is submitted to these sites more frequently and is generally fresher and more unique .
Ultimately , the readership goes where the content is .
This is understandable simply because other sites have enormously large user bases compared to Mixx .

Content producers : Again , because the community is relatively small , there is no particularly compelling reason to target Mixx – right now .
The outbound traffic is almost non-existent , so your content may only be read by four to five people .
That said , comments on Mixx tend to be much better than those on Digg and people try to write down constructive thoughts rather than just trying to be funny and get the comment voted up .

That said , comments on Mixx tend to be much better than those on Digg and people try to write down constructive thoughts rather than just trying to be funny and get the comment voted up .
Marketers : I think the one point that almost no one in the social media space understands or appreciates is the impact marketers have on social news sites .
These are the people that have the most to gain ( financially ) from participating on these sites and therefore have not only a significant incentive to create unique , high - quality , and the most highly - targeted content for the audience ( because , after all , good content is the best linkbait ) , but they also have a significant incentive to participate most frequently and be community members in good standing .
Because the return on investment from Mixx is currently very close to 0 , marketers find little value in Mixx ( apart from engagement in form of comments , if the story is promoted ) .
I ’m sure by now you have seen a theme in all four of the points made above .
Many people do n’t want to submit yet because the community that will see the content is too small .
The readership is n’t there because there is n’t a big enough community finding and vetting the content fast enough .
Content producers are n’t targeting
Mixx because there is n’t enough of a community that they can convert to a readership .
Marketers do n’t care much for Mixx because there is n’t any ROI from the relatively small community .
As I write this , I completely understand the problem Mixx has .
Their product is great and , in many ways , it is one of the best products out there .
The problem is that building a community is like a chicken and an egg question .
Without a community you ca n’t be successful , and without any kind of cachet you ’re not going to have an easy time building a community .
That said , Mixx finds itself in an excellent position .
They have started with a clean slate and are identified in staunch opposition to everything that is wrong with the most popular social news site right now , Digg .
What defines Mixx and the future of the site is its passionate devotion to all its users and the Mixxers ’ devotion to the site .
For example , thanks to the community members , the Mixx feed was added both to popurls as well as FriendFeed to be aggregated for all other users .
These users take it as their personal mission to campaign for the site and spread the word about the community .
I took a look at this and I believe it is precisely because of this that Mixx is more successful than all of the smaller social news communities I previously mentioned .
Mixx is doing really well for the stage that they ’re in .
They are growing fast , the conversation is moving along very nicely , and above all , the people behind the site understand what the problems are ( not only with their site but with all the other sites in the space ) and are actively working on fixing those problems .
After talking to many people who actively participate on the site , I ’m confident that a year from now Mixx will be a force to be reckoned with .
They are embracing social news and are n’t afraid of their community ( like some other social news sites ) .
They have no issue with giving complete control to you , the user , and working for you rather than having you work for them .
They have taken the principle of community to heart and they truly believe that you know what ’s next better than they do .
And that , I believe , is what will help them join the ranks of the big four .
All Mixx needs is for the social news space ( participants , content producers , marketers , other sites in the space ) to understand that the site is 6 months out of private beta and evaluate it on that basis .
Yes , the short - term return on investment is n’t the highest for the community members , but based on my evaluation of the site , if things keep going the way they are along with a little help from others interested in the best social news experience ( people exactly like you , the reader ) , Mixx will mature into one of the top social news communities out there .
Even though I am one of the most active users on Digg and StumbleUpon and work for Propeller , I do n’t have an issue with this evaluation because I believe social news is not a zero sum game .
We can learn from Mixx and Mixxers , improve the social news space , and make the entire social news experience much better for our audience .

AUSTIN , Texas – Last year , Twitter was the big winner at South by Southwest .
In 2008 , it 's all about Sched.org .
Every year , one web service captures all the buzz at the two - week - long conference by proving itself to be innovative , geek friendly and , perhaps most importantly , insanely useful .
This year , a simple calendaring service is the site most plugged into SXSW 's zeitgeist .
The Sched.org website displays the entire conference calendar , covering the interactive , film and music events plus parties and unofficial galleries , on a dynamic , easily customizable web page .
The site has proven itself to be a godsend to overwhelmed attendees trying to figure out where to go , when to get there , what the most popular events are and who you 'll see once you arrive .
" It solved the problem of complete chaos in the schedule - management part , " says Chirag Mehta , the site 's co-creator .
At 2007 's conference , that role was filled by Twitter , a microblogging service that lets users post simple updates about their location .
Keyed - in geeks used Twitter to find out where all the best parties were happening and who was there .
Since it was geared toward mobile use , it proved to be indispensable at the busy conference plagued by flaky WiFi connections .
But while Twitter came from established Silicon Valley digerati – the app's creators include the founders of Blogger , which was bought by Google in 2003 – Sched.org was cooked up in 14 hours by two Florida developers with day jobs .
Mehta , a 27 - year - old IT consultant , built the site with 24 - year - old web designer Taylor McKnight .
It was McKnight who found inspiration for Sched.org while on a Mexican holiday with his family .
He began thinking about how to tackle SXSW 's sprawling schedule and built a simple version of it .
McKnight coded up a quick demo and sent it to Mehta the day before his vacation ended .
" Taylor showed it to me at 12 noon that Sunday , " Mehta says .
" I said , ' This is really cool ....
You 're going to drag me into this , are n't you ?
I can stay up until 2 a.m. , so we 've got 14 hours .
Let 's build it . ' "
Using a simple Ajax interface , the two have built an elegant application .
The login is simple – just pick a user name and password and Sched.org sets up your account .
Each day 's festival events are laid out in their own tab .
Click on a tab to browse the events and pick which panel , film or music show you want to attend .
One click adds the item to a personalized page with a unique URL , which can be bookmarked on a mobile device ( it looks great on an iPhone ) or printed out .
You can also see who is attending which event , and sort the events by popularity .
By Saturday afternoon , Sched.org already had 1,900 users signed up and utilizing the site .
McKnight and Mehta have a history together .
The two recently collaborated to build Chime.tv , a video - search website that seeks out clips on all the popular video - sharing sites and presents them in a TV - like interface , complete with dedicated channels for different topics .
McKnight , along with his friend Daniel Westermann - Clark , also previously built Podbop , a search mashup that helps you discover bands playing in your city , displaying venue information and links to MP3s so you can sample the music .
Mehta and McKnight were able to input the official schedule from the South by Southwest website , but they had to enter all the unofficial events by hand .
" If we would have known that this would have caught on like this , we would have spent another day making sure that the unofficial ( events ) were automated , " said Mehta .
The pair imagines they will be able to build unique versions for other crowded conferences or big , multi-day events once they iron out the kinks .
But for now , connected geeks are using Sched.org to find the hottest kicks around Austin – and breathing a collective sigh of relief that somebody else did most of the dirty work for them .
Taylor McKnight ( left ) and Chirag Mehta worked together to create Sched.org .
The easy - to - use web app is a hit among SXSW conference attendees .

An Interview with Douglas R. Hofstadter , following '' I am a Strange Loop ' '
Douglas R. Hofstadter is best - known for his book Gödel , Escher , Bach ( GEB for short ) .
In his latest book , I am a Strange Loop , he visits once again many of the themes originally presented in that book .
The interview below was conducted in September 2007 and was originally published , in Hebrew , in the online culture magazine Haayal Hakore .
The interview was conducted by Tal Cohen and Yarden Nir-Buchbinder .
The first part of I am a Strange Loop reads like a condensed version of GEB , by explaining the idea of consciousness as a strange loop .
However , unlike in GEB , you do not discuss AI in this book .
Are you disappointed with the way cognitive / AI research has advanced in the past three decades ?
Did you , like many other researchers of the time , believe that intelligent machines are “ just around the corner ” ?
And if so , do you still believe it will happen , eventually ?
I certainly did not believe intelligent machines were just around the corner when I wrote GEB .
[ Chapter 19 ] of GEB makes that very clear indeed .
Am I disappointed by the amount of progress in cognitive science and AI in the past 30 years or so ?
Not at all .
To the contrary , I would have been extremely upset if we had come anywhere close to reaching human intelligence — it would have made me fear that our minds and souls were not deep .
Reaching the goal of AI in just a few decades would have made me dramatically lose respect for humanity , and I certainly do n't want ( and never wanted ) that to happen .
I am a deep admirer of humanity at its finest and deepest and most powerful — of great people such as Helen Keller , Albert Einstein , Ella Fitzgerald , Albert Schweitzer , Frederic Chopin , Raoul Wallenberg , Fats Waller , and on and on .
I find endless depth in such people ( many more are listed on [ chapter 17 ] of I Am a Strange Loop ) , and I would hate to think that all that beauty and profundity and goodness could be captured — even approximated in any way at all ! — in the horribly rigid computational devices of our era .
Do I still believe it will happen someday ?
I can't say for sure , but I suppose it will eventually , yes .
I would n't want to be around then , though .
Such a world would be too alien for me .
I prefer living in a world where computers are still very very stupid .
And I get a huge kick out of laughing at the hilariously unpredictable inflexibility of the computer models of mental processes that my doctoral students and I co-design .
It helps remind me of the immense subtlety and elusiveness of the human mind .
Indeed , I am very glad that we still have a very very long ways to go in our quest for AI .
I think of this seemingly “ pessimistic ” view of mine as being in fact a profound kind of optimism , whereas the seemingly “ optimistic ” visions of Ray Kurzweil and others strike me as actually being a deeply pessimistic view of the nature of the human mind .
( I say all this much more poetically on p. 522 of Le Ton beau de Marot , by the way . )
We 'll return to Kurzweil soon .
You use the word “ soul ” , rather than consciousness .
While you clearly qualified the term to remove any religious connotations , avoiding such connotations is not really possible ; “ soul ” is a very loaded symbol in this respect .
Why did you choose to use it , and not , for example , “ mind ” or “ consciousness ” or any of several other , less - loaded alternatives ?
I used the word “ soul ” because , out of all the various words that one might use — “ consciousness ” , “ intentionality ” , “ mind ” , and so forth — it is the one that I think most evocatively suggests the deep mystery of first - person existence that any philosophically inclined person must wonder about many times during their life .
But I think that the first - person pronoun “ I ” is just as evocative a word for the same thing .
I could also have used the word “ spirit ” , I guess , but that , too , would have seemed loaded with religious flavor to many readers .
The point is , whenever one talks about what life is , from the inside , one gets very close to what religion itself is all about .
It therefore should n't be too big a surprise that I appropriated a religion - flavored word to talk about a deep mystery that is so close to the very core of religion .
One of the most surprising arguments in the book ( it has in fact appeared in his previous book , Le Ton beau de Marot ) is the idea that the soul outlives the body by having its copies , or “ soul - shards ” , exist in many brains — the brains of other people , who have known the deceased ; perhaps a stronger variation of the idea that a person lives so long as others remember him .
You present a compelling argument for the notion of a soul surviving its physical body by being spread across multiple brains ; the more a person is familiar to others , the better his soul is “ present ” in their brain , too .
How will you respond to the claim that the “ presence ” of one soul in another soul ’s brain is merely a simulation mechanism , developed by the evolution process as a means to improve survival ?
( Being able to predict what members of your clan are about to do can certainly be a powerful survival tool . )
My argument in I Am a Strange Loop is spelled out clearly .
If a person ’s soul is truly a pattern , then it can be realized in different media .
Wherever that pattern exists in a sufficiently fine - grained way , then it is , by my definition , the soul itself and not some kind of “ mere simulation ” of it .
“ Mere simulation ” is a phrase that sounds suspiciously like John Searle when he is contemptuously deriding AI in his usual flippant fashion .
However , as I see it , there is no black - and - white dividing line between “ mere simulations ” of a complex entity and full realizations of it — there are just lots and lots of shades of gray all along the way .
This spectrum is pointed out in many places in my books , including the three marvelous short stories by Stanislaw Lem included in The Mind ’s I .
We 'll get back to Lem ’s books , too ...
If indeed a soul can survive by being present in other brains , then certain souls survive for many centuries after their primary brain is gone .
You provide an example with Frederic Chopin , saying that “ Chopin , the actual person , survives so much in our world , even today ” .
A common saying is that authors are “ immortalized ” by their books .
Your notion of soul - shards casts a whole new light on this idea , suggesting that authors ( and artists , such as musicians ) truly extend the survival of their soul by making their works well - known .
In this sense , it seems like your own books make a huge effort to familiarize the readers with your inner life , the making of your soul ; for example , where most authors would have written “ My fabric was greatly influenced by many people , from Niels Bohr to Charlie Brown ” , you provide a detailed list of over 45 names .
The book ( and your previous book , Le Ton beau de Marot ) is peppered with scores of anecdotes about your personal life .
As a reader , I certainly feel like I know you much better than I know most other authors , certainly authors of non-fiction works .
Can this be viewed as an attempt to entrench shards of your soul in the minds of your readers ?
Is this your shot at immortality ?
I am not shooting at immortality through my books , no .
Nor do I think Chopin was shooting at immortality through his music .
That strikes me as a very selfish goal , and I do n't think Chopin was particularly selfish .
I would also say that I think that music comes much closer to capturing the essence of a composer ’s soul than do a writer ’s ideas capture the writer ’s soul .
Perhaps some very emotional ideas that I express in my books can get across a bit of the essence of my soul to some readers , but I think that Chopin ’s music probably does a lot better job ( and the same holds , of course , for many composers ) .
I personally do n't have any thoughts about “ shooting for immortality ” when I write .
I try to write simply in order to get ideas out there that I believe in and find fascinating , because I 'd like to let other people be able share those ideas .
But intellectual ideas alone , no matter how fascinating they are , are not enough to transmit a soul across brains .
Perhaps , as I say , my autobiographical passages — at least some of them — get tiny shards of my soul across to some people .
But such autobiographical story - telling is not nearly as effective a means of soul - transmission as is living with someone you love for many years of your lives , and sharing profound life goals with them — that ’s for sure !
Scientist and inventor Ray Kurzweil presents a different take at immortality , a more physical one .
Like you , Kurzweil views the soul as “ software ” that can be executed on different “ hardware ” .
He further believes that in a relatively short while , we will have electronic hardware which is the equivalent of the human brain ( which you eloquently characterize as a “ universal machine ” , capable as “ executing ” any “ soul software ” ) .
Once such hardware is available , Kurzweil believes immortality would have been reached : by “ downloading ” our soul - software onto electronic brains ( “ Giant Electronic Brains ” ? ) , we will become immortals , able to create backups of our souls to be restored in case of disaster , and able to shift our physical location anywhere in the speed of a software download .
Do you share Kurzweil ’s view of hardware being able to execute human soul software within the foreseeable future ?
Do you agree with his view of this being the equivalent of immortality — will the software running on the electronic brain be the same “ I ” ?
I think Ray Kurzweil is terrified by his own mortality and deeply longs to avoid death .
I understand this obsession of his and am even somehow touched by its ferocious intensity , but I think it badly distorts his vision .
As I see it , Kurzweil ’s desperate hopes seriously cloud his scientific objectivity .
I think Kurzweil sees technology as progressing so deterministically fast ( Moore ’s Law , etc. ) that inevitably , within a few decades , hardware will be so fast and nanotechnology so advanced that things unbelievable to us now will be easily doable .
A key element in this whole vision is that no one will need to understand the mind or brain in order to copy a particular human ’s mind with perfect accuracy , because trillions of tiny “ nanobots ” will swarm through the bloodstream in the human brain and will report back all the “ wiring details ” of that particular brain , which at that point constitute a very complex table of data that can be fed into a universal computer program that executes neuron - firings , and presto — that individual ’s mind has been reinstantiated in an electronic medium .
( This vision is quite reminiscent of the scenario painted in my piece “ A Conversation with Einstein ’s Brain ” toward the end of The Mind ’s I , actually , with the only difference being that there is no computer processing anything — it ’s all done in the pages of a huge book , with a human being playing the role of the processor . )

Rather ironically , this vision totally bypasses the need for cognitive science or AI , because all one needs is the detailed wiring plan of a brain and then it ’s a piece of cake to copy the brain in other media .
And thus , says Kurzweil , we will have achieved immortal souls that live on ( and potentially forever ) in superfast computational hardware — and Kurzweil sees this happening so soon that he is banking on his own brain being thus “ uploaded ” into superfast hardware and hence he expects ( or at least he loudly proclaims that he expects ) to become literally immortal — and not in the way Chopin is quasi-immortal , with just little shards of his soul remaining , but with his whole soul preserved forever .
Well , the problem is that a soul by itself would go crazy ; it has to live in a vastly complex world , and it has to cohabit that world with many other souls , commingling with them just as we do here on earth .
To be sure , Kurzweil sees those things as no problem , either — we 'll have virtual worlds galore , “ up there ” in Cyberheaven , and of course there will be souls by the barrelful all running on the same hardware .
And Kurzweil sees the new software souls as intermingling in all sorts of unanticipated and unimaginable ways .
Well , to me , this “ glorious ” new world would be the end of humanity as we know it .
If such a vision comes to pass , it certainly would spell the end of human life .
Once again , I do n't want to be there if such a vision should ever come to pass .
But I doubt that it will come to pass for a very long time .
How long ?
I just do n't know .
Centuries , at least .
But I do n't know .
I ’m not a futurologist in the least .
But Kurzweil is far more “ optimistic ” ( i.e. , depressingly pessimistic , from my perspective ) about the pace at which all these world - shaking changes will take place .
In any case , the vision that Kurzweil offers ( and other very smart people offer it too , such as Hans Moravec , Vernor Vinge , perhaps Marvin Minsky , and many others — usually people who strike me as being overgrown teen - age sci - fi addicts , I have to say ) is repugnant to me .
On the surface it may sound very idealistic and utopian , but deep down I find it extremely selfish and greedy .
“ Me , me , me ! ” is how it sounds to me — “ I want to live forever ! ”
But who knows ?
I do n't even like thinking about this nutty technology - glorifying scenario , now usually called “ The Singularity ” ( also called by some “ The Rapture of the Nerds ” — a great phrase ! ) — it just gives me the creeps .
Sorry !
Another surprising argument in the book is the almost Zennish claim that the soul is nothing but an illusion ; an illusion that exists because it hallucinates itself .
Perhaps we can say that Hofstadter ’s answer to the psychophysical problem is simply , “ There is no problem , because there is no psycho .
We just imagine it ” — and the fact we imagine it is what leads , in fact , to the psycho ’s existence .
This is the heart of the strange loop that lends its name to the book .
The illusion stems from the brain ’s need to create an internal representation of its surrounding ( for survival purposes ) , and part of this representation necessarily includes the brain itself , the “ I ” , a mechanism that represents itself and thereby leads to its very existence .
Clearly , not every brain represents itself with equal level of detail ; animals , for example , represent the world in their brain in an inferior manner , and hence their self - representation — including their “ I ” , or their “ soul ” — is inferior ; perhaps one could say that they hallucinate less ...
( Before you criticize the idea , please bear in mind that this brief outline probably does it a disservice ; you 'll have to read the book to fully understand this theory , even if you disagree . )
For the sake of discussion , Hofstadter came up with a “ scale ” for measuring the “ soul level ” of different brains : the Huneker scale .
It is named after James Huneker , a music critic who said , in the early 1900 ’s , that “ Small - souled men , no matter how agile their fingers , ” should not attempt playing a certain piano piece by Chopin .
You claim that an “ I ” is nothing but a myth , a hallucination perceived by a hallucination .
Certainly , from this point of view , one can assume that there is nothing sacred about souls .
Yet you seem to hold souls as sacred , being , for example , a vegetarian .
Are n't those views somewhat conflicting ?
If a soul is not real , and is nothing but the high - level result of bio-chemical processes , why care about the survival of other souls ( and in particular “ low - huneker ” souls ) ?
I can't explain this completely rationally .
Sure , my brain falls for the universal myth of the “ I ” — the great hallucination , if you prefer — just as powerfully as does any other human brain .
And this hallucination inevitably gives rise to compassion and empathy ( yes , merely empathy for other hallucinations , if you will , but that ’s just how it is ) .
At some point , in any case , my compassion for other “ beings ” led me very naturally to finding it unacceptable to destroy other sentient beings ( or other hallucinations , if you prefer ) , such as cows and pigs and lambs and fish and chickens , in order to consume their flesh , even if I knew that their ( hallucinated ) sentience was n't quite as high as the ( hallucinated ) sentience of human beings .
Where or on what basis to draw the line ?
How many hunekers merit respect ?
I did n't know exactly .
I decided once to draw the line between mammals and the rest of the animal world , and I stayed with that decision for about twenty years .
Recently , however — just a couple of years ago , while I was writing I Am a Strange Loop , and thus being forced ( by myself ) to think all these issues through very intensely once again — I “ lowered ” my personal line , and I stopped eating animals of any sort or “ size ” .
I feel more at ease with myself this way , although I do suspect , at times , that I may have gone a little too far .
But I 'd rather give a too - large tip to a server than a too - small one , and this is analogous .
I 'd rather err on the side of generosity than on the other side , so I ’m vegetarian .
( However , I do n't worry about the souls of tomatoes , as I point out in Chapter 1 of I Am a Strange Loop . )
Near the end of the book , you discuss performances of Bach ’s music .
Are there any modern performers that you esteem in particular ?
How about variations on Bach ?
Playing Bach in jazz - style is very common , for example .
I do n't pay all that much attention to who is performing classical music , because for me most top - notch performers sound very similar to each other .
There are of course subtle differences between great performers , but what counts most for me is the composer ’s sequence of notes and harmonies , and that ’s always there , just about perfectly .
Small variations on how the notes and harmonies are produced can have small effects , but that ’s all .
Classical music is about the profound meanings put there by the composer , not about subtle tweaks on it brought out by the performer .
At least that ’s how I see it .
You know how much I love analogies — well , here ’s one .
To me , hearing lots of great performers perform the same piece ( and I once had just such an experience — I was at a music festival in Aspen , Colorado where a whole bunch of stunningly talented young pianists performed the very beautiful first movement of the Schumann piano concerto one after the other , and I listened for a couple of hours , and it was fascinating ) is like watching the greatest slalom - skiers in the world on television as they compete against each other in the Olympics .
They ’re all unbelievably great at what they do , and they all come down the very long hill within a second or two of each other , sometimes separated by only tenths or hundredths of a second !
The differences between them are almost microscopic , in the end .
They are all beautiful to watch but I can't tell one from the other .
If somebody told me that they were all the same person wearing different - color uniforms , I would n't shout “ Impossible ! ”
Would you ?
Mind you , this takes nothing away from such people ’s enormous talent , but it just says that many different gifted people can carry out nearly indistinguishable marvelous feats that I myself could never aspire to do at all .
What they do is hugely impressive , but the differences between the performances of these hugely gifted and hard - working individuals are not all that great .
And as in skiing , so in performance of classical music .
Incidentally , to be very clear on this , I would say it ’s a totally different ballgame when it comes to jazz and popular music , because in those cases liberties galore are taken by all performers — inserting one ’s own personality is the name of the game !
“ The very same song ” as sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra can be unbelievably different ( and of course this vast difference is also due in large part to the musicians in the bands accompanying the singers , as well as to the vastly different arrangements ) .
In jazz and popular music , who is playing or singing counts enormously much for me .
It makes all the difference in the world .
But in classical music , who is performing counts for far far less , as long as we are dealing with a highly talented performer .
I have to add that literary translation is a lot more like jazz or pop music than it is like performance of classical music , because once again , the personality of the translator becomes an intrinsic and central part of the “ voice ” that is speaking .
That is inevitable , and it is why translation is such a deep and important art .
Translation is another subject in which Hofstadter finds great interest , ever since he helped translate GEB to French .
Translation is the key subject of Le Ton beau de Marot , and Hofstadter returns to it in this interview ’s final question .
In fact , he uses this question to tie everything together :
When presenting questions about the soul , I am a Strange Loop ( like several of the articles in The Mind ’s I ) draws on science - fiction themes , such as teleportation .
Yet the list of influential people in your life includes no SF authors , and the only SF character in that list is Captain Nemo .
Do you read science fiction at all ?
What are your thoughts on this genre ?
When I was around ten or twelve , I liked science fiction ( I still vividly recall some aspects of the novel Red Planet by Robert Heinlein ) and found it very stimulating , but after a while I grew tired of it .
Nonetheless , I do admire a few science - fiction authors , such as Robert L. Forward ( who was a professional physicist — he ’s the author of Dragon ’s Egg , to which I devote nearly a whole chapter in Le Ton beau de Marot ) and Stanislaw Lem ( author of The Cyberiad , among many other books , from which two wonderful short pieces in The Mind ’s I are taken — and his separate piece Non Serviam is also included in The Mind ’s I ) .
But even Lem , despite all his scientific subtlety and philosophical insight , occasionally troubles me ( I remember I once read some long novel by him that I could n't stand ! ) .
The problem is that too many liberties are taken and one can't really believe in the scenarios any more .
I guess I am pretty old - fashioned in my literary tastes .
I like a powerful , believable novel , such as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns , by Khaled Hosseini , which both take place in Afghanistan , and of course The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger , and Vikram Seth ’s wonderful novel - in- verse The Golden Gate .
That last novel , by the way , was inspired by Pushkin ’s spectacular novel - in- verse Eugene Onegin .
I was in fact led to Eugene Onegin by meeting Seth for a coffee some twenty years ago in a Palo Alto bookstore and learning on that occasion about how he had been deeply inspired by Charles Johnston ’s English rendition of EO , and shortly thereafter I eagerly gobbled down several English translations of EO ( including Johnston ’s , of course ) , in the process falling deeply in love with James Falen ’s intoxicatingly beautiful version of EO .
That love affair then inevitably led me , a few years later , to tackling the Russian original — and to my utter astonishment , I wound up memorizing huge chunks of it ( as do the Russians themselves ) , and then translating the entire novel - in- verse into English verse myself .
That year - long adventure was one of the most wonderful episodes of my entire life , and I tell the whole story in my Translator ’s Preface to that book .
Translating EO into my own style of English verse , and seeing it in other people ’s styles in English , French , German , Italian , etc. , gave me lots of metaphors for thinking about the human soul and how it can survive in other media — after all , here was the “ soul of Russian literature ” ( for that ’s truly how Russians conceive of Eugene Onegin , although non-Russians do n't generally know that ) being transplanted into a radically different medium and yet surviving beautifully in , say , James Falen ’s or Babette Deutsch ’s anglicizations ( and possibly in mine as well , but I can't be objective on that score ) .
I often wondered about the hypothetical sci- fi scenario in which all traces of the Russian original were destroyed , so that all that was left of Eugene Onegin was , say , James Falen ’s English version of it — would Eugene Onegin have survived ?
And my answer always was a categorical and unmitigated “ Yes ! ”
And that ’s how I think about the survival of human souls in other human brains — it ’s just that the “ translations ” of souls are n't nearly as high - quality as Falen ’s is of Pushkin ’s original .
That ’s too bad , but it ’s life .
You take what you can get .
Pushkin puts it this way , in stanza 38 of Chapter II of Eugene Onegin , in my translation ( he ’s speaking of the young would - be poet named Lensky , who is in a cemetery standing near the graves of his parents and brooding poetically about life ’s all - too - fleeting nature ) :
And there he , on the the stark , dark marker
Atop his parents ' graves , shed tears ,
And praised their ashes — darker , starker .
Alas , life reaps too fast its years ;
All flesh is grass .
Each generation ,
At heaven ’s hidden motivation ,
Arises , blooms , and falls from grace ;
Another quickly takes its place .
And thus our race , rash and impetuous ,
Ascends and has its day , then raves
And hastens toward ancestral graves .
All too soon , death ’s sting will get to us ;
Aye , how our children ’s children rush
And push us from this world ’s sweet crush .
Notice , by the way , the captial “ A ” at the beginning of each line — just a whim of mine that I indulged myself in ( and which , I think , improved the stanza ’s quality , since this extra self - imposed constraint forced me to pay incredibly close attention to each and every word choice in each and every line to make everything flow effortlessly despite the constraint ) .
And here , just for the sake of comparison , is James Falen ’s marvelously mellifluous and lyrical version of that same stanza :
And then with verse of quickened sadness
He honored too , in tears and pain ,
His parents ' dust ... their memory ’s gladness ...
Alas !
Upon life ’s furrowed plain —
A harvest brief , each generation ,
By fate ’s mysterious dispensation ,
Arises , ripens , and must fall ;
Then others too must heed the call .
For thus our giddy race gains power :
It waxes , stirs , turns seething wave ,
Then crowds its forebears toward the grave .
And we as well shall face that hour
When one fine day our grandsons true
Straight out of life will crowd us too !
I hope that by comparing these two English versions of the Russian original , you can get a sense for how “ the same pattern ” exists in them all — two of them in the medium or substrate of English , and one of them ( unseen here ) in the substrate of Russian .
To me , this is a wonderful metaphor for soul transplantation .

Analyst Nick Parker has shot a warning at the Xbox 360 , stating that declining European sales could lead to a delisting in some territories .
He was speaking at the 2008 Nordic Games Conference when he spoke of the potential trouble .
" The trouble with Xbox 360 is it has n't managed to shake off this urban , irreverent adult male feel ; so it has n't gained traction in the more casual gaming markets of mainland Europe such as France , Spain and Italy , where it 's stalled , " Parker stated .
" And there are already rumours of Xbox 360 being delisted from certain retailers . "
Parker later explained to Spong that " There were rumours a couple of months ago from people who know that region - Spain and Portugal - that some retailers were looking at de-listing .
If you had to create space for those things that were going to make profit , Xbox 360 could be a candidate .
It 's what you 'd expect in any markets where products are slow moving .
Independent sales data is indicating that sales in certain regions are proving to be a challenge . "
Is the Xbox 360's marketing inherently a problem ?
Is it really so wrong to find a stable demographic and market to it ?
With Nintendo capturing the hearts of mainstream audiences and likely keeping them for a while , surely it 's actually a good idea to stick with the market you know and put out the games they want to play .
Just because Nintendo had massive success with the Wii , it does n't mean other companies will have the same success if they copy it , or need to do so in order to survive .
it 's not like the young males are a dying breed .
There will always be a market for so - called " hardcore " games .
When Grand Theft Auto games are unable to sell , that 's when I 'll worry .
Urologists were n't eager to treat a young man , but he 's notconvinced it 's all in his head .
( MASTERFILE ) I first realized something was wrong when I was 19 and my girlfriend at the time told me that it was n't normal to lose your erection in the middle of sex .
So I started thinking more about it .
If I can get decently hard , it 's gone in about 10 or 15 minutes .
I 'm 25 now , and I should n't have this problem .
If I were 55 , it would be a different story .
But I did n't get help right away .
It took a while to admit that I had any problems at all .
I looked up information online and did n't find a lot of answers .
By the time I finally worked up the nerve to talk to my doctor , I was married to a very understanding woman .
And my problem frustrated us both .
My doctor was n't much help .
I tried Viagra and Levitra , and both of them have helped me to get a fuller erection , but , from what I understand , it 's not as full as it should be .
And both have the strangest side effects , at least for me .
In addition to giving me sinus congestion and headaches , the pills make me feel depressed very quickly .
It really kills the mood , and I beat myself up over not being able to satisfy my wife .
More about ED
I know a lot of doctors say it 's often a psychological issue — especially when ED happens in younger guys — but I do n't know .
I want to say it is , because that means it 's something I can eventually fix with therapy .
But the fact is that I 've had this all my life , and that makes me think there 's a physical cause .
Next Page : After my experiences with the pills [ pagebreak ] After my experiences with the pills , my doctor recommended that I see a urologist .
Unfortunately , the first few urologists I called refused to see me because I 'm not a 55 - year - old with a heart condition .
It was just the doctors ' policy .
It was so hard to be turned away .
I wondered if would be able to find any help at all .
When I finally found a urologist who would see me , sitting in the waiting room was a little uncomfortable .
I was the only guy under 40 .
The doctor gave me a quick five - minute examination and said I might have leaky veins .
Basically , the blood flows into my penis at a normal rate but leaves much quicker than it enters .
He described a test where they give you an injection to achieve an erection and inject a dye so they can see the blood flow .
Ironically , you have to take another medication to get rid of the erection .
But the doctor did n't recommend the test and would n't give me a clear reason .
The whole experience left me wanting more answers , and I was turned off by how little time he spent talking to and examining me .
I 'm planning to get a second opinion .
Basically , his idea of a treatment plan was just to deal with it .
And at my age , I know that I do n't have to accept that .

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is not quite feelin ' eBay 's plans to go PayPal - only in Australia , and has issued a draft notice rejecting the proposal .
The ACCC said that eBay 's proposed conduct might allow the company to abuse its power and ultimately eliminate competition in the market where PayPal operates .
eBay now needs to submit a response to the ACCC if it wants to move ahead with its plans .
Last month , eBay announced that it would require all payments made through the popular auction site in Australia to be done through PayPal beginning June 17 .
Both users and financial institutions were up in arms over the decision , saying that it would reduce competition and force users to either agree to the new terms or leave the market altogether .
eBay responded by saying that going PayPal - only will make transactions safer , and that users are free to go elsewhere ( you know , the thousands of other , popular online auction sites ) if they do n't want to use PayPal .
A long list of individuals and organizations then submitted their concerns to the ACCC , including ( allegedly ) Google , which runs PayPal competitor Google Checkout .
Many of the submissions argued that eBay 's entire goal was to substantially lessen competition .
" eBay 's proposed conduct will result in significant public detriments including a reduction in consumer choice and a reduction in the overall quality of online payment processing services in Australia , " read the 38 - page complaint that was linked to Google .
It turns out that the ACCC agrees with those concerns .
" PayPal currently competes with a range of other providers to supply online payment services to users of online marketplaces .
If the notified conduct is allowed to go ahead , there will be no competition for the supply of such services to buyers and sellers using eBay , " ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel said today in a statement .
" Given eBay 's position as Australia 's leading online marketplace , the notified conduct will substantially reduce competition to supply online payment services to users of online marketplaces more generally . "
The organization acknowledged that there may be some benefits to going PayPal - only , such as increased buyer protection insurance .
Still , the benefits apparently do n't outweigh the negative effects .
" [ T ] he ACCC believes that consumers are in the best position to decide which payment method is most suitable for them , " Samuel said .
He is now asking eBay to delay implementation of the PayPal - only measures until a final decision is made by the ACCC .
Ha’aretz ’s Ari Shavit poses the following hypothetical :
In November , after Senator Barack Obama becomes president - elect of the United States , outgoing president George W. Bush inflicts a severe blow on Iran .
That could take the form of a naval siege , the flexing of American military muscle , or even an all - out air strike targeting Iran ’s nuclear program .
Under ordinary circumstances , people would reject out of hand such a wild scenario .
The American public does not support the idea of opening a second front in the Middle East , and America ’s political , military and intelligence establishments are fearful .
A military move , even a semi-military one , carried out by an outgoing president would be unprecedented and illegitimate ; it would be perceived as the final insane trumpet call of a thoroughly off - the - wall administration with a committed religious outlook .

He thinks that this scenario may have “ little likelihood ” of happening , but , he adds , “ little likelihood is not zero likelihood . ”
The upshot of confronting Iran ?
Shavit writes :
In the long run , such a wild scenario would be good for Israel just as it would be good for America .
A nuclear Iran would endanger Israel ’s survival , Middle Eastern stability and the West ’s well - being .
On the other hand , an Iran deprived of its nuclear weapons would ensure both Israel ’s future and a stable Middle East and would allow the West to continue maintaining its values and lifestyle for a considerable period of time .
However , in the short run , this wild scenario is fraught with danger .
There could be a serious intelligence blunder ; there could be a serious military blunder .
In any event , the Iran of the ayatollahs is a power with a religiously committed leadership ; it is very clever and powerful .
If pushed into a corner , it might prefer to go out with a bang .
Nobody today can say for sure what would be the nature and intensity of such a bang .

Hat tip : JTA ’s Uriel Heilman , who thinks this scenario ai n’t gonna happen .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Hillary Clinton is rated as " honest and trustworthy " by 44 % of Americans , far fewer than say this about John McCain ( 67 % ) and Barack Obama ( 63 % ) .
The latest USA Today / Gallup poll , conducted March 14 - 16 , asked Americans to rate the presidential candidates on honesty and nine other character dimensions .
The 23 - point gap separating Clinton and McCain on honesty is the largest between any two candidates for any dimension tested in the poll .
The accompanying table shows how Americans rate the candidates on each dimension .
In addition to his strong showing on honesty , McCain also fares well on leadership .
Sixty - nine percent of Americans describe the Arizona senator as " a strong and decisive leader , " giving him an advantage over both Clinton ( 61 % ) and Obama ( 56 % ) in this regard .
Obama 's strengths lie in his perceived empathy -- two in three Americans say he " understands the problems Americans face in their daily lives " and " cares about the needs of people like you . "
Clinton and McCain are in the 50 % range on both of these dimensions .
Obama ( 51 % ) also edges McCain ( 46 % ) and Clinton ( 45 % ) on " shares your values . "
Clinton is the leader on what proves to be a weakness for both McCain and Obama -- having a clear plan for solving the country 's problems .
Forty - nine percent say Clinton does , compared with 41 % for Obama and 42 % for McCain .
Clinton has tried to emphasize this theme in her campaign in order to draw a distinction between her and Obama , and it rates as Obama 's ( and McCain 's ) lowest score .
Clinton has perhaps been less successful in convincing voters that she can better navigate her way through the Washington policy process than the other candidates .
McCain ( 60 % ) leads both Clinton ( 51 % ) and Obama ( 48 % ) in terms of being able to manage the government effectively .
Also , Obama ( 62 % ) and McCain ( 61 % ) finish well ahead of Clinton in terms of being able to " work well with both parties in Washington to get things done . "
All three candidates are rated well with respect to having a vision for the country 's future -- 68 % say this about Clinton , 67 % about Obama , and 65 % about McCain .
One final dimension underscores another potential vulnerability for Clinton -- 47 % of Americans say she is someone they would be proud to have as president ( 51 % say they would not be proud to have Clinton ) .
Obama ( 57 % ) and McCain ( 55 % ) both score above the majority level on this measure , which highlights that both tend to fare better on basic likability measures than Clinton .
Implications
It is clear that voters are able to distinguish among the three major presidential candidates and rate some areas as strengths and some areas as weaknesses for each .
Clinton would appear to have more weaknesses in the public 's eyes than McCain or Obama , though that might reflect the fact that she is a better - known figure ( and has lower favorable ratings ) .
Currently , she holds a significant lead over Obama on only 2 of the 10 character dimensions evaluated here ( strong and decisive leader , and having a clear plan for solving the country 's problems ) and McCain on one ( clear plan ) .
Despite this , she remains competitive with McCain in general - election matchups and she has held off Obama 's attempts to wrap up the Democratic nomination .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,025 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 14 - 16 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

John Demjanjuk ’s last appeal to avoid deportation was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on May 19 .
The 88 - year - old accused Nazi concentration camp guard was stripped of his citizenship and ordered sent to Ukraine , his birthplace ; Poland , the locus of the crimes ; or Germany , the heir to the Nazi regime under which he served .
Yet , as it now stands , he is still in the United States .
Why ?
He ca n’t be exiled unless another country agrees to accept him .
For the time being , he remains free .
In this , Demjanjuk is not alone .
There are five other former Nazi criminals against whom the U.S. Justice Department successfully completed deportation proceedings but whom no country has been willing to accept .
Romanian - born Johann Leprich , a guard at Mauthausen camp in Austria , is one ; his deportation was finalized in 2006 .
Another is Jakiw Palij , born in a region of Poland that is now in Ukraine .
He was a guard at Poland ’s Trawniki labor camp ( where in a single day in 1943 , 6,000 prisoners were murdered ) , and his deportation was finalized in January 2006 .
Mykola Wasylyk , another Trawniki guard also found to be at the Budzyn camp , had his final appeal denied in 2004 .
Theodor Szehinskyj , also born in a part of Ukraine that used to be Poland , was in the SS unit called the Death ’s Head Brigade and was a guard at the Gross - Rosen , Sachsenhausen and the Warsaw concentration camps .
His deportation litigation was completed in March 2006 .

Finally , there is Anton Tittjung .
Tittjung was born in what was then Yugoslavia and is now Croatia .
He was a Waffen SS member and a guard at Mauthausen .
Should any of these criminals worry that deportation is imminent , they might take comfort from the fact that the Supreme Court declined to hear Tittjung ’s final appeal way back in 2000 .
He still remains free in the United States .
In addition , in recent years , four of their denaturalized Nazi peers died before they were ever deported .
In all of these cases , the countries of their birth , such as Ukraine , Romania , Poland or Croatia , and the countries where their crimes were committed , such as Austria or Poland as well as Germany , were contacted by the Justice Department , and none expressed interest in receiving these now “ stateless ” persons .
There is no law , domestic or international , that requires foreign countries to accept or extradite these former Nazis -- or to give a reason why they do n’t .
However , their reasons are easy to divine and include not wanting to burden the state with these aged citizens , no desire for an expensive investigation and trial , and fear that nationalist or neo -Nazi elements might be aroused by reopening Nazi-era wounds .

But that does not lift their moral responsibility to accept and / or prosecute the criminals of the Nazi era .
In what society do murderers go free ?
What nation can forget the crimes of the Nazi era ?
Given that the victims of the Holocaust cannot cry out for justice , who will ?
Poland , Ukraine and Romania might make the argument that they were under Nazi rule at that time .
Germany has no such excuse .
And although Germany has prosecuted many native - born Germans for their World War II - era crimes , they have been less eager to do so as time goes by .
Germany has had even less interest in prosecuting those non-Germans , like Demjanjuk , who served the Nazis in the countries they conquered -- as though Germany could draw a border around the Holocaust crimes it is responsible for .
Regardless of any moral impetus countries might have to extradite Nazi criminals , until now there has been no legal one .
That may change .
On May 12 , Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - Ore. ) introduced the World War II War Crimes Accountability Act of 2008 , which would require the U.S. to evaluate foreign countries ’ cooperation in extraditing or prosecuting Nazi criminals the U.S. wants deported .
Assistance or lack thereof would affect a nation ’s visa - waiver status for business travelers and tourists .
More than 50 years after the end of World War II , it is fair to ask :
Why do we care ?
What ’s the point of expending our time , effort and money -- and that of other countries -- on these old men ?
Why not move on ?
What of forgiveness ?
Advertisement
Forgiveness or mitigation as a legal , or even a moral , concept should only be available to those who are willing to fully confess their participation in the crimes of the Nazi era and express remorse .
But to date , there have been no complete confessions by the guilty and no remorse .
Demjanjuk , for example , continues to deny any Nazi involvement whatsoever , even in the face of incontrovertible documentary evidence unearthed after the collapse of the Soviet Union that confirmed his presence at numerous concentration camps .
Still , time is passing .
In the case of these criminals , there is some irony in the fact that they have lived long enough to be exposed for who they were and what they did .
If no country accepts them before they die , at least they wo n’t pass from this Earth as innocents .
It may not be final justice , but it is some comfort .
Can money buy you happiness ?
Yes — so long as you spend the money on someone else .
According to new research , giving other people even as little as $ 5 can lead to increased well - being for the giver .
That 's the insight into the secret of happiness by HBS professor Michael Norton and two colleagues from the University of British Columbia , Elizabeth Dunn and Lara Aknin .
Their article , " Spending Money on Others Promotes Happiness , " appeared in the March 21 , 2008 issue of Science .
" Intentional activities — practices in which people actively and effortfully choose to engage — may represent a promising route to lasting happiness .
Supporting this premise , our work demonstrates that how people choose to spend their money is at least as important as how much money they make , " the researchers explain .
" Our findings suggest that very minor alterations in spending allocations — as little as $ 5 in our final study — may be sufficient to produce non-trivial gains in happiness on a given day . "
Norton and colleagues found these results to hold in three different studies : a nationally representative survey , a field study of windfall spending , and an exploration in which participants were randomly assigned to spend money on others rather than themselves .
We asked Norton to elaborate in an email interview , an invitation to which he cheerfully agreed .
Sarah Jane Gilbert :
What prompted you to conduct this research into the connection between money and happiness ?
Michael Norton :
One of the most puzzling paradoxes in social science is that though people spend so much of their time trying to make more money , having more money does n't seem to make them that much happier .
My colleagues Liz Dunn and Lara Aknin — both at the University of British Columbia — and I wondered if the issue was not that money could n't buy happiness but that people simply were n't spending it in the right way to make themselves happier .
Liz had the great idea to explore whether , if we encouraged people to spend money in different ways , we could uncover the domains in which money might lead to happiness .
We conducted a number of studies — from national surveys to a field study in which we examined how the manner in which employees at a Boston - based company spent a profit - sharing bonus impacted their long - term happiness — in which we showed that money can buy happiness , when people spend that money prosocially on others ( giving gifts to friends , donating to charities ) rather than on themselves ( buying flat - screen televisions ) .
Q : What are the psychological factors involved when it comes to individuals and feelings they encounter when giving away their money ?
Does it matter how wealthy you are ?
A : We found that it was the relative percentage of their money that people spend on others — rather than the absolute amount — that predicted their happiness .
In the bonus study described above , for example , the size of the bonus that people received had no impact on their long - term happiness .
It was the percentage of that bonus they spent on others that increased their well - being .
In another study , we showed that spending as little as $ 5 over the course of a day on another person led to demonstrable increases in happiness .
In other words , people need n't be wealthy and donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity to experience the benefits of prosocial spending ; small changes — a few dollars reallocated from oneself to another — can make a difference .
Q : So many of us equate having money with happiness .
How does this relate to your findings that showed giving it to others is what promotes happiness ?
A : Although a large body of research does show that people become happier as they move from being very poor to lower middle class , after this point the impact of income on happiness is much weaker .
Think of someone who makes $ 100,000 one year and $ 110,000 the next — do we really expect this additional income to suddenly make this person fulfilled , without a care in the world ?
( You can also think about whether such changes in your own income really make you happier with your life on a day - to - day basis : Being informed about a raise certainly makes us happy , but the $ 10,000 does n't make our siblings or in - laws any less difficult to deal with over the course of the following year . …)
Although people believe that having money leads to happiness , our research suggests that this is only the case if at least some of that money is given to others .
Q : If we were aware that giving equates to happiness , would we be more likely to spend money on others instead of on ourselves ?
A : We were actually most worried about the opposite problem , whether knowing about the effect of prosocial spending might erase it , if people engaged in prosocial spending in a calculated manner in order to " get happy . "
We conducted a survey in conjunction with the New York Times " TierneyLab " in which readers who had just learned about our findings were invited to complete a brief survey in which they reported their happiness , as well as how much money they had spent on others and on themselves so far that day .
Consistent with our previous research , we found that spending more on others was associated with greater happiness among this sample of approximately 1,000 New York Times readers , even though the respondents had been exposed to our previous findings .
Q : What are you working on next ?
A : We are now actively looking to work with more companies that are willing to be creative with how they encourage their employees to spend their bonuses , and companies that are willing to be creative in how they engage in charitable giving .
For instance , many companies donate a lump sum to charities each year .
Our research suggests that companies might think about splitting that money up among their employees and empowering them to choose the recipient of those donations .
We refer to such initiatives as creating a " prosocial workplace , " which we believe has benefits both for companies , in the form of happier employees , and for society , through increases in charitable giving .
No taking photos in the s33kr1t Disneyland parking lots !
I mean , sure , they 're full of CCTVs taking pictures of you , but just because you 're paying $ 80 for the day , plus $ 10 to park , why should you feel free to steal the Mouse 's precious , precious parking - lot photons ?
After all , those photos could be used by Al Quaeda to coordinate a strike on the Mouse House !
At the time I marveled that these were now ten years old–and I remember parking in the lot when it was brand new .
Just as I took this photo , however , a Security Cast Member in a patrol unit approached me ( well , he stopped a ways away and shouted through a rolled - down window ) and told me photography was not permitted there .
Since that statement did n't make any sense , my first reaction was to question why that was .
As I evaluated the possible responses , I thought " security " or " because I said so " would be what I 'd get , so I complied and continued walking .
I brought this up to appropriate people , who agreed there is no blanket prohibition of photography there .
I wonder what secrets are hidden in this Pinocchio sign that are waiting to be discovered ?
NICE guys knew it , now two studies have confirmed it : bad boys get the most girls .
The finding may help explain why a nasty suite of antisocial personality traits known as the “ dark triad ” persists in the human population , despite their potentially grave cultural costs .
The traits are the self - obsession of narcissism ; the impulsive , thrill - seeking and callous behaviour of psychopaths ; and the deceitful and exploitative nature of Machiavellianism .
At their extreme , these traits would be highly detrimental for life in traditional human societies .
People with these personalities risk being shunned by others and shut out of relationships , leaving them without …

Visual impairment may be associated with an increased risk of suicide through its indirect negative effect on health , according to a new article .
Eye conditions that lead to visual impairment often have psychosocial and health consequences including impaired activities of daily living , social isolation , mental impairment , increased dependency on others , increased motor vehicle crashes , falls and fractures , depression and poor self - rated health , according to background information in the article .
" Increased mortality risks also have been noted in adults with visual impairment and disabling eye disease . "
Byron L. Lam , M.D. , of Bascom Palmer Eye Institute , University of Miami School of Medicine , and colleagues reviewed data from national health surveys of 137,479 participants conducted between 1986 and 1996 .
Participants reported demographic information along with details about visual impairment and other health conditions .
Researchers then verified deaths of participants up until 2002 through the National Death Index .
During an average 11 years of follow - up , 200 suicide deaths were identified .
" After controlling for survey design , age , sex , race , marital status , number of non-ocular health conditions and self - rated health , the direct effect of visual impairment on death from suicide was elevated ( increased by 50 percent ) but not significant , " the authors write .
The indirect effect of visual impairment on suicide through poor self - rated health or number of non-ocular health conditions was considerable ( 5 percent and 12 percent , respectively ) .
" The combined indirect effects of reported visual impairment operating jointly through poorer self - rated health and a higher number of reported non-ocular conditions increased the risk of suicide significantly by 18 percent . "
" In summary , we observed that reported visual impairment increased suicide risk , particularly indirectly via reported health status and health conditions , " the authors conclude .
" Our results suggest improved treatments of visual impairment and factors causing poor health could potentially reduce suicide risk . "
This study was supported by a grant from the National Eye Institute and a grant from the National Institute on Occupational Safety and Health .

We 'd totally want one of these around the house until we realized that most of our day is spent sitting on something or other anyway , so this robot would just spin around getting jealous before pitifully running out of power .
A person my age has watched many things decline in America , and few get better .
As one of my neighbors says , everything good is gone or going .
In that category we must now include good reporting .
When I started work in Washington in 1973 , it was axiomatic that a newspaper reporter talked to many sources for any story .
The story , in turn , reflected a number of viewpoints and perspectives .
No reporter worth his bourbon would have dreamed of just printing some press release put out by the government .
But that is now what they all seem to do , especially in covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Forgetting that the phrase “ to lie like a bulletin ” is military in origin  the reference is to bulletins issued by Napoleon ’s grande armeé  they print verbatim the happy talk the U.S. military is obliged by the Bush administration to spew .
To the degree the war in Iraq is still covered , the American public is assured over and over that “ violence is down . ”
For the moment , that is true , but the implication that we are on a roll is not true .
Fourth Generation wars do not move in linear fashion .
Violence is down because the constantly shifting network of deals and alliances among Iraq ’s warlords has created a stable interlude .
Those alliances will continue to shift , and as they do so violence will rise again .
How many reporters are asking the talking - dog majors who brief the press the central strategic question , namely whether there is any evidence a state is reemerging in Iraq ?
As best I can tell , none .
The same number appears to be trying to answer that question from other , more reliable sources .
The reporting on Afghanistan is if anything worse .
On Sunday , June 22 , the Cleveland Plain Dealer , a paper I like , printed an AP article under the headline , “ Marines Drive Taliban From Volatile Province , ” namely Helmand .
The article itself more modestly claims victory in one Helmand town , Garmser .
If the 24th MEU has driven the Taliban out of Helmand province , I ’ll eat my yurt .
One town , maybe , but what does taking a town mean in a guerilla war ?
When the Marines leave , which they will , the Taliban will return .
The fact of the matter is , the whole NATO / American effort in Afghanistan is circling the drain .
The American papers should be full of in - depth , multi- sourced stories about the war there .
A friend just back from Britain reports that the British press is full of just such stories .
In one recent 10 - day period , the Brits lost nine soldiers killed , including their first woman .
Was that reported anywhere in the U.S. press ?
What lies behind the decline in the quality of American reporting ?
Cutbacks in the size of newsrooms are part of the answer .
As the electronic image replaces the printed word , newspapers are dying .
To those who know that perceiving reality requires more than shadows on the cave wall , that is bad news .
Lazy reporters are another part of the answer .
It is easy to print the bulletins .
Reporters have always been lazy , but now their editors let them get away with it .
Not too many decades ago , any reporter who single - sourced a story would have been sent back on the street to get more sources , with a richness of invective editors seldom lacked .
But the biggest reason , I suspect , is intellectual cowardice .
After the defeat in Vietnam , many supporters of the war blamed the press for our failure .
By printing the bad news , the press supposedly undermined popular support for the war and thereby caused our defeat .
It ’s poppycock , of course .
The Vietnam War was lost early in the game when MACV , at the demand of Gen. William Depuy , ordered an end to efforts to control the populated coastal lowlands in favor of fighting formal battles against enemy main force units in the highlands .
Those units were sent there as bait , which MACV took .
But the American press was scarred by the accusations .
Now , it is afraid to be accused of “ not supporting the troops ” if it does anything but print the bulletins .
So the American public gets the mushroom treatment , and two failed wars continue ad infinitum .
When the roof falls in both in Iraq and in Afghanistan , the shock will be considerable .
America ’s yellow press will deserve no small share of the blame .
You do n't have to be innumerate to be a mathematician , but it could help .
Elders of the tribe have produced a report for the thinktank Reform which calculates that Britain has " lost half a million " mathematicians since 1990 at a cost to the economy of a " staggering £ 9bn " .
Needless to say , the government should act .
How £ 9 bn ?
The boffins have added up the average " market premium " of the 430,000 fewer A - level maths students who have ceased studying the subject over the period and declared that total " lost " to the national product .
This is irrespective of what the bright sparks might otherwise have earned , or whether a flooding of the market with mathematicians might have depressed the so - called premium .
Even if the maths is robust , the economics is dreadful .
It looks as if the authors thought of a figure big enough to win some headlines and get the excitable Tory schools spokesman , Michael Gove , to demand that the government do something .
Both succeeded .
My campaign for curricular updating is getting nowhere .
Were the Reform report not devoted to the Holy Mother Church of maths and science , some mathematician would have dismissed it as nonsense .
But nonsense in the service of professional self - aggrandisement is what ethicists call " good cause corruption " .
Maths and science self - justify as economically worthwhile in a way that law or economics or management studies do not dare .
They must fight their corner in the marketplace .
Championing the report in these pages on Tuesday , the Oxford maths professor , Marcus du Sautoy , claimed that examiners were now too frantic to make maths seem relevant to young people 's working lives .
The subject had been " emasculated by a move away from rigour and logic " in pursuit of the fool 's gold of " relevance " .
This had " ended up just making it boring " .
I studied advanced maths to 16 .
I loved wandering in its virtual world of trigonometry and logarithms , primes and surds .
I breakfasted on quadratic equations , lunched on differential calculus and strolled , arm in arm , with Ronald Searle 's square on the hypotenuse .
It was a waste of time .
I dedicated my next two years to Latin and Greek , which proved to be more useful ( just ) .
Most teenagers clearly feel the same .
They must grapple with difficult techniques and concepts which hardly any of them will ever use , assuming they can understand or remember them .
In the age of computers , maths beyond simple and applied arithmetic is needed only by specialists .
Ramming it down pupils ' throats in case they may one day need it is like making us all know how to recalibrate a carburettor on the offchance that we might become racing drivers .
Maths is a " skill to a purpose " , and we would should ponder the purpose before overselling the skill .
An academic subject in decline always grasps at one last straw , that it " trains the mind " .
In his essay on Arnold of Rugby , Lytton Strachey pointed out that this argument kept Victorian education immured in the middle ages , teaching classical languages while Germany and America were forging ahead with technology .
Why irrelevance to life should hold the key to mental callisthenics is never explained , let alone proved .
It is on a par with such maxims as " The shortest route to a boy 's brain is through the seat of his pants " .
The old guard say that a dose of algebra and Latin verbs " never did me any harm " , but the modern student is rightly more demanding .
When Kenneth Baker invented the national curriculum in 1987 , it never occurred to him to question its content .
Science and maths lobbied hard and captured the core , alongside only English .
Not just history and geography , but economics , health , psychology , citizenship , politics and law - with far better claims to vocational utility - were elbowed aside .
Millions of pounds were and still are devoted to teaching maths to reluctant pupils who know that they will never see or hear of it again .
Numbers studying maths and science since 1987 have plummeted .
Baker 's attempt at centralist compulsion was a failure .
The claim that " Britain needs maths " is shaky .
In the 60s and 70s , half of Europe 's output of mathematicians and scientists was from the Soviet Union .
There was a huge " maths premium " , but no impact on national prosperity .
The Soviets forgot to teach economics , let alone politics , law or the liberal arts .
I could as well reply to Reform that more maths at the expense of humanities would spell economic disaster .
In the two decades during which British pupils have fled from maths towards social science and the humanities , the economy has boomed .
It has done so on the strength of finance , marketing and design , on service activities that have little mathematical content .
If the market is any guide , Britain " needs " more financiers , consultants , marketers , publicists and lawyers .
Besides , maths as a discipline is now global rather than chauvinistic .
Maths research is online ; the HeyMath !
website is a universal teacher .
The two best books on this topic are Innumeracy , by the American John Allen Paulos , and A Mathematician 's Apology , by former Cambridge professor GH Hardy .
The first describes all the maths a person needs to know , mostly simple concepts applied to daily life , to proportion , risk and probability .
Paulos makes the point that a nation may be expert at algebra yet have no sense of statistical probability , to the profit of its insurance industry and the detriment of its public life .
To Hardy , maths was a sublimely cerebral activity .
" The mathematics that can be used for ordinary purposes by ordinary men is negligible , " he wrote .
The glory of maths was aesthetic , " justified as art if it can be justified at all " .
The practitioner is pursuing " a harmless and innocent occupation " , an intellectual hobby .
What stimulates today 's students is the realm of the creative imagination and the working of the marketplace .
This spectrum , from English and drama to business and finance , seems benign both to individuals and to the economy .
Students are not stupid .
They know where money is to be made , which is why they flock to medicine among the sciences .
Maths replies that these young people are just taking easy options .
But there is no virtue in a difficult discipline whose victims regard it as of no use .
Students are declining to specialise in maths not because it is difficult but because they cannot see the point .
Curricular archaism is the political correctness of the conservative classes .
To pass muster , a subject must help the economy or , if not , be deliberately irrelevant , a mind trainer .
It must have a long academic tradition .
It must be obscure .
Above all , it must not be novel or popular with students .
Yet there is no reason why a new subject cannot be made challenging .
That is the job of education .
Besides , young people are voting with their feet .
They want the humanities and social sciences that are clamouring for a place on the curriculum , and they will get them .
The old guard must make way .

What do parasites and mountains have in common ?
They both keep populations apart and drive evolution , say researchers .
In the absence of geographical barriers such as mountains and oceans , parasite “ wedges ” keep populations of the same species apart , say Corey Fincher and Randy Thornhill of the University of New Mexico in the US .
They claim this can provide the opportunity for populations and even new languages to evolve separately .
Fincher and Thornhill say their hypothesis explains the longstanding ecological debate about why it is that biological diversity decreases as you move away from the equator and towards the poles .
“ Individuals must balance the benefits with the costs of contacting other members of the same species , ” says Fincher .
For humans interacting with each other , for example , benefits include the opportunity to mate and trade , but these come at a cost : the risk of contracting a parasite or disease .
Advertisement
“ These costly interactions especially come from interacting with people who do not belong to your society or group , whose immune systems are adapted for a separate set of parasites than your own , ” adds Fincher .
Socialising risk
The notion was first suggested in the 1970s by researchers who noticed that baboon populations living in the African savannah typically carried similar populations of bacterial fauna and would frequently interact .
In the rainforests , however , where each population tended to carry its own set of bacteria , primates typically interacted far less .
In the parasite - rich forest populations , interacting with others came with a high chance of contracting a lethal illness , making parasites an evolutionary driving force .
According to Fincher and Thornhill , similar situations can be found in human populations .
Taking languages as their measure of diversity , the pair looked at the concentration of different languages within an area and the number of parasites in that same area .
Lacking detail ?
They collected data on parasites and languages around the world and found that the diversity of indigenous human languages is correlated with the diversity of human disease - carrying parasites .
The correlation was true on every continent and independently of historical contexts such as colonialism .
Mark Pagel , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading , UK , says the correlation is interesting but insufficient .
Fincher and Thornhill did not divide the world by linguistic region , but into six large continents .
This means they do not have enough detail to link differences in parasite infections with different languages , Pagel says .
However , he adds that linguistic diversity does increase as you move from north to south in North America and the pattern is the same worldwide , mirroring the increase in diversity biodiversity as you move to the tropics .
‘ Great dark secret ’
But rather than parasites driving linguistic diversity , Pagel believes the explanation lies in an intrinsic human tendency to wage war .
“ I believe humans will separate and split whenever they can , ” Pagel told New Scientist .
“ You ’ve got all these people wandering around the Amazon all doing more or less the same thing – hunting and gathering – so why do they all speak different languages ?
“ There must be some ecological force driving them to live in separate groups .
We are intensely competitive and when the environment will support a small group living separately I believe humans will do that , ” he says .
In ecologically poor environment , humans and other animals need to range further in order to find food and inevitably bump into each other and mix .
But in ecologically rich areas , such as Papua New Guinea , villages that are just a few kilometres apart speak different languages .
To Pagel , this proves that populations that do not need to interact to survive wo n’t .
“ I think this is a great dark secret about humans , ” he adds .

Debate remains about how toxic dioxin is to humans , but the Department of Toxic Substances Control says there is no safe level of exposure .
Kimi Klein , a human health toxicologist with the department , said that although the dioxin on the mill site was not the most toxic dioxin out there , there was “ very good evidence ” that chronic exposure to dioxin caused cancer and “ it is our policy to say if any chemical causes cancer there is no safe level . ”
Fort Bragg must clean the dioxin - contaminated coastline this year or risk losing a $ 4.2 million grant from the California Coastal Conservancy for a coastal trail .
Its options : haul the soil in a thousand truckloads to a landfill about 200 miles away , or bury it on site in a plastic - lined , 1.3 - acre landfill .
Alarmed by the ultimatum , residents called in Paul E. Stamets , author of “ Mycelium Running : How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World . ”
Typically , contaminated soil is hauled off , buried or burned .
Using the mushroom method , Mr. Stamets said , it is put in plots , strewn with straw and left alone with mushroom spawn .
The spawn release a fine , threadlike web called mycelium that secretes enzymes “ like little Pac - Mans that break down molecular bonds , ” Mr. Stamets said .
And presto : toxins fall apart .
In January , Mr. Stamets came down from Fungi Perfecti , his mushroom farm in Olympia , Wash .
He walked the three - mile coastline at the site , winding around rocky coves on wind - swept bluffs where grass has grown over an airstrip but barely conceals the ash piles .
It was “ one of the most beautiful places in the world , hands down , ” he said .
Quick to caution against easy remedies 
“ I am not a panacea for all their problems ”  he said he had hope for cleaning up dioxin and other hazardous substances on the site .
“ The less recalcitrant toxins could be broken down within 10 years . ”
Here at TPM HQ we ’re watching John McCain ’s prebuttal to Sen .
Obama ’s speech tonight .
And , man , I ’m curious to hear what other people think , but I really feel like he would have served himself much better by just going to ground for the evening .
McCain is often very good when he speaks extemporaneously .
Even better in 2000 .
But still good .
He ’s also good in debates .
But giving set piece speeches , let ’s face it , he ’s simply awful .
He finds it impossible to pretend he ’s actually thinking what he ’s saying .
But this whole speech is defensive in character ( explaining why he ’s not running for Bush ’s third term ) , awkward and just feels old .
The slogan seems to be : Am Not McSame !
The crowd of maybe like 200 people is also sort of an unfortunate contrast .
Late Update : Here ’s how bad it is .
All the Fox commentators are giving competing explanation for why McCain ’s speech sucked .
And here it is …

Responding to the letter from the former secretaries , the bill ’s House sponsor , Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California , said Wednesday that he believes an outright ban on menthol is not the best way to address it .
Image Newport is the largest selling menthol cigarette in America .
Credit ... Daniel Acker / Bloomberg News
“ I ’m determined to see tobacco legislation pass Congress that protects all our children , ” Mr. Waxman said .
“ Leading public health experts have told us that giving F.D.A. the authority to ban menthol is the best way to balance both public health considerations with the reality that many adults only smoke menthol cigarettes .
I ’ll continue our ongoing review to make sure we are dealing with this issue in the most effective way possible . "
Menthol is derived from mint and is also available synthetically .
Smoking menthol - flavored cigarettes gives the mouth a cool feeling , similar to sucking on a peppermint , and can help mask the harsh taste of tobacco .
The bill ’s treatment of menthol “ caves to the financial interests of tobacco companies and discriminates against African - Americans  the segment of our population at greatest risk for the killing and crippling smoking - related diseases , ” the letter from the former secretaries said .
“ It sends a message that African American youngsters are valued less than white youngsters . ”
Mr. Califano said that even though the bill gives the F.D.A. the authority to remove additives it would require a lengthy process that “ could go on and on and on , and you ’re talking about years before you get through the administrative process and the courts . ”
Mr. Califano , who served as health secretary under President Jimmy Carter , said the idea to send the letter began when Dr. Louis W. Sullivan , the health secretary during the administration of President George H. W. Bush , called him to complain about the bill ’s treatment of menthol .
“ We both got our blood boiling , ” Mr. Califano said in a telephone interview .
They also decided to contact other past health secretaries .
Five of them were reached and all agreed to sign onto the letter , according to Mr. Califano , who now runs the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University .
Photos taken after the Pentagon crash do not support the Government conspiracy theory that Flight 77 , a Boeing 757 airliner , demolished a major portion of the masonry structure : Seismic waveform data also brings into question what struck the Pentagon .
Seismologists have detected other 9/11 aircraft even pinpointing exact crash times for the Boeing 737 airliners that crashed into the WTC Towers and the aircraft alleged to be Flight 93 that crashed in Pennsylvania .
The seismologists observed :
We analyzed seismic records from five stations in the northeastern United States , ranging from 63 to 350 km from the Pentagon .
Despite detailed analysis of the data , we could not find a clear seismic signal .
Even the closest station ( = 62.8 km ) at Soldier 's Delight , Baltimore County , Maryland ( SDMD ) did not record the impact .
We concluded that the plane impact to the Pentagon generated relatively weak seismic signals .
http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/nodate/seismicobservations.html
The RENSE article , The 911 Pentagon Engine Story , http://www.rense.com/general67/911eng.htm
explained that the JT8D engine identified in the debris in front of the Pentagon wall could have been from early Boeing 737-100 and 737-200 airliners or an assortment of other aircraft .
Since witnesses decribed the incoming Pentagon aircraft having two engines under the wings the number of possible aircraft comes down to a handful .
National Geographic reported that the FBI confiscated a video tape from a Citgo gas station within a half hour of the crash .
Without asking the questions how did the FBI know of the tape and how did they grab it so quickly , many people think the aircraft model could be identified from that video since the aircraft flew directly over the Citgo station http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1211_wirepentagon.html
The RENSE article , Missing Pentagon Unobstructed Citgo Videos , http://www.rense.com/general63/unob.htm develops the Citgo station story with more outstanding photos .
Even though America 's Coverup Agencies , the FBI and the Pentagon , have fought tooth and nail to prevent disclosure of what really happened at the Pentagon on 9/11 photos , witnesses have already filled in the blanks .
Get up to speed by reading The RENSE article , Sneak Preview - 911 Pentagon Tapes : http://www.rense.com/general64/911et.htm
In that article American patriots are taking the DOJ and the FBI though the wringer in a Federal Court .
A retired FBI agent told this writer that FBI lawyers are hacks .
He claimed any good attorneys go to work for the other side !
Bronco Bingham is the plaintiff in the main FOIA action to obtain the Pentagon videotapes .
His crackerjack attorney , Scott Hodes , is running circles around the FBI lawyers .
TIMELINE FOR BRONCO BINGHAM , SCOTT HODES FOIA REQUEST Courtesy of Bronco Bingham www.flight77.info
October 14 , 2004 FOIA REQUEST : all videotapes that showed the Pentagon crash impact in any office of the FBI .
The request mentioned that the Citgo station and the Sheraton National Hotel had videos taken by the FBI on 9/11 .
November 3 , 2004 , FBI ANSWER : no Sheraton National Hotel videotapes November 17 , 2004 APPEAL :
Where is the Citgo video ?
FBI answer was inadequate search .
Responder was inexperienced with indexing procedures .
Request that searcher ask 9/11 investigators directly for location of videos .
December 1 , 2004 FBI letter acknowledged receipt of APPEAL letter .
March 7 , 2005 ( 4 months later ) FBI letter in respnse to APPEAL : A tape was found but release would interfere with enforcement proceedings .
THAT VIDEO is believed to be the video source of the famous Pentagon Parking Lot stills .
Attorney Hodes noted in the FOIA request that stills from the Parking Lot video had already been released by CNN : http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/07/gen.pentagon.pictures/index.html
However , the FBI claims those stills were ' leaked ' by the Pentagon and NOT officially released .
Therefore , the FBI does n't considered them to exist !
In the Sneak Preview - 911 Pentagon Tapes article , a helicopter was prominent in the ' leaked ' stills .
Its function was to remote control the aircraft at the construction entrance located at ground level to make it appear the plane actually penetrated the Pentagon :
The renovated Pentagon section that was targeted had special steel , kevlar reinforced masonry walls and ' blastproof ' windows .
Jack Singleton explains how the aircraft got partially into the Pentagon : " Where the plane came in was really at the CONSTRUCTION ENTRANCE , " says Jack Singleton , president of Singleton Electric Co. Inc. , Gaithersburg MD , the Wedge One electrical subcontractor .
" The plane 's left wing actually came in near the ground and the right wing was tilted up in the air .
That right wing went directly over our trailer , so if that wing had not tilted up , it would have hit the trailer .
My foreman , Mickey Bell , had just walked out of the trailer and was walking toward the construction entrance . "
http://web.archive.org/web/20040404074145/
http://www.designbuildmag.com/oct2001/pentagon1001.asp
From witness accounts the aircraft piled up on the Pentagon masonry wall and after a short while was blown to bits that rained down for blocks .
The Parking Lot stills show THAT explosion and the parts of the aircraft in the air along with the helicopter .
THE FBI PARKING LOT VIDEO WOULD SHOW THE IMPACT , THE DELAY , THE EXPLOSION , THE HELICOPTER , AND THE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT ..
Here are three of the ' leaked ' stills from that video : .
March 8 , 2005 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Inadequate search and release of records .
Failure to timely respond .
Requests injunctive relief that defendants immediately and fully comply with plaintiff 's FOIA request .
April 18 , 2005 DOJ RESPONSE : Claims no records have been withheld .
ADMITS Citgo tape was confiscated but it does n't show Impact .
Claims no Sheraton video .
April 19 , 2005 JUDGE'S ORDER
It is hereby ORDERED that the defendants shall file a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment before June 31 , 2005 .
August 1 , 2005 DOJ SEEKS SUMMARY JUDGMENT on basis of Videos withheld because of ongoing enforcement proceedings .
August 29 , 2005 OPPOSITION TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT : Requests FBI release parking lot video and make a better search .
Claims video CAN'T be withheld under amendment 7 as its release will not affect the sentencing of Zacharias Moussaoui who has already pled guilty to six charges of conspiracy to commit the terorist attacks that included hijacking and crashing Flight 77 into the Pentagon on 9/11 .
September 9 , 2005 DOJ Reply to Opposition to Summary Judgment : Similar to above DOJ reply .
September 9 , 2005 EXHIBIT FOUR from the count case was a DECLARATION of FBI agent Jacqueline Maquire on the discovery of 85 Pentagon tapes from 9/11 .
1 ) Using associated written documentation BUT not viewing them , 56 videos did n't show the Pentagon building , crash site , or crash impact .
2 ) Viewed 29 tapes personally but sixteen videos did n't show the impact and crash site 3 ) The other 13 videos showed the Pentagon crash site .
Twelve of these tapes showed the crash site after the impact .
Agent Maquire found only a CD - ROM with the Parking Lot video copies .
4 ) Found one Citgo station video .
A FBI video unit was asked to determine if it showed the impact but no impact was seen .
5 ) Found no Sheraton National Hotel video .
Found a Doubletree Hotel video but no impact was seen .
September 26 , 2005 Second FOIA request : Seeks copies of 85 tapes as mentioned in the Maquire Declaration .
In a response to another FOIA request attorney Peter Gersten was told the Citgo station video and another video from a Virginia Department of Transportation camera were confiscated but are withheld for ongoing enforcement proceedings .
Peter gets the LAST WORD : I am sure that you ( FBI searcher ) are aware that FOIA exemption ( b ) ( 7 ) ( A ) which applies to law enforcement records requires a showing that the production of such records or information could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings .
The two CCTV videos purportedly show what several witnesses have publicly stated they observed : Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon on 9-11 - 01 .
As I stated in the appeal of my initial request , the debate over what hit the Pentagon has thrived due to the apparent contradiction between the eyewitness and physical evidence .
Whereas a large body of reports of eyewitness accounts strongly supports that a twin - engine jetliner ( Flight 77 ) swooped in at a very low altitude and exploded at or in front of the Pentagon , photographs of the facade and lawn show an absence of aircraft debris or a pattern of damage consistent with such an aircraft .
The resulting evidence vacuum has created the conditions for a protracted controversy about what hit the Pentagon .
The lack of evidence of large aircraft debris in post - crash photographs of the Pentagon 's exterior , combined with the refusal of officials to produce evidence supporting the official story , has led many skeptics to believe that the damage was caused by something other than a jetliner hitting the building .
Further , there is neither video footage nor any photographic evidence in the public domain showing a jetliner approaching or crashing into the Pentagon .
Not only has the government refused to release footage that would clearly show how the Pentagon was attacked , it has also seized footage not belonging to the military .
The FBI reportedly confiscated video recordings from three locations shortly after the attack ( Sheraton National Hotel , NEXCOMM / CITGO gas station , and the Virginia Department of Transportation ) .
The FBI has , in its latest response admitted possessing at least two of these CCTV videos .
These two recordings could provide decisive evidence about the crash and end the controversy .
All the perpetrators who directly participated in the hijacking of the jetliners and the subsequent attacks are dead .
Even assuming that the FBI is conducting an ongoing investigation , the release of the two CCTV videos would in no way jeopardize , compromise , or hinder that investigation since the videos merely show what everyone already is aware of ?
Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon .

Any kindergarten in Israel with more than 10 children requires the approval of the Education Ministry , but three kindergartens offering children the education teaching of the controversial Scientology movement are operating in Tel Aviv these days without the ministry being aware of their principles .
One of these kindergartens , in the Nahalat Yitzhak neighborhood has about 90 children .
Although it received the Education Ministry 's approval , it failed to note its religious leanings .
Previous Scandal Youth group supported by Scientology Tali Heruti-Sover
Who is behind invitation to party for ' Youth for Human Rights ' ?
The invitation is signed by Don Shaul , 13 year old , with title of Israeli director of ' International Youth for Human Rights ' .
But behind heartwarming initiative stands Scientology movement Youth group supported by Scientology
The ministry has never even heard of the other two Scientology kindergartens , one in the Yad Eliyahu neighborhood and the other on Keren Kayemet Street in northern Tel Aviv .
The Scientology cultist movement was materialized in the United States in the 1950s .
Its principles were developed from author L. Ron Hubbard 's set of ideas and practices regarding the relationship between the spirit , mind and body presented in the book " Dianetics " .
In the book , Hubbard developed ideas in regards to ways humans can release themselves from mental elements preventing them from studying , developing and reaching a deeper understanding of the world .
One of the issues characterizing education according to the Scientology ideas is teaching respect , human rights and friendship – expressed in addressing children at eye level .
When a teacher speaks to one of his or her pupils , he or she will bend down in order to prevent significant height differences .
It should be noted that a visit to one of the three kindergartens did not reveal any strange or severe issues in the teachers ' treatment of the children , and yet these kindergartens are operating without a license and without being supervised by the Education Ministry .
Avi Katzover , an Education Ministry spokesman for the Tel Aviv District , said in response that " the kindergarten ( in Nahalat Yitzhak ) was granted an operating license after it was made clear that it has no security or health risks .
The license is temporary until the end of the school year .
" The pedagogical aspect will be examined this year and we will then make a final decision whether to grant it a permanent license for the coming years as well .
" As for the Scientology issue , the Education Ministry is unaware of such principles being taught in the kindergarten .
The supervisor examined the kindergarten 's education contents and did not spot any Scientology content .
The teacher also denied any involvement in the cult . "
The U.S. Attorney Purge scandal may be over , but the Bush administration has n’t changed its habit of ridding itself of those guilty of independent thinking .
The battle over dioxin contamination in this economically stressed region [ of Michigan ] had been raging for years when a top Bush administration official turned up the pressure on Dow Chemical to clean it up .
On Thursday , following months of internal bickering over Mary Gade ’s interactions with Dow , the administration forced her to quit as head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ’s Midwest office , based in Chicago .
We ’ve learned quite a bit in recent days about the White House interfering with EPA regulations on dioxin contamination , but it ’s especially bold , even for the Bush gang , to fire the one career official who was looking out for the public ’s interests .
For the past year , Gade has been locked in a heated dispute with Dow about long - delayed plans to clean up dioxin - saturated soil and sediment that extends 50 miles beyond its Midland , Mich . , plant into Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron . [ … ]
Though regional EPA administrators typically have wide latitude to enforce environmental laws , Gade drew fire from officials in Washington last month after she sent contractors to test soil in a Saginaw neighborhood where Dow had found high dioxin levels .
Michigan Environmental Council President Lana Pollack called Gade a “ woman of unquestioned credentials and integrity who was doing her job enforcing our environmental laws . ”
In this administration , that ’s not a compliment .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Faced with declining prices for timber products , owners of forest lands could find new sources of revenue in environmental efforts , industry experts said on Tuesday .
Because uncut trees are stores of carbon , forest owners may be able to extract value from them by just leaving them alone , particularly as a U.S. market for trading carbon emissions develops , experts told a conference in San Francisco .
Also , timberland owners and investors can sell easements that protect resources or wildlife , or provide sustainable fuel for burning in biomass power plants .
“ Conservation and biomass are new return drivers , ” said Andrew Kelsen , director of alternative investments at investment consulting firm Gray and Co .
The hope of revenue from green initiatives comes at an uncertain time for investors in timberlands .
Forestry investing has accelerated in recent years , driving up prices for timberland and leading some analysts to question whether a recent slide in their prices signals a steeper fall .
“ If we are in a bubble , ( investors ) are buying at a peak , ” said E. Thomas Tuchman , president of U.S. Forest Capital LLC .
The current housing slump has driven down demand for lumber products and pounded stocks like International Paper Co and Weyerhaeuser Co .
Still , lower demand has not dampened the outlook for timber at the biggest U.S. pension fund , the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , which owns timber assets in Australia and Latin America .
Calpers has set a target allocation for timber at 1 percent to 1.5 percent of its total assets , or roughly $ 3 billion , and targets a 6 percent real rate of return on its forest land investments .
Farouki Majeed , a senior investment officer with the pension fund , is unfazed by falling timber prices .
“ We ’re long - term investors , ” Majeed said .
“ We think we can ride this out . ”
Timberland has gained traction in recent years among large institutional investors such as state pension funds and university endowments as they look to diversify their investment portfolios .
As an asset class , timberland outperformed stocks between 1987 and 2007 , with the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries ’ timberland index generating a compounded annual return of 15.3 percent , versus the S&P 500 ’s 10 percent .
The pension fund ’s investment staff sees timberlands as an inflation hedge .
“ We ’re probably in a period where we ’re likely to see inflation emerge as an issue we need to be concerned about , ” Majeed said .

Barack Obama , the Democratic contender for the US presidency , has said his main priority as president would be to end US involvement in Iraq .
Speaking before an international tour , Mr Obama said " our single - minded and open - ended focus on Iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping America safe " .
The senator said another priority would be to take the war to al - Qaeda and the Taleban in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
His Republican rival accused Mr Obama of contradicting himself over Iraq .
John McCain said the US " surge " of American troops in Iraq was working , and that the same strategy should be applied to Afghanistan .
I wo n't bluster and I wo n't make idle threats - but understand this , when I am commander - in - chief , there will be nowhere the terrorists can run and nowhere they can hide

McCain speech : Excerpts
Send us your comments
In an apparent criticism of the Bush administration , Mr McCain said the US effort in Afghanistan was " no way to run a war " .
Addressing supporters in New Mexico , he said : " If I 'm elected president , I will turn around the war in Afghanistan , just as we have turned around the war in Iraq , with a comprehensive strategy for victory . "
He also said he would bring al - Qaeda 's leader , Osama Bin Laden , to justice .
Mr Obama 's foreign policy speech comes ahead of a tour that will include Iraq and Afghanistan , the dates of which have not been disclosed for security reasons .
' Unacceptable '
In his speech at the International Trade Center in Washington , Mr Obama said : " This war diminishes our security , our standing in the world , our military , our economy , and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st Century . "
Al - Qaeda has an expanding base in Pakistan that is probably no farther from their old Afghan sanctuary than a train ride from Washington to Philadelphia

Obama speech : Excerpts
He said the conflict in Iraq must be brought to an end as " the central front in the war on terror is not Iraq , and it never was " .
Mr Obama said that as president he would take the US in a new direction , and a priority would be to finish the fight against the Taleban and al - Qaeda , which has an expanding base in Pakistan .
He said the troop surge policy had actually hurt America 's overall strategic interests , by diverting resources away from Afghanistan , just as the situation there was deteriorating .
Mr Obama said a withdrawal from Iraq would allow a much - needed redeployment of troops .
He said sustained co-operation was needed between Afghanistan , Pakistan and Nato to root out al - Qaeda and the Taleban .
" It is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 3,000 Americans were killed on our soil , the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 are still at large , " he said .
On other issues , Mr Obama made the following pledges :
To use all tools not to allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon
To invest $ 150bn over the next 10 years to end America 's dependence on foreign oil
To develop new defences to protect against the 21st Century threat of biological weapons and cyber- terrorism Timetable for withdrawal BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says the war over the war in Iraq is moving into high gear .
The essential difference between Mr Obama and his Republican rival , John McCain , is that the Illinois senator wants to set a clear timetable for a withdrawal from Iraq - some 16 months - while Mr McCain insists that the situation on the ground , not timetables , must govern the pace of any withdrawal , our correspondent says .
It is not just a political argument , he adds - it has a huge bearing on the signals that the next US president will send to the Middle East and at root it is a test of their capacity to be Commander - in - Chief .
Opinion polls suggest that Americans remain deeply divided on the best strategy in Iraq , with almost equal support for a clear timetable or for no timetable for a withdrawal .
Mr Obama may not necessarily need to win this argument outright , our correspondent says , but in setting out his foreign policy stall he needs to show that he has credible , concrete positions that make sense of a complex world .

Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
Coiled up in a tornado is as much energy as an entire power plant .
So a Canadian engineer has a plan to spin up his own twister and extract energy from its tethered tail .
It all depends on heating the air near the surface so that it is much warmer than the air above .
" You can generate energy whenever you have a temperature gradient , " said Louis Michaud .
" The source of the energy here is the natural movement of warm and cold air currents . "
These so - called convective air currents are only useful if they can be channeled in some way .
That is why Michaud proposes using a tornado as a kind of drinking straw between the warm ground below and the cold sky above .
Wind turbines placed at the bottom could generate electricity from the sucked - up air .
Whirlwind tour
Tornadoes and hurricanes form when sun-heated air near the surface rises and displaces cooler air above .
As outside air rushes in to replace the rising air , the whole mass begins to rotate .
Michaud got the notion of a man-made tornado — what he calls the Atmospheric Vortex Engine ( AVE ) — while working as an engineer on gas turbines .
" When I looked further into it , I did n't run into anything that was impossible , " Michaud told LiveScience .
The AVE structure is a 200 - meter - wide arena with 100 - meter - high walls .
Warm humid air enters at the sides , directed to flow in a circular fashion .
As the air whirls around at speeds up to 200 mph , a vacuum forms in the center , which holds the vortex together as it extends several miles into the sky .
The concept is similar to a solar chimney with the swirling walls of the vortex replacing the brick walls of the tower .
But the AVE can reach much higher into the sky where the air is colder .
With wind turbines at the inlets to the arena , Michaud calculates that as much as 200 megawatts of electricity ( enough for a small city ) could be extracted without draining the vortex of its power .
" Look at natural tornadoes that destroy a house or carry off a car and still have plenty of energy left over , " he said .
Waste heat
Michaud imagines the AVE could get its warm air from the exhaust of a power plant .
" Most power plants reject more than half of the heat that they make , " he said .
The AVE could generate energy from this waste heat because it connects the ground to the upper atmosphere where the temperature gets as low as negative 60 degrees Celsius ( 80 degrees below zero Fahrenheit ) .
This cold reservoir draws the warm air up fast enough to turn turbines .
" All you have to do is send the heat up there , " Michaud said , and the extra energy from the AVE could increase the output of a power plant by 40 percent .
Making the tornado dependent on a waste heat supply would also be a built - in safety feature .
" If it came off the base , there would be nothing to sustain the vortex , " Michaud said .
He said the vortex might produce a little extra precipitation in the surrounding area .
To build a 200 megawatt AVE facility would cost $ 60 million , Michaud estimates .
This implies a cost per megawatt that is lower than all existing power generation technologies .
Michaud has tested many small prototypes and is currently working on a 4 - meter wide AVE near his home in Ontario .
The research comes mostly out his own pocket book , as he has not found an investor yet .
" Utility companies are risk - adverse , " he said .
" They prefer to buy from established vendors . "
What It 's Really Like At A John McCain " Town Hall Meeting " Posted by Pile ( 7683 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Activists ]
From DailyKOS comes , " Yesterday , I drove to New Jersey , quietly stood on line which ushered me into the Community College Auditorium in Pemberton , picked a good spot on the third level of benches , pretended to clap and applaud when John McCain said stupid things which I did n't agree with , all with the hopes of being called on by one of the McCain staffers holding a microphone .
I was oh so close .
I was next on the other side of the auditorium when McCain abruptly ended the supposedly open town hall where he allegedly takes tough questions after 1 questioner , who only got called on because his nine year old kid was next to him , asked McCain about Bin Laden . "
McCain 's so called town halls are actually rallies hosted by the local Republican Party .
The host , Chris Myers , identified himself as a local leader and claimed that New Jersey is going to go red because of the 2000 people in the gym .
( About 1 % of us were Obama supporters , someone held a sign up at the end , no one interrupted McCain 's speech . )
However if McCain can't fill a small gym in his only trip to New Jersey this month , his candidacy is in trouble .
The seating was staged .
There were about 20 people with Veteran 's hats and all were seated directly in line with McCain 's podium in the front and back .
Your cameras from home would make it appear that half the people there were veterans .
In reality it was about 1 % .
Mixed into the Veterans was one angry woman who had a sign claiming she was a Hillary supporter voting McCain .
This one sign was placed directly in the spot where the cameras were most likely to pick it up .
She was planted there .
It also appears that there was one singular woman who pulled the same stunt Thursday night at the so called Fox News McCain town hall meeting in New York .
These people are n't real Clinton supporters , this too is staged .
The event began with the Pledge of Allegiance and an invocation .
In a multicultural country , an invocation is kind of creepy .
The latter is not exactly inclusive but it appeared that all cameras were directed off during the invocation so that this non inclusive invocation could not be shown .
Then , all the local politicians getting stage time , including the Congressman in the area , and the Jersey candidates for the House and Senate .
Dick Zimmer , the former Congressman running against Frank Lautenberg , was received tepidly by what should have been a friendly crowd .
People in Jersey know what a nasty louse Dick Zimmer truly is .
Then Joe Lieberman took the stage claiming he was a Democrat supporting John McCain while taking pot shots at Obama in vague terms .
Joe is no Democrat .
Then it was Tom Kean , the whitewasher of the 9/11 committee , trying to give McCain credit for the commission which McCain and Republicans have sandbagged the American people with .
Then John McCain took the stage .
McCain spoke for about thirty minutes .
He praised people .
It was hysterical when McCain praised Lieberman as helping him win New Hampshire .
Lieberman started smirking , lifting his head smugly , while bearing a Cheshire cat grin as if Lieberman was somehow important and relevant .
Smugness and Vanity would be understatements .
Joe Lieberman and John McCain have been big reasons why Washington has failed the American people for the past 30 years so the more irrelevant they are , the better off the American people are .
McCain fumbled through his sound bites all while claiming that people are tired of sound bites .
McCain used harsh and partisan rhetoric all while claiming that this needs to change .
Large sections of McCain 's audience booed when McCain was misrepresenting Obama 's position but McCain of course calls for civil dialogue while never denouncing the uncivil nature of his supporters .
Shockingly he claimed he did not know what climate change was in 2000 but has since read up on it .
He foolishly claims that Iraq is the central focus on the War on Terror merely because David Petraeus says so .
McCain said that the Obama camp is going to try and claim that he is for privatizing Social Security and that this is untrue .
He then claimed he was against privatizing Social Security while in the very next sentence , proposing a policy that was , in effect , privatizing Social Security .
Now there 's video showing McCain supporting the privatization of Social Security in 2004 despite McCain saying that he 's never supported it .
McCain lies at the drop of a hat .
It 's obvious to most people .
This was one of McCain 's big gaffes today .
McCain also does n't understand habeas corpus .
He claimed the recent 5 - 4 decision on detainees was perhaps the worst in history because they are " enemy combatants . "
John McCain does n't understand that many of the people in Guantanamo are at best " accused enemy combatants . "
He also seem confused between habeas corpus and tort remedies .
But under this McCain Doctrine , any person in the world could be thrown in prison by John McCain merely because John McCain labels him a terrorist .
There are some nefarious names throughout history that held the same view .
It was laughable when McCain tried to talk about education .
He was ill informed and elitist .
First it was the usual gobbly - gook about private schools and school choice , which of course is n't school choice at all .
Then McCain had the audacity to equate him and Cindy sending their kids to super rich , super well funded private schools as if everybody would have access to this .
It was bizarre .
McCain has his usual sound bites and the event was craftily staged .
Approximately 200 people were hand selected ahead of time to be in a separate VIP area behind McCain and in front of McCain .
This was a campaign rally not a town hall meeting and this needs to be emphasized .
Next came the questions and answers .
McCain had said how much he loves to do town hall meetings because he likes to answer tough questions .
But almost every questioner was picked out ahead of time or was about to be chosen because of a video image or the person appeared to be a rock solid Republican during McCain 's speech .
( That was me .
I had on a suit and a lapel pin .
Even Holy Joe could n't recognize me . )
The questions and answers were not chosen among random people .
5 of the 7 questioners came from the VIP section including a woman in a wheelchair who was placed there ahead of time by a senior McCain staffer and then pointed to for a question even though she never raised her hand .
They were plants .
A couple of them were reading from index cards .
A sixth questioner was also a plant in the bleachers about 40 feet to my right .
He was a local Republican mayor whom the locals were familiar with .
The 7th questioner was only the 2nd person from outside the VIP section .
There were 3 spotters walking around with microphones looking for apparent Republicans in the audience .
The first spotter found the Republican mayor , the 2nd spotter found the 7th questioner , the third spotter was standing next to me as I was going to be questioner number eight .
( I clapped at the right times , was dressed well , had the flag lapel pin on . )
The 7th questioner was chosen because McCain thought a 9 year old child was going to ask the question .
But the father took the mike , told how his wife and child flew out of Newark on 9/11 and that could have been them .
He then asked a very simple question , " Why have n't we gotten Bin Laden ?
A bunch of Obama people and others cheered .
( I refrained , I was to be the next question . )
McCain got pissed , started rambling about the Diamondbacks and Yankees and Rudy Giuliani on a screen , said as President Bin Laden would be caught ( Guess this means Bin Laden is still safe for another few months ) and people were laughing that McCain was n't answering the question .
You could see the veins in McCain starting to burst , he got very uncomfortable that his scripted rally just got derailed by this gentleman and then he ended the rally by thanking everyone and saying God Bless America .
Again , this was not a town hall meeting .
If McCain wants tough questions he can come to Netroots Nation and be asked tough but fair questions for an hour .
I was disappointed I could n't ask my two questions because I know I can inform people more about John MCCain in 10 minutes than the national media has in 10 years .
As for the questions I had , there were as follows :
1. Senator McCain , you say we wo n't leave Iraq until we " achieve victory . "
Define the criteria of " achieving victory . "
2. Senator McCain , you voted with George W Bush 100 % of the time in 2008 and your senior advisor Lindsay Graham says that you are an extension and enhancement of George W Bush .
Is there anything that you today disagree with policy wise from George W Bush ?
If so , name 3 specifics .
If given the chance to ask these questions , McCain would have avoided them or stumbled .
At the so called " Straight Talk Town Hall Meeting " there was little straight talk and certainly no town hall meeting .
And in addition to the McCain gaffes for the day , the fact that Mccain 's town halls are really staged rallies with plants in the audience is the real story if anybody in the national media would like to report on it .

Ron Paul deserves representation at the Republican national convention in proportion to the support he received in the primaries .
And his supporters are prepared to fight like hell to make sure he gets it .
Across the country , at state and county GOP conventions , diehard supporters of maverick Ron Paul are staging uprisings in an effort to secure a role for Paul at the national convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul … .
In Minnesota , Paul loyalists captured seven delegate slots at congressional district meetings , and in Nevada , the convention abruptly recessed on April 26 after balloting showed Paul supporters winning at least half of the initial contests for delegate slots to the national convention … .
People are catching on .
Last weekend in Maine , McCain ’s forces were well organized , but Paul ’s activists nevertheless managed to pick up one of the 18 delegates at stake .
“ They attempted fraud , ” [ Julie O’Brien , executive director of the Maine Republican Party ] asserted .
“ We knew what had happened in Nevada , so we really prepared in advance . . . to make sure everything was done by the book . ”
I say boooo to Julie O’Brien .
I hope there are enough Paulestinians at the national Republican convention to rouse some rabble .
To paraphrase one of our commenters , Ron Paul tried to save the Republican Party .
Sometimes I wonder why he bothered .
Nothing 's perfect .
Stare closely enough at anything - even a masterpiece - and you 're bound to find flaws sooner or later .
They might be small .
They might be insignificant .
They might not detract from the overall quality of the piece at all ...
Except when they really , really do .
With these seven games , in fact , you do n't need to stare .
Their flaws are so huge , so obvious , so frustrating and so effing obnoxious that you can't help but notice them , despise them and wonder how the damn things got included in the first place .
Do we usually end up loving these games anyway ?
Yes .
Would we love them a lot more if they lanced these particular features like the foul , cancerous boils they truly are ?
Oh hell yes .
The best parts : Beloved Disney characters ; beloved Final Fantasy characters ; successfully merging the two ; gorgeous animation ; Hollywood - grade voice acting ; genuinely heartfelt story .
The WORST part : GUMMI SHIP
This selection should n't stir up much controversy , as you probably saw it coming from the moment you read the headline .
Everyone hates the Gummi Ship .
Everyone .
People who try the games for a few hours hate the Gummi Ship .
People who worship and adore the entire series hate the Gummi Ship .
People who cosplay as Heartless and draw fan art of Sora kissing Riku ( yes , they exist ) hate the Gummi Ship .
People who have never even played Kingdom Hearts hate the Gummi Ship .
Why ?
Because the Gummi Ship sections are as completely unnecessary as they are completely unavoidable .
After just one taste of the mind - numbing and repetitive " Star Fox for Dummies " gameplay , you 'll never want to see that blocky jalopy again ... but you 'll have to , because Kingdom Hearts forces you to travel by Gummi Ship dozens upon dozens of times .
Sure , you can customize it , but that 's about as appealing an opportunity as designing the stationary for your math homework .
Besides , you usually just ended up with junk like this :
Ha . Ha .
Dishonorable mention :
No matter how big a fan of Disney and The Little Mermaid you are , we dare you to make it through all five of Kingdom Heart II 's Atlantica " musical challenges " without wanting to tear your own ear drums out .
The video clip below might be enough to cause irreparable harm :

A musical for everyone to have a lot of finny fun --" * GUNSHOT *
I wrote a story in March noting just how ubiquitous Joe Lieberman had become in McCainworld .
If anything , he 's become even more prominent in the campaign since , holding conference calls to carry the campaign message and appearing at his friend 's side all over the country , including last Thursday at a nationally - televised town hall meeting in New York .
It remains a longshot , but Lieberman 's name has been popping up as a veep prospect .
It almost has a Cheney - esque quality to it : you look around and then pick the guy who has been right in front of you all along .
And people who know McCain say that if he were liberated to pick whoever he wanted , politics aside , he 'd love to tap his pal Joe .
The problem , of course , is that there would be blowback .
" The political consensus is that McCain could n't get away with either , and he knows it , " wrote Bob Novak in his Saturday column about McCain 's inclination to look at both Lieberman and the pro-choice Tom Ridge .
When I floated the prospect to another prominent conservative , he did n't waste a moment before telling me what the reaction would be from the right - wing : harsh .
There is also the matter of whether Lieberman , who knows from running for veep , would be interested in reprising his 2000 role .
" As my boss says , ' been there , done that , got the t- shirt ! ' " quipped Lieberman spokesman Marshall Wittmann when I asked if it was crazy to think the senator may be a prospect once again .
Of course , that is not exactly a Shermanesque denial .
And the possibility continues to bubble in Republican circles .
Appearing yesterday on Fox News Sunday , Karl Rove included Lieberman on a list of four possible running mates for McCain .
Rove said he preferred Mitt Romney , but said Lieberman would be " the choice way out of left field — you know , the real excitement . "
I 'm not sure how much excitement the famously genial and mild - mannered Lieberman would bring to the ticket , but it would make a statement .
Especially if McCain finds his chances for victory to be increasingly distant as the summer wears on , Lieberman could be the man he turns to .
Why ?
Because he'd help underscore two central elements of McCain 's campaign while also making a major symbolic point about the sort of president he wants to be .
First , it would be similar to what Gore did for Clinton in 1992 : reinforcing strengths instead of bolstering weaknesses .
McCain has long said that the threat of Islamic terrorism is the preeminent issue facing the country : picking somebody who also feels strongly about the same and has much experience on national security issues could help keep a focus on the matter
And , perhaps even more important , selecting a Democrat - turned - Independent would help McCain make the case that he is the real post - partisan in the race .
One of the most compelling arguments the Arizonan has is that he has walked the walk when it comes to working across party lines on difficult issues while his rival has done more talking than walking .
Picking Lieberman would make that argument in living color -- and suggest that a McCain presidency could end the gridlock that has beset Washington 's political culture .
That 's the argument for -- there are many more strong points to make against , not the least of which is Lieberman 's abortion stance , opposition to the central elements of Republican economic dogma and his diminished stature among his fellow Democrats in the Senate .
But in politics as in football , it 's tough to come back if you 're down a few touchdowns and running the wishbone .
You 've got to throw the longball .

A piglet scared of wallowing in mud has overcome its fears with the help of some Wellington boots .
Six - week - old Cinders appears to suffer from mysophobia , a fear of dirt , after refusing to join her siblings as they splashed around in the mud .
Owner Andrew Keeble from Thirsk , North Yorks , said his daughter Ellie , 12 , suggested kitting her out in the tiny footwear which had been on a key ring .
" Lo and behold they fitted her like a glove , " Mr Keeble said .
" She 's scared of mud , but her brothers and sisters are quite happy in it .
" We 've never come across this before .
They are born ready to go and explore , but she never really liked going in the mud . "
Mr Keeble and wife Debbie , both 42 , run a sausage company and keep about 200 pigs on their 1,000 - acre farm .
But the father - of - four said there was no chance that Cinders would be slaughtered .
" She 's more of a pet really now and she 's going to live a very long and happy life , " he said .
The young saddleback has been chosen by the couple as a mascot for their campaign to raise money for the Farm Crisis Network , which supports struggling farmers .
Congress caves on the global gag rule but the huge spending bill expected to pass this week will head to President Bush 's desk with some reproductive health victories .
One of the major impasses between Congress and the White House this year has been over the bills that fund the government .
But it looks like the fighting may soon come to end as lawmakers attempt to pass an omnibus funding bill that President Bush will not veto .
On the House side , Appropriations Chair David Obey ( D - Wis. ) says he 's optimistic .
Obey has been in the middle of a heated reproductive and sexual health battle for many months related to both the controversial Global Gag Rule ( also known as the " Mexico City Policy " ) for its purpose of restraining any discussion related to abortion from U.S. funded health clinics overseas and the recent increase in federal dollars for failed abstinence - only programs .
Unfortunately , passing such a large spending package that would n't get vetoed by our illustrious president meant gutting the bill ( over the weekend ) of language put in place by Democrats who wanted to see either a full repeal of the harmful Global Gag Rule or at least what was termed a " contraceptive exemption . "
The " contraceptive exemption , " introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey ( D - NY ) , Chairwoman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee , would have allowed for the provision of free contraception to international health agencies that have been denied funding through the Global Gag Rule .
The Global Gag Rule , put in place by President Reagan , and lifted temporarily only by President Clinton , restricts free speech and limits health care provision in many developing nations by preventing U.S. aid to family planning agencies that provide crucial health services unless they abide by severe free speech curtailments as set by the U.S. government – free speech limits that would never hold up under the United States Constitution .
President Bush 's insistence on continuing to bar funding to international NGOs , agencies that are in some way connected to centers that provide or advocate for abortion as an option , has had a tremendous impact on women and their families .

According to the Washington Post :
" Two of the largest distributors of contraception [ in Kenya ] , Family Health Options Kenya and Marie Stopes Kenya , did not provide abortions , which are illegal in Kenya , but were subsidiaries of London - based parent organizations whose members helped provide them in other countries .
Together , the two groups closed five family planning clinics after losing U.S. funding . "
2007 saw a historic moment when both the Senate and House agreed that the global gag rule was harmful to women's health and and included provisions to overturn at least a part of it and get contraceptives to women who wanted them .
But President Bush did not value the compromise position – and did not see the value in providing contraception .
He threatened a veto early on forcing Democrats and Republicans to agree to his demands .
Reproductive health advocates do have something to celebrate .
The bill loosens the shackle of the requirement that mandated that at least one - third of US global HIV prevention funds be used solely for programs that promote abstinence until marriage .
The mandate is nullified for one year .
According to the Global Health Council , the bill increases funding levels for HIV / AIDS efforts globally by almost $ 1.8 billion for fiscal year 2008 .
In addition , family planning funds were increased slightly to $ 461 million , though the global gag rule keeps them from being used in the most effective way possible .
This funding level is far below the estimated $ 1 billion that is the appropriate U.S. contribution to the global total needed to meet unmet need for contraceptives .
As Amy Coen , president of Population Action International says ,
" We commend members of Congress – on both sides of the abortion debate — for finding common ground to improve the lives of women and their children , thus reducing unintended pregnancies , abortion , and HIV infection through greater access to contraceptives .
It is tragic that President Bush was unable to follow their lead .
His persistent threat to veto the foreign assistance bill doomed this life - saving measure .
It is unconscionable for a president to ignore the majority of the members of Congress , the majority of Americans and the best interests of millions of human beings because he is blinded by his own narrow beliefs .
Today the shadow of one man darkens the lives of so many . "

In reading the Forgotten Man , one is struck by some parallels between our current economic times and the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Then : The Great Depression was preceded by the stock market crash of 1929 .
Prior to the crash people were borrowing money to buy stocks sure that stocks could only go up in value .
Margin requirements were relaxed so that a buyer need only put 10 % down .
Now : Prior to the housing crash Americans were borrowing money to buy houses sure that houses could only go up in value .

Now : Government payrolls nationwide are expanding , with an ever greater percentage of Americans employed by federal , state , or local government .
This comes on top of a huge expansion after September 11 , 2001 , when we began devoting a larger fraction of our labor force to security and many of those folks are government employees .
Governments at all levels continue with massive building programs .
Then : “ Roosevelt himself saw that while [ Social Security ’s ] revenues might cover its costs now , the numbers from the actuaries suggested that there would not be enough money for old - age pensions for future generations . ”
Social Security was explained thusly : “ You and your employer will each pay three cents on each dollar you earn , up to $ 3,000 a year .
[ That amount ] is the most you will ever have to pay . ”
Now :

It impoverished tenant farmers and other laborers who could not earn a living unless the land was actually farmed .
Now : Congress recently passed the most expensive agriculture bill in American history .
At a time when people worldwide are struggling to pay for food , we pay farmers not to grow food and / or encourage them to turn food into SUV fuel .

Sure , we 'll admit to a certainsuper - fun fascination with gadgetry , but a new study out this month by the Solutions Research Group says that overall , we 're borderline obsessed -- and that 68 percent of Americans in general feel anxious when not connected in one way or another .
The study used research collected on almost 5,000 people over two years , and found that feelings of " disconnect anxiety " affected people of all ages , triggering sentiments like " dazed , " " disoriented , " " tense , " " inadequate " and even " panic . "
Interestingly , however , the reasons for disconnect anxiety changed as subjects got older -- teens and young adults worried about social communications being cut off , while older adults mostly fretted over work and safety issues .
The study is backed up by all kinds of humorously embarrassing data like the percentage of BlackBerry users who 've sent a message in the bathroom ( 63 % ) and the average number of Facebook friends a 12 - 24 year old has ( 159 ) but what we found most surprising is that just 37 % of laptop owners frequently use their machines in the bedroom .
That seems awfully low to us -- what if you miss something while you 're asleep ?

Three years ago this month , T. Boone Pickens launched a multi-million dollar crusade to bring more wind energy to the US .
“ Building new wind generation facilities , ” along with energy efficiency and more consumption of domestic natural gas , the Dallas billionaire claimed , would allow the US to “ replace more than one - third of our foreign oil imports in 10 years . ”
Those were halcyon times for the wind industry .
These days , Pickens never talks about wind .
He ’s focused instead on getting a fat chunk of federal subsidies so he can sell more natural gas to long - haul truckers through his company , Clean Energy Fuels .
( Pickens and his wife , Madeleine , own about half of the stock of Clean Energy , a stake worth about $ 550 million . )
While the billionaire works the halls of Congress seeking a subsidy of his very own , he ’s also trying to find a buyer for the $ 2 billion worth of wind turbines he contracted for back in 2008 .
The last news report that I saw indicated that he was trying to foist the turbines off onto the Canadians .
Being dumped by Pickens is only one of a panoply of problems facing the global wind industry .
Among the issues : an abundance of relatively cheap natural gas , a growing backlash against industrial wind projects due to concerns about visual blight and noise , increasing concerns about the murderous effect that wind turbines have on bats and birds , the extremely high costs of offshore wind energy , and a new study which finds that wind energy ’s ability to cut carbon dioxide emissions have been overstated .
Yeah , that ’s a long list of things .
But the mainstream media rarely casts a critical eye on the wind industry .
So bear with me for a few minutes .
And in doing so , consider how the backlash against industrial wind is playing out in Wales , where , on May 27 , the BBC reports that some 1,500 protesters descended on the Welsh assembly , demanding that a massive wind project planned for central Wales be halted .
Earlier this month , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. came out with another broadside ( this one in the Wall Street Journal ) against the Cape Wind project off Cape Cod , not far from the Kennedy clan ’s place in Hyannisport .
Kennedy says New England should n’t put 130 wind turbines in Nantucket Sound , instead , it should import hydropower from Canada .
He neglected to say that Cape Wind likely wo n’t ever get built because the Department of Energy is withholding its financing of the project .
Over the past few days , protesters in Denmark have been camping on a wooded tract in Northern Jutland in order to prevent the clearing of a protected forest where the government plans to build a test center that aims to install a series of wind turbines 250 meters high .
The increasing opposition to industrial wind projects – opposition that ’s coming from grassroots organizations all over the world – should be a wake up call for advocates of renewable energy .
Instead , the wind industry ’s apologists continue to claim that they are victims of a conspiracy , and that they are under attack from the “ fossil fuel industry . ”
That ’s been the typical response from the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) and its hirelings , who prefer to use character assassination rather than engage in factual debate .
Here ’s the reality : the wind industry is under a full - blown attack from market forces .
Those markets are economic , political , social , and environmental .
And the wind scammers are losing on nearly all fronts .
Let ’s start with natural gas .
Few people know the natural gas business better than Pickens , and he ’ll tell you that himself .
Many times .
Two years ago , shortly after he launched his high - profile plan , Pickens said natural gas prices must be at least $ 9 for wind energy to be competitive .
In March 2010 , Pickens was still hawking wind energy , but he ’d lowered his price threshold saying “ The place where it works best is with natural gas at $ 7 . ”
By January of this year Pickens was complaining that you ca n’t “ finance a wind deal unless you have $ 6 gas . ”
That may be true , but on the spot market , natural gas now sells for about $ 4.50 per million Btu .
Today ’s relatively low natural gas prices are a direct result of the drilling industry ’s new - found prowess at unlocking galaxies of methane from shale beds .
Those lower prices are great for consumers but terrible for the wind business .
The difficulties faced by the wind industry are evident in the numbers :
Last year , total US wind generation capacity grew by 5,100 megawatts , about half as much capacity as was added in 2009 .
During the first quarter of this year , new wind installations totaled just 1,100 megawatts , indicating that this year will likely be even worse than 2010 .
For its part , the wind industry continues to claim that it ’s creating lots of “ green ” – oops , I mean “ clean ” – energy jobs .
Last year , after the lame - duck Congress passed a one - year extension of the investment tax credit for renewable energy projects , AWEA said it would “ help save tens of thousands of American jobs . ”
Perhaps .
But those jobs are so expensive that not even Pickens could afford many of them .
Last December , about the same time that Congress was voting to continue the wind subsidies , Texas Comptroller Susan Combs reported that tax breaks for wind projects in the Lone Star State cost nearly $ 1.6 million per job .
And that “ green ” job bonanza is happening in Texas , America ’s biggest natural gas producer .
Few people in the Obama administration have been more fulsome in their backing of wind than Energy Secretary Steve Chu .
A few weeks ago , while at the Aspen Institute , I ran into Chu at a cocktail party .
During our conversation , Chu casually dismissed the widespread opposition to industrial wind projects as a bunch of “ NIMBYs . ”
( That is , “ not in my backyard . ” )
If Chu had done even the smallest bit of homework , he would know that the European Platform Against Windfarms now has 485 signatory organizations from 22 European countries .
In the UK , where fights are raging against industrial wind projects in Wales , Scotland , and elsewhere , some 250 anti-wind groups have been formed .
In Canada , the province of Ontario alone has more than 50 anti-wind groups .
The US has about 170 anti-wind groups .
Over the past year or so , I have personally interviewed people in Wisconsin , Maine , New York , Nova Scotia , Ontario , the U.K. , New Zealand , and Australia .
All of them used almost identical language in describing the health problems caused by the noise coming from wind turbines that had built near their homes .
Janet Warren , who was raising sheep on her 500 - acre family farm near Makara , New Zealand , told me via email that the turbines put up near her home emit “ continuous noise and vibration ” which she said was resulting in “ genuine sleep deprivation causing loss of concentration , irritability , and short - term memory effects . ”
A few months ago , Warren and her family decided they could n’t stand to live with the noise any longer and moved out of their home to another location .
Or consider the case of Billy Armstrong , a plumbing and heating engineer who lives in County Durham , England .
Armstrong must endure the noise from several wind turbines that were recently installed 800 yards from his home .
When we talked by phone , Armstrong told me that he is frequently awakened by the noise from the turbines , particularly during the summer months .
What is his advice for other rural landowners facing the prospect of wind turbines being built near their homes ?
His reply : “ Fight them .
Do n’t let them do it . ”
The problems associated with low - frequency noise caused by wind turbines if finally getting proper attention from the scientific community .
The August issue of the journal Bulletin of Science , Technology & Society , has nine articles that address various aspects of the turbine - noise issue .
The most important : low - frequency noise , also known as infrasound .
Although inaudible to most humans , infrasound can cause a number of maladies including headaches , sleeplessness , and vertigo .
One of peer - reviewed articles that appears in the Bulletin of Science , Technology & Society , is by Carl V. Phillips , a Harvard - trained PhD .
Phillips concludes that there is “ overwhelming evidence that wind turbines cause serious health problems in nearby residents , usually stress - disorder type diseases , at a nontrivial rate . ”
Among the most prominent critics of the wind industry on the noise issue is Dr. Robert McMurtry , an Ontario - based orthopedic surgeon .
McMurtry has impeccable credentials .
He ’s a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada .
Earlier this month he was named a Member of the Order of Canada , the country ’s highest civilian award .
Over the past two years , McMurtry has spearheaded the effort to stop industrial wind projects in Ontario while also leading efforts to get peer - reviewed medical studies done on the deleterious effects of turbine - produced infrasound .
“ The people who are forced to live near these turbines are being abused , ” McMurtry told me a few months ago .
“ It is compromising their health . ”
But the wind industry has taken a stand : never mind the science ; ignore the complainers .
That ’s the stance taken by AWEA and other wind lobby groups who continue to deny that there are any problems with wind turbine noise and that those who are complaining merely need psychological counseling .
In late 2009 , AWEA and the Canadian Wind Energy Association , published a paper which attempted to quiet critics on the noise issue , by declaring that “ There is no evidence that the audible or sub- audible sounds emitted by wind turbines have any direct adverse physiological effects . ”
It also suggested that the symptoms being attributed to wind turbine noise were psychosomatic and declared flatly that the vibrations from the turbines are “ too weak to be detected by , or to affect , humans . ”
And lest you think that the research being done on wind turbine noise is collegial , think again .
Last year , during a webinar that was sponsored in part , by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , an arm of the US Department of Energy , Geoff Leventhall , a consultant who was working for AWEA , said that one of the researchers who has been investigating the health effects of infrasound caused by wind turbines was “ stupid . ”
If that ’s the case , then there are thousands of stupid people protesting against industrial wind , and they are located all over the world .
Here ’s a small sampling of recent news :
— Last November , five people , several of them from Earth First !
were arrested near Lincoln , Maine , after they blocked a road leading to a construction site for a 60 - megawatt wind project on Rollins Mountain .
According to a story written by Tux Turkel of the Portland Press Herald , one of the protesters carried a sign which read “ Stop the rape of rural Maine . ”
— On May 12 , the first industrial wind facility proposed for rural Connecticut was rejected by the state ’s siting council , which said the “ visual effects ” of the project were “ in conflict with the policies of the state . ”
The project had been vigorously opposed by Save Prospect , a group founded by an affable high school teacher named Tim Reilly .
— Denmark , the supposed Valhalla of wind energy , is seeing fierce opposition to the energy sprawl required by wind .
On July 22 , 2010 , the Danish paper Jyllands - Posten reported that there are some 40 anti-wind groups in Denmark and that “ more and more neighbors are protesting against new , large wind turbines . ”
It cited the Svendborg city council which recently refused to provide a permit for turbines over 80 meters high , after a local group “ protested violently against two wind turbines ” that had been erected a few months earlier .
The story continued , saying that “ neighbors complain especially about the noise ” from the turbines .
It then quoted the town deputy mayor as saying that due to “ the violent protests and the uncertainty of low - frequency noise ” coming from the turbines , the town would “ not expose our citizens ” to large wind turbines .
— Last August , the Danish Society for Nature Conservation filed a complaint with the European Union in order to stop the parliament ’s move to install 250 - meter high wind turbines in a protected area in northern Jutland .
According to the Danish press , the government is going ahead with the plans for the wind turbine testing center , and in recent days , Danish police have been forced to call in reinforcements because more than 30 protesters have been camping in the forest to prevent the project from going forward .
— Last September , the Copenhagen Post reported that “ State - owned energy firm Dong Energy has given up building more wind turbines on Danish land , following protests from residents complaining about the noise the turbines make . ”
The article quotes company CEO Anders Eldrup , as saying “ It is very difficult to get the public ’s acceptance if the turbines are built close to residential buildings , and therefore we are now looking at maritime options . ”
— Residents of Falmouth , Massachusetts , a small town on Cape Cod , continue to complain about noise coming from a 1.65 megawatt turbine that was installed in their town .
The July 12 issue of the Cape Cod Times quotes Falmouth resident Neil Andersen , who says that at certain times , the turbine “ gets jet engine loud … To put it simple , they drive one crazy . ”
— Residents of Vinalhaven , Maine continue to complain to state and local officials about the noise coming from turbines erected in their town .
And some residents have chosen to abandon their homes rather than continue to live with the noise .
Of course , the wind industry claims that it has huge opportunities offshore .
That ’s true if money is no object .
Building offshore wind projects costs about $ 5,000 per kilowatt , or about the same as a new nuclear plant , even though a nuclear plant will have a capacity factor at least three times that of the wind project .
Put another way , building offshore wind costs about five times as much as the $ 1,000 or so per kilowatt needed for a new natural gas fired generator .
Those high costs will mean high costs for ratepayers .
The likely cost for electricity from Cape Wind , the controversial wind project located off of Cape Code , will be about $ 0.21 per kilowatt - hour – if that project ever gets built .
Last year , an offshore project off the coast of Rhode Island , Deepwater Wind , was rejected by that state ’s public utility commission because the cost of electricity from the project was expected to be $ 0.244 per kilowatt - hour with annual increases of 3.5 % per year .
For reference , the average retail price of electricity in the US is about $ 0.10 .
While the wind industry continues to hope for more mandates and subsidies that will increase the cost of electricity for ratepayers , America ’s wildlife is being subjected to a double standard .
Indeed , the apparent appeal of “ green ” energy is so great that the US wind industry has a get - out - of - jail - free card when it comes to federal wildlife laws .
Despite overwhelming evidence that shows tens of thousands of violations , the US wind industry has never been prosecuted under the Eagle Protection Act nor the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 , one of the oldest wildlife laws in America .
In 2008 , a study funded by the Alameda County Community Development Agency , estimated that about 2,400 raptors , including burrowing owls , American kestrels , and red - tailed hawks – as well as about 7,500 other birds , nearly all of which are protected under the MBTA – are being killed every year by the wind turbines located at Altamont Pass , California .
Last month , the Los Angeles Times reported that 70 golden eagles per year are being killed by the turbines at Altamont Pass .
But again , the federal government has not brought a single case against the wind industry .
Wildlife biologists estimate that the region around the pass would need 167 pairs of nesting golden eagles to produce enough offspring in order to make up for all of the eagles being killed by the bird Cuisinarts at Altamont .
But the region only has 60 pairs of eagles .
Indeed , the only time the wind industry has ever faced legal action for killing birds occurred last year when the state of California reached a $ 2.5 million settlement with NextEra Energy Resources for the bird kills at Altamont .
As part of that deal , the company agreed to remove or replace all of the turbines at Altamont by 2015 .
The lack of prosecution of the wind industry for bird kills underscores a pernicious double standard in the enforcement of federal wildlife laws : at the very same time that federal law enforcement officials are bringing cases against oil and gas companies and electric utilities under the MBTA , they have given a de facto exemption to the wind industry for any enforcement action under that same statute .
Indeed , over the past two decades or so , federal authorities have brought hundreds of cases against the oil and gas industry for violations of the MBTA .
A recent example : On August 13 , 2009 , Exxon Mobil pled guilty in federal court to charges that it killed 85 birds – all of which were protected under the MBTA .
The company agreed to pay $ 600,000 in fines and fees for the bird kills , which occurred after the animals came in contact with hydrocarbons in uncovered tanks and waste water facilities on company properties located in five western states .
Despite the toll that wind turbines are taking on birds , the industry continues to claim that efforts to protect bird life are just too stringent .
In May , the Fish and Wildlife Service announced guidelines for the siting of wind turbines , but AWEA immediately objected , with the lobby group ’s boss , Denise Bode , denouncing the guidelines as “ unworkable . ”
Bats are getting whacked , too .
On July 17 , the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette reported that the 420 wind turbines that have been erected in Pennsylvania “ killed more than 10,000 bats last year …
That ’s an average of 25 bats per turbine per year , and the Nature Conservancy predicts that as many as 2,900 turbines will be set up across the state by 2030 . ”
A study of a 44 - turbine wind farm in West Virginia found that up to 4,000 bats had been killed by the turbines in 2004 alone .
A 2008 study of dead bats found on the ground near a Canadian wind farm found that many of the bats had been killed by a change in air pressure near the turbine blades that causes fatal damage to their lungs , a condition known as “ barotrauma . ”
Bat Conservation International , an Austin - based group dedicated to preserving the flying mammals and their habitats , has called the proliferation of wind turbines “ a lethal crisis . ”
In 2009 , I interviewed Ed Arnett , who heads the group ’s research efforts on wind power .
He said that the head - long rush to develop wind power is having major detrimental effects on bat populations but few environmental groups are willing to discuss the problem because those groups are so focused on the issue of carbon dioxide emissions and the possibility of global warming .
“ To compromise today ’s wildlife values and environmental impacts for tomorrow ’s speculated hopes is irresponsible , ” Arnett said .
But Arnett added that only a handful of bat species are protected by federal law .
And thus the killing of bats by wind turbines gets little attention from the media .
The final issue to be addressed is the one that drives the wind energy devotees to total distraction : carbon dioxide .
For years , it has been assumed that wind energy can provide a cost - effective method of reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
The reality : wind energy ’s carbon dioxide - cutting benefits are vastly overstated .
Furthermore , if wind energy does help reduce carbon emissions , those reductions are likely too expensive to be used on any kind of scale .
Those are the findings of an exhaustive new study from Bentek Energy , a Colorado - based energy analytics firm .
Rather than rely on computer models that use theoretical emissions data , the authors of the study , Porter Bennett and Brannin McBee , analyzed actual emissions data from electric generation plants located in four regions : the Electric Reliability Council of Texas , Bonneville Power Administration , California Independent System Operator , and the Midwest Independent System Operator .
Those four system operators serve about 110 million customers , or about one - third of the US population .
Bennett and McBee looked at more than 300,000 hourly records from 2007 through 2009 .
Their results show that the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) and other wind boosters have vastly overstated wind ’s ability to cut sulfur dioxide , nitrous oxide , and carbon dioxide .
Indeed , the study found that in some regions of the country , like California , using wind energy does n’t reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at all .
But the most important conclusion from the study is that wind energy is not “ a cost - effective solution for reducing carbon dioxide if carbon is valued at less than $ 33 per ton . ”
With the US economy still in recession and unemployment numbers near record levels , Congress cannot , will not , attempt to impose a carbon tax , no matter how small .
The wind industry ’s apologists are desperate to dismiss the Bentek study , which is a more thorough version of a similar study the firm did in early 2010 .
But the Bentek study is similar to several other studies that have come to almost identical conclusions .
For instance , in 2003 , a paper presented at the International Energy Workshop in Laxenburg , Austria by a group of Estonian researchers concluded that using traditional power plants to compensate for the highly variable , incurably intermittent electricity produced by wind turbines “ eliminates the major part of the expected positive effect of wind energy , ” and that “ In some cases the environmental gain from the wind energy use was lost almost totally . ”
In 2004 , the Irish Electricity Supply Board found that as the level of wind capacity increases , “ the CO2 emissions actually increase as a direct result of having to cope with the variation of wind - power output . ”
A 2008 article published in the journal Energy Policy , James Oswald and his two co-authors concluded that increased use of wind will likely cause utilities to invest in lower - efficiency gas - fired generators that will be switched on and off frequently , a move that further lowers their energy efficiency .
Upon publication of the study , Oswald said that carbon dioxide savings from wind power “ will be less than expected , because cheaper , less efficient [ gas - fired ] plant[s ] will be used to support these wind power fluctuations .
Neither these extra costs nor the increased carbon production are being taken into account in the government figures for wind power . ”
In November 2009 , Kent Hawkins , a Canadian electrical engineer , published a detailed analysis on the frequency with which gas - fired generators must be cycled on and off in order to back up wind power .
Hawkins findings : the frequent switching on and off results in more gas consumption than if there were no wind turbines at all .
His analysis suggests that it would be more efficient in terms of carbon dioxide emissions to simply run combined - cycle gas turbines on a continuous basis rather than use wind turbines backed up by gas - fired generators that are constantly being turned on and off .
Hawkins concludes that wind power is not an “ effective CO2 mitigation ” strategy “ because of inefficiencies introduced by fast - ramping ( inefficient ) operation of gas turbines . ”
If wind energy does n’t effectively cut carbon dioxide , then the wind sector has few reasons to exist .
The Global Wind Energy Council claims that reducing the amount of carbon dioxide into atmosphere “ is the most important environmental benefit from wind power generation . ”
For its part , the American Wind Energy Association insists that the wind business “ could avoid 825 million tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030 . ”
That 825 million tons sounds like a lot .
It ’s not .
In 2010 , global carbon dioxide emissions totaled 33.1 billion tons .
Thus , if the US went on a wind energy binge , and installed thousands of turbines in every available location , doing so might reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by about 2.5 % .
And that calculation assumes that global carbon dioxide emissions will stay flat over the next two decades .
They wo n’t .
And that leads to the obvious question : if wind energy does n’t significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions , then why does the industry get such hefty subsidies ?
The key subsidy is the federal production tax credit of $ 0.022 for each kilowatt - hour of electricity .
That amounts to subsidy of $ 6.44 per million BTU of energy produced .
For comparison , in 2008 , the Energy Information Administration reported that subsidies to the oil and gas sector totaled $ 1.9 billion per year , or about $ 0.03 per million BTU of energy produced .
In other words , subsidies to the wind sector are more than 200 times as great as those given to the oil and gas sector on the basis of per - unit - of - energy produced .
If those fat subsidies go away , then the US wind sector will be stopped dead in its tracks .
And for consumers , that should be welcome news .
The wind energy business is the electric sector ’s equivalent of the corn ethanol scam : it ’s an over - subsidized industry that depends wholly on taxpayer dollars to remain solvent while providing an inferior product to consumers that does little , if anything , to reduce our need for hydrocarbons or cut carbon dioxide emissions .
Indeed , it only increases costs and complexity for the utilities , which , in turn , means higher costs for consumers .
A final point : whenever you hear people like Steve Chu complain about “ NIMBYs ” who do n’t want wind turbines on their property , be sure to include billionaires on the list of NIMBYs .
You see , people like Boone Pickens are eager to have wind turbines and transmission lines put up on other people ’s land , not theirs .
In 2008 , Pickens declared that his 68,000 - acre ranch located in the Texas Panhandle , one of America ’s windiest regions , will not sport a single turbine .
“ I ’m not going to have the windmills on my ranch , ” Pickens declared .
“ They ’re ugly . ”

A crude JavaScript implementation of the first stage of Super Mario Brothers has been making the rounds today .
It ’s roughly playable but misses many key aspects ( no mushrooms , no flag , no one - ups , etc. ) .
However , that ’s not what ’s particularly interesting about the game .
Perhaps the most interesting part of the application is not within the game mechanics itself but in the fact that all of the game contents are embedded within the game script :
This includes all game sprites and music .
This is an interesting feat and one that ’s possible to accomplish within your own code .
Let ’s take a step through how this was done to understand how we can better use this within our own sites .
Music Embedding ( base64 )
Surprisingly , how the music is embedded within the application is , perhaps , the easiest to completely understand .
The application makes use of data : URLs , encoding the Mario music MIDI files using base64 .
We can see the result within the source file :
aSounds = [ // very small , very simple mario theme .
Sequenced by Mike Martel .
" data:audio/mid;base64 ,TVRoZAAAAAYAAQAEAMBNVH... " , // game over .
Sequenced by John N. Engelmann .
" data:audio/mid;base64 ,TVRoZAAAAAYAAQADAHhNVH ... " ] ,
data : URLs work by encoding the entire contents of the specified files within the URL to the file itself .
This can even be used for images ( embedding PNGs , JPGs , GIFs , etc. ) .
In this case it ’s being sent to an < embed / > element , which is capable of playing the midi file .
We can spot the resulting injection code here :
playMusic = function ( iSoundID , bLoop ) { if (! bMusic ) return ; var oEmbed = dc ( " embed " ) ; oEmbed.src = a Sounds[ iSoundID ] ; oEmbed.id = " sound_ " + i SoundID ; if ( bLoop ) o Embed.setAttribute ( " loop " , " true " ) ; oEmbed.setAttribute ( " autostart " , " true " ) ; oEmbed.style.position = " absolute " ; oEmbed.style.left = - 1000 ; appChild( document.body , oEmbed ) ; } ,
Which simply creates an embed element , sets it to automatically start , and injects the data : url as the src .
The result is an auto - playing MIDI file ( assumedly a similar result could be achieved with another universal file format , such as WAV ) .
data : URLs are capable of playing in all browsers but Internet Explorer ( they ’re being introduced in Internet Explorer 8 ) .
In the case of this application Internet Explorer users simply do n’t receive audio for the game .
Image Embedding ( binary and ascii )
The second , interesting , portion of the application is the embedding of the various sprites used in the game .
This includes the mario character , the blocks , pipes , and even the background images .
The application uses a number of interesting techniques in order to compress the size of the resulting images .
Rather than using the data : url technique ( which is completely applicable , in this case , to applications that can use them ) the game , instead , uses the < canvas /> element ( and regular div/ spans for Internet Explorer ) .
Because of this dual platform target the individual pixels of the sprites must be saved and retrieved .
In order to meet this target all of the individual pixels must be stored in a way that is space efficient , and yet , easy to access .
To start , all available colors must be mapped out and reduced .
All sprites within the game have , at most , 4 colors ( some have less ) .
We can see this reduction process in the following graphic :
This reduction , and mapping into a binary grid , is a useful way to create a portable sprite ( each sprite is reduced to the binary and associated colors ) .
The next step is to convert the binary grid into an easily - transportable string , like the following :
The end result is a string representation of the entire sprite – which is quite small ( byte - wise ) while still being translatable back to its original representation .
Both of these encoding techniques can prove to be quite useful in your JavaScript code – especially if you ’re striving to encapsulate as much within the base code , itself , rather than in external files .
This talk was delivered on June 8 , 2008 , at the Future of Freedom Foundation ‘s conference on “ Restoring the Republic : Foreign Policy and Civil Liberties . “
I would like to speak to you today about Christianity and War .
I do n’t suppose there is anything I write and speak about with more fervor than the biblical , economic , and political fallacies of religious people .
This is especially true regarding the general subject of Christianity and war .
If there is any group of people that should be opposed to war , torture , militarism , the warfare state , state worship , suppression of civil liberties , an imperial presidency , blind nationalism , government propaganda , and an aggressive foreign policy it is Christians , and especially conservative , evangelical , and fundamentalist Christians who claim to strictly follow the dictates of Scripture and worship the Prince of Peace .
It is indeed strange that Christian people should be so accepting of war .
War is the greatest suppressor of civil liberties .
War is the greatest destroyer of religion , morality , and decency .
War is the greatest creator of fertile ground for genocides and atrocities .
War is the greatest destroyer of families and young lives .
War is the greatest creator of famine , disease , and homelessness .
War is the health of the state .
But Christianity is in a sad state .
In the Church can be found some of the greatest supporters of the state , its leaders , its military , and its wars .
Christians who are otherwise good , godly , disciples of Christ often turn into babbling idiots when it comes to the subjects of war , the military , and killing for the state .
There is an unholy desire on the part of a great many Christians to legitimize killing in war .
There persists the idea among too many Christians that mass killing in war is acceptable , but the killing of one ’s neighbor violates the sixth commandment ’s prohibition against killing .
Christians who would n’t think of using the Lord ’s name in vain blaspheme
God when they make ridiculous statements like “ God is pro-war . ”
Christians who try never to lie do so with boldness when they claim they are pro-life , but refuse to extend their pro-life sentiments to foreigners already out of the womb .
Christians who abhor idols are guilty of idolatry when they say that we should follow the latest dictates of the state because we should always “ obey the powers that be . ”
Christians who venerate the Bible handle the word of God deceitfully when they quote Scripture to justify U.S. government wars .
Christians who claim to have the mind of Christ show that they have lost their mind when they want the full force of government to protect a stem cell , but have no conscience about U.S. soldiers killing for the government .
There is an unseemly alliance that exists between certain sectors of Christianity and the military .
Even Christians who are otherwise sound in the faith , who are not fooled by Bush ’s pseudo - Christianity and faith - based socialism , who believe that the less government we have the better , who do n’t support the war in Iraq , and who oppose an aggressive U.S. foreign policy get indignant when you question the institution of the military .
Some churches would have no trouble doubling as military recruiting centers .
There are Christian colleges that even offer Army ROTC .
Most churches fawn over current and former members of the military , not just on Veterans Day , but on other holidays like Memorial Day , Armed Forces Day , and the Fourth of July , and also on special “ military appreciation ” days that they designate .
Well , like those in foreign countries on the receiving end of a U.S. military intervention , I do n’t appreciate most of what the military does today , as I will explain later .
Much of the blame for Christian support for war must be laid at the feet of the pastors , preachers , and priests who have failed to discern the truth themselves so they can educate their congregations .
It is tragic that many so - called Christian “ leaders ” moonlight as apologists for Bush , the Republican Party , and Bush ’s Republican - supported war .
In fact , some of them could double as Republican Party operatives without changing their sermons .
Too many pastors are cheerleaders for war , bloodshed , death , and destruction ; since , after all , Iraqis are all just a bunch of dumb ragheads , Muslim heathens , or incorrigible terrorists .
We hear more from the pulpit today justifying military intervention in the Middle East than we do about the need for missionaries to go there .
It is appalling that instead of the next military adventure of the U.S. government being denounced from every pulpit in the land , it will be preachers who can be counted on to defend it — and more so if it is another Republican war .
To compound all of this , many of the church and denominational leaders who do n’t follow the Republican Party line and do n’t support the war in Iraq are strangely silent .
Not a word about the immorality of the Iraq War .
Not a word about U.S. imperialism .
Not a word about the lies of the U.S. government .
Not a word about the pseudo - Christianity of the president .
Not a word about Christians naïvely supporting the latest U.S. government pronouncement .
Not a word about the CIA and the military being no place for a Christian young person .
Not even a mild word of warning about the evils of the U.S. government .
I do n’t buy the excuse that these leaders are merely preaching and teaching the Bible and choosing not to dabble in politics .
They are not silent about the evils of rock music , trashy daytime television , abortion , and pornography , even though the Scripture does n’t mention these things , yet they are silent about the evils of war .
Perhaps their churches contain too many current and former members of the military and they do n’t want to rock the boat .
Perhaps they are veterans themselves and feel embarrassed to now criticize their former employer .
If there is any group within Christianity that should be the most consistent , the most vocal , the most persistent , and the most scriptural in its opposition to war and the warfare state , it is conservative Christians who look to the Bible as their sole authority .
Yet , never at any time in history have so many of these Christians held such unholy opinions .
The adoration they have toward President Bush is unholy .
The association they have with the Republican Party is unholy .
The admiration they have for the military is unholy .
The thirst they have for war is unholy .
The callous attitude they have toward killing foreigners is unholy .
The idolatry they manifest toward the state is unholy .
If you doubt the truth of what I am saying about the sad state of Christianity , then look no further than the support that a theocratic warmonger like Mike Huckabee received in primary elections earlier this year held all over the South in the so - called Bible Belt .
A church in my hometown of Pensacola , Florida , even had Huckabee in to preach on a Sunday evening during primary season .
And this time the primaries down South were n’t the usual case of Christians holding their noses and voting for what they perceived to be the lesser of two or more evils , for there was actually a principled conservative Christian on the ballot — Ron Paul .
Much of the Christian antagonism toward Dr. Paul was on account of his opposition to the war in Iraq and the larger war on terror .
Yet , Christians who chose Huckabee over Paul chose the greater evil that they hoped to avoid .
They themselves are evil , not because they rejected Ron Paul , but because they love war , the military , and the warfare state .
Huckabee not only supported the sending of more troops to their death in Iraq , he actually maintained that we should not withdraw from Iraq because “ we are winning . ”
If we are winning in Iraq when four thousand American soldiers are dead , thousands of physically and / or mentally disabled soldiers need a lifetime of care , a trillion dollars has already been spent , the morale and readiness of the military is at historic lows , the Guard and Reserve forces are decimated , military hardware and equipment are worn out , the reputation of America in the eyes of the world is at rock bottom , and new terrorists are being created faster than we can kill them , I hate to see what kind of condition we would be in if we started losing .
And then there is John McCain , whose foreign policy is based on a Beach Boys song .
Although he has been harshly criticized by many Christians for not being conservative enough , he is rarely if ever condemned for being the most radical warmonger of all the presidential candidates .
Christians may disagree with some of his proposals , but they generally consider him to be a decorated war hero instead of a dangerous mad bomber .
I have already heard Christians talking about holding their noses in the November election and voting for McCain so we do n’t get one of those evil Democrats in the White House , as if McCain were any less evil than any Democrat who has ever held or run for the office .
I have made some shocking statements about religious people , perhaps even some provocative and incendiary statements .
In fact , people that do n’t know anything about me might be inclined to believe that my remarks thus far have been an attack on Christianity .
To the contrary , I am a Bible - believing Christian , as conservative as they come .
Probably more conservative than many nominal Christians would feel comfortable with .
True , I have spoken or written negative things about every religion , sect , and Christian denomination — including my own — but the difference between me and Christian apologists for Bush , the Republican Party , the military , war , and the state is that I worship the God of the Bible , not Mars , the god of war .
Although I am not an ordained minister , I have preached in churches and other venues .
I have earned degrees in theology .
I have taught children in Sunday school and adults in Bible college .
I will put my conservative Christian credentials up against anyone .
I think I know Christianity and Christians as well as anyone .
So , please understand that it is not Christianity I am criticizing ; it is Christians who , by their persistent support for war , the warfare state , and the military , are giving Christianity a bad name .
The result of Christian support for war reminds me of a story in the Old Testament about two sons of the patriarch Jacob .
In order to avenge the rape of their sister by some foreigners , the sons of Jacob told their leader that if his people consented to be circumcised , then both groups of people could intermarry and the rapist could have their sister to wife .
However , after all the foreigners were circumcised , when they were sore , two sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , came and slew all the men who were incapacitated and spoiled their city .
When their father Jacob heard about this , he told his sons : “ Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land . ”
Christian warmongers have made Christians to stink among the non-Christian inhabitants of the United States .
After five years of this senseless war in Iraq , some of the war ’s greatest defenders continue to be Christians .
A poll conducted last year by Christianity Today magazine asked the question : “ Do evangelicals need a time of repentance for the Iraq war ? ”
A plurality of respondents answered in the negative , and agreed with the proposition that the war in Iraq was necessary and justified .
Sure , overall Christian support for the war has declined .
Unfortunately , however , it is generally not out of a principled opposition to war and the warfare state , but only because the war did n’t turn out as planned , the war is taking too long , the war has been mismanaged , the war is costing too much , or the war has resulted in too many dead and wounded American troops .
The morality of going to war in the first place , as well as the number of dead and wounded Iraqis , is of absolutely no concern to most Christian Americans .
Yet , every dead American solider is a hero .
What a beautiful word is that word “ hero ” ; the more hideous the death , the more beautiful the name it is necessary to find for it .
Christians have bought into a variety of American nationalism that has been called the myth of American exceptionalism .
This is the idea that the government of the United States is morally and politically superior to all other governments ; that America is a city on a hill — the redeemer nation , the Messiah nation , Rome on the Potomac , the “ hope of all mankind , ” as President Bush termed it ; that American values are the only true values ; that the United States is the indispensable nation responsible for the peace and prosperity of the world ; that the motives of the United States are always benevolent and paternalistic ; that to accept American values is to be on the side of God , but to resist them is to oppose God ; that other governments must conform to the policies of the U.S. government ; that other nations are potential enemies that threaten U.S. safety and security ; and that the United States is morally justified in imposing sanctions or launching military attacks against any of our enemies that refuse to conform to our dictates .
This is why U.S. foreign policy is aggressive , reckless , belligerent , and meddling .
This is why U.S. foreign policy results in discord , strife , hatred , and terrorism toward the United States .
This is why U.S. foreign policy excuses the mass murder of civilians in the Philippines , Germany , Japan , Korea , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , and Iraq as for the greater good .
This is why the fruits of U.S. foreign policy are the destabilization and overthrow of governments , the assassination of leaders , the destruction of industry and infrastructure , the backing of military coups , death squads , and drug traffickers , imperialism under the guise of humanitarianism , support for corrupt and tyrannical governments , brutal sanctions and embargoes , and the United States bribing and bullying itself around the world as the world ’s policeman , fireman , social worker , and busybody .
And because Americans are preoccupied with reconciling religious faith with national pride , they care little about the consequences of American foreign policy , preferring instead to view the world in Manichean terms of good ( us ) and evil ( them ) .
People who are non-Christian or non-religious and oppose the actions of the warfare state should be concerned about the Christian attitude toward war .
An overwhelming majority of Americans identify themselves as Christians .
The same can be said of the members of the U.S. military .
The percentage of congressman who identify their religion as Christianity is higher than that of the general population .
If Christians at all levels of society were to withdraw their support for the war in Iraq , the war on terror , and the military , the war in Iraq would end tomorrow , the war on terror would be suspended , and the military would no longer receive a steady supply of cannon fodder from churches and Christian colleges .
What a shame that non-Christians , including atheists , agnostics , infidels , pagans , and the irreligious , who oppose the genocide that the United States has unleashed in Iraq , have a moral code higher than that of many Christians .
Non-Christian Americans should know that Christian enthusiasm for war and the warfare state is a perversion of Christianity , an affront to the Saviour whom Christians worship as the Prince of Peace , a violation of Scripture , contrary to the whole tenor of the New Testament , and an unfortunate demonstration of the profound ignorance many Christians have of history and their own Bible .
God only knows how many non-Christians have been driven from Christianity because of Christian indifference toward or outright support of war .
The early Christians were not warmongers like so many Christians today .
They did not idolize the Caesars like some Christians idolize President Bush .
They did not make apologies for the Roman Empire like many Christians do for the U.S. Empire .
They did not venerate the institution of the military like most Christians do today .
They did not participate in the state ’s wars like too many Christians do today .
If there was anything at all advocated by the early Christians it was peace .
After all , they had some New Testament admonitions to go by :
Blessed are the peacemakers ( Matthew 5:9 )
Live peaceably with all men ( Romans 12:18 )
Follow peace with all men ( Hebrews 12:14 )
Aggression , violence , and bloodshed are contrary to the very nature of Christianity .
True , the Bible on several occasions likens a Christian to a soldier .
As soldiers , Christians are admonished to “ put on the whole armor of God . ”
The Apostle Paul , who himself said : “ I have fought a good fight , ” told a young minister to “ war a good warfare . ”
But the Christian soldier in the Bible fights against sin , the world , the flesh , and the devil .
He wears “ the breastplate of righteousness ” and “ the helmet of salvation . ”
The weapons of the Christian are not carnal : his shield is “ the shield of faith ” and his sword is “ the word of God . ”
The New Testament admonishes Christians to not avenge themselves , to do good to all men , and to not render evil for evil .
There is nothing in the New Testament from which to draw the conclusion that killing is somehow sanctified if it is done in the name of the state .
The Church Father Justin Martyr described the peaceful nature of the early Christians :
And we who had been filled with war and mutual slaughter and every wickedness , have each one — all the world over — changed the instruments of war , the swords into ploughs and the spears into farming instruments , and we cultivate piety , righteousness , love for men , faith , and the hope which is from the Father Himself through the Crucified One .
We who hated and slew one another , and because of differences in customs would not share a common hearth with those who were not of our tribe , now , after the appearance of Christ , have become sociable , and pray for our enemies , and try to persuade those who hate us unjustly , in order that they , living according to the good suggestions of Christ , may share our hope of obtaining the same reward from the God who is Master of all .
Unlike many Christians today who proudly serve in Caesar ’s army , the early Christians were critical of the Roman Empire and military service .
Instead of being willing to die for the emperor and his empire , Christians declared “ Jesus Is Lord ” in direct opposition to Roman imperial claims .
The Church Father Lactantius explained that the Romans believed that there is no other way to immortality than by leading armies , devastating foreign countries , destroying cities , overthrowing towns , and either slaughtering or enslaving free peoples .
Truly , the more men they have afflicted , despoiled , and slain , the more noble and renowned do they think themselves ; and , captured by the appearance of empty glory , they give the name of excellence to their crimes .
. . .
If any one has slain a single man , he is regarded as contaminated and wicked , nor do they think it right that he should be admitted to this earthly dwelling of the gods .
But he who has slaughtered endless thousands of men , deluged the fields with blood , and infected rivers with it , is admitted not only to a temple , but even to heaven .
Unfortunately , the nineteenth - century Quaker Jonathan Dymond similarly observed of Christians : “ They who are shocked at a single murder on the highway , hear with indifference of the slaughter of a thousand on the field .
They whom the idea of a single corpse would thrill with terror , contemplate that of heaps of human carcasses mangled by human hands , with frigid indifference . ”
The famed church historian Adolf von Harnack described the features of military life that would have presented great difficulty to Christians :
The shedding of blood on the battlefield , the use of torture in the law - courts , the passing of death - sentences by officers and the execution of them by common soldiers , the unconditional military oath , the all - pervading worship of the Emperor , the sacrifices in which all were expected in some way to participate , the average behaviour of soldiers in peace - time , and other idolatrous and offensive customs — all these would constitute in combination an exceedingly powerful deterrent against any Christian joining the army on his own initiative .
The aforementioned Lactantius describes Christians as “ those who are ignorant of wars , who preserve concord with all , who are friends even to their enemies , who love all men as brothers , who know how to curb anger and soften with quiet moderation every madness of the mind . ”
And then came just war theory .
This was the attempt by Augustine to reconcile Christian participation in warfare with the morality of New Testament Christianity by , among other things , distinguishing between soldiers ’ outwardly violent actions while waging war and their inwardly spiritual disposition .
In its essence , just war theory concerns the use of force : when force should be used and what kind of force is acceptable .
The timing of force relates to a country ’s justification for the initiation of war or military action ; the nature of force relates to how military activity is conducted once a country commits to use force .
The principle of the just war is actually many principles , all of which must be met for a war to be considered just .
I agree with Christian philosopher Robert Brimlow , who views just war theory as untenable because it is difficult to know with sufficient confidence whether all of its conditions have been met , because some of its tenets are impossible to realize , because the criteria of just war theory are too flexible , because it contradicts itself in that it sanctions the killing of innocents , which it at the same time prohibits , and because it used to justify rather than to prevent war .
Indeed , just war theory can be used effectively by all sides to justify all wars .
I would add that just war theory is not even based on Scripture .
It is , however , rooted in blind obedience to the state .
It is the state that decides to go to war , not the people , most of whom want nothing to do with war ; that is , until the state sufficiently propagandizes its citizens .
The state always claims that it is acting defensively , has the right intention , has the proper authority , is undertaking war as a last resort , has a high probability of success , and that a war will achieve good that is proportionally greater than the damage to life , limb , and property that it will cause .
Just war theory merely allowed Christians to make peace with war .
Then , of course , came the Crusades , followed by the continual wars among European Christians .
The ultimate picture of the folly of war is the bloodbath perpetrated by the Christian nations in World War I .
I have heard a lot lately about how most terrorists are Muslims , about how Islam is a violent religion , and about how Muslims are willing to kill in the name of their religion .
That may all be true , but Christians who live in glass houses should be careful about throwing stones at Muslims .
Yes , I am familiar with the tenets of the Muslim religion .
And when I mentioned that I had said negative things about every religion I certainly meant to include Islam .
But it was Christians who expelled the Jews from Spain in the fifteenth century , not Muslims .
It was Christians who exploited and killed Africans by the millions in the Congo Free State in the late nineteenth century .
It was Christians — Christian Americans — who slaughtered thousands of Filipinos in the so - called Philippine Insurrection at the turn of the twentieth century after we “ liberated ” them from Spain .
And then , from 1914 to 1918 , in battle after senseless battle , Christian soldiers in World War I shot , bombed , torpedoed , burned , gassed , bayoneted , and starved each other and civilians until twenty million of them were wounded and another twenty million lay dead .
And what did the Christians at home in the United States do and say before and during World War I ?
Their conduct was shameful .
Challenged with the problem of arousing the patriotic spirit of the nation , government leaders must convince the populace of the absolute necessity of war , the utter wickedness of the enemy , and the supreme justness of the country ’s cause .
To these ends the churches became willing servants of the state .
They contributed to wartime hysteria and propaganda .
Christianity became an adjunct to nationalism .
Loyalty to one ’s country became the highest expression of the Christ - like life .
Love of country exceeded love of mankind .
God and country became synonymous .
To give one ’s life for his country and its flag was to give it for God and his Kingdom .
As Christ died to make men holy , so U.S. soldiers died to make men free .
There was no difference between the pronouncements of patriotic organizations , government propaganda bureaus , and the edicts of Christian leaders .
Religious organizations and nationalistic groups vied with each other in their flowery patriotic declarations .
America ’s participation in the war was viewed as a missionary enterprise .
It is a blot on Christianity that many of the religious dissenters from the drive for war were unorthodox Christians — socialists , Unitarians , Universalists , Adventists , and Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
Several members of this latter sect were sentenced to prison for circulating a book by their late leader with this particularly objectionable passage : Nowhere in the New Testament is patriotism ( a narrowly minded hatred of other peoples ) encouraged .
Everywhere and always murder in its every form is forbidden .
And yet under the guise of patriotism civil governments of the earth demand of peace - loving men the sacrifice of themselves and their loved ones and the butchery of their fellows , and hail it as a duty demanded by the laws of heaven .
What a shame that this statement was not on the lips of every so - called orthodox Christian .
Orthodox clergymen in the pulpit and their followers in the pew both succumbed to war psychology and societal pressure just as most other citizens .
One Baptist pastor said that he looked “ upon the enlistment of an American solider ” as he did “ on the departure of a missionary for Burma . ”
A Presbyterian minister likewise remarked : “ Every dollar and every service given to Uncle Sam for his army is a gift to missions . ”
The dean of Oberlin College , who was also a Congregational minister , maintained that “ the Christian soldier in friendship wounds the enemy .
In friendship he kills the enemy . ” A Methodist preacher from Pittsburgh declared that he “ would have gone over the top with other Americans . ”
“ I would have driven my bayonet into the throat or the eye or the stomach of the Huns without the slightest hesitation , ” he said , “ and my conscience would not have bothered me in the least . ”
An Episcopal minister wrote in the Atlantic Monthly that “ the complete representative of the American Church in France is the United States Army overseas . ”
Leaders in the Lutheran and Catholic churches had no trouble expressing their patriotism by a steadfast allegiance to the government .
One of the most notable Christian servants of the state during World War I was Ralph McKim , the rector of the Church of the Epiphany in Washington D.C. McKim made claims for Germany that were never ascribed to Hitler : “ Germany seeks to control the whole world .
Her ambition is to dominate mankind .
Her aim is to bring all peoples and nations under the Hohenzollerns . ”
To McKim , the conflict in Europe was a “ crusade ” and a “ holy war . ”
Because he believed that civilization was at stake , “ and humanity — and Christianity itself , ” McKim maintained : “ It is God who has summoned us to this war .
It is His war we are fighting . ”
Soldiers at the front were “ marching to Calvary ” to meet “ the armies of Antichrist . ”
Other Christian ministers during World War I advocated restraints on anti-war speech and writing , the suppression of German - language newspapers , the purchase of war bonds , spying on American citizens , the death penalty for those who obstructed recruiting , harsh treatment of conscientious objectors , absolute loyalty to the government , hatred of the German people , torture of the German Kaiser , a one hundred - year boycott of German goods , and the mass sterilization of soldiers in Germany .
Para - church organizations were enlisted by the state as well .
The YMCA was recruited to check morals , promote morale , and make men better fighters physically .
Its secretaries exhibited the Bible as the greatest of all war books , and presented Jesus as a warrior thrusting his bayonet through a Hun in battle as example to others .
Even the American Peace Society , whose members consisted largely of Christians , came to support the war .
Religious journals donated advertising space for the sale of war bonds .
Near the war ’s end , Christian Work magazine ran a full - page ad that read at the top of the page : “ Kill the Hun , Kill his Hope . ”
In the middle of the page was a picture of a bayonet and a $ 100 liberty bond .
Underneath this was the reminder : “ Bayonet and Bond — both Kill !
One Kills the Hun , the Other Kills his Hope . Buy U.S. Government Bonds . ”
We hear much of the same now regarding the Iraq War , and without the massive government propaganda campaign that was undertaken during World War I . I guess Christians have gotten dumber .
When Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in March of 2003 with the announcement that our cause was just , Christians lined up in droves to support their president .
They enlisted in the military .
They put “ W ” stickers and yellow ribbons on their cars .
They implored us in church to pray for the troops .
They made heroes out of every dead American soldier .
They began reciting their patriotic sloganeering , their God-and - country rhetoric , and their “ obey the powers that be ” mantra .
They dusted off their books on just war theory .
They denounced Christian opponents of the war as liberals , pacifists , traitors , and Quakers , usually preceded by the adjectives unpatriotic and anti-American .
Why ?
Why have so many religious people gotten it so wrong ?
As I have explained in many of my articles on Christianity and war over the years , there are many reasons : thinking that the war in Iraq was in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks , believing that Saddam Hussein was another Hitler , supposing that Iraq was a threat to the United States , seeing the war in Iraq as a modern - day crusade against Islam , assuming that the United States needed to protect Israel from Iraq , viewing Bush as a messiah figure , equating the Republican Party with the party of God , blindly following the conservative movement , deeming the state to be a divine institution instead of a lying , stealing , and killing machine , failing to separate the divine sanction of war against the enemies of God in the Old Testament from the New Testament ethic that taught otherwise , having a profound ignorance of history and primitive Christianity , reading too much into the mention of soldiers in the New Testament , adopting the mindset that brute force is barbarism when individuals use it , but honorable when nations are guilty of it , possessing a warped “ God and Country ” complex , holding a “ my country right or wrong ” attitude , and as I mentioned previously , accepting without reservation the myth of American exceptionalism .
But if I had to single out one thing that has caused Christians to be so accepting of war and the warfare state it would have to be the military .
Americans love the military , and American Christians are no exception .
It does n’t seem to matter the reason for each war or intrusion into the affairs of another country .
It does n’t seem to matter how long U.S. troops remain after the initial intervention .
It does n’t seem to matter how many foreign civilians are killed or injured .
It does n’t seem to matter how many billions of dollars are spent by the military .
It does n’t even seem to matter what the troops are actually doing —
Americans generally believe in supporting the troops no matter what .
Social activist Lee Griffith remarks in his book The War on Terrorism and the Terror of God : Currently , public support for military actions is virtually instinctive , especially so if troops have already been placed in harm ’s way .
It is claimed that , to question the endeavor , to express less than enthusiastic support is to show callous disregard for the lives of the young women and men who face enemy bullets on our behalf .
As if by magic , the charge of disregard for life is leveled against those who oppose placing troops on the battlefield while the potentates who placed them there are held immune .
Americans are repulsed by the serial killer who , to satisfy the basest of desires , dismembers his victims ; but revere the bomber pilot in the stratosphere who , flying above the clouds , never hears the screams of his victims or sees the flesh torn from their bones .
Killing women and children at a distance of five feet is viewed as an atrocity , but at more than five thousand feet it is a heroic act .
Christians of all branches and denominations have a love affair with the military .
This alliance includes Catholic just - war theorists , evangelicals in and out of the military , Red-State Christian fascists , Reich - wing Christian nationalists , progressive Christians who oppose the war in Iraq , theocon Values Voters , Christians who are not part of the Religious Right , and even conservative Christians who oppose an aggressive , interventionist foreign policy .
The superstitious reverence that many Christians have for the military in some cases borders on a fetish .
Criticism of the military is strictly verboten .
To question the military in any way — its size , its budget , its efficiency , its bureaucracy , its contractors , its weaponry , its mission , its effectiveness , its foreign interventions — is to question America itself .
One can condemn the size of government , but never the size of the military .
One can criticize federal spending , but never military spending .
One can denounce government bureaucrats , but never military brass .
One can deprecate the welfare state , but never the warfare state .
One can expose government abuses , but never military abuses .
One can label domestic policy as socialistic , but never foreign policy as imperialistic .
I am often accused of being anti-military , of not appreciating the sacrifices that have been made so that I can have the freedom to speak English , vote , write articles critical of the military , and express my negative opinions about U.S. foreign policy .
But if the military were actually engaged in defending the United States , securing the borders , guarding the shores , patrolling the coasts , and protecting the skies then I would be as pro-military as the chairman of the joint chiefs .
What is the purpose of the military ?
I think it is beyond dispute that the purpose of any country having a military is defense of the country against attack or invasion , not to “ rid the world of evil , ” as Bush proclaimed from the pulpit of the National Cathedral a few days after the 9/11 attacks .
The U.S. military should be engaged exclusively in defending the United States , not defending other countries , and certainly not attacking them .
It is U.S. borders that should be secured .
It is U.S. shores that should be guarded .
It is U.S. coasts that should be patrolled .
It is U.S. skies where no -fly zones should be enforced .
But because U.S. foreign policy is aggressive , reckless , belligerent , and meddling ; because it has a history of hegemony , nation building , regime change , and jingoism ; because it is the story of interventionism , imperialism , and empire ; because it results in discord , strife , hatred , and terrorism toward the United States : the U.S. military — the enforcer of U.S. foreign policy — is a force for evil in the world .
Because America ’s military heritage is not one of how our troops have repelled invaders , kept us safe from attack , or defended our freedoms , it is not honorable to serve in the military .
This is a bitter pill to swallow , especially for soldiers who fought for a lie and the families of soldiers who died for a lie .
America ’s military heritage is unfortunately one of bombs and bullets , death and destruction , intervention and invasion , and occupation and oppression .
The purpose of the military has been perverted beyond all recognition .
The military spreads democracy by bombs , bayonets , and bullets .
The military garrisons the planet with troops and bases .
The military is responsible for the network of brothels around the world to service U.S. troops who have no business being away from home .
Military personnel serve simultaneously as policemen , firemen , scientists , social workers , and bullies with the world as their precinct , forest , laboratory , client , and playground .
What do providing disaster relief , dispensing humanitarian aid , supplying peacekeepers , enforcing UN resolutions , and spreading goodwill have to do with defending the country against attack ?
How do launching preemptive strikes , changing regimes , enforcing no - fly zones , stationing troops in other countries , and garrisoning the planet with bases have anything to do with defending the country against invasion ?
Here is the new role envisioned for the army by Defense Secretary Robert Gates : “ Army soldiers can expect to be tasked with reviving public services , rebuilding infrastructure and promoting good governance .
All these so - called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking , planning , and strategy — where they must stay . ”
Combat veterans , regardless of how they feel about the war in Iraq and U.S. foreign policy , should be outraged at this new vision for the Army .
Is the Army explaining its new vision to young people who walk into Army recruiting centers ?
And with the tremendous financial incentives being offered to enlist in the military today , do young people even care what the vision of the military is or are they blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes ?
But regardless of how the purpose of the military has been perverted beyond all recognition , the troops are still responsible for their actions .
After all , it is the troops that are doing the actual fighting in Iraq right now — not Bush , not Cheney , not Gates , not Rice .
As much as I have nothing but contempt for the architects of the war , the president who instigated the war , the neocons who welcomed the war , the Congressmen who funded the war , and the conservatives who supported the war , it is U.S. soldiers who are dropping the bombs , firing the mortars , throwing the grenades , launching the missiles , and shooting the bullets .
It is U.S. soldiers who have paved the way for the rampant sectarian violence .
It is U.S. soldiers who have unleashed brutality , murder , genocide , death , and destruction in Iraq .
I was told by one of my critics that he agreed with me on the point of not fighting illegal and unjust wars , but that doing so was not the fault of the soldiers .
Well then , whose fault is it ?
No one is doing the fighting except the soldiers .
It does n’t matter who told them to bomb , maim , and kill or what the reason is that they were told to do these things .
If the troops stop fighting , the war will grind to a halt .
I do n’t support the troops .
I did n’t support them in the last war , I do n’t support them in this war , and I wo n’t support them in the next war .
It is the troops that are ultimately responsible for prosecuting this senseless and immoral war .
Yet , U.S. forces are generally not held responsible for any of their actions by their superiors , the government , or the general public unless they do something particularly evil that becomes an embarrassment .
Most people say the troops are not responsible because they ’re just following orders .
No soldier is responsible for the death and destruction he inflicts as long as it is state - sanctioned death and destruction .
Many evangelical Christians agree , and join in this chorus of statolatry with their “ obey the powers that be ” mantra .
Even many of those who maintain that Bush and Cheney are war criminals are hesitant to condemn the individual soldier .
I am not .
First of all , the last time I looked in my Bible , I got the strong impression that it was only God who should be obeyed 100 percent of the time without question .
Second , what would the attitude toward the soldier be if he were ordered to attack in some way American citizens under the guise of maintaining order ?
Is that an order we want U.S. soldiers to obey ?
Third , why would we want U.S. soldiers to follow orders to bomb , maim , kill and otherwise attack foreigners around the world that have never lifted a finger against the United States ?
Fourth , soldiers in other countries are not accorded this luxury .
Unlike the soldiers of any other country , U.S. soldiers are always viewed by Americans as liberators and peacekeepers , never invaders and occupiers .
We would we get extremely upset at foreign soldiers if they killed Americans even if they were just following orders .
No supporter of the war in Iraq who uses the “ obeying orders ” defense would allow a German officer at the Nuremberg Trials to get away with saying that he was just obeying Hitler ’s orders .
And fifth , if the U.S. government told someone to kill his mother , any American would be outraged if he under any circumstances went and did it .
But then if the government tells someone to put on a uniform and go kill some Iraqi ’s mother , the typical American puts a yellow ribbon on his car and says that we should support the troops .
But why should the response be any different ?
Why should morality be put off just because a uniform is put on ?
Being told to clean or paint a piece of equipment is one thing ; being told to bomb or shoot a person is another .
But , it is objected , even if some commands are questionable , U.S. military effectiveness would be greatly diminished if the troops did n’t obey orders .
Let ’s hope so .
How many Vietnamese and Laotians and Cambodians would be alive today if the U.S. military had been rendered impotent ?
We have heard a lot lately about how the United States may need to confront Iran militarily .
First it was that the Iranian president was the reincarnation of Hitler , then it was Iran ’s ambition to build a nuclear bomb , and now it is Iran ’s arming of Iraqi insurgents .
These are all bogus threats , of course , but when has that ever prevented the United States from going to war ?
Listen , every act of American military intervention in some other country was made possible because the troops blindly followed the orders of their superiors .
If they had refused to do anything that was not related to actually defending the country , then there would not have been any overseas deployments , preemptive strikes , land mines buried , bombs dropped , missiles launched , torture under the guise of interrogation , and no meddling in other countries .
The result of this would have been not only less anti-American sentiment , but fewer terrorists , fewer dollars wasted , fewer dead foreigners , and fewer dead American soldiers .
Now , if the purpose of the U.S. military has been perverted beyond all recognition ; if the military spends more time securing the borders , guarding the shores , patrolling the coasts , and protecting the skies of other countries than it does in defense of the United States ; if the military is engaged in sending its soldiers thousands of miles away to kill people and destroy their property after “ liberating ” them from their ruler ; if U.S. foreign policy results in our military being the greatest force for evil in the world ; then why in God ’s name would a Christian join the military and help the state carry out its evil deeds ?
Why would a pastor implore his congregation to pray for the troops ?
Why would a church display a yellow ribbon that says “ we support our troops ” ?
There were 181,000 people who joined the military last year .
Certainly , the majority of them would designate their religion as Christianity .
Many Christians will not allow their children to set foot in a public school , but then encourage them , or at least not discourage them , to join the U.S. military and not only face government propaganda and immorality on a much greater scale , but participate in bringing death and destruction to the latest enemy , not of the American people , but of the U.S. government .
There is universal agreement among Christians that no Christian could in good conscience work as a pimp , a prostitute , an abortionist , a drug dealer , or an exotic dancer .
Adherents of other religions and atheists would also generally select more wholesome occupations .
For a Christian to sell himself to the highest bidder as a contract killer would be considered a very immoral thing to do , but if the same Christian serves as a killer for hire for the U.S. government he is held in high esteem .
I know I have been rather blunt , but the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy was even more direct : “ Armies will first diminish , and then disappear , only when public opinion brands with contempt those who , whether from fear , or for advantage , sell their liberty and enter the ranks of those murderers , called soldiers . ”
Because the war in Iraq is immoral and unjust , and because there is no draft , Christians who join the military are willing accomplices to murder .
Since when is murder sanctified if it is carried out by state order , in a state uniform , and with a state - issued weapon ?
Christians not in the military are some of the greatest supporters of the military .
Many Christians have exchanged biblical Christianity for imperial Christianity .
Now , I realize that few Christians subscribe to the deviant Christianity espoused by conservative columnist Ann Coulter , who maintained after the 9/11 attacks that “ we should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity . ”
But some of the same Christians who never hesitate to criticize the Catholic Church still view the war in Iraq as a modern - day crusade against Muslims .
I ’ve got some bad news for them :
The Lord never sanctioned any crusade of Christians against any religion .
The God of the Bible never called , commanded , or encouraged any Christian to kill , make apologies for the killing of , or excuse the killing of any adherent to a false religion .
Dispensationalists who are quick to point out the distinctions between Israel and the Church often invoke the Jewish wars of the Old Testament against the heathen as a justification for the actions of the U.S. military .
Although God sponsored these wars , and used the Jewish nation to conduct them , it does not follow that God sponsors American wars or that America is God ’s chosen nation .
The last time I checked , George Bush was not God , America was not the nation of Israel , and the U.S. Army was not the Lord ’s army .
It is not just military chaplains asking God to bless troops on their missions of death and destruction who are taking God ’s name in vain .
Anyone using
God ’s holy name to justify the state ’s wars and military interventions is taking his name in vain .
Indeed , as the aforementioned Lee Griffith has said : “ The claim of divine sanction for violence is among the crudest forms of blasphemy . ”
This love affair that Christians have with the military is an illicit affair .
The unholy alliance between Christianity and the military must be broken .
Christians should renounce the militarism of society .
They should stop regarding the state ’s acts of aggression as benevolent .
They should stop calling evil good and good evil .
They should stop presuming divine support for U.S. military interventions .
They should vigorously dissent the next time some politician says there is some great evil in the world that must be stamped out by the U.S. military .
Because just war theory merely allows Christians to make peace with war , they should reject it just as they would any theory of just piracy or just terrorism or just murder .
Above all , they should stay out of the military .
But what should a Christian soldier do ?
Resign , be a conscientious objector , or at the least follow John the Baptist ’s rules for soldiers , as given in the Gospel of Luke : “ Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages . ”
There is only one path to take when a Christian in the military is faced with an order to kill , bomb , or destroy someone or something halfway around the world that he has never met or seen , and is no real threat to him , his family , or his country : “ We ought to obey God rather than men ” ( Acts 5:29 ) .
Christian colleges should discontinue all ROTC programs , ban military recruiters from all their campuses , and discourage their students from enlisting in the military .
Likewise , Christian pastors and youth ministers should do everything in their power to keep their young people out of the military .
Churches should treat members of the military no different than they treat employees of Wal - Mart or McDonalds .
They should stop this nonsense of asking God to bless the troops .
Should we pray that God blesses the troops while they drop their bombs , throw their grenades , launch their missiles , fire their mortars , and shoot their bullets ?
Is beseeching God to protect the troops as they shoot , bomb , maim , mine , destroy , “ interrogate , ” and kill to carry out an evil foreign policy consistent with the Christianity in the New Testament ?
Yes , we should pray for the troops .
We should pray that the troops come home .
We should pray that no more of their blood is shed on foreign soil in some senseless war .
But we should also pray that they stop bringing death and destruction to foreigners .
And while we ’re at it , we should pray that young , impressionable students are not ensnared by military recruiters .
We should likewise pray that churches stop supplying cannon fodder to the military .
The problem with the U.S. military is , of course , U.S. foreign policy .
U.S. foreign policy is not only aggressive , reckless , belligerent , and meddling , it is also extremely arrogant .
The United States would never tolerate another country engaging in an American - style foreign policy .
Now , I think I loathe President Bush as much as any man in this room , and perhaps even more so because , as a Bible - believing Christian , I oppose his faith - based socialism , his misuse of Scripture and religion , and his doctrinal deviations from orthodox Christianity , but what if another country said that the U.S. government was corrupt and oppressive and needed a regime change and then came over here and overthrew our government ?
I would be outraged , as would every American .
The United States has troops in about 150 countries .
Would it be okay if each of these countries sent troops to the United States ?
If not , then why not ?
Would it be okay if each of the countries the United States has a military base in decided to build a base in the United States ?
Why not ?
Why the double standard ?
It is the height of arrogance to insist that the United States alone has the right to garrison the planet with bases , station troops wherever it wants , police the world , and intervene in the affairs of other countries .
It is high time for Christians who still defend the state , its leaders , its military , and its wars to wake up and open their eyes and recognize some cold , hard facts :
The United States has become a rogue state , a pariah nation , an evil empire .
The United States ’ military is the greatest force for evil in the world .
The United States is the arms dealer to the world .
The United States is not the world ’s policeman .
The United States cannot redeem the world through violence .
The United States is not the God-anointed protector of Israel that enjoys a special relationship with God .
The United States government is the greatest threat to American life , liberty , and property — not the leaders or the military or the people of Iraq , Iran , Syria , China , Russia , or Venezuela .
Our republic is crumbling .
It is imperative that we return to the noninterventionist foreign policy of the Founders .
Christians , of all people , should be leading the way .

Vatican Says Absolutely No Female Priests Posted by Pile ( 8977 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Sociology ]
The Catholic Church reiterated its love for women 's rights by making it quite clear : no women priests -- they will be excommunicated , along with anyone who ordains them .
The Vatican issued its most explicit decree so far against the ordination of female priests on Thursday , punishing them and the bishops who try to ordain them with automatic excommunication .
The decree was written by the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and published in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano , giving it immediate effect .
A Vatican spokesman said the decree made the church 's existing ban on female priests more explicit by clarifying that excommunication would follow all such ordinations .
Excommunication forbids those affected from receiving the sacraments or sharing in acts of public worship .
Rev. Tom Reese , a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University , said he thought the decree was meant to send a warning to the growing number of Catholics who favor admitting women to the priesthood .
" I think the reason they 're doing this is that they 've realized there is more and more support among Catholics for ordaining women , and they want to make clear that this is a no - no , " Reese said .

Dont laugh at excommunication .
Ever since the Vatican eliminated the limbo there no where to go after you die and you just extend in line waiting for issue to be solved for ever .

Yet somehow , some statements made by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard , even those having nothing to do with the religion , have actually come into question by critics who often refer to them as " exaggerated " and " laugh out loud retarded . "
Some things are self - evident : Murder is wrong , kindness is good and 75 million years ago , a ruler of a Galactic Confederacy rounded up billions of his own citizens and shipped them to Earth ( then called Teegeeack ) , tied them to volcanoes and used hydrogen bombs to blow up their bodies .
Adultery is bad .
Lying is wrong .
5 On His Native American Upbringing ...

He Said :
It seems L. Ron really , and we mean really wanted to make it clear that he had some extraordinary credentials when it came to his understanding of spirituality .
And what do most of us require in a spiritual leader ?
Nothing less than full membership in a Native - American tribe .
Lucky for L. Ron , the Blackfoot Indian tribe of Montana recruited him and made him a blood brother in a really cool tribal ceremony that probably featured a whole lot of feathers and peace pipes and dancing and whatnot .
And , oh yeah , that was when he was just four years old .
Those injuns must have really recognized great perception and timeless wisdom in little L. Ron when he was n't crapping his pants .

And then , as if his followers would n't be crapping their pants in excitement over his Blackfeet Indian connections , L. Ron also insists that he spent his adolescence sitting at the feet of shamans of the Orient , eventually applying their ageless wisdom to produce -- TA - DA !-- Scientology .
But Actually :
L. Ron lived in Helena , Montana when he was four .
The nearest Blackfoot Reservation was over 100 miles away .
Still , he could have made the trek for the blood brother ceremony ... if the Blackfoot tribe actually conducted that sort of ritual .
But oops , they did n't .
As our friends at Wikipedia point out :

" The white Blackfeet historian Hugh Dempsey has commented that the act of blood brotherhood was ' never done among the Blackfeet , ' and Blackfeet Nation officials have disavowed attempts to ' reestablish ' Hubbard as a ' blood brother ' of the Blackfeet . "
Probably just an innocent misunderstanding .
But what about his travels to Asia , you ask ?
There is some authenticity to Hubbard 's story .
His father , Harry Hubbard , was actually stationed in Guam at the US Naval Base , so , yeah , young Hubbard did have the opportunity to spend some time in Asia .
What did Hubbard learn from the wise men there ?
From his actual diary :

" They smell of all the baths they didnt take .
The trouble with China is , there are too many chinks here . "
A senior citizen drove his brand new BMW Z4 convertible out of the car saleroom .
Taking off down the motorway , he floored it to 90 mph , enjoying the wind blowing through what little hair he had left .
' Amazing ! ' he thought as he flew down the M40 , enjoying pushing the pedal to the metal even more .
Looking in his rear view mirror , he saw a police car behind him , blue lights flashing and siren blaring . '
I can get away from him - no problem ! ' thought the elderly gent as he floored it to 110 mph , then 120 , then 130 mph .
Suddenly , he thought , ' What on earth am I doing ?
I 'm too old for this nonsense ! '
So he pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the police car to catch up with him .
Pulling in behind him , the police officer walked up to the driver 's side of the BMW , looked at his watch and said , ' Sir , my shift ends in 10 minutes .
Today is Friday and I 'm taking off for the weekend .
If you can give me a reason why you were speeding that I 've never heard before , I 'll let you go . '
The man looked very seriously at the policeman and replied , ' Years ago , my wife ran off with a policeman .
I thought you were bringing her back . '
' Have a good day , Sir , ' said the policeman .
Recycling as an everyday practice has become more and more common these days .
But what about all those gadgets you accumulate ?
What happens to them ?
There are many options out there , but for most , they involve more cost , effort , and time then our busy schedules or motivation will allow .
Sure , there are some newer options such as Second Rotation , the company I profiled in January that quotes you a value for your product based on the condition you claim it ’s in , then they inspect it , and either give you that amount , or a different agreed upon one .
But even there , with the free shipping and the possibility of getting cash rather then spending it to recycle , it ’s based on current market value , a wildly fluctuating amount , as the new half price twice the speed iPhone exemplifies .
What if you could guarantee exactly how much you ’d get , based on how long you ’ve owned it , at the time of purchase ?
This is now a reality , via the company Tech Forward .
You can buy a product at any store you like , then purchase their Guaranteed Buyback service , which covers a wide range of electronics , from MP3 players to desktop computers .
Who would benefit from this service ?
Anybody , really , but here are some examples :
You are going to be in a 2 year certificate program , and know you ’ll need a laptop primarily for that , you can now do it , knowing what you ’ll have coming back to you when you sell it .
Or perhaps you are someone who is a fiend for the latest gear or worried about what you ’re about to buy becoming outdated ( iPod Touch , before the recently announced half price iPhone ) Tech Forward ’s plan allows you to buy without worry .
The end buyer , who has a chance to get a quality piece of electronics that they can be assured is of good quality .
The planet , with a reduced load of toxics from disposed of electronics .
And the kicker ?
The quoted values are only for products in what they consider “ good ” condition !
As in if it ’s what they consider excellent condition , you can get 15 % more then you signed up for .
What an incentive to take great care of your electronics .
So , given the fickle nature of this industry , what happens to these electronics ?
Tech Forward first work to get it sold , which I should think is fairly easy , given that not everybody needs / wants the absolute latest thing , and would be glad to get a well taken care of older device .
What if they ca n’t sell it ?
Tech Forward will , “ recycle , in an environmentally - friendly way , any item that can not be resold . ”
I ’d prefer if they said how , with who , and where , but that ’s something you can ask them about if it matters to you .
But there ’s one problem with TechForward .
No phones allowed .
What to do ?
For you , FlipSwap is a great new option that goes beyond what Second Rotation offers .
They have partnered with a number of electronics retailers , so that you can go into a shop , have them analyze the phone , and get instant credit , to be used in buying a new one .
And FlipSwap is n’t just for single phone returns .
They work with cell phone businesses that could perhaps have 1000s of phones in storage .
And with both , they do n’t charge shipping .
From their site , it appears they are quite conscientious with recycling , should it need to happen .
If it ’s found that the phone is n’t functional or sellable , FlipSwap , in addition to recycling , will plant a tree .
And internally as a company , they “ closely monitor our consumption of resources and continually strive to reduce waste . ”
Readers :
What are other ways you ’ve found to responsibly and easily reuse or recycle products ?
Have you used either of the above services ?

Holy crap– somebody just went and TORE MY FREAKING USB CABLE IN HALF while it was still attached to my laptop !!!
No– wait– sorry .
That ’s just my USB drive .
My bad .
Never mind .
( And after the jump , how to make your own . )
It ’s no secret that there are a lot of strange USB devices out there , particularly flash drives .
Not a comprehensive list , but we ’ve sure seen Lego , twigs , action figures , bowling balls , sushi , anatomical parts , transparent drives , erasers , cassette tapes and on and on and on .
Despite all that , the picture above is a little surprising – because yes , it ’s a working USB flash drive .
Here , we give the step by step walk through of how to make your own .
This is a KingMax 1 GB USB flash drive , one of the smaller varieties out there .
I got it on eBay for about $ 10 and there seem to be plenty more available .
Above , you can see it in between my fingers and in my computer for scale .
The gold pads are just printed pads on a tiny circuit board .
The plastic cover is attached only weakly , by a bit of silicone adhesive , and peels off fairly easily to expose the bare printed circuit board of the flash drive .
Not too much to it , really .
Next we need a victim USB cable .
I started with this new $ 1.50 USB “ A - B ” cable .
Looking at the end that we ’ll be cutting up , you might notice a neat injection molding seam that runs around the edge .
Using a sharp hobby knife , cut neatly along that seam .
Cutting there actually provides some camouflage for you :
Since we expect there to be a seam there , it ’s very hard to notice an additional cut as well .
If you really want your seams to be invisible , you might want to use a black USB cable .
Cut deeply enough that you actually cut through to the metal shell underneath the rubber , at which point you can start to peel back the rubber parts .
The metal shell underneath the rubber overmolding consists of two of pieces of thin steel that are stamped and folded into place .
They are held together by some tabs and slots – use a small screwdriver to defeat the tabs and you can pull the flap the “ lid ” piece , so that you can now get at the inside of the metal shell .
With the one piece of the metal shell removed , you have access to the middle parts of the shell where the original USB wires and plastic and metal connections are located .
Cut them away with your choice of tools .
I found that the hobby knife worked well enough to sever the wires , at which point the remaining plastic parts could be removed pretty easily .
What ’s left is just the metal shell– ready for us to put our own circuit board in .
Now we can start to test - fit the bare - board USB drive into the metal shell .
Seems to fit okay .
Still need to fix it in place , though .
One other final detail to take care of :
The back side , where the circuit board will be resting , has some metal parts that the back side of the circuit board will be touching – so we need an insulator there .
I had an old piece of clear blue heat - shrink tubing that happened to fit well , but a piece of electrical tape would have done the job too .
Once that was added , it all looked safe and still fit together .
To bond everything together and fill all the extra space inside the USB cable end , I use gel - style 5 minute epoxy .
Fortunately , five minutes gives you enough time to apply the glue , place the flash drive in place , and put the rubber molded housing back on .
Hold the connector firmly – paying attention to the seams for alignment– until the epoxy cures , about five more minutes .
Last step :
Cut the cable as desired .
A jagged cut looks different than a clean cut– take your pick .
So that ’s it– how to make your own cut - off usb cable flash drive .

Monday Isaac Newton blogging : A little light reading , Principia edition .
Update : See correction below .**
To introduce myself to the Cosmic Variance community ( at Sean ’s very kind invitation ) , let me just admit up front that I am a glutton for punishment .
Exhibit A : last year I read the Principia for pleasure . *
That ’s not exactly right– it is more accurate to say that in the context of writing a book on Isaac Newton ’s role as currency cop and death penalty prosecutor , I found myself reading the Principia as literature rather than the series of proofs it appears to be .
Just like John Locke , who had to ask Christiaan Huygens if he could take the mathematical demonstrations on faith ( Huygens said he could ) , I read to see what larger argument Newton was making about the ways human beings could now make sense of material experience .
( This is , by the way , the only connection I can imagine that Locke and I share . )
What I got out of the exercise , more than anything else , was a reminder of how something we now mostly take for granted is in fact truly extraordinary : taken all in all , it seems genuinely remarkable that cosmology exists at all as a quantitative , empirical science .
That is : it is not obvious – or at least it was n’t , all that long ago , that it would ever be possible to treat the universe as a whole as an object of study – especially given our very constrained vantage point from within that which we want to examine .
Most accounts of the story of modern cosmology more or less unconsciously downplay the strangeness of the claim that we can in fact make sense of the universe as a whole .
They begin – mine did -- with Einstein and the 1917 paper " Cosmological Considerations in the General Theory of Relativity , ( to be found in English translation here . )
Cosmology in this telling becomes more or less an inevitable extension of a recent advance in theoretical physics ; the change in worldview precedes this extension of the apparatus of general relativity into a new calculation .
I recant : though I certainly wrote my version of this basic tale , reading Newton has reminded me of the much more radical change in the understanding of what it is possible to think about that had to precede all that cosmology ( among much else ) has achieved .
It certainly was not clear that the universe as a whole was subject to natural philosophical scrutiny in 1684 , the year of Edmond Halley ’s fortunate visit to Trinity College , Cambridge , and his more - or - less innocent question about the curve traced by a planet , assuming " the force of attraction towards the sun to be reciprocal to the square of their distance from it ?
[ strike ] that would produce an elliptical planetary orbit with the sun at one focus . [ / strike ]
An ellipse [ strike ] inverse square relationship [ / strike ] , Newton told Halley .
How did he know ?
Why – he had calculated it .
By 1686 , Newton had extended and revised his off - the - cuff answer into the first two books of Principia , both titled " The Motion of Bodies . "
These pursued the implications of his three laws of motion through every circumstance Newton could imagine , culminating in his final demolition of Cartesian vortex physics .
But even though he had worked through a significant amount of mathematical reasoning developing the consequences of his inverse square law of gravitation , he left the ultimate demonstration of the power of these ideas for book three .
Books one and two had been " strictly mathematical , " Newton wrote .
If there were any meat and meaning to his ideas , though , he must " exhibit the system of the world from these same principles . "
To make his ambitions absolutely clear Newton used the same phrase for the title of book three .
There his readers would discover " The System of the World . "
This is where the literary structure of the work really comes into play , in my view .
Through book three , Newton takes his audience through a carefully constructed tour of all the places within the grasp of his new physics .
It begins with an analysis of the moons of Jupiter , demonstrating that inverse square relationships govern those motions .
He went on , to show how the interaction between Jupiter and Saturn would pull each out of a perfect elliptical orbit ; the real world , he says here , is messier than a geometer ’s dream .
He worked on problems of the moon ’s motion , of the issues raised by the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere , and then , in what could have been a reasonable resting point for the book as a whole , he brought his laws of motion and gravity literally down to earth , with his famous analysis of the way the moon and the sun influence the tides .
Why not stop there ?
The story thus far had taken gravity from the limits of the observed solar system to the ground beneath each reader ’s feet .
More pragmatically – it told a story whose significance Newton ’s audience would have grasped immediately : the importance of understanding the rules governing tides was obvious enough to the naval powers of the day .
No matter .
Newton kept on going .
The last section of his world - system turned to the celestial and seemingly impractical : the motion of comets , in an analysis of the track of the great comet of 1680 .
Newton presented his findings through two different approaches : one produced by collecting all the data points he could of traveler ’s observations and plotting the comet ’s track against those points ; and the other in which he selected just three points and calculated the path implied .
The two analyses matched almost exactly , and both showed that this comet did not complete a neat , elliptical orbit .
Rather , it traced a parabola .
Newton knew what he had done .
He was no accidental writer .
A parabola , of course , is a curve that keeps on going – and that meant that at the end of a very long and very dense book , he lifted off again from the hard ground of daily reality and said , in effect , look :
All this math and all these physical ideas govern everything we can see , out to and past the point where we ca n’t see anymore .
Most important , he did so with implacable rigor , a demonstration that , he argued , should leave no room for dissent .
He wrote " The theory that corresponds exactly to so nonuniform a motion through the greatest part of the heavens , and that observes the same laws as the theory of the planets and that agrees exactly with exact astronomical observations cannot fail to be true . "
( Italics added ) .
And now , finally , to get back to the point : this , I would argue , was the essential first and in some ways the most difficult step in the foundations of cosmology .
With it Newton transformed the scale of the universe we inhabit , making it huge , perhaps infinite .
Even more important , he demonstrated that a theory that could not fail to be true made it possible to examine one phenomenon -- matter in motion under the influence of gravity --- throughout all space .
That thought thrilled Newton ’s contemporaries – Halley caught the mood in his dedicatory poem to the Principia , writing that " Error and doubt no longer encumber us with mist ; /.... We are now admitted to the banquets of the Gods ; / We may deal with laws of heaven above ; and we now have / The secret keys to unlock the obscure earth .... "
To catch a distant echo of that euphoria , just imagine what it would have been like to contemplate that ever receding comet , fifteen years into its journey towards who knew where at the time of Newton ’s writing , and know that its behavior was knowable through an extraordinary act of human invention .
It ’s a whole ‘ nother story to ask what it would take to create a similar sense of pride and pleasure in a general audience today .
But just to get the discussion going , I ’d suggest that one of the oddities of contemporary cosmology as presented to the public is the degree to which the universe at large has become more homey ; the very success in making the argument that there is a continuous scientific narrative to be told from the Big Bang to the present makes it harder to see just how grand a claim that is .
So , to end with an open invitation to this community : what would make current physical ideas as powerful and as intelligibly strange as Newton was able to make his story of a comet traveling from and to distances with out limit ?
Last housekeeping notes : in one of the more premature bits of self - promotion in publishing history , the Newton material discussed above derives from my book , tentatively titled Newton and the Counterfeiter , coming early next year from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt ( and Faber , for those of you across the pond ) .
Also – my thanks again to Sean Carroll for welcoming me here .
If you want to see what I do when I ’m at home , check out The Inverse Square Blog .
* If you are minded to pick up a copy of Principia , get this edition .
Not only is it a well made book , easy to look at , well printed , with clear diagrams , it comes with the invaluable guide to reading the Principia written by I. Bernard Cohen .
Accept no substitutes .
** Thanks to reader and award - winning physics teacher David Derbes for catching my inversion of the problem Halley put to Newton .
Let this be a lesson to me : blog in haste ; check one ’s notes at leisure ; repent in public .

Click to viewWill Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull feature Indy ducking CGI boulders and reacting to greenscreen aliens ?
Not according to production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas , who also worked on Superman Returns and X2 : X - Men United .
We just talked to Dyas , who says he built all of the movie 's sets , with little or no greenscreen .
More details , and a gallery of Dyas ' designs from Superman and X2 , after the jump .

Many people had feared that George Lucas ' involvement in the new Indiana Jones would mean another spate of greenscreen craziness , along the lines of the three Star Wars prequels .
But Dyas says :
There really was n't much CGI .
We built all the sets ...
We built all of the [ moving stone staircases , converging stone pillars and other pieces ] so it was very nice .

You can see from looking at these images from Dyas ' portfolio that he 's designed and built some very elaborate sets for earlier movies , including Magneto 's cell in X2 .
It 'll be interesting to see Indy go head - to - head with the 100 percent CGI Speed Racer , also opening in May .

But despite the setting  or maybe because of it  Mr. Quint ’s audience seemed particularly moved by his gesture .
“ I like that he came here , ” Ebenezer Sarpeh , 46 , said , in the accent of his native Ghana .
“ And , yeah , the music , I like it . ”
It was Mr. Sarpeh who burst into spontaneous applause on several occasions and started yelling “ magic fingers ” during one particularly deft moment .
Later , he took a turn in front of the stage and his fellow cabdrivers laughed and cheered while he shimmied and moonwalked , the Newark Taxi Cab Association ’s answer to Justin Timberlake .
Like many of the cabdrivers in attendance , Mr. Sarpeh said it was the first recital by a classical violinist that he had ever attended .
A few confessed that they had little more than a passing familiarity with such music .
But they were proud to surround Mr. Khalil , who sat front row center in a black suit with a pink shirt and matching tie .
“ If one cabby does something good , we feel like we all do something good , ” said Patrick Cosmeus , 43 , who has been driving for a decade and seemed a little sheepish as he admitted that he had seldom found anything more valuable than a forgotten cellphone in his taxi .
“ But everything we find , we always return it , ” he added .
“ Everything we find is valuable to someone , ” Mr. Khalil pointed out .
“ If you lost your pen , you would think it was valuable . ”
Universities are so concerned about this issue that some — Amherst , Tufts , the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard , for example — have expanded public service fellowships and internships .
“ We ’re in the business of graduating people who will make the world better in some way , ” said Anthony Marx , Amherst ’s president .
“ That ’s what justifies the expense of the education . ”
This year , Tufts announced that it would pay off college loans for graduates who chose public service jobs .
And officials at Harvard , Penn , Amherst and a number of other colleges say one reason they have begun emphasizing grants instead of loans in financial aid is so students do not feel pressured by their debts to pursue lucrative careers .
In an interview this spring , Dr. Faust held up as a model Teach for America , the nonprofit program that has recruited large numbers of students at top colleges to teach in low - income schools for two years .
With 9 percent of Harvard ’s senior class applying to Teach for America this year , 37 students made the cut .
One of the seniors that Dr. Faust met with in the winter was Dhaval Chadha , who wanted her support for a “ diversity in careers ” forum he was organizing .
Mr. Chadha , 21 , who grew up in India , will spend the next year on a fellowship in Brazil , working with an antipoverty group in preparation for what he says will be his career in public service .
“ I do n’t think a lot of people at Harvard know what a hedge fund or a consulting firm is when they start , ” he said .
But then , he explained , juniors and seniors being recruited come back from expensive dinners out and “ start throwing salaries around , ” and students begin to understand that “ there ’s already a kind of prestige attached to working for those people . ”
“ It ’s like applying to college all over again , ” he added .
“ ‘ I applied to 8 to 10 Ivy League colleges , and I got in here .
I applied to these 40 companies , and I got into these ones . ’
It ’s exactly the thing that appeals to the Harvard competitive spirit . ”
Evgenia Peeva , who will be working for McKinsey , said : “ You have to be part of the competition .
You have to prove to yourself and everyone else that you can do it . ”
Angry German farmers rally in Berlin
By Stefan Steinberg
9 June 2008
Thousands of dairy farmers from all over Germany rallied in Berlin on Wednesday to protest the low prices they receive from major dairies and supermarket chains .
Twenty tractors lined up in front of Berlin ’s Brandenburg Gate as the crowd , including many young farm workers , listened to speeches from dairy farm representatives .
Posters and banners at the rally testified to the militancy of farmers .
They made clear that the current pricing policies of the major food retailing chains and the European Union were threatening the livelihoods of thousands of German small and middle - sized farmers .
Speakers at the rally brought solidarity greetings to the rally from farmers in France , Switzerland and Holland , making clear that the problem of increased production costs and declining returns was a pan-European problem .
Prices paid to European Union farmers for milk have fallen by around 30 percent during the past six months , while the farmers ’ production costs have risen dramatically .
For many years the EU agricultural tariff system provided a framework for prices and subsidies that guaranteed big profit margins to major dairy cooperatives such as Friesland and Campina in the Netherlands and Arlka in Denmark , while at the same time securing the existence of tens of thousands of small and middle - sized farmers across Europe .
Current EU plans to phase out all subsidies and completely subject European farmers to the whims of the free market mean inevitable ruin for many small - scale farms .
The EU recently reduced its milk quota by 2 percent and proposes a further 1 percent drop in quotas over the next five years , with the aim of abolishing dairy quotas entirely by 2014 .
In mid-2007 the EU also stopped paying export subsidies to European dairy farmers .
European farmers are hit on the one side by the EU policy and on the other by rising international fuel and food prices .
The recent large rise in fuel and diesel prices makes running farm machinery much more expensive and also increases the prices of fertilisers and animal feed .
At the same time , German farmers are confronted with the market power of German supermarket chains that use their influence to keep prices down and returns to the farmer at a minimum .
This policy has paid premiums .
The list of Germany ’s richest employers is dominated by the owners and shareholders of such cheap food outlets as Aldi , REWE and Lidl .
This is the background to the strike by German dairy farmers begun on May 27 .
In an unprecedented action farmers boycotted milk supplies and in a number of regions blockaded German dairies in order to prevent supplies from other producers from reaching the plants .
Following one such blockade of a Nordmilch plant in northern Germany , the company responded by threatening picketers with a € 500,000 ( 780,000 - dollar ) lawsuit .
Last Monday German riot police dragged away picketers at plants north of Hamburg .
Leaders in the Federal Farmers ’ Union ( DBV ) , which has the largest membership among German farmers , have denounced the radical actions undertaken by farmers organised in the smaller Dairy Farmers Association ( BDM ) .
The head of the DBV , Gerd Sonnleitner , made clear from the start that he opposed a strike by dairy farmers .
During the boycott the DBV declared its opposition to what it termed “ illegal ” actions .
At the Berlin rally the speaker of the DBV was greeted with boos and catcalls from the audience .
The militancy and confidence of farmers had grown during the past ten days , and in Berlin farmers acknowledged they had been struck by the sympathy and solidarity they received from the population at large .
Alarmed that their action had unleashed a wave of militancy that threatened to escape their control , the leadership of the BDM used the rally in Berlin to call off the farmer ’s strike and end the blockades of German dairies and supermarkets .
While acknowledging the extent of popular support for their action and the extent of European solidarity — in the past few weeks protest actions by dairy farmers have taken place in France , Austria , Switzerland and even Bulgaria — BDM president Romuald Schaber declared the farmers action had been a complete success and urged them to immediately return to work .
Already in the midst of the farmers action one leader of the BDM , Franz Grosse , had indicated that the association was keen to wind down the action .
“ We recommend there be no escalation outside the factories , so that we can hold sober talks , ” he said .
From the podium of the Berlin rally Schaber praised the deal struck during the past few days with the Lidl supermarket chain , which has agreed to increase the price of milk products in its chain of stores .
Indicating that other supermarket chains would follow suit , Schaber demagogically declared that the “ last bastion had fallen ” and the farmers should congratulate themselves on a victory .
In fact the victory declared by Schaber is completely hollow .
Other major supermarket chains have made no clear indications they are prepared to make any concessions .
A commentary in the Süddeutsche Zeitung entitled .
“ Bogus success ” declares that any talk of success on the part of the farmer ’s representatives is utterly misplaced .
None of their fundamental problems have been tackled .
There is no firm commitment from the overwhelming majority of supermarket chains , and it is by no means certain that farmers would profit from any deal made .
Instead prices of milk products could rise at the expense of the consumer , with the farmers receiving nothing .
As for the concession already made by the Lidl chain the Süddeutsche Zeitung writes :
“ There are grounds for thinking that the action by Lidl was first and foremost a clever marketing move .
Opinion polls indicated that a majority of consumers support the demands of the farmers for higher prices .
Lidl knew this .
The first one to give way is the good guy in the eyes of the public .
He sets the precedent for fairer prices while the others merely follow suit .
After the scandal over the spying of its workers [ it was recently revealed that the Lidl chain employs video cameras and the services of security firms to spy on its own employees ] such an opportunity comes just at the right time to allow Lidl to polish up its image . ”
In the course of the demonstration in Berlin reporters from the WSWS spoke with a number of young framers .
Lars and Sören had travelled from Schleswig - Holstein to attend the demonstration .
Sören works on a middle sized farm cooperative with 147 cows in the state of Schleswig - Holstein .
He described some of the problems confronting farmers :
“ We are continually confronted with rising prices that drive up our production costs .
At the same time the receipts from the big dairies that work out the price of milk in collaboration with the big supermarket chains are continually falling .
Last autumn we were receiving 47 cents for a litre of milk .
Now we are being offered between 25 and 33 cents a litre .
At the same time our production prices have soared .
In the space of a year , the prices of animal feeds have increased by 70 percent .
Fertiliser prices have increased , and in the space of the past few months we have been confronted with dramatic increases in the price of diesel .
It is impossible for us to continue unless the pricing system is reformed . ”
Sören noted that the Lidl supermarket chain had agreed to make some concessions , but he pointed out that other even bigger chains had made no commitment .
“ I am for keeping up the pressure until all the major food distributors make firm commitments .
Other companies like Aldi and REWE are even bigger .
We should not back down with our strike and milk boycott until all the companies have given way . ”
Sören was firmly opposed to any hike in prices being passed on to the consumer :
“ The owners of the supermarket chains are among the richest men in Germany .
The Albrecht brothers , who own the Aldi chain , top the German Rich List .
They already make enough profits to be able to pay us a reasonable price for our products .
I am against any price hike being passed on to the consumer . ”
Moritz and Andreas travelled from Weser in North Rhine Westphalia to attend the rally .
Andreas also elaborated on the plight facing small and middle - sized farmers in his region .
Andreas works on a farm with a total of 70 cows .
“ We have all been struck be the amount of solidarity we have received from the public .
Many people have told us they would be prepared to pay more for their milk because they realise the present pricing policy is wrong .
The population at large is being hit by rising prices , and I think they know how we feel .
The fact that we have received support from other countries shows that this is not just a German problem .
Farmers across the continent are in the same boat . ”
Both Moritz and Andreas were opposed to any premature end to the strike .
“ We have seen an initial reaction to our milk boycott , but it does not go far enough .
We should continue out action until we have really firm results .
Otherwise we will be back on the streets in the near future . ”

A local hot line has seen a dramatic spike in suicide calls from people in Palm Beach County who are facing foreclosure and can't pay their bills , according to numbers released today .
Since the start of the year , 256 people in the county told operators at the 211 hot line that they were thinking about suicide .
Of those , 44 told operators that their main reason was that they had lost a job , were facing foreclosure , could n't afford to pay their bills or were homeless .
A month of gasoline prices near $ 4 a gallon was enough to sour Americans ’ long love affair with trucks and sport utility vehicles , pushing them back into sedans -- and driving Detroit ’s automakers into deeper trouble .
U.S. sales results released Tuesday showed cars outselling gas - guzzling trucks and SUVs by almost 200,000 in May -- the biggest margin since 1996 .
That was bad news for U.S. automakers , whose lineups are heavily skewed toward large , inefficient vehicles , but a boon to their car - focused Asian rivals .
General Motors posted a sales drop of about 27 % from a year earlier and said it would close four truck plants , prepare its Hummer brand for a possible sale and focus on making smaller cars .
Chrysler ’s 25.4 % sales decline put it behind Honda in monthly sales for the first time .
And , after 17 years , Ford ’s F - Series trucks were dethroned from the top sales position , falling to No. 5 behind the Honda Civic , Toyota Corolla , Toyota Camry and Honda Accord .
“ I think it ’s a watershed moment , ” said Jim Farley , head of marketing at Ford .
For the month , overall vehicle sales in the U.S. were 1.4 million , down 8.4 % from a year earlier , according to Autodata Corp .
Based on the May sales rate , the industry is on pace to sell just 14.3 million vehicles this year in the U.S.
In 2007 , total sales were 16.1 million .
For nearly a decade , Americans bought more light trucks -- a segment that includes pickups , SUVs and minivans -- than cars .
But starting in March , cars edged ahead .
The gap widened in April , and in May , 193,559 more cars than light trucks were sold .
“ The market has shifted dramatically from large gas - guzzling vehicles to smaller , fuel - efficient vehicles , ” said Dennis Virag , president of Automotive Consulting Group in Ann Arbor , Mich .
GM in May saw a 37 % decline in light truck and SUV sales and its share of the overall U.S. market dropped below 20 % , a new low for the automotive giant that in 1980 had 45 % of the U.S. market .
GM Chairman Rick Wagoner said the company believed that American consumers were shifting permanently from SUVs toward smaller vehicles .
He said the company ’s board had greenlighted production of a new small car in an Ohio factory and of its
Volt electric vehicle -- set to debut in 2010 -- in Detroit .
“ We at GM do n’t think this is a spike or a temporary shift , ” Wagoner said in a conference call before the company ’s annual shareholder meeting in Wilmington , Del .
It was a different story for many Asian automakers .
The fuel - efficient Honda Civic compact had a record month with 53,299 sold , a 38.5 % increase from May 2007 .
It and other small cars including the Fit helped Honda , which sells very few light trucks and and is heavy with fuel - efficient cars , post a 15.6 % increase in vehicles sold for the month .
Hyundai , Mazda , Kia and Subaru posted sales increases for the month .
So did Nissan , which saw an 8.4 % increase in sales , driven by a 43 % burst from its Altima sedan , which like the Civic comes as a hybrid as well as a traditional drivetrain .
But Nissan ’s results were pulled down by a lineup that includes large SUVs such as the Armada , whose sales fell 52 % , and the Titan full - size pickup , which was down 56 % .
The difficulties of that delicate balancing act between cars and light trucks was perhaps best illustrated by Toyota , which had a 4.3 % decline in sales for the month despite a mix of cars that includes the popular Yaris , Camry , Corolla and Matrix models .
The drag , in the Japanese automaker ’s case , was the trucks and full - sized SUVs it makes in the U.S .
“ All of our previous assumptions on the full - sized pickup truck segment are off the table , ” said Bob Carter , head of Toyota ’s U.S. sales unit .
Of the many models crippling GM sales , the worst have borne the Hummer nameplate .
In May , Hummer purchases declined 60 % , and through the first five months of the year it is the marque that has slipped the most , down 36 % , placing it behind brands such as Chrysler , Bentley and even Maybach .
The Hummer H3 gets an average of 15 miles per gallon , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
“ At this point , we are considering all options for the Hummer brand , ” Wagoner said .
“ Everything from a complete revamp of the product lineup to partial or complete sale of the brand . ”
No possible buyer has been named for the division , which was for a few years -- when gasoline cost less than $ 3 a gallon -- one of GM ’s best - performing .
Last week , GM ’s stock hit a 26 - year low , falling to $ 17.38 .
In trading on Tuesday , GM shares rose 14 cents , to $ 17.58 .
At Tuesday ’s shareholder meeting , speakers criticized Wagoner for what they called his excessive compensation in light of the company ’s poor performance .
According to one calculation , GM ’s chairman received compensation worth nearly $ 16 million last year , up from $ 9.6 million in 2006 .
Nevertheless , a measure to tie executive pay to performance was defeated at the meeting .
Besides Hummer , another SUV brand that has been rumored to be on the block is Jeep , considered the one salable product among the holdings of cash - starved Chrysler .
The privately held automaker has repeatedly denied that it intends to sell Jeep , but analysts say it ought to have considered that option some time ago .
Jeep ’s top - selling vehicle , the Wrangler , gets an average of 18 mpg .
“ Chrysler should have sold it two years ago , ” analyst Virag said .
“ Today , Jeep is seen as a portfolio of products that are pretty inefficient . ”
After years of juicy profits from light trucks , all three U.S. automakers are scrambling to shift production toward cars .
GM said Tuesday that it would close plants in Oshawa , Canada ; Moraine , Ohio ; Janesville , Wis. , and Toluca , Mexico .
Several thousand jobs could be affected .
Those plants are responsible for pickup trucks and SUVs such as the Chevrolet Silverado , the GMC Envoy and the medium - duty Chevy Kodiak and are expected to end production no later than the end of 2009 .
Sales at Ford fell 15.6 % in May , buoyed a bit by a 3 % gain in its sales of cars such as the popular Focus .
Last month , Ford said that it would cut worker shifts and total production at a handful of plants that make its largest SUVs and pickup trucks , and that it would produce the subcompact Fiesta in a plant outside Mexico City that currently makes the F - series pickup .
Even Chrysler , which of all carmakers has the product mix most heavily slanted toward light trucks , with 71 % of its vehicles sold through May falling into that category , is looking to cars .
In April , it announced that Nissan would produce a small car for it , while Chrysler would make trucks for Nissan in a Mexico factory .
Still , some worry that Detroit ’s newfound love of small cars could backfire because of the sheer size and inertia inherent in such large operations .
“ Oftentimes what we see from Detroit is an overreaction too late , ” said Wes Brown , principal of Los Angeles marketing research firm Iceology .
“ They make seismic shifts to react to what the market is doing today , and by the time they get the product to market , the market has moved on . ”

Jane Harman ( D - CA ) sucks .
There ’s no better way to say it .
Why does Jane Harman suck ?
Because she introduced the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 .
An oddly named bill , reminiscent of The Patriot Act , The Protect America Act , and others which might be called anything but patriotic or protecting .
And , for that , both it , and she , sucks .
BTW , this bill is also loving called the Thought Crime Bill .
Why ?
Watch and weep , then keep reading .
This clip is from the film Washington You ’re Fired which you can purchase here .
An excellent film , one I highly recommend .
Let me say , for the record , that in concept , I do n’t think that it ’s a bad thing to determine who might want to blow up both stuff and people in the US .
If you read what ’s on the House site regarding this bill , it sounds all rosy .
That said , a generally worded document – no , LAW , of dubious origins ( more below the fold ) , with inadequate definitions ; definitions which are open to far too much interpretation for comfort , becomes something to fear greatly .
But that ’s not the only reason Jane Harman sucks .
Let ’s first look at this bill and we ’ll more about why Ms. Harman sucks shortly .
So , how is this poorly worded ?
This is an excerpts from the official House site .
10/23/2007 –Passed
House amended .
Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 – Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to add a new section concerning the prevention of violent radicalization ; ( an extremist belief system for facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political , religious , or social change ) ; and homegrown terrorism ( violence by a group or individual within the United States ; to coerce the U.S. government , the civilian population , or a segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives ) .
Why is this problematic ?
Lee Waters takes this on quite nicely .
The definition of violent radicalization uses vague language to define this term of promoting any belief system that the government considers to be an extremist agenda .
Since the bill does n’t specifically define what an extremist belief system is , it is entirely up to the interpretation of the government .
Considering how much the government has done to destroy the Constitution they could even define Ron Paul supporters as promoting an extremist belief system .
Literally , the government according to this definition can define whatever they want as an extremist belief system .
Essentially they have defined violent radicalization as thought crime .
The definition as defined in the bill is shown below .
( 2 ) VIOLENT RADICALIZATION–
The term `violent radicalization ’ means the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political , religious , or social change .
The definition of homegrown terrorism uses equally vague language to further define thought crime .
The bill includes the planned use of force or violence as homegrown terrorism which could be interpreted as thinking about using force or violence .
Not only that but the definition is so vaguely defined , that petty crimes could even fall into the category of homegrown terrorism .
The definition as defined in the bill is shown below .
( 3 ) HOMEGROWN TERRORISM–
The term `homegrown terrorism ’ means the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born , raised , or based and operating primarily within the United States or any possession of the United States to intimidate or coerce the United States government , the civilian population of the United States , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives .
Section 899B of the bill goes over the findings of Congress as it pertains to homegrown terrorism .
Particularly alarming is that the bill mentions the Internet as a main source for terrorist propaganda .
The bill even mentions streams in obvious reference to many of the patriot and pro-constitution Internet radio networks that have been formed .
It also mentions that homegrown terrorists span all ages and races indicating that the Congress is stating that everyone is a potential terrorist .
Even worse is that Congress states in their findings that they should look at draconian police states like Canada , Australia and the United Kingdom as models to defeat homegrown terrorists .
Literally , these findings of Congress fall right in line with the growing patriot community .
And then there were the speeches which resulted in this bill ’s passage .
First up , excerpts from Rep. Bennie Thompson [ D - MS ] :
In May , six men were arrested for allegedly plotting to attack Fort Dix .
Three of those men were United States citizens ; the other three had been in the United States since they were small children .
Then , again , in June , another four men were charged with plotting to attack JFK Airport by blowing up jet fuel tanks .
The alleged mastermind of this plot was a United States citizen .
Homegrown terrorists no longer need to travel to Afghanistan or Pakistan to get support and training .
They can simply go on the Internet to find violent propaganda and others who share their violent ideology .
The bill also creates a center of excellence to conduct research that is desperately needed in determining the root cause of violent radicalization .
The centerpiece of this bill is the creation of a national commission .
It is a step in the right direction .
National commissions have a long and successful history in this country .
The Gilmore Commission , of which our chairwoman was a member , which functioned from 1993 to 1998 , made 164 recommendations regarding the domestic response to terrorism .
Of those 164 recommendations , all have been adopted in whole or in part by the Congress and the Federal Government .
Well , we ’re off to a bad start .
The Fort Dix situation was a case of presumptive prosecution ( which is too reminiscent of our preemptive war with Iraq ) and , in my opinion , questionable in many respects ) which garnered a guilty plea by one suspect for possession of weapons .
Not exactly a stunning bit of terrorism there .
( If you ’re interested , here ’s a good blog which followed this .
Knock yourself out . )
And what about that JFK thing ?
Not to sound redundant , but dubious at best .
And I wo n’t even get into Jose Padilla , for that was an atrocity .
And just what is the root cause of violent radicalization ?
Let me venture a couple of guesses here : abject poverty , food insecurity ( why do n’t they call it starvation anymore ? ) , our government ’s interference both domestically and abroad which is usually to the detriment of the populace at large , mental illness ?
I am sure the list could go on and on but how about addressing a couple of the concepts ?
And The Gilmore Commission ?
Hold that thought for another moment .
But let ’s give our esteemed representatives some benefit of the doubt .
Let ’s look more at the speeches .
Now to Ms. Harman ’s speech .
Again excerpts :
In recent testimony before our Intelligence Subcommittee , some common traits and characteristics emerged .
Said RAND Corporation ’s Bruce Jenkins : “ It is the same age group that is susceptible to being recruited into gangs .
These are young men who are going through identity crises , looking to define themselves .
If you have a narrative that exalts violence , that attempts to project that violence as a personal obligation , that offers the tantalizing prospect of clandestinity ( sic ) , identity , all of those are appealing to that specific age group . ”
Combine that personal adolescent upheaval with the explosion of information technologies and communications tools , tools which American kids are using to broadcast messages from al Qaeda … .
I ’ll spare you more speeches consisting of Fort Dix , Al Qaeda , JFK , etc. , etc. , ad nauseum .
But what about this Rand Corporation ?
And how about The Gilmore Commission ?
Glad you asked .
This is from an interview by Amy Goodman and journalist Jessica Lee and Kaman Karl Franklin , a fellow with the Center for Constitutional Rights :
JESSICA LEE : Right .
When I started to look into this bill , what I found was a great influence by the Rand Corporation , which is a government affiliated think tank .
Twice , Brian Michael Jenkins , who is an expert on terrorism , gave testimony in the House on this bill .
AMY GOODMAN : He is from the Rand Corporation .
JESSICA LEE : He is from the Rand , yes .
They largely tried to push this bill through on this idea there are these extreme political Islamists in our country and they did not do a very good job stating the actual threat .
But when you look through the Rand Corporation ’s other reports in 2005 , they had a report called “ Trends in Terrorism ” .
And they had one chapter called “ Homegrown Terrorism Threats ” .
When you look in that chapter , there ’s nothing about political Islamists .
In fact , its all about anti- globalization people on the right and left side of the spectrum .
The animal rights and the environmental movements ; and anarchists .
And to me I found that very interesting that that testimony was not mentioned at all when this bill was passed .
That this legislation is not just gonna look at so - called violent , religious people , but also people who have been very strong opinions against this administration .
AMY GOODMAN : In terms of the Rand Corporation , it was Daniel Ellsburg who worked for the Rand Corporation , when he have that many thousands of pages on the history of the Vietnam war and the Pentagon papers .
So Rand is the key — what would you say , writer of the bill ?
And the Congressmember who ’s most involved in this ?
JESSICA LEE : Representative Jane Harmon , a Democrat from California , has had a lengthy relationship with the Rand Corporation .
I called several times to get comment from the Rand Corporation , they said that their experts are out of town and unavailable due to the holidays .
So I did not find out if they indeed did write the bill themselves .
What we do know is that have a great influence and that they have had in the past .
KAMAU FRANKLIN : I just wanted to add to the Rand comment , particularly with Brian Michael Jenkins , supposed terrorist expert who ’s mainly known according to Rand as someone who helped the United States in counter - insurgency measures in Vietnam , which is one of his claims to fame .
In addition to that , he wrote a book and in his own book , I just want to quote that says “ in their international campaign , the Jihadist will seek common ground with leftist , anti-American and anti-globalization forces who will in turn seek radical Islam comrades against a mutual foe . ”
So I think what Jessica ’s talking about , is that , the breadth of it is not focused in on supposed terrorists who are threatening the United States , but folks who have real concerns about where this country is heading , folks who express dissent in various different ways including demonstrations and marches .
These are the folks who this bill potentially good target .
Here is an excellent Open Letter to Jane Harman addressing this issue and Rand specifically .
I strongly suggest you read this .
One of the best entries I have read concerning this slippery slope of a bill is by Paul Craig Roberts , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration , prior Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial pages , and a Contributing Editor of the National Review ( yes , I said National Review , that bastion of thinking left ) .
He ends his post with “ The light of liberty has gone out in the United States . ”
Ya think ?
The assault on the US Constitution by the Democratic Party is as determined as the assault by the Republicans .
On October 23 , 2007 , the House passed a bill sponsored by California Democratic congresswoman Jane Harman , chairwoman of a Homeland Security subcommittee , that overturns the constitutionally guaranteed rights to free expression , association , and assembly .
The bill passed the House on a vote of 404 - 6 .
In the Senate the bill is sponsored by Maine Republican Susan Collins and apparently faces no meaningful opposition .
Harman ’s bill is called the “ Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act .
” When HR 1955 becomes law , it will create a commission tasked with identifying extremist people , groups , and ideas .
The commission will hold hearings around the country , taking testimony and compiling a list of dangerous people and beliefs .
The bill will , in short , create massive terrorism in the United States .
But the perpetrators of terrorism will not be Muslim terrorists ; they will be government agents and fellow citizens .
We are beginning to see who will be the inmates of the detention centers being built in the US by Halliburton under government contract .
Who will be on the “ extremist beliefs ” list ?
The answer is : civil libertarians , critics of Israel , 9/11 skeptics , critics of the administration ’s wars and foreign policies , critics of the administration ’s use of kidnapping , rendition , torture and violation of the Geneva Conventions , and critics of the administration ’s spying on Americans .
Anyone in the way of a powerful interest group–such as environmentalists opposing politically connected developers–is also a candidate for the list .
The “ Extremist Beliefs Commission ” is the mechanism for identifying Americans who pose “ a threat to domestic security ” and a threat of “ homegrown terrorism ” that “ cannot be easily prevented through traditional federal intelligence or law enforcement efforts .
While I am railing on Jane Harman , let me add that this is n’t the only reason to say that she sucks .
Ms. Harman was also one of the Gang of Eight who knew , back in 2004 , about the Bush administration ’s warrantless wiretapping .
Now only did she not say anything , she supported it and tried to keep it out of the press .
She felt that open discussion was damaging .
As the former Rep. Tom Hayden says :
She was one of a handful of Congressmembers invited into the secret White House briefings on what has mushroomed into a major scandal : the launch of domestic spying by intelligence agencies without warrants .
The ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee , Harman promised the White House to keep secret what she heard at the meetings .
She could have been a whistleblower , but chose not to be .
She could have refused the unconditional promise of secrecy , but chose not to .
She could have resigned the secret committee without comment , letting her silence do the talking , but chose not to .
Left to Harman , the spy scandal would still be a secret today .
It was the New York Times , not Democratic leaders , who first broke the silence and secrecy .
Harman actually approved the spy program in her initial comments , then sought a legal opinion before commenting further .
Thanks , Jane .
Between this and the Thought Crime Bill , I feel so much safer .
Since the birth of our nation , patriotism IS dissent .
Patriotism is a working media which oversees the overseers .
Patriotism is questioning everything to keep our government honest .
Patriotism requires a knowledgeable population .
It takes interest from the masses , the ability to critically think and understand .
Alas , we are failing miserably on each of these very important aspects of what being patriotic truly is .
What it is not is wrapping yourself in a flag , wearing a flag pin , or blindly following whatever ideology you choose .
What can you do ?

When the Nazis came for the communists ,
I remained silent ;
I was not a communist .
When they locked up the social democrats ,
I remained silent ;
I was not a social democrat .
When they came for the trade unionists ,
I did not speak out ;
I was not a trade unionist .
When they came for the Jews ,
I remained silent ;
I was n’t a Jew .
When they came for me ,
there was no one left to speak out .

Tutulemma : Solar Eclipse Analemma
Credit & Copyright : Tunc Tezel and Cenk E. Tezel
Explanation :
If you went outside at exactly the same time every day and took a picture that included the Sun , how would the Sun appear to move ?
With great planning and effort , such a series of images can be taken .
The figure - 8 path the Sun follows over the course of a year is called an analemma .
With even greater planning and effort , the series can include a total eclipse of the Sun as one of the images .
Pictured is such a total solar eclipse analemma or Tutulemma - a term coined by the photographers based on the Turkish word for eclipse .
The composite image sequence was recorded from Turkey starting in 2005 .
The base image for the sequence is from the total phase of a solar eclipse as viewed from Side , Turkey on 2006 March 29 .
Venus was also visible during totality , toward the lower right .
Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN's Jason Carroll explores the issue of race .
Barack Obama 's father was from Kenya ; his white mother was from Kansas .
( CNN ) -- The 2000 U.S. Census was the first time Americans were allowed to identify themselves as " multiracial , " and more than six million people checked more than one box in the race and ethnicity category .
Included in the multiracial category is the Democratic presumptive nominee , Sen. Barack Obama .
With a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya , Obama is the nation 's first biracial candidate for president .
The media , however , have continually called Obama the nation 's first major party " black candidate , " saying he could make history as the first " black president . "
But is that accurate ?
A columnist examining Obama 's background summed up his racial identity into one equation : white + black = black .
For me , that said it all .
There are some who point out Obama is just as white as he is black .
He may be the nation 's first black president , but he would also be the nation 's 44th white president .
Is Obama black or biracial ? »
" He ca n't say , ' I 'm a white guy named Barack Hussein Obama , ' nobody 's going to buy that , " says cultural critic Michaela Angela Davis .
" We 're not ready for that . "
This is an issue that has sparked debate not only in our newsroom , but also among my friends and family .
Most Americans see Obama as a black man , and he identifies himself as a black man .
But there are some who will argue that by labeling Obama as a " black candidate , " we are all ignoring a vital and legitimate side of his life .
Does Obama 's race really matter ? »
I spoke with a group of young professionals who are part of a biracial support group called Swirl .
Swirl was started by a woman named Jen Chau whose father is Chinese and mother is white .
Chau says this debate over Obama 's racial identity is very familiar and she 's been dealing with this issue her whole life .
Chau identifies herself as a mixed - race person as do the other members of Swirl we spoke with .
Lynda
Turet says she could never identify herself as a white person in America because she is also half - Filipina .
Both women support Obama 's choice to identify himself as a black candidate , but they also understand why he emphasizes his white roots .
David Mendell , author of " Obama : From Promise to Power " says there 's an idea of a " post- racial " candidate , a candidate who transcends the labels of race to appeal to all races .
He says though most Americans view Obama as black , he has been able to use his own experiences to appeal to both black and white audiences and that has translated into political success .
This is a debate that will continue as we watch the presidential race .
It seems with an issue like this there 's no right or wrong answer .
As Michaela Angela Davis says , it 's a step in the right direction that we are even having this discussion as all .

That 's right : 520 times .

There 's no question that nuclear power is the most climate - friendly industrial - scale energy source .
You can worry about radioactive waste or proliferating weapons .
You can complain about the high cost of construction and decommissioning .
But the reality is that every serious effort at carbon accounting reaches the same conclusion : Nukes win .
Only wind comes close — and that 's when it 's blowing .
A UK government white paper last year factored in everything from uranium mining to plant decommissioning and determined that nuclear power emits 2 to 6 percent of the carbon per kilowatt - hour as natural gas , the cleanest of the fossil fuels .
Embracing the atom is key to winning the war on warming : Electric power generates 26 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions and 39 percent of the United States ' — it 's the biggest contributor to global warming .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A federal appeals court on Monday overturned a U.S. military tribunal ’s enemy combatant designation for a Chinese Muslim at the Guantanamo Bay prison , its first ruling that gives a detainee a chance for release .

It ordered the U.S government to release or transfer Huzaifa Parhat , a member of the Uighur ethnic group , or to “ expeditiously ” hold a new military tribunal for him .
Parhat , who was captured in Afghanistan and who has been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for six years , is one of several Uighurs still at the prison .
The United States has struggled to find a country willing to accept the Uighurs .
In 2006 , the United States allowed five Chinese Muslims released from Guantanamo to seek asylum in Albania .
The U.S. government has said it cannot return the Uighurs to China because they would face persecution there .
Many Muslim Uighurs , who are from Xinjiang in far western China , seek greater autonomy for the region and some want independence .
Beijing has waged a relentless campaign against what it calls the violent separatist activities of the Uighurs .
The ruling by the three - judge panel was under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 that gave the prisoners a limited review before the appeals court of their designation as an enemy combatant .
The court also said Parhat can seek his immediate release before a U.S. District judge under the Supreme Court ’s landmark ruling this month that the detainees have the legal right to challenge their years - long confinement .
A key issue in the Parhat case was whether he had been involved in any activity that would justify designating him as an enemy combatant .
The government argued that Parhat was trained by a group called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and that it has links to al Qaeda .
That was enough to hold him , it said .
Parhat ’s lawyers said he considered China , not the United States , the enemy , and that there was no evidence that he ever joined the group .
There are about 270 detainees at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo , which was set up in January of 2002 to hold terrorism suspects captured after the September 11 attacks .
Most of the prisoners have been held for years without being charged and many have complained of abuse .
More than 190 of the prisoners have filed challenges with the U.S. appeals court in Washington to the decisions by the military tribunals that they have been properly held as enemy combatants .
In April , Parhat ’s case was the first to be heard by a civilian appeals court .
In a one - paragraph notice summarizing its ruling , the three - judge appeals court panel said it issued its opinion on June 20 to both sides in the Parhat case .
Because the ruling contained classified information and information the government initially submitted in secret , a redacted public version will be made available later , it said .
In keeping with the court ’s general reluctance to interfere with the president ’s war - making powers , its rulings in the war on terror began relatively modestly .
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , in 2004 , pertained only to United States citizens detained as enemy combatants on American soil ; the court held that they must get a “ meaningful opportunity ” to challenge the factual basis for their detention .
The second ruling , in Rasul v. Bush , came soon after the scandal at Abu Ghraib .
Though momentous , it was still limited .
The court found , 6 - 3 , that Guantànamo Bay was within United States jurisdiction and subject to its laws , meaning detainees there were entitled to some sort of due process in American courts .
It did n’t specify the process , nor suggest that Congress could n’t amend a law through which detainees could access the courts .
The 2006 Hamdan case concerned the military commissions that President Bush established at Guantánamo Bay to try some detainees in the aftermath of 9/11 .
Here the court ’s majority went further .
It found that by creating the commissions without asking Congress to agree , the president had overstepped his authority under the Constitution ’s separation of powers .
Moreover , it held that the president was obligated to honor America ’s commitments under the Geneva Conventions .
In response , the administration succeeded in getting Congress to authorize the military commissions and stripping the Guantánamo detainees of the right to habeas corpus .
Which brings us to last week ’s ruling in Boumediene  and the 5 - 4 decision to restore that ancient right .
The easiest explanation for the rash of rebukes is that this administration has simply been unusually aggressive in asserting executive authority stemming from 9/11 , a singularly devastating attack in which terrorists killed thousands in New York , Washington , and Pennsylvania .
“ I think it ’s less about the court and more about the executive , ” says Geoffrey Stone , a law professor at the University of Chicago and the author of “ Perilous Times : Free Speech in Wartime . ”
“ The executive has made extreme claims that are lawfully and constitutionally unfounded , even giving him the same benefit of the doubt that the government has received in prior cases . ”
As the administration sees it , every action it has taken since Sept. 11 is n’t only justified by national security concerns in an age of terrorism , but consistent with the president ’s historically expanded powers during wartime .
Even the Constitution leaves room for suspending habeas corpus in times of rebellion or invasion .
ADDENDUM ... MICROBES , FEAR , AND OTHER TOXINS ....
I appreciate all of the comments ... even the ones that ask the hard questions or bring up shortcomings or potential shortcomings in this instructable .
First off , let me say that this filter makeover is NOT intended to do ALL that the Brita filters claim to do , but just do what the activated carbon portion performs , which meets my needs very well .
I live in a small community of about 50 individuals in the high plains of N.E. New Mexico , and the water hardness is just under 1000 parts per million ( ppm ) , which are largely sulphates with some sodium , so we do n't use that water for drinking or cooking .
We distill some of our water in solar and electric distillers , and also collect rainwater from our metal roofs .
Because of the quantity of dust , pollen , algae spores and other organic matter ( bird poop , etc. ) that settles on our roofs , we filter our water through a multi-stage filter bank that concludes with a .5 micron carbon block filter .
Each week we consume about 250 to 300 gallons of rainwater alone , so water filtration is a requirement , but at the same time , we 're not going to lose sleep over what get through the carbon .
The filter pitchers that we use are primarily to remove any off - flavors that may not be entirely removed by the carbon block , and this the granulated carbon does remarkably well .
Refilling these filters amounts to a substantial annual cost savings for us .
In the last two months I 've refilled over 30 of these filters with the NSF certified granulated activated carbon that I linked to on page 1 < http://stores.ebay.com/Carbon-Eze >.
Everyone should have their water tested and judge from the test results what type of filtration you NEED .
Be intelligent .
Why pay for something you do n't use ?
Use your own judgment as to whether a carbon - only filter is suitable for your situation .
I hate fear / ignorance stimulated marketing tactics that are used by some water filter companies ( or any company ) to get folks to buy their product out of fear and ignorance .
I will try to dispel the concerns that some have suggested in the comments .
For those who are concerned that the quality of the carbon that they might encounter at an aquarium shop , and feel they need FDA " food grade " certification or on their activated carbon , I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIND A SOURCE THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH AND BUY FROM THEM .
YOU MAY EVEN WANT TO SHARE WHAT YOU FIND ... POST THEIR CONTACT INFO HERE in a comment .
The carbon source I linked to sell NSF certified carbon .
Really , though , I think the amount of concern over this point is overstated , as aquarium fish tend to be very sensitive to certain impurities and the folks that make the carbon for that application are very aware of this ... they do n't want anything in the filter media they sell , as it's not good for business .
Personally , I would trust a vet supply ( or aquarium shop ) over the FDA any day of the week .
The FDA approves toxins for food additives ( sodium fluoride , Aspartame , MSG , etc. ) while forbidding beneficial or benign ingredients ( stevia , numerous medicinal herbs , etc. ) .
It 's usually about corporate money & bribes .
Anyone with a source for alternate or superior filter media are encouraged to post their findings and URLs in the comments .
For those with a concern about medications that may be in your city water supply ( I'm assuming from the city recycling the waste water ) , if it 's a carbon based / organic medication , then carbon should filter that out .
Do your research , be responsible , be wise .
Do what works for you .
If you have a concern about the carbon becoming a medium for microbes to flourish , one of the best ways to slow that process down is to lower the temperature of your filter by keeping the pitcher in fridge .
Keep in mind that carbon removes ( adsorbs ) organic , carbon based impurities as well as chlorine ... which also includes what decomposing residue that results from the organic impurities " rotting " that get caught by the carbon ... molds , fungi , yeast , mildew ... microbes in general .
In other words , the " fresh " stuff that gets trapped by the filter and begins to decompose remains to be trapped by the carbon UNTIL the carbon has reached saturation .
Unless your olfactory senses are totally fried , you should be able to tell by the taste of the water when the carbon is spent and in need of replacement .
If you 're one that is ultra sensitive to this kind of stuff , find out what works for you and stick with it .
If you sleep better by using a corporate , consumer grade product , then by all means , do that .
If you 're filtering water that has chlorine in it , the chlorine will likely reduce / retard / prevent the growth of microbes .
The chlorine probably already killed all of the cooties BEFORE you ran them through the filter .
Myself , I would n't worry about it unless you truly have a real and not imaginary need for additional filtration .
A WORD ABOUT DISCLAIMERS :
I purchased a book several years ago titled " The Egoscue Method of Health Through Motion " which had a disclaimer that really impressed me ... it is included below and applies to this instructable , as well as life in general .
Personal responsibility is n't for everyone , just those who appreciate freedom and do n't care to blame others . :o )
" Ours is a highly litigious society .
Which means , in plain English , we like to sue each other , blame each other , transfer responsibility to others .
Since , as you 'll see , responsibility is a continuing theme of this book , the space which is usually reserved for what the lawyers refer to as the " disclaimer " is being used to make an additional and , I believe , more important point .
You 've seen the words many times : " The following material is not intended as a substitute for the advice of a physician .
The reader should consult a physician before embarking on this or any health program ... " --- or words to that effect .
The all - purpose liability firebreak .
Disclaimers are a legal necessity , but they are a cop-out .
This material is no substitute for the reader taking responsibility for his or her own health .
Therefore , I have an important recommendation to make :
If you really need a disclaimer , close the book and put it back on the shelf unread .
I hope you do n't , because what I have to say in the pages ahead will change your life .
Pete Egoscue "
A COUPLE FINAL THOUGHTS / OPINIONS :
Anyone who is truly concerned about their health and is still eating meat and diary products are either ill informed or are not really concerned ENOUGH about their health .
I would say the same thing applies to living / working in the city environment ... it 's not physically or spiritually healthy .
I have n't been to a hospital for an illness in over 24 years , and the last 17 of those years I 've been a vegetarian .
I have n't been sick for almost three years ... ever since I gave up eggs and dairy .
I know about 50 other vegetarians who also stopped eating eggs and dairy products at the same time who also have n't been ill in almost three years .
Be wise with what you do with your life .
Huckabee supporters react to McCain affair rumors Michael Roston
Published : Thursday February 21 , 2008

Print This Email This While John McCain 's campaign went into crisis management mode over allegations that the Arizona senator had an inappropriate relationship with a telecommunications lobbyist , his only remaining challenger , former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee offered a muted public reaction to the news .
" I take him at his word , " Huckabee said in a press conference broadcast just before 11 AM on Fox News , adding that McCain was an " honorable man " and that he should n't get into the details of the story .
But while Huckabee seemed focused on campaigning in Texas , a traditionally conservative bastion , pundits and his supporters were debating the implications of the reports .
" Has the Huckabee miracle occurred ? " asked Max Brantley of the Arkansas Times blog .
" Mike Huckabee is suddenly a very real contender for president of these United States . "
Huckabee 's low - cost presidential campaign has relied heavily on Huck 's Army , the informal network of volunteers who get out the word and the vote for the former governor .
And some seemed to agree with Brantley 's assessment of the situation .
" This is why Mike has been saying he ' ca n't dropout , ' " wrote one commenter at Huck 's Army .
" God is in control here ......!! "
But other Huck 's Army members were more measured in their responses .
" Mike has run a very very clean campaign against McCain and it will be interesting if he takes this opportunity to go a little negative considering how important keeping [ T ] exas close or winning [ T ] exas is to his campaign strategy , " wrote another commenter .
And an additional member said it was best to stay patient in reacting to the news .
" Not sure how much legs this has , but I 'm sure people will be discussing why Huckabee is smart to sit in throughout this process , " wrote a forum participant .
Still , one commenter in the forum said Huckabee should not pursue negative attacks based on the story .
" He wo n 't ........ he should n't .
He 's bigger than that .
Our God is bigger than that , " the forum writer said .
Huckabee himself did not address the subject on Wednesday evening while addressing a rally of supporters in Texas .
" I do n't think anyone running for office has ever depended on a single state as I 'm depending on Texas , " the Fort Worth Star - Telegram quoted Huckabee saying before 2,000 supporters in the city of Plano .
Huckabee 's delegate deficit to McCain is all but insurmountable and recent polls in Texas show the senator opening up a widening lead over the Baptist minister .
Still , it was evident from the words of Huckabee supporters on Wednesday night that the question of McCain 's personal conduct may cause them to hew more closely to their chosen candidate .
" He speaks for us , the left out conservative Christian group , and we are a big part of the Republican Party and they need to hear us , " ABC13 News in Houston quoted a rally attendee as saying .

Python Generator Tricks
By Pramode C.E .
The Python programming language 's support for generators is described in PEP 255 .
This article demonstrates a few simple programs which make use of this feature to do some fun stuff like filtering out prime numbers , representing an `infinite ' series expansion in a finite way , applying the Euler `accelerator ' to make a series converge faster etc .
Many of the programs which I describe here have been taken from `test_generators.py ' which is available with the Python source distribution .
A few ideas have been stolen from the Computer Science classic , Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs .
What is a Generator ?
A generator is , simply put , a function which can stop whatever it is doing at an arbitrary point in its body , return a value back to the caller , and , later on , resume from the point it had `frozen ' and merrily proceed as if nothing had happened .
Here is a simple example :
[ Listing 1 ]
from __future__ import generators def foo( ) : print ' hello ' yield 1 print ' world ' yield 2
I am using Python 2.2 - in order to use the generator facility , a special `import ' statement should be placed at the very beginning of the file .
It may not be required in later versions .
Note the `yield ' keyword .
A function which contains a yield statement anywhere in its body is considered to be special by the Python interpreter - it is treated differently from ordinary functions .
Let 's see how :
>>> from gen1 import * >>> a = foo( ) >>> print a < generator object at 0x8158db8 >
We note that calling the function did not result in the function getting executed .
Instead , the Python interpreter gave us a `generator object ' .
This is one of the implications of using the yield statement in the body of the function .
Now , what do we do with this generator object ?
>>> a.next ( ) hello 1 >>> a.next ( ) world 2 >>> a.next () Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " line 1 , in ?
StopIteration
Calling a.next ( ) resulted in the function beginning its execution - it prints hello and comes to a dead stop at the `yield ' statement , returning the value 1 to the caller .
The function has gone back to its caller , but its `local state ' has been fully preserved .
Another invocation of a.next results in the function restarting from where it had stopped earlier - it prints `world ' and stops after returning the value 2 to the caller .
Yet another invocation of a. next results in the function `falling off ' the end - because our function is a special `generator function ' , this will result in an exception , StopIteration , being raised .
Let 's now try running a for loop on our generator :
>>> a = foo( ) >>> for i in a : ... print i ... hello 1 world 2 >>>
The for loop works by invoking a.next ( ) and assigning the value obtained to i , which then gets printed .
The strings ' hello ' and ' world ' get printed as part of the execution of `foo ' .
It would also be interesting to try out invoking the `list ' function on the generator object - we will get a list [ 1,2 ] as the result .
In both cases ( for loop as well as `list ' ) , iteration stops when the StopIteration exception is raised .
The body of a generator function should not contain a return statement of the form `return expr ' - a simple `return ' is allowed .
The PEP discusses this and many more things .
You should try running the following code :
[ Listing 2 ]
from __future__ import generators def foo(n ) : if ( n < 3 ) : yield 1 else : return yield 2
Try running a for loop over the generator objects returned by say , foo ( 10 ) and foo ( 1 ) .
Also , try calling next ( ) on these objects .
Representing infinite sequences
Generators present us with some fun ways to manipulate infinite sequences - though some people might question their practical utility !
As far as we are concerned , being fun is reason enough !
[ Listing 3 ]
from __future__ import generators def foo( ) : i = 0 while 1 : yield i i = i + 1
What we have above is the simplest possible `infinite ' generator .
Try calling next ( ) on the generator object returned by calling `foo ' .
Give this object as an argument to a `for ' loop - you will see that the loop keeps on printing numbers .
If you wish Python to eat up memory , try running `list ( foo ( ) ) ' .
Try writing a more interesting function , say a Fibonacci series generator .
Here is an infinite series of alternating positive and negative terms :
1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...
This series converges to PI / 4 .
We will write a Python generator for it .
def pi_series ( ) : sum = 0 i = 1.0 ; j = 1 while ( 1 ) : sum = sum + j / i yield 4 * sum i = i + 2 ; j = j * - 1
Each `yield ' statement keeps on returning a better approximation for PI .
Test it out by calling `next ' on the generator returned by invoking pi_series .
We note that the series does not converge very fast .
It would be convenient to have a function which would return the first N values yielded by a generator .
def firstn ( g , n ) : for i in range ( n ) : yield g.next ( )
Note that the first argument to this function is a generator object .
Here is what I got when I tried out `list ( firstn ( pi_series ( ) , 8 ) ) ':
[ 4.0 , 2.666666666666667 , 3.4666666666666668 , 2.8952380952380956 , 3.3396825396825403 , 2.9760461760461765 , 3.2837384837384844 , 3.0170718170718178 ]
We can apply a `sequence accelerator ' to convert a series of terms to a new series which converges to the original value much faster .
One such accelerator , invented by Leonhard Euler , is shown below :
( Sn+1 ) stands for the ( n+1 ) th term , ( Sn - 1 ) for the ( n - 1 ) th term .
If Sn is the n'th term of the original sequence , then the accelerated sequence has terms as shown in the equation above .
Let 's try writing a generator function which accepts a generator object and returns an `accelerated ' generator object .
def euler_accelerator(g ) : s0 = g.next ( ) # Sn - 1 s1 = g.next ( ) # Sn s2 = g.next ( ) # Sn+1 while 1 : yield s2 - ( sqr(s2 - s1 ) ) /( s0 - 2*s1 + s2 ) s0 , s1 , s2 = s1 , s2 , g.next ( )
Here is what I got when I tried printing the first few terms of this series :
[ 3.166666666666667 , 3.1333333333333337 , 3.1452380952380956 , 3.1396825396825401 , 3.1427128427128435 , 3.1408813408813416 , 3.1420718170718178 , 3.1412548236077655 ]
Note that the series is converging much faster !
You can get the program as a whole :
[ Listing 4 ]
The Eratosthenes sieve
A cute idea for `filtering out ' prime numbers , invented by the Alexandrian mathematician Eratosthenes , works as follows .
Suppose you want to find out all prime numbers below , say , 1000 .
You first cancel all multiples of 2 ( except 2 ) from a list 1..1000 .
Now you will cancel all multiples of 3 ( except 3 ) .
4 has already been canceled , as it is a multiple of 2 .
Now you will take off all multiples of 5 , except 5 .
And so on .
Ultimately , what remains in the list would be prime numbers !
Let 's start with a generator which gives us all integers from `i ' onwards :
def intsfrom ( i ) : while 1 : yield i i = i + 1
def exclude_multiples (n , ints ) : for i in ints : if ( i % n ) : yield i
Now let 's write a generator which will eliminate all multiples of a number `n ' from a sequence :
An invocation of the generator , say , list ( firstn ( exclude_multiples ( 2 , intsfrom ( 1 ) ) , 5 ) ) , will give us the list [ 1,3,5,7,9 ] .
Now , its time for us to build our `sieve ' .
def sieve ( ints ) : while 1 : prime = ints.next ( ) yield prime ints = exclude_multiples ( prime , ints )
You can get the source file containing these function definitions from here :
[ Listing 5 ]
Recursive Generators
Generator functions can call themselves recursively .
It takes some time getting used to it .
Let 's try analyzing the way the following functions work :
[ Listing 6 ]
from __future__ import generators def abc( ) : a = deff ( ) for i in a : yield i yield ' abc ' def deff ( ) : a = ijk ( ) for i in a : yield i yield ' deff ' def ijk ( ) : for i in ( 1,2,3 ) : yield i yield ' ijk '
An invocation of abc will yield a generator object .
Calling `next ' on it would result in `abc ' starting execution .
The very first line of `abc ' invokes `deff ' which returns a generator object .
After that , a.next ( ) is invoked as part of the very first iteration of the for loop .
This results in `deff ' starting execution the same way .
The body of `deff ' builds a generator object by calling `ijk ' and calls its `next ' method as part of the for loop .
This results in `ijk ' starting execution and yielding 1 , `deff ' also yields 1 , and `abc ' also yields 1 . Calling the `next ' method ( of the generator object returned by invoking `abc ' ) two more times will result in the values 2 and 3 getting propagated up .
Yet another invocation will result in the string `ijk ' propagating up the call stack because the for loop in the body of `ijk ' has terminated .
Calling `next ' again will result in the body of `ijk ' terminating , with the result that the `for ' loop in `deff ' gets a StopIteration exception , which results in that loop terminating and the function yielding the string `deff ' .
Subsequent invocation of `next ' will result in `abc ' being returned to the top level caller .
The final invocation of next ( again , note that we are invoking `next ' on the object returned by calling `abc ' ) will result in the caller getting a StopIteration exception because the body of `abc ' has also been executed in full .
Let 's now look at Guido 's binary tree example .
The classical inorder traversal is coded as below :
def inorder (t ) : if t : for x in inorder ( t.left ) : yield x yield t.dat for x in inorder ( t.right ) : yield x
a = inorder ( t.left ) for x in a : ....
Zero crossing detector
Let 's think of invoking inorder on a tree with only one node ( say containing data 50 ) .
Doing `for x in inorder ( t.left ) ' is same as : Because t.left is 0 , calling a.next ( ) ( which the for loop does ) results in a StopIteration exception - this terminates the loop immediately .
The next statement in the body is `yield t.dat ' - this returns 50 .
The next for loop also terminates immediately because of a StopIteration .
It should be easy to visualize the way the code works for more complex tree structures .
Here is the source for the program - [ Listing 7 ] .
Let 's define a `signal ' as a stream of positive and negative integers .
1 2 - 1 - 4 3 2 - 3 - 4 2 3 4 - 2 ...
A zero -crossing detector outputs a signal which describes the zero crossings of the input signal - the resulting signal is +1 whenever the input signal changes from negative to positive , - 1 whenever input signal changes from positive to negative and 0 otherwise .
We shall assume that 0 is positive .
Here is the zero-cross detector :
[ Listing 8 ]
def zerocross ( g ) : a = g.next ( ) b = g.next ( ) while 1 : yield cross_detect ( a , b ) a , b = b , g.next ( )
Acknowledgements
If the signal is coming from a sensor , noise will lead to spurious zero crossings .
So , we can think of `smoothing ' the signal ( using some form of `moving average ' computation ) and then detecting the zero crossings .
Most of the code has been `lifted ' from `test_generators.py ' , which comes with the Python source distribution .

Oil has played a fascinating side role in my Anglo Disease series , allowing the debt bubble to go on for much longer than expected .
But now , instead , it is accelerating the crash .
Let me take you through the whole cycle .
One of the more interesting things about this Friday 's economic news was the very obvious connection between the unemployment number and oil prices .
What links the two is debt , the defining feature of what I have called the Anglo Disease , ie the highly unequal economy whereby the rich and the financial sector ( almost the same thing these days ) capture most of the income but hide it by providing cheap debt to the middle classes so that they can continue to spend .
A good summary of what the Anglo Disease is about can be found in this diary , written up as an Op - Ed text , but let me take you through the concept again :
the name mirrors that of the " Dutch disease " , which was coined to describe the impact of the rapid development of the oil&gas sector in the Netherlands on therest of the economy : the high profitability of the new sector captured a high share of investment , thus weakening other parts of the economy , which were partly neglected ; in addition , the fact that it created a large boost to exports pushed the currency up , thus further making other industrial activities uncompetitive in what was a largely export - oriented economy .
The " Dutch disease " describes that shrivelling of the rest of the economy as money flowed to oil&gas producers .
in today 's economy , the cannibalistic sector is not oil&gas , but finance .
Bankers , through debt , have the ability to convert future cash - flows into immediate profits .
Such immediate returns attract more capital , talent and resources ( which can not go to other sectors ) and impose an iron discipline on the rest of the economy : those that provide the debt want to ensure that the future cash - flows will indeed materialize , and move in to ensure a relentless focus , in the underlying activities , on profitability at the expense of all other criteria .
The immediate contribution of the financial world to measured GDP and growth makes it a popular industry , thus reinforcing its influence - and spreading out its way of thinking , focused on monetary gains and financial " efficiency . "
So not only the rest of the economy gets squeezed for any extra drop of profitability , but the language of financial analysts becomes the dominant one of not only economic discourse but also political discourse ;
one of the more attractive features of the financial world , for its promoters , is its ability to concentrate huge fortunes in a small number of hands , and promote this as a good thing ( these people are said to be creating wealth , rather than capturing it ) .
Making money , lots of it , is the ultimate arbiter of not just success , but also morality ;
wealth , rather than it ) .
Making money , lots of it , is the ultimate arbiter of not just success , but also morality ; of course , the reality is that such wealth concentration is created by squeezing the rest , as is obvious in the stagnation of incomes for most in the middle and lower rungs of society .
This is not so much wealth creation as wealth redistribution , from the many to the few .
But what has made this unequality ( the fundamental feature of the Anglo Disease ) tolerable is that the financial world itself was able to provide a convenient smokescreen , in the form of cheap debt , provided in abundance to all .
The wealthy used it to grab real assets in funny money , and the rest were kindly allowed to keep on spending by tapping their future income rather than their insufficient current one ;
in a nutshell , the debt bubble hid the class warfare waged by the rich against everybody else , conveniently trapping those that could not or would not live within their means in the system , by making their livelihood increasingly dependent on not rocking the boat .
but the debt bubble was ( duh ) a debt bubble , and it is now bursting , as it inevitably would .
What matters is how the pain is shared , and , right now , it does not look as it will be shared the same way the loot was on the way up .
The whole cycle was just a way to permanently transfer wealth from the many to the few .
It was wilfully created by the combination of ultra low interest rates as set by the Fed ( thus my moniker of " Bubbles " Greenspan ) , tax cuts for the rich ( Bush 's helpful but hardly invisible hand ) and the permanent propaganda for liberalisation , deregulation , " reform " and " freedom . "
The outside world had a role in this bubble , because part of the squeeze on the working classes was made possible by the threat of outsourcing and offshorisation to China , India et al ( which kept wages in check and workers tame ) , and a lot of the bubble was in turn funded by the surplus cash generated by these countries through their exports and their policies to keep their currencies weak ( to maintain their price competitivity ) , which had them accumulate huge amounts of dollars which they then lent back to the US via the purchase of Treasurys .
This is where oil shows up for the first time in the story : the growing demand from China , India et al. started pushing prices up as this happened at a time when supply was suddenly become tighter .
Paradoxically , the oil price increases provided an additional boost to the debt bubble : while they started biting into consumer spending , they also generated a new round of cheap liquidity , as oil producing countries suddenly found themselves with huge amounts of money , in dollars , which they could not , or chose not to , spend right away - presto , these were invested into Treasurys , ie loaned to the US .
This provided the liquidity to finance consumer spending in the US ( including for gas ) and kept the interest rates on long term debt very low ( demand for bonds pushes the price for bonds up , and thus brings the yield , is the interest rate , down ) .
This happened at a time when the Fed had finally decided to increase its short term rates as it could no longer justify the extravagantly low rates of 2001 - 2004 and created what Greenspan called his " conundrum " - that apparent disconnect between short term and long term interest rates .
It was just the bubble going on afterburner , thanks to oil prices .
Effectively , the liquidity created by high oil prices hid for two years the fact that the bubble was bursting .
But now , everything is aligned - in the wrong direction :
the debt bubble is bursting , as long announced by observers not blinded by greed or ideology , with all the expected pain : the real estate crash , the banking crisis , the foreclosures , and the coming inevitable recession ;
the income capture mechanisms set up during the bubble have not been reversed , so the pain is falling disproportionately on the poorest , and the finance world ( ie the rich ) is being bailed out .
The rescue of Bear Stearns may have inflicted pain on shareholders , but it saved bondholders , which is unprecedented and ominous .
Public discourse is still largely about " reform " , tax cuts and " letting the market " solve things ;
and oil prices are still going up , and are biting increasingly hard into people 's incomes .
They are going up because of global trends ( oil production from friendly regions are inconveniently declining now , after a couple of decades temporarily hiding the reality of global scarcity ; the countries that piggybacked on the US debt - fuelled growth have prospered and are consuming more , oil producing countries are booming and using more oil themselves , and their growing prosperity makes them more assertive and less willing to listen to Western pleas to produce more and / or to let oil majors have access to their resources : thus , for a combination of political and geological reasons , oil supply is stagnant ) , and our own economic woes will not be enough to bring them down : they will thus worsen the economic outlook here ;
an additional factor that comes in is that an alternative to the dollar exists : the euro .
For the first time , the rest of the world has the possibility to store value elsewhere than in dollar - denominated instruments .
The debt bubble was largely a dollar phenomenon , and the easiest way to deflate it is to lower the value of the dollar .
Gold played that role in the past , but it's not that convenient a tool ; now the euro is the perfect outlet to express skepticism about the value of the dollar .
As this makes investors less keen to hold dollars able to actually do something about it , it WILL drive interest rates up in the US , after many years of flows the other way round keeping them down .
Yesterday was a perfect demonstration of these links .
Beyond the bellicose words against Iran coming from Israel , what drove the markets yesterday was the announcement that the unemployment rate had gone up a lot more than was expected ( to 5.5 % instead of the 5.1 % predicted by analysts ) .
That announcement , in turn , made the markets brutally change their expectations about future Fed rate changes .
They had been expecting increases in the coming months , to fight inflation , but increases are impossible , politically , at a time when unemplyment is going up rapidly .
The expectation of lower short term rates in turn drove the dollar down ( especially as this came the day after the European Central Bank said that it would increase rates itself this summer ) .
The flight away from the dollar then pushed commodities up , and in particular oil .
As speculators had been betting on oil prices going down , they were wrongfooted and had to abandon their positions brutally to avoid further losses , thus magnifying the price increase ( an aside here : speculators were betting on oil going down not up ) .
So there you have it : wage stagnation ( Anglo Disease ) and oil production stagnation ( the fundamental driver of the Countdown diaries ) combining in a perfect storm .
But hey , the financiers are still sitting pretty , and will say that more " reform " and " deregulation " and tax cuts are needed .
Maybe it 's time to stop listening to what is highly self - interested drivel , and take back what they grabbed : it 's not theirs .
And maybe it 's time to actually worry about using lots less oil ( and gas and coal ) .
And , wonderfully , a programme to invest in housing and vehicle energy efficiency , renewable energy , and infrastructure , paid for by massive tax hikes on the rich , will help solve the current recession and the oil crisis .
But Hillary , is n’t that YOUR fault ?

I was reading David Brooks ’ column today and I am not sure what his point was , as this stopped me in my tracks :
New dynamos like India and China threaten American dominance thanks to their cheap labor and manipulated currencies .
Now , everything is made abroad .
American manufacturing is in decline .
The rest of the economy is threatened .
Hillary Clinton summarized the narrative this week : “ They came for the steel companies and nobody said anything .
They came for the auto companies and nobody said anything .
They came for the office companies , people who did white - collar service jobs , and no one said anything .
And they came for the professional jobs that could be outsourced , and nobody said anything . ”
Now , correct me if I am wrong , but was n’t it the Clinton Administration – including the first lady – that promoted NAFTA , as well as granted Most Favored Nation status to China ?
And has n’t she been in the Senate for eight years and on the national stage for 16 ?
Should n’t she have said something before now ?
You know , something other than this :
“ I think , on balance , NAFTA has been good for New York and America . ” ( Jan. 5 , 2004 )
or this :
or this :
Beyond that , the language she uses to describe the current situation is based on a very famous bit of poetry about the Holocaust and Hillary seems to have learned nothing from it .
The point is to speak out against injustice even if it does n’t seem to effect you ( the ends with “ And then . . . they came for me . . .
And by that time there was no one left to speak up ” ) .
But Hillary , who was IN POWER THE WHOLE TIME , said nothing until she got to Ohio in 2008 and realized that primary voters there were not happy about NAFTA .
During all of her time in Washington , she defended NAFTA , despite what she says now .
It is one thing to say she opposed it but could n’t speak out because she was a member of the administration , but her most famous quote is from 2004 , well after Bush took over the big chair and she was a senator .
And if she supported NAFTA in 2004 , but now says she did n’t , the real question is , to whom was she lying : New Yorkers or Ohioans ?
That ’s not leadership .
That ’s Bush - style revisionist history .
One would think a senator could speak her mind on the issues .
Perhaps if they came for cushy government jobs , then she would have spoken out …
Behind the falsification of US economic data
By Peter Daniels
2 June 2008
In recent years , it has become increasingly clear to those who follow US economic statistics that there is something dubious about the numbers released by official government agencies and used to guide many aspects of social and public policy .
The details and chronology of the corruption of economic data are presented in a new book by Kevin Phillips , the political commentator and former Republican Party adviser who has become something of a muckraking critic of the “ excesses ” that he helped set in motion .
The book is entitled , Bad Money : Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism Phillips summarizes some of his main conclusions in an article in the current issue of Harper ’s Magazine .
The article focuses primarily on three measures : the monthly Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , the quarterly Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , and the monthly figure for the unemployment rate .
Phillips convincingly demonstrates that the real unemployment rate in the United States is between 9 and 12 percent , not the 5 percent or less that is officially claimed .
The real rate of inflation is not 2 or 3 percent , but instead , between 7 and 10 percent .
And real economic growth has been about 1 percent , not the 3 - 4 percent officially claimed during the most recent Wall Street and housing bubble that has burst .
Phillips ’s background makes his statements all the more significant .
He was a prime strategist for Nixon ’s 1968 presidential campaign and one of the main architects of the notorious “ Southern strategy , ” through which the old Republican Party of Wall Street and Main Street refashioned itself with a right - wing populist appeal , stoking racial antagonisms while above all capitalizing on the bankruptcy of American liberalism to shift the political spectrum sharply to the right .
The corruption of official statistics is not the work of one administration , and Phillips traces it back nearly 50 years .
The current occupant of the White House has , in fact , been somewhat less active on this front than his predecessors .
Soon after John F. Kennedy took office in 1961 , Phillips points out , he appointed a committee to recommend possible changes in the measurement of official joblessness .
What soon followed was the use of the category of “ discouraged workers ” to exclude all those who had stopped looking for jobs because they were n’t available .
Many who had lost employment in basic industry , in a trend that was just beginning to pick up steam with automation and the rise of global competitors in such industries as steel and auto production , were no longer counted as unemployed .
During the administration of Lyndon Johnson , the federal government began using the concept of a “ unified budget ” that combined Social Security with other expenditures , thus allowing the current Social Security surplus to disguise growing budget deficits .
As Phillips reports , Nixon tried to tackle the “ problem ” of statistics in typically Nixonian fashion : he actually proposed that the Labor Department simply publish whichever was the lower figure between seasonally adjusted and unadjusted unemployment numbers .
This was apparently deemed too brazen an attempt at manipulation and was never implemented .
Under Nixon ’s Federal Reserve chairman , Arthur Burns , however , the concept of “ core inflation ” was devised .
This became the means of excluding certain areas like food and energy , on grounds of the “ volatility ” of these sectors .
The suggestion was that these prices jumped and then sometimes fell , so that it was best to remove them from the prices surveyed .
In fact , food and energy together accounted for an enormous portion of spending for most sections of the working class and , as Phillips also explains , these two sectors are “ now verging on another 1970s - style price surge . ”
As of last January , Phillips writes , the price of imported goods had increased 13.7 percent compared with a year earlier , the biggest jump since these statistics began in 1982 .
Gasoline prices , meanwhile , have soared by more than 30 percent since just the beginning of this year .
The Reagan administration addressed itself to the pesky problem of housing in the inflation index .
An “ Owner Equivalent Rent ” measurement was dreamed up for the purpose of artificially lowering the cost of housing — from a purely abstract statistical standpoint .
Under Reagan , Phillips also points out , the armed forces began to be included in the labor force and among the employed , thus reducing the unemployment rate , even though these same members of the military would in many cases have no employment in civilian life .
George H.W. Bush and his Council of Economic Advisers proposed the recalculation of inflation statistics to give greater weight to the service and retail sectors and , again , reduce the official rate of inflation .
This change was actually implemented during the Clinton administration .
Clinton also carried out other changes , including a reduction in the monthly household sampling from 60,000 to 50,000 , a decrease that was concentrated in the inner cities and had the effect of reducing official jobless figures among African - Americans .
The Clinton years were an especially active time for imaginative tinkering with economic data .
Three other “ adjustments ” in the Consumer Price Index were implemented under the Democratic administration : product substitution , geometric weighting , and hedonic adjustment .
Product substitution means that , for example , if steak gets too expensive , individuals substitute hamburger .
Steak is simply removed from the typical food basket even though it has been used in the past to track price changes .
Geometric weighting is defined as lower weighting in the price index for those goods and services that are rising most rapidly in cost , on the assumption that they are consumed in lower quantities .
This may of course be true , but the aim is to reduce the inflation figure , covering up the fact that some items are no longer affordable for tens of millions of people .
Phillips is particularly scathing about “ hedonic adjustment , ” also implemented during Clinton ’s presidency .
In this concept , the supposedly improved quality of some products and services is translated into a reduction in their effective cost .
This is another obvious attempt to reduce official inflation .
“ Reversing the theory , however , the declining quality of goods or services should adjust effective prices and therefore add to inflation , ” Phillips writes , “ but that side of the equation generally goes missing . ”
Phillips explains that every single one of the statistical revisions implemented over the past two generations have become permanent .
Once initiated by a Democratic or Republican administration , they were carried over to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other agencies in bipartisan fashion , no matter who the current occupant of the White House was .
To all of the above should be added one other element , which Phillips does not discuss , perhaps because it does not stem from the economic data itself .
That is the explosive growth of the US prison population , which has soared over the last 30 years and now stands at 2.3 million , compared to an overall labor force of 153.1 million .
This situation , the outcome of the misnamed war on drugs and the overall bipartisan law - and - order hysteria , keeps the official unemployment rate artificially low .
Between the army and the prison system , official joblessness is reduced by perhaps 2 percent .
Phillips points out that all of the changes in economic recordkeeping over the past 50 years were not the result of some grand conspiracy .
They certainly did not stem from a master plan hatched in the 1960s or 1970s , of course .
This does not mean , however , that there is no logic to these developments , no broader economic and political source .
The corruption of economic data corresponds to deepening contradictions of US and world capitalism .
These contradictions impelled the bourgeoisie to abandon a general policy of social reform that had lasted for more than three decades , and to embark on what has been termed a “ one - sided class war , ” in which the services of the pro-capitalist trade unions were utilized to carry out an unprecedented transfer of wealth from the working population to a tiny ruling elite .
There was a step - by - step logic to all of the measures that were taken to misrepresent basic economic statistics .
Big business could not have carried out the policies it required without falsifying economic reality .
Even though daily life became increasingly difficult for huge sections of the working class , it was necessary to divide and disorient , to intimidate millions with the claim that “ there is no alternative , ” and that what Reagan referred to as the magic of the marketplace was creating a veritable golden age from which everyone would benefit .
Some of the consequences of the falsification of data can be translated into dollars and cents .
If the CPI had not been systematically understated , Phillips explains , Social Security checks would be 70 percent greater than they currently are .
Beyond the direct impact on Social Security and other government expenditures , an artificially low unemployment rate and poverty rate ( officially reported as 12 percent , but in fact at least twice that figure ) helped the financial and political establishment to reduce living standards and social conditions .
How many countless think tank reports and magazine articles , trumpeted by Democratic and Republican politicians and academic figures alike , took as the gospel truth that the “ Anglo - American ” model of capitalism , compared to its more regulated rivals in France and Germany , meant lower unemployment ?
This and similar claims were based largely on lies .
American capitalism once prided itself on the accuracy of its economic statistics .
An alphabet soup of regulatory agencies carried out this work .
During the decades of the Cold War , the spokesmen for big business always pointed to the mockery of economic data produced by the Stalinist regimes as one more proof of the superiority of the profit system .
Today , however , the growing crisis is producing a historic reversal .
Where American capitalism once required accurate data , today it requires lies .
Phillips ’s revelations share something with those of former White House press secretary Scott McClellan .
They are not exactly news , but they represent a kind of barometer of the growing crisis that is forcing its way into the open within official and semi-official circles .
Artist Erik Nordenankar has created the “ Biggest Drawing in the World ” according to his webpage .

iOS 11 Beta 2 has been released on 9 October and it looks like it introduced some new changes and features .
One of the most important addition to the Beta 2 version of iOS 11 is related to the Unicode 10 Emoji characters .
Other new things in the Beta 2 are bug fixes for the Home Screen , tweaks in the SOS Emergency preferences and some multitasking with the 3D touch option .
Two Teams , One iOS
We have two teams : the users of iOS 11 are either excited about the new Emoji , or about the 3D Touch gestures .
The latter option was removed in the previous iOS ( Beta 1 ) , but it came back in this new Beta version with an improved animation , being easier to get it started than before .
With the 3D touch multitasking option , you can use a device that has this feature enabled and try some commands such as invoking the App Switcher or use it for switching between the last two apps that you recently used .
A lot of iOS 11 users have been pleased about the 3D feature and when they saw it gone , they were quite frustrated about it , as they frequently used it .
If you ’re one of those who want to know more about the emoji , then do n’t worry as there are new ones available , in different colors and genders , including dinosaurs or a pretzel , a wizard , grasshopper , broccoli , a zombie and a lot more .
For those that have enrolled in the beta testing programs , then they can check out Settings -> General ->
Software Update , and see if they have their iOS updated to the last Beta version .
If there are more new features in the iOS 11 Beta that we have n’t mentioned , then we would like to hear them from you and how they impact your experience .
GRIFFIN , Ga.  Tim Williams ' goal was to create a device to test soil moisture around peanut pods , but his modest invention is now helping probe the soil of the Red Planet for traces of water .
Williams was on sabbatical in 1987 working with a Washington State University team led by soil scientist Gaylon Campbell when he started to design a device to measure the water content around delicate peanut pods without destroying them .
RELATED ARTICLE : Mars lander probes first microscope sample
His handheld contraption has two parallel needles — one is heated with a known quantity of energy and the other measures what happens to that heat when it 's put into the ground .
The tool was uncomplicated .
Most of the University of Georgia agronomist 's half - dozen or so inventions are simplifications of more complex measuring instruments .
Williams also designed a device to measure radiation in crops to help scientists understand the productivity of a crop and he devised a gauge of leaf coverage on the ground to estimate how much light penetrates ground cover .
He 'd forgotten the peanut invention until he got a call last year saying it would be part of NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander .
Campbell 's company , Decagon Devices , had updated the contraption for the Mars mission , making it more durable and adding the capacity to measure the thermal and electrical properties , air temperature , wind speed and water vapor .
It is mounted on a robotic arm that will excavate a trench in the planet 's surface .
For Williams , who has researched peanuts for 38 years , it 's exhilarating to see his brainchild delve into the subsoil of the Red Planet .
" I got much more excited when it hit Mars and survived the impact , " Williams said .
" It 's one of those little things you look at and say , ' Wow . ' "

[ C ] ampaign insiders say that the former president 's future campaign role is a " sticking point " in peace talks with Mrs Clinton 's aides .
The Telegraph has learned that the former president 's rage is still so great that even loyal allies are shocked by his patronising attitude to Mr Obama , and believe that he risks damaging his own reputation by his intransigence .
A senior Democrat who worked for Mr Clinton has revealed that he recently told friends Mr Obama could " kiss my ass " in return for his support .
This link no longer works at The Raw Story .
Hmmm .
But it works here
A second source said that the former president has kept his distance because he still does not believe Mr Obama can win the election .

Consumers are worried about the state of the US economy Confidence among US consumers hit its lowest level for 16 years in May , according to the Conference Board .
The research body 's Consumer Confidence Index fell to a level of 57.2 in May , down from April 's figure of 62.8 .
The Conference Board blamed the pessimism on the short - term outlook for the US economy as well as weakening business and job conditions .
The figures tell a similar story to the University of Michigan 's Index , which hit a 28 - year low in May .
" There is a fear the economy is in a recession or going into one and people may find their jobs in jeopardy , " said David Coard from the Williams Capital Group in New York .
" When you talk to people on the street they seem to be really being squeezed at the pump and the supermarket while their income is n't keeping up . "
Turnaround unlikely The Conference Board also issued pessimistic forecasts for the coming months .
" Consumers ' inflation expectations , fuelled by increasing prices at the pump , are now at an all - time high and are likely to rise further in the months ahead , " said Lynn Franco , director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center .
" As for the short - term outlook , the Expectations Index suggests little likelihood of a turnaround in the immediate months ahead . "
The index is based on responses from 5,000 US households .
It has plunged since last July , when it stood at 111.9 .
Since then , the housing slump and rising prices for food and fuel have taken their toll on the mood among consumers .
The figures are closely watched because consumer spending accounts for two - thirds of all economic activity in the US .

One evening last autumn a group of about 10 artist managers , including representatives for the pop stars Kylie Minogue and Robbie Williams as well as an executive who oversees the Beatles catalog , clustered around a table in an executive dining room at the London headquarters of EMI .
The purpose was to size up the new boss , Guy Hands , and discuss the future of the record business .
Mr. Hands , the private equity financier who had made a fortune sprucing up pubs in England and gas stations on the German autobahn , told the gathering that Rupert Murdoch had privately scoffed at his acquisition of EMI by saying , “ MySpace is going to be the future of music , not record labels . ”
“ I said I was going to prove him wrong , ” Mr. Hands recalled in a recent interview .
It has been almost 10 months since Mr. Hands , through his private equity firm Terra Firma , bought EMI for about $ 6.4 billion , and by several accounts , including Mr. Hands ’s own , it has been a chaotic time .
The company now wobbles under a huge debt load , a leadership vacuum  it has no chief executive and most major decisions are made by Mr. Hands  and low morale among many of its employees .
Mr. Hands said about 80 percent of the $ 6.4 billion paid for EMI was for the music publishing unit , which owns copyrights and provides a steady flow of cash .
Cheap gas and diesel due to government fuel subsidies has become one of the favored whipping boys of late — a convenient way to blame high oil prices on the actions of some other government or faraway people ( See 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ) .
But how much can subsidies really be blamed for present oil demand ?
Would cutting a 30 % gasoline subsidy reduce demand by 30 % ?
Why not ?
I ’ll stake out and defend a somewhat extreme position : reducing , or even eliminating fuel subsidies will not cause a significant , long - term reduction in demand and may even cause demand to increase more quickly than with subsidies in place .
More importantly , we must not fall prey to claims that cutting fuel subsidies is an easy solution to our energy problems .
Fuel subsidies are currently in place for nearly half the world ’s population .
Fuel subsidies around the world have previously been covered at The Oil Drum in Fun With Subsidies and Taxes , as well as numerous articles in the media on the topic in the past few weeks ( links above ) .
Additionally , most OECD states indirectly subsidize fuel consumption in a variety of ways .
I wo n’t rehash this existing coverage , though I do need to point out that every article *
I ’ve been able to locate has argued that cutting subsidies will have a significant effect on demand , and will help to lower oil prices ( * only one analyst , Benoit de Vitry of Barclay Capital , seem to agree with me ) .
To me , this wave of media coverage of subsidies is just like the waves of media coverage past on speculators , big oil conspiracies , and the promise of oil shale : a source of false hope that a magical solution exists to our energy problems .
For that reason , my intent here is to argue that the long - term effect of cutting fuel subsidies is , contrary to the reports in the media , not of much significance .
Demand Elasticity is a Marginal Matter
The first reason that cutting subsidies wo n't have a dramatic impact on demand is that the fuel demand elasticity of a country is the aggregate of the marginal demand elasticity of each of its consumers .
For that reason , the elimination of a 30 % subsidy for fuel will not result in a proportional drop in demand of 30 % .
For some users , price increase will completely price them out of the market , and their marginal demand will be completely eliminated .
For others , either because of wealth or the value of liquid fuels to their economic activity , the elimination of the subsidy will result in no decline in consumption .
The vast majority of consumers will lie somewhere in between .
Therefore , right at the outset , we can say that the elimination of a 30 % subsidy will not result in a 30 % drop in demand .
I ’d love to be more precise on this point , but neither the data nor methodology currently exists to project with any confidence exactly how much demand reduction would result from the elimination of subsidies — all we can say with any certainty is that it will be smaller than the size of the subsidy eliminated .
Evaluating the Energy Intensity of the Opportunity Cost to Subsidy Expenditures
The next question — and perhaps the most important — is to evaluate the opportunity cost of a government ’s expenditures on fuel subsidies .
If a government does’t spend $ X billion on fuel subsidies , what will it spend the money on ?
What is the energy intensity of that expenditure compared to the amount of demand reduced through cutting the subsidy ?
Take India , for example .
In India , the total cost of fuel subsidies could be as high as 2 - 3 % of GDP .
What happens to that spending if it does n’t subsidize fuel use ?
There are two theories here , both of which create at least some fuel consumption that did n’t exist before .
One theory is that it will be spent in a way that results in lower fuel consumption — but almost certainly not in a way that results in NO fuel consumption .
The argument in favor of this position is that , because fuel subsidies distort economic calculations in favor of consuming fuel , a neutral use of the same amount of funds should result in less fuel consumption .
However , there is an opposing position : because subsidies are , according to market theory , a sub-optimal allocation of resources when compared to free - market allocation , the elimination of subsidies will result in stronger economic growth ( or less economic decline ) than with the subsidies .
This is especially true if the money saved from subsidies is n’t spent at all , but rather reduces the tax burden or lowers the rate of inflation .
It remains potentially true to a lesser degree even if the money is merely spent elsewhere , since neutral spending is likely to have a less distorting effect on economic activity .
Therefore , according to this theory , elimination of a fuel subsidy may actually result in greater fuel demand over the long term — and that demand may be even more inelastic because it stems from a more efficient allocation of resources .
This is the argument of Benoit de Vitry of Barclay ’s Capital .
In the end , it may come down to this question :
What ’s worse ( from the admittedly very skewed perspective of demand management ) : 100 million Indian middle class paying 40 % under market for diesel with a GDP growth rate of 5 % , or 200 million Indian middle class paying market for diesel with a GDP growth rate of 7 % ?
Cutting Subsidies Wo n’t Slow the “ Export - Land ” Effect
Finally , cutting fuel subsidies in exporting nations wo n’t significantly slow the grinding effect of the Export Land Model , whereby rising revenues of fuel exporting countries lead to increasing domestic consumption and declining net exports .
What happens if subsidies are suddenly cut , and citizens of Venezuela or Saudi Arabia have to pay the market rate for oil ?
The extra money they spend on oil goes to their own government , rather than to some other nation .
And that money can then be spent on other projects or programs — the opportunity cost issue noted above .
However , to make the cuts in subsidies viable , they are likely to be offset by progressive spending plans that disproportionately benefit the poor .
This is exactly what is currently happening in Malaysia .
The result may actually increase demand : the rich , who are not the beneficiaries of these offsetting handouts , are also the least likely to reduce their demand due to price rises .
The poor , who may otherwise reduce their demand , are the most directly benefited by the handouts .
And , because it may be possible to prevent any demand destruction by simply handing out 1 /2 or 2/3 of the money previously spent on subsidies to the poorest consumers , there is likely to be money left over to be spent elsewhere ( or not taxed in the first place ) , which brings us right back to the previous discussion on the energy intensity of that alternative spending .
To conclude , I ’m certainly not advocating the maintenance or increase of existing fuel subsidies .
They are an inefficient allocation of resources , resulting in less economic activity for every barrel of oil consumed .
Rather , my intent here is only to dispel the notion — increasingly popular of late — that eliminating fuel subsidies is some kind of magic bullet to derail the demand train .
At best , I think the elimination of fuel subsidies will result in a minor and short - term decrease in the rate of demand growth in developing nations .
It will not significantly alter the energy crisis facing humanity .
Either way , the elimination of subsidies may not be politically practicable — where they have been cut there have been riots ( 1 2 ) , and there are numerous movements attempting to actually increase fuel subsidies ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) .

A construction company has developed solar panels that use peel - and - stick technology to attach to roofs .
That ’s right : Lumeta ’s Power - Ply 380 is a solar panel sticker .
The product ’s adhesive back allows it to be installed about twice as fast as conventional rack - mounted solar panels .
Check out the video to see a speedy installation .
Coming from Lumeta , a subsidiary of DRI , a $ 90 million a year construction company headquartered in Irvine , the product is another sign that energy generation is being incorporated into conventional building practices .
" Solar needs to become part of the building envelope and this is a step towards that , " said Stephen Torres , COO of Lumeta .
" The whole idea was [ to ] create a new product that integrates better with the roof system . "
While the panels are lighter and easier to install than traditional tilt - it systems , the downside is that by sticking flat on the roof , they lose the optimal angle to the sun .
Torres says that costs his company ’s panels about five percent of their power production .
As is , the panels claim peak power generation of 380 watts ( pdf ) in a " typical installation . "
With energy prices rising to records levels , the amount and variety of solar cells and solar systems is increasing by leaps and bounds , offering new options for consumers and businesses that want to take making electricity into their own hands .
So far , Lumeta has lined up several projects totaling about 500 kilowatts of electricity generation that will begin at the end of June .
In total , they ’ve got five megawatts worth of panels in the pipeline from Suntech , a major solar cell manufacturer .
While the hassle of installation of solar panels has almost certainly slowed its acceptance , it ’s not the only hangup for photovoltaics .
Most solar systems cost at least $ 10,000 to install , depending on your state ’s incentive programs , and you do n’t make your money back in electric bill savings for more than a decade .
So , even with the increased ease of installation provided by these stickers , solar photovoltaic panels probably wo n’t prove the only answer for clean energy generation in the foreseeable future .
The stickers are n’t available for home installations , but Lumeta does offer a panel system designed to integrate with those terra -cotta tiles that developers love .
Dutch people eager to dissociate themselves from the anti-Quran film Fitna have taken to the web to apologize for the controversial video .
Hundreds of Dutch citizens have uploaded videos to YouTube showing themselves holding signs with apologies for the film .
In other anti-Fitna clips , the subjects simply say the words , " I 'm sorry . "
Fitna , a 17 - minute film by Dutch politician Geert Wilders , juxtaposes passages from the Islamic holy book with graphic footage of terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe .
In one scene , the sound of paper ripping can be seen as a reader pages through the Quran .
A website called Sorry for the Film encourages users to upload photos of themselves to indicate they do not support the views propagated in Fitna .
Mediamatic , a technology collective based in Amsterdam , posted instructions for making " Sorry Fitna " videos .
Fitna , which was posted Thursday to LiveLeak , received more than 3 million views before the video - hosting site removed it Friday .
The film subsequently appeared on Google Video and YouTube .
LiveLeak restored the video Sunday , with a note reading : " We have decided to once more make this video live on our site .
We will not be pressured into censoring material which is legal and within our rules . "
After its release , the film drew condemnation from Arabs and a call for a boycott of the Netherlands .
Wilders said Monday he would cut a controversial cartoon by Danish artist Kurt Westergaard from the film to avoid a lawsuit by the Danish Union of Journalists .
The cartoon , which depicts the prophet Muhammad with a bomb - shaped turban , sparked protests in 2006 .

Researchers have engineered a metamaterial that uses tiny geometric surface features to successfully capture the electric and magnetic properties of a microwave to the point of total absorption .

A team of scientists from Boston College and Duke University has developed a highly - engineered metamaterial capable of absorbing all of the light that strikes it – to a scientific standard of perfection – they report in Physical Review Letters .
The team designed and engineered a metamaterial that uses tiny geometric surface features to successfully capture the electric and magnetic properties of a microwave to the point of total absorption .
“ Three things can happen to light when it hits a material , ” says Boston College Physicist Willie J. Padilla .
“ It can be reflected , as in a mirror .
It can be transmitted , as with window glass .
Or it can be absorbed and turned into heat .
This metamaterial has been engineered to ensure that all light is neither reflected nor transmitted , but is turned completely into heat and absorbed .
It shows we can design a metamaterial so that at a specific frequency it can absorb all of the photons that fall onto its surface . ”
In addition to Padilla , the team included BC researcher Nathan I. Landy , Duke University Professor David R. Smith and researchers Soji Sajuyigbe and Jack J. Mock .
The group used computer simulations based on prior research findings in the field to design resonators able to couple individually to electric and magnetic fields to successfully absorb all incident radiation , according to their findings .
Because its elements can separately absorb the electric and magnetic components of an electromagnetic wave , the “ perfect metamaterial absorber ” created by the researchers can be highly absorptive over a narrow frequency range .
The metamaterial is the first to demonstrate perfect absorption and unlike conventional absorbers it is constructed solely out of metallic elements , giving the material greater flexibility for applications related to the collection and detection of light , such as imaging .
Metamaterial designs give them new properties beyond the limits of their actual physical components and allow them to produce “ tailored ” responses to radiation .
Because their construction makes them geometrically scalable , metamaterials are able to operate across a significant portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .

Bush Administration Takes Aim at National Parks Gun Ban
WASHINGTON , DC , May 1 , 2008 ( ENS ) – The Bush administration on Wednesday announced its intent to shoot down federal rules that prohibit individuals from carrying loaded firearms in U.S. national parks and wildlife refuges .
The proposal would permit individuals to carry loaded and concealed weapons if permitted by state laws in the state where the park or refuge is located , a change many current and retired park rangers contend is unnecessary and potentially dangerous .
U.S. Interior Department officials said the proposed change would clarify conflicting state and federal restrictions .
The 61 units of the National Park Service where hunting is permitted , as well as the public lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management , follow state laws on firearms .
Concealed handguns would be allowed in national parks under the proposed regulation , if allowed in the state where the park is located .
( Photo credit unknown )
" The safety and protection of park and refuge visitors remains a top priority , " said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne .
" The proposed regulations will incorporate current state laws authorizing the possession of concealed firearms , while continuing to maintain important provisions to ensure visitor safety and resource protection . "
Firearms were first banned in national parks in the 1930s in a bid to curb poaching .
The current rules , implemented under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s , allow visitors to national parks and refuges to possess firearms so long as they are " rendered temporarily inoperable or are packed , cased or stored in a manner that will prevent their ready use . "
" Much has changed in how states administer their firearm laws in that time , " U.S. Interior Department Assistant Secretary Lyle Laverty .
Forty - eight U.S. states now have laws allowing for legal possession of concealed weapons .
The administration believes that management of national parks and wildlife refuges " should defer to those state laws , " Laverty said .
But an array of park advocacy and law enforcement groups view the change as foolish and argue the administration is catering to the wishes of the U.S. gun lobby .
" This is purely and simply a politically - driven effort to solve a problem that does n't exist , " said Bill Wade , chairman of the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees .
" There are no existing data that suggest any public interest to be gained by allowing visitors to parks to possess concealed handguns . "
Seven former National Park Service directors sent Kempthorne a letter last month echoing that sentiment .
Other parks groups , including the Association of National Park Rangers , the Ranger Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police , and the National Parks Conservation Association have also urged the Interior Department not to change the current restrictions .
" Do visitors want other visitors with concealed handguns sitting next to them in park concession restaurants , or in park visitor center auditoriums during interpretive programs , or walking with them during ranger - guided walks ? " asked Wade , former superintendent at Shenandoah National Park .
" Will parks and concessionaires now have to install metal detectors at the entrances to lodges and visitor centers and other administrative facilities ? "
Critics of the proposal contend these concerns would cause major headaches for the Park Service , adding that it is unclear what would be done in parks that have boundary lines in multiple states .
" The question we are asking is do the American people perceive a need to change a long - standing regulation or are they happy with the results of managing parks with regard to loaded guns , " said Scot McElveen , president of the Association of National Park Rangers .
Parks are among the safest places in the country , according to advocacy groups , who contend the likelihood of becoming a victim of a violent crime in a park or wildlife refuge is one in 708,000 .
Many state parks permit loaded and accessible guns .

But the proposal is viewed a victory by the National Rifle Association and at least 51 U.S. senators , who began pressing Kempthorne to issue the new plan late last year .
One proponent of the change - Senator Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican - threatened in January to try and force the new regulation by amending a public lands bill , but abandoned the effort once Kempthorne indicated his support for relaxing the gun ban .
Today , Senator Coburn 's press secretary Don Tatro told ENS that even if a regulation allowing guns in parks is passed , the senator intends to reintroduce legislation this year because he wants to make the measure " permanent . "
Supporters of the proposal contend the existing rule violates the constitutional gun rights of U.S. citizens and argue that law - abiding individuals should be allowed to carry weapons for self - protection .
" It is important that we provide consistency in firearm regulations and recognize states ' rights in this matter , " said Senator Mike Crapo , an Idaho Republican and leading advocate of the change .
Other lawmakers , however , remain unconvinced .
The proposal is " appalling " and would create " an incoherent , ineffective and inconsistent patchwork of policies , " said Senator Dianne Feinstein , a California Demcorat .
" The American public consistently rates our national parks at the top of federal government programs that work well , " Feinstein added .
" There is no need to ' fix ' a system that our citizens tell us is not broken . "
The public has until June 30 to comment on the proposed rule change .
SANTA MONICA , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
With so much attention being given to the tragedy in Myanmar -- new figures put the number of dead or missing at 70,000 due to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis -- it 's worth looking at our own shores for potential catastrophe : Half the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of seashore .
In terms of dollars , businesses would be hit the hardest in a U.S. coastal disaster .
Taking that into consideration , private and public sector groups are looking at ways to find public policy and private - market solutions to better protect coastal communities .
The Resilient Coasts Initiative is one such effort .
Launched last week by the socially responsible business organization Ceres and the H. John Heinz III Center for Science , Economics and the Environment , it is bringing together a broad coalition of insurers , regulators , politicians , environmental organizations , real estate developers and investors to address the need for climate adaptation to reduce ever - increasing coastal risks in the United States .
Participants include American International Group , Inc. , Travelers , Risk Management Solutions and the chief financial officer of the State of Florida .
" Coastal protection needs to be part of our national conversation on climate change , " says Ceres president Mindy Lubber , in announcing the joint venture with the Heinz Center at the Ceres conference in Boston last week .
" This is an historic moment in which public and private - sector leaders recognize the rising threat of climate change in coastal communities and the need for strong policies and market - based solutions to reduce that exposure . "
The initiative is eerily prescient .
Cyclone Nargis last weekend ripped through Myanmar , formerly Burma , affecting some 1.5 million people , according to the United Nations .
Major weather events are sure to bring collateral damage , and that damage is costing lives as well as lots of money .
Residents of Cape Cod , for example , have seen their home insurance premiums double over the past two years .
In many coastal communities insurance companies are refusing to underwrite coverage at all .
New solutions are needed
While it 's tempting , bad weather should n't be mistaken for climate change .
Weather is today , or next week .
Climate change is the likelihood of weather events over a period of years .
Unfortunately we are at the bend in the global climate .
It means more than policy .
It means people , places and things are affected .
Societies must learn to adapt ( how about putting more resources into better predictions ! ) and businesses too .
" When we 're all getting tired of rhetoric , we are seizing the opportunity to establish a blueprint for protecting our most vulnerable places and people , " says Thomas Lovejoy , president of the Heinz Center .
The cost of Hurricane Katrina , the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean and now Myanmar 's cyclone point to reasons why we must create an early - alert system for those places most vulnerable to severe weather events .
Of the 180 countries in the world with low - lying coastal zones , 130 of them , including the U.S. , have built their largest cities on these zones .
So far , no mega cities have been whacked by crushing storms .
We should n't wait until that happens ( which without proper warning systems and procedures , just might ) .
Our national weather system satellites are in desperate need of repair .
One reportedly does n't even function .
The government has yanked funding from weather programs and cut back on investing in new technology .
We are going blindly along as always .
Yet we are n't heading blindly along into a storm ; it 's headed into us .
Waiting until it's too late
It will be too late after the fact of another major environmental catastrophe to say : " Why did n't we do something sooner ?
How could n't we know ?
Why were n't we warned and prepared ? "
These questions are too hauntingly familiar .
We need to fund better weather programs and procedures and invest in new systems that have the potential to save us from the results of what are n't aberrations any more : heightened weather events .
The future costs are just too great not to .
The Resilient Coasts Initiative has a few key areas that more should embrace : limit new development in the most vulnerable areas , strengthen and upgrade existing buildings to prevent further losses , and promote infrastructure investments that will help communities adapt to a rise in sea levels .
Climate change is happening ... now .
Myanmar should be a tragic reminder for us all .
And we should n't need any more reminding .
Lawyers for Mayor Bloomberg are asking a judge to ban any reference to the Second Amendment during the upcoming trial of a gun shop owner who was sued by the city .
While trials are often tightly choreographed , with lawyers routinely instructed to not tell certain facts to a jury , a gag order on a section of the Constitution would be an oddity .
" Apparently Mayor Bloomberg has a problem with both the First and the Second amendments , " Lawrence Keane , the general counsel of a firearms industry association , the National Shooting Sports Foundation , said .
The trial , set to begin May 27 , involves a Georgia gun shop , Adventure Outdoors , which the city alleges is responsible for a disproportionate number of the firearms recovered from criminals in New York City .
The gun store 's owner , Jay Wallace , says his store abides by Georgia and federal regulations and takes steps to avoid selling firearms to gun traffickers .
Mr. Wallace 's store is one of 27 out - of - state gun shops sued by New York City , and the first to go to trial .
City lawyers , in a motion filed Tuesday , asked the judge , Jack Weinstein of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn , to preclude the store 's lawyers from arguing that the suit infringed on any Second Amendment rights belonging to the gun store or its customers .
In the motion , the lawyer for the city , Eric Proshansky , is also seeking a ban on " any references " to the amendment .
" Any references by counsel to the Second Amendment or analogous state constitutional provisions are likewise irrelevant , " the brief states .
Many Americans believe that the Second Amendment provides an individual the right to own a gun .
Others believe that it provides no right to private gun ownership , but gives states the power to keep militias .
In a recent court deposition , Mayor Bloomberg said he believed " the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights gives you the right to keep and bear arms . "
But in a recent brief to the Supreme Court , lawyers for Mr. Bloomberg argued that the amendment " was not intended to vest armed power in citizens acting outside of any governmental military effort  either federal or state . "
In a statement sent via e-mail to The New York Sun , the city 's criminal justice coordinator , John Feinblatt , said the issue at the upcoming Adventure Outdoors trial " is n't the Constitution but whether the respondents broke federal firearms laws . "
" The right to bear arms has nothing to do with whether the respondents made straw sales , " Mr. Feinblatt said .
A straw sale occurs when gun dealers sell to someone making the purchase on behalf of another  often someone with a felony record , who is ineligible to own guns .
The city sent an undercover team to simulate a straw purchase at Adventure Outdoors .
Lawyers for the gun store say the two hidden cameras brought in by investigators malfunctioned less than halfway into the purchase and fail to show the precautions taken by the sales staff at the store to prevent a straw purchase .
Of the city 's recent motion to preclude mention of the Second Amendment , a lawyer for Adventure Outdoors , John Renzulli , said , " If you ca n't discuss the Bill of Rights in a court of law , where should we discuss these issues ?
Should we reserve it for the tavern ? "
Mr. Renzulli said the city 's lawsuit did implicate the Second Amendment : " The politics involved here is whether the city has the power to go into another state and control the lawful sale of firearms . "
Still , Mr. Renzulli said he did not plan to oppose the city 's request regarding references to the Second Amendment .
Mr. Renzulli , who has defended suits against the gun industry in Judge Weinstein 's courtroom before , said that in the past the defense has struck a deal with the plaintiffs on the matter : Lawyers for the gun industry wo n't mention the Bill of Rights to the jury , if the plaintiffs do n't mention the National Rifle Association .
" We usually say we 're not talking about the Second Amendment and you 're not talking about the NRA as a huge lobbying group that controls the legislature , " Mr. Renzulli said .
He said he expected a similar agreement to be struck in the Adventure Outdoors case .
The Evolution of Elephants
In any given debate over evolution vs pseudoscience , you 'll typically hear about apes to men , or Mesonychids to whales , dinosaurs to birds , or fins to feet .
But almost never do you hear about aardvarks to elephants , or elephants to manatees .
And that 's strange , because Proboscidean evolution is just as fascinating as that of any other lineage .
We 've recently recognized two distinctly different groups of extant ( still - living ) species of African elephants which are closely - related , and which are both a bit more distantly - related to Asian elephants , which are even more distantly - related to mammoths , and then mastodons , ( multiple species of each ) and so on - to other , older , and much weirder things that are still obviously related to elephants , but clearly are not elephants , and never were .
All of these listed so far are in the Order , Proboscidea , which means " things with funky noses " .
Proboscidea is just one of several orders within the taxonomic Superorder , Afrotheria , which means " hooved mammals which come from Africa , and have funky noses " .
An aardvark
is considered
a hooved
African animal
with a funky nose .
A ' hoof ' is a
really thick fingernail
that is used
for walking on .
Afrotheria does n't include any elephant birds , elephant seals , or elephants Gerald .
But it does include elephant shrews , along with manatees , tenrecs , aardvarks , hyrax , dugong , dassies , and other stupid - sounding words .
The aardvark is a basal Afrotherian .
" Basal " means that its the most primitive - looking , ... the prototype , ... the shape of things that went .
This is the one everything else was based on .
In this case , the aardvark is what scientists think the granddaddy of all Afrotherians once looked like .
Amazingly , genetic sequencing says they 're right !
The modern aardvark could be a karyotype of what the ancestors of all afrotherians should look like .
This is a tapir .
It is a Proboscidian karyotype .
That means it looks an awful lot like what the earliest proboscideans looked like .
( ' Proboscidean ' is a fancy word for ' elephant ' , remember ? )
It does look a lot like the oldest fossil gonna - be elephants .
But the tapir is n't basal to elephants , because it does n't really belong to that family , it just looks like it does .
That 's why its only a karyotype .
The Tapir is a ' hooved , funky - nosed animal that does n't come from Africa .
It looks like a wanna - be elephant , but its actually closer to rhinos .
Rhinos and tapirs both have only three toes .
It does look a little bit like a kinda proto- elephant , ... sort of .
This is Moeritherium , one of three real basal proboscideans ,
a " mother of all elephants " , ... sort of .
Except for the toes , Moeritherium looks a lot like a tapir , does n't it ?
This 40 million year - old proto - pachyderm was about the same size as a tapir , and looked a lot like one .
But they had slightly oversized upper incisors , which grew out pointed like fangs .
and not just that ;
Its also a basal Sirenian too .
Elephants started out as relatively small hippo- like things until their teeth went crazy and started growing out of control .
This is true of the whole order .
That 's the nature of inherited traits .
Consequently Proboscidians are all recognized and categorized not by their prehensile noses , but by their outrageous dentistry .
From this Chilotherium skull , we can see that they already had what were probably very short tapir - like noses but which were already helpful in feeding .
And for chewing , they relied only on their molars , so they were n't so dependant on the condition of their incisors .
So it did n't matter that they grew out so strangely that eventually they could use them as raking or stabbing weapons .
This Oligocene semi-elephant called Fiomia is beginning to look the part , and shows us how these teeth started growing a lot longer than they should have been .
This Gomphotherium from about 20 million years ago represents a point in elephant evolution when both the upper and lower incisors grew to such proportions that they were unusable for eating ; and of course the length of the nose had to increase right along with the teeth and lower jaw .
These lead to Tetralophodon , Trilophodon , Palaeomastodon , and Platybelodon .
One of the interesting things about evolution and paleontology is that its sometimes nearly impossible to tell whether you 're looking at two different kinds of animals , or just two different version of the same thing .
Because the way evolution works , everything can be described as another version of anything else you want to put next to it .
The next really important stage of elephant evolution is when the lower incisors became tusks .
Some of these species did n't have such shovel - like teeth anymore , and there was a space left where the newly - lengthened nose would now slide between , so that now it could be considered a true trunk , as seen here on Stegotetrabelodon .
Obviously , there came a point at which these absurdly mutated teeth had become useless for feeding , which forced them to use their already - flexible noses to rake and trowel food into their mouths the same way modern elephants still do today .
Initially , both the top and bottom incisors grew out as well as the lower jaw .
I will use this Deinotherium to represent the point at which that trend came to an end , when the lower jaw sort of " dropped off " so to speak , leaving one now - very - long nose , which was out there by itself as it is on modern elephants .
Just a couple million years ago , or so , every species that bore four tusks and elongated lower jaws eventually died off , leaving only Deinotheres and the more familiar - looking twin - tusked proboscidians like the stegodont , which lead to mammoths , mastodons , and several other species of proboscidean pachyderms not listed here
WASHINGTON 
The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday declared that cost overruns for Defense Department weapons had “ reached crisis proportions , ” after government auditors reported that the projected final cost of the Pentagon ’s major programs had ballooned $ 295 billion over initial budget estimates .
The chairman , Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , also said that he would propose a law creating an independent director of cost assessment at the Pentagon .
Mr. Levin said there was a need for stronger evaluation of whether contractors were making unrealistic promises to get programs started , ensuring later overruns and delays .
“ It ’s going to take a fundamental change in the structure and the culture of the acquisition system to address that problem , ” Mr. Levin said at a committee hearing on the cost overruns .
Testifying before the committee , the Pentagon ’s top procurement officer , John J. Young Jr. , reserved judgment on Mr. Levin ’s proposal , saying he needed more time to study it .

This means that the stats update will be down until we get the machine back up , but the back up AS should handle all classic clients , and the PS3 and GPU clients are unaffected ( as their AS is on a different machine ) .
Who 's watching you ?
Shadow home secretary David Davis has dramatically quit Parliament the day after the government narrowly won the vote on 42 - days detention for terrorism suspects .
Standing on the steps of Westminster , the Tory MP said he would fight a by - election in his own constituency against the " insidious , surreptitious and relentless erosion of fundamental British freedoms " .
The BBC's Dominic Casciani looks at the key issues raised by Mr Davis .
DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE
What did David Davis say ?
" Up until yesterday , I took the view that what we did in the House of Commons , representing our constituents , was a noble endeavour because we defended the freedoms of the British people .
" Well we did up until yesterday .
Yesterday this house decided to allow the state to lock up potentially innocent British citizens for up to six weeks without charge . "
What 's the issue ?
David Davis led the Tory opposition to the government 's plans to hold terrorism suspects for up to 42 days without charge .
He and other critics say 42 - day detention breaches a fundamental right not to be unlawfully detained , enshrined in the Magna Carta .
What does the government say ?
Prime Minister Gordon Brown says the move to 42 days is a measured preparation for a time when police may need extra powers in an exceptional situation .
He says the public supports it and the safeguards are strong .
CCTV AND SURVEILLANCE
One CCTV camera for every 14 citizens What did David Davis say ?
" A CCTV camera for every 14 citizens . "
What 's the issue ?
Millions have been spent on CCTV cameras , rolled out to deter city centre crime .
The figure quoted by David Davis comes from a guess contained in a fairly old study of cameras in two London streets and is probably an under-estimate of the number of cameras in the UK .
One police officer recently told the BBC CCTV played a part in solving only 3 % of crime .
Many cameras play little law and order role because they were not installed for the police 's benefit or are not capable of capturing pictures clear enough to be used in evidence .
However , thanks to software that can read number plates and text and isolate specific human behaviour , their importance is increasing .
Controversial " Talking CCTV " has been installed in some areas , whereby control centre staff can speak to people they are watching , asking them to pick up litter or move on .
What does the government say ?
Ministers believe CCTV helps people feel safe but Home Office research casts doubt on whether they genuinely cut crime .
THE DNA DATABASE
What did David Davis say ?
" A DNA database bigger than any dictatorship has , with thousands of innocent children and a million innocent citizens on it . "
What 's the issue ?
The national DNA database is extremely controversial , partly because of how easy it is to be added to it and how difficult it can be to get removed .
When it was launched in 1995 , only the DNA of convicted criminals could be kept but from 2004 it began holding the DNA of anyone arrested for a recordable offence and detained at a police station .
DNA testing can help solve crimes
As of this spring , the database held 4.5 m samples - a greater proportion of the population than any other DNA database in the world .
This includes disproportionate numbers of samples from black men , prompting one senior judge to argue that the only way the system can be made fair is to hold everybody 's DNA .
What does the government say ?
DNA is a key element of the modern crime - fighting toolkit but there are no plans to cover the entire population .
Of the 200,000 samples from people neither charged nor convicted , which would have in the past been removed , the Home Office says 8,500 had been subsequently matched to crime scenes , involving some 14,000 offences including 114 murders , 55 attempted murders and 116 rapes .
ID CARDS AND DATABASE STATE
What did David Davis say ?
" We will have shortly , the most intrusive identity card system in the world ....
The creation of a database state opening up our private lives to the prying eyes of official snoopers and exposing our personal data to careless civil servants and criminal hackers . "
What 's the issue ?
The government 's apparent determination to press ahead with a national ID card is one of the most controversial issues in national policy and politics .
ID cards will be gradually phased in In short , the government wants ID cards as part of plans to fight crime , modernise the state and tackle illegal immigration .
Foreign nationals will soon need to carry a card , followed probably by students , and then others will be encouraged to get a card as a means of making their life easier .
In theory , at some point after 2012 there will be critical mass and Parliament will be asked to make them compulsory .
There are huge concerns over the costs , the practicality of the cards and whether the databases will work and remain secure .
What does the government say ?
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith told the BBC in March there were " big advantages " to making ID cards as widespread as possible but there needed to be public acceptance .
There have been repeated claims that the government is contemplating a U - turn on ID cards , none of which has been substantiated .
TRIAL BY JURY
What did David Davis say ?
" We have witnessed an assault on jury trials - that bulwark against bad law and its arbitrary use by the state .
Short cuts with our justice system that make our system neither firm not fair . "
What 's the issue ?
There have been several moves to limit the right to a trial by jury over the years , two since 1997 .
These include attempts to reform how serious fraud trials are heard , because of the complexity of the evidence .
Each attempt has failed in Parliament .
Legal observers expect another attempt to reform juries in the near future .
What does the government say ?
The government has always denied that it is trying to erode defendants ' rights - but argues that reforms and modernisation are necessary in the name of effective justice .
Only this week , one of the country 's top judges said the jury system " simply cannot survive " if terrorism cases last as long as 14 months .

Seven Maori tribes will manage the land collectively
In a historic settlement , the New Zealand government has signed over huge tracts of forest land to the ownership of seven Maori tribes .
The NZ$ 420 m ( $ 319 m ) agreement transfers ownership of nine forests - covering 435,000 acres ( 176,000 hectares ) of land - in the central North Island .
Hundreds of Maori , some in traditional dress , thronged parliament to witness the signing of the accord .
" It 's a historic journey we are on , " Prime Minister Helen Clark said .
" We came into politics to address injustice and seek reconciliation .
Thank you for walking that road with us on this historic day , " she added , according to AP news agency .
The settlement - the largest single deal between the government and Maori tribes - seeks to address grievances dating back to the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi .
The treaty guaranteed the indigenous Maori people use of their land and resources in return for ceding sovereignty to the British crown .
But land seizures and ownership breaches followed .
' Sustainable future '
The forests signed over are mainly large commercial pine plantations , generating about NZ$ 13 m a year in rents .
The settlement also hands over rents that have accumulated on the land since 1989 .
Between them , the seven tribes or iwi include more than 100,000 members .
They will manage the land collectively , setting up a holding company structure and forestry management structure .
The chairman of the collective , Maori paramount chief Tumu Te Heu Heu , said the objective was to provide tribes with " a strong , durable and sustainable economic future " , in particular young members and the coming generations .
" This is our legacy to them , " he said , according to AP .
Maori make up about 15 % of New Zealand 's 4.2 million population , but are among the country 's poorest citizens , experiencing high unemployment , and poor health , education and housing compared to other New Zealanders .
Yesterday , I showed you a great video of NASA scientists explaining how magnetic fields work over beautiful animations making the fields come to life .
Today , now that you 're all caught up on how the fields work , I 'll show you how geophysicist Dan Lathrop is building a fake planet filled with liquid sodium that will , if all goes according to plan , end up with a magnetic field of its own .

The 10 - foot - tall , 26 - ton steel ball will spin at a high speed of 80MPH at its equator when it 's fully operational .
The idea is that our planet gets its magnetic field from the core , a quickly spinning ball of liquid metal , probably liquid iron .
Because iron only melts at seriously high temperatures — this is the center of the Earth we 're talking about , after all — Lathrop is using liquid sodium instead .
Hopefully , when it 's heated up and starts spinning , the liquid sodium will slosh around in some sort of " organized turbulence , " with an overall pattern emerging in how it sloshes around .
This will make it like a tiny working model of the center of the Earth , giving us a much better understanding of what goes on down there and just how it controls the magnetic field that makes all compasses point to the North Pole . [ Neatorama via NPR ]
Britain 's biggest banks face payouts of more than £ 10bn after losing the right to charge current account holders as much as they like for unauthorised borrowing .
Vindicating
The Independent 's year - long campaign against bank charges , the High Court ruled yesterday that fees for slipping into an overdraft or bouncing a cheque are subject to standard legal rules on fairness of contracts , raising the prospect of hundreds of thousands of successful compensation claims .
High Street banks had insisted that charges on customers could be levied entirely at their own discretion , with penalties of up to £ 38 common for breaches of overdrafts .
The Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) is now expected to press ahead with an epic legal battle to prove that the charges are unfair .
If the case succeeds , then banks may be forced to compensate every customer for charges going back years , giving millions of people a windfall .
Consumer groups hailed the ruling as a " massive victory " , though the banks hinted they will appeal , threatening protracted legal warfare in the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords .
In the meantime , claims for refunds worth about £ 711 m are on hold , pending the outcome of the case .
The OFT estimates that banks and building societies make £ 2bn to £ 3.75 bn a year from unauthorised borrowing fees , suggesting the total reclaimable could be as much as £ 20bn .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One million customers won refunds before the OFT and eight financial institutions announced on 27 July last year that they would jointly bring yesterday 's test case to establish whether the charges are legal .
The banks – Abbey , Barclays , Clydesdale , Halifax Bank of Scotland , HSBC , Lloyds TSB , Royal Bank of Scotland and the Nationwide Building Society – assembled one of the biggest commercial legal teams of recent times to fight the case .
Judge Andrew Smith agreed with them yesterday that the charges were service rather than " penalty " fees and that their terms and conditions were , for the most part , in " plain intelligible language " .
But he went on : " I reject the banks ' contention that the relevant terms are exempt from assessment as to fairness under the 1999 [ Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts ]
Regulations .
" This does not mean that the relevant terms are necessarily to be regarded as unfair ... or that they are not binding upon consumers .
Those are not questions for me to decide in this judgment . "
Campaigners claimed the banks should now lift the waiver and immediately start paying out to customers .
" The banks should do the right thing now : concede defeat , agree with the OFT what constitutes a fair unauthorised overdraft fee , and refund their customers as soon as possible , " said Doug Taylor , of the consumer group Which ?
" The Financial Services Authority [ FSA ] must now drop its waiver so the thousands of cases pending can be processed .
Every second this remains unresolved is costing consumers £ 111 in overdraft charges . "
Martin Lewis , of MoneySavingExpert.com said : " Thisis a massive victory for the bank charge campaign because the primary line of attack has been that bank charges are unfair under unfair terms legislation .
" Banks currently charge £ 35 for what is an automated letter printed off the computer .
What does it really cost ?
Some generous people say £ 4 , I say about £ 2 . "
The British Bankers ' Association said the judgment was " complex " and the banks were considering its implications , adding that further court hearings were required .
" As previously agreed with the Financial Ombudsman Service and the FSA , customer complaints relating to unauthorised overdraft charges will currently remain on hold , " it added .
Under the law , bank customers can bring legal claims for bank charges dating back six years in England and Wales and five years in Scotland .
Annual results for the major lenders show they have so far paid out more than £ 559 m in refunds but the total is higher because Abbey and the Nationwide kept their refunds secret .
" In one sense this is a good result , " said David Kuo , of the personal finance website fool .co.uk .
" But the banks will try and appeal and prolong the agony for consumers .
I do hope they see sense – they have lost this one and will certainly lose the next one . "

YOU have to hand it to the British for their engaging skill at understatement .
How else to explain their predilection for taking something refreshing and delicious and saddling it with a name like “ ordinary ” ?
Ordinary is the term for the basic British bitter , the ale that has for generations quenched bottomless thirsts in pubs throughout England .
Possibly even the British realized that a name like ordinary might cause a few patrons to lay their heads on the bar far too early in the evening , out of sheer boredom .
So in their fashion , they ratcheted up the excitement .
A slightly stronger ale was called best bitter or special bitter , a heartier brew was dubbed extra special bitter , or E.S.B .
Can you contain yourself ?
It ’s not easy , because I am thrilled with bitters .
They are beers for drinking , for enjoying several pints over the course of an evening , rather than for carefully paced sipping .
They are not meant to impress connoisseurs with their power or creative flavoring .
They are meant , as so many British pub - goers understand , to quench thirst pleasurably without getting in the way of conversation .
With Nomination Clinched , Obama Now Free To Be Horrifying Scumbag

Barrow has accused Democrats of wanting to " cut and run " in Iraq , and enthusiastically supports telcom immunity .
He needs Obama 's support because he 's being challenged in the primary by State Senator Regina Thomas .
Bonus scumbaginess : Barrow is white , Thomas is an African - American woman .
Glenn Greenwald has the appalling details here .
Meanwhile , Nell says : " I encourage anyone who can afford to do so to donate to the non-partisan effort to prevent a Congressional sellout on warrantless eavesdropping and and immunity for telcoms who broke the law helping the Bush regime invade our privacy . "

The leader of an apocalyptic church was arrested at a remote ranch in New Mexico as part on a child sex abuse investigation , police said .
Wayne Bent , 66 , the head of the doomsday Lord Our Righteousness Church , was detained after agents arrived at the compound where the leader and his followers are based near Clayton , north - east New Mexico .
New Mexico State Police spokesman Peter Olson said Bent was facing three charges of criminal sexual contact , but did not provide further details .
The arrest comes after three children under the age of 18 were removed from the sect 's compound last month following allegations of inappropriate contact involving Bent .
The Lord Our Righteousness Church , also known as the Strong City community , is an offshoot of the Seventh - Day Adventist Church according to reports .
Bent is reported to have preached that the world would end on October 31 , 2007 , however his followers later denied any such prediction was made .

“ A DESTABILISING contraction in nationwide house prices does not seem the most probable outcome ... nominal house prices in the aggregate have rarely fallen and certainly not by very much . ”
Alan Greenspan 's soothing , if rather verbose , words on America 's housing market in 2005 rank high on history 's list of infamous predictions .
But to be fair , most American economists shared his view that it was highly unlikely that average nationwide home prices would drop .
That was the sort of thing that happened only during a deep depression , like the 1930s .
Unfortunately , new figures this week reveal that house prices have already fallen by more over the past 12 months than in any year during the Great Depression .
The S&P / Case - Shiller national index fell by 14.1 % in the year to the first quarter .
Admittedly , other property indices show smaller drops , but most economists now favour this measure .
The index goes back only 20 years , but Robert Shiller , an economist at Yale University and co-inventor of the index , has compiled a version that stretches back more than a century .
This shows that the latest fall in nominal prices is already much bigger than the 10.5 % drop in 1932 , at the worst point of the Depression .
And things are even worse than they look .
In the deflationary 1930s , America 's general price level was falling , so in real terms home prices declined much less than they did nominally .
Today inflation is running at a brisk pace , so property prices have fallen by a staggering 18 % in real terms over the past year .
In nominal terms , the average home is now worth 16 % less than at the peak in 2006 , and the large overhang of unsold houses suggests that prices have further to fall .
If so , this housing bust could well see a bigger cumulative fall in prices than the 26 % real drop over the five years to 1933 .
Most people would call that a pretty destabilising contraction .
Mr. Bush told ABC
News this month that he knew of these meetings and approved of the result .
Those who have followed the story of the administration ’s policies on prisoners may not be shocked .
We have read the memos from the Justice Department redefining torture , claiming that Mr. Bush did not have to follow the law , and offering a blueprint for avoiding criminal liability for abusing prisoners .
The amount of time and energy devoted to this furtive exercise at the very highest levels of the government reminded us how little Americans know , in fact , about the ways Mr. Bush and his team undermined , subverted and broke the law in the name of saving the American way of life .
We have questions to ask , in particular , about the involvement of Ms. Rice , who has managed to escape blame for the catastrophic decisions made while she was Mr. Bush ’s national security adviser , and Mr. Powell , a career Army officer who should know that torture has little value as an interrogation method and puts captured Americans at much greater risk .
Did they raise objections or warn of the disastrous effect on America ’s standing in the world ?
Did anyone ?
Mr. Bush has sidestepped or quashed every attempt to uncover the breadth and depth of his sordid actions .
Congress is likely to endorse a cover-up of the extent of the illegal wiretapping he authorized after 9/11 , and we are still waiting , with diminishing hopes , for a long - promised report on what the Bush team really knew before the Iraq invasion about those absent weapons of mass destruction  as opposed to what it proclaimed .
At this point it seems that getting answers will have to wait , at least , for a new Congress and a new president .
Ideally , there would be both truth and accountability .
At the very minimum the public needs the full truth .
A series of Apple patent filings published this week reveal a version of the Apple TV media device capable of browsing and recording live television programming in addition to serving up pre-aired content from the company 's iTunes Store .
Originally filed back in October of 2006 , the filings clearly show considerable work on the part of the electronics maker to create an alternative to products like the TiVo digital video recorder ( DVR ) , complete with a searchable on - screen guide and configurable touch - based remote control device that would serve as a portable program guide .
The remote , similar in appearance to second - generation iPod nano , would include an LCD display , storage component , and touch - based navigation pad that would allow users to download several weeks of programming information from the Apple TV media device onto the remote interface for later interaction .
" For example , program data for upcoming programs , e.g. , for the next month , can be downloaded and stored on the remote control device , " Apple said .
" Thereafter , a user of the remote control device can search programs that are to be broadcast and determine which programs to record .
The recording settings can be programmed onto the remote control device , and then be provided to the video device when a data communication is established between the remote control device and the video device . "
( Note : it would seem logical that this functionality could also be integrated directly into the iPhone or iPod touch . )
In real world instances , this would allow users to pre-load the remote with the following month 's scheduled television programming , pack the remote with their belongings , and then while on " a commute on a train , " for instance , use the remote to determine what programs to record .
" Thus , when the user arrives home , the user can place the remote control device within the vicinity of the video device or within the docking port , and the recording data is downloaded into the video device , " the company explained .
" Thereafter the specified programs are recorded . "
Although shown in Apple 's filings as comprising a circular navigation surface below the LCD screen , another implementation of the advanced remote could include a " rectangular surface , a square surface , or some other shaped surface , " Apple said .
" Other surface geometries that accommodate pressure sensitive areas and that can sense touch actuations may also be used , e.g. , an oblong area , an octagon area , etc . "
Meanwhile , the Apple TV device itself would feature a more advanced form of an on - screen programming guide akin to those found on today 's digital cable boxes or TiVO DVR records .
In addition to a standard guide that takes up the entire screen , Apple illustrates several " overlay " interfaces that consume less real estate , such as a horizontal " recording navigation menu " that could float atop of ongoing video content , offering a list of recorded content and allowing the user to preview those recordings in a small widget dialog while live programming transmissions are ongoing .
Several other overlay interface components are also apparent from the filings , including a Mac OS Dock - like interface that would rise from the bottom of the screen and include icons for recording shows , searching programming , and so forth .
" In one implementation , the icons include a home icon , a recordings navigation icon , a channels navigation icon , a browse navigation icon , and a search navigation icon , " Apple said .
" Additionally , one or more context - dependent icons may also be generated within the menu overlay .
For example , a record icon can be generated in the received context to allow a user to record video data that is presently being received .
In one implementation , the menu overlay may also delimit context - dependent icons .
For example , a bar delimits the record icon from the navigation icons . "
Such as the case with Mac OS Dock , highlighting an icon would be indicated by enlarging the size of the icon and generating a textual description atop the enlarged icon .
By using the navigational component of the advanced Apple remote , a user could select the delete icon to delete from memory the recorded program currently being displayed in the video environment .
Users could also shrink , zoom or resize video being displayed in the video environment .
In instances of shrunken content , a " reflection of the video environment may be shown in the space " also occupied by the Dock - like control interface .
Selecting the " channel " icon from the Dock would produce a narrow , vertical overlay that lists all pre-recorded content or live content , within which the user could preview clips of those while live broadcasts or pre-recorded content while video continues to run in the full - screen environment .
" In one implementation , the video preview is generated after the channel menu item remains highlighted for a period of time , e.g. , several seconds .
In another implementation , the video preview is generated after the channel menu item 918 is highlighted and at the cessation of a touch actuation ( e.g. , the lifting of a finger off the rotational input device of the remote control device ) , " Apple said .
" The video preview can be generated , for example , by expanding the channel menu item vertically .
In the received / broadcast context , the video preview can include the video data of the program currently being broadcast on the channel corresponding to the highlighted channel menu item . "
Additional interface overlay menus described in the filings include a vertical browsing menu and " action menu , " the latter of which would include icons for playback , recording , deletion , and accessing " related programming . "
Options would exist to record just one episode of a show or " all instances " of a series .
A search overly component is also detailed , similar to the version already included in the current version of Apple TV , only suited to search the live programming guide .
It could function both as part of both the full - screen guide , or via the narrow vertical overlay guide .
As part of its filings , Apple also included about a dozen tables showing the how the various inputs on the touch - based Apple remote would function differently depending on what content or navigational interface was displayed on the screen .
For example , while browsing the on - screen guide , the left side of the circular touch surface would rotate the listing to the left , while that same function during video playback would rewind the video by 10 seconds .

A major demand of the environmental movement , put forward as essential to combating global warming , is the imposition of a massive rollback in global emissions of carbon dioxide accompanied by a freeze on such emissions at the sharply reduced level imposed .
In this spirit , Britain 's Stern Review , published in the fall of 2006 , seeks a reduction of 25 percent by the year 2050 .
Going considerably further , the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has urged a 60 percent reduction .
Such pronouncements can be made openly and repeatedly only because the immense majority of people do not take the trouble to understand their implications .
They do not because what is required to do so is a combination of making connections between various facts and performing calculations .
These are activities that are widely perceived as onerous .
Nevertheless , this level of thinking is essential if people are to understand the implications of environmentalism 's demands .
In purely verbal terms , those implications are that environmentalism seeks the destruction of the energy base of the modern world , along with the elimination or radical reduction in the supply of all goods and services that depend on that energy base .
It seeks this on the grounds that these goods and the energy on which they depend entail the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
The goods and services in question are air conditioners , automobiles , airplane travel , housing , food , clothing , refrigerators , freezers , television sets , telephones , washers , dryers , books , computers — everything that depends on the production and use of oil , coal , or natural gas , which all release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in being burned .
The destruction of the energy base and the production of goods and services is implied by the fact that in order to rollback the emission of carbon dioxide , it is necessary to rollback the production and use of energy in these forms .
But rolling back the production and use of energy reduces the production of goods and services .
Turning now to the arithmetic of environmentalist destruction , I will proceed to calculate the extent of the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per person that is entailed in the environmentalist demands .
This will serve as a guide to the extent of the reduction in the production and use of energy per person and thus as a guide to the reduction in the production of goods and services per person .
Proceeding in this way , it will be very easy to prove that environmentalism seeks the destruction of the energy base of the modern world , along with the elimination or radical reduction in the supply of all goods and services that depend on it .
Let me start with the 25 percent reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions urged by the Stern Review .
Its application across the world would imply a 25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions here in the United States by that year .
Yet the population of the United States in 2050 is projected to be approximately 400 million people .
Since the US population is currently 300 million people , this means that four - thirds of the present population of the US would be expected to generate only three - fourths of present carbon dioxide emissions .
Three - fourths divided by four - thirds is nine - sixteenths , or 56.25 percent .
That would be the projected per capita level of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States in 2050 , i.e. , a reduction of 43.75 percent from today 's level .
If the reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions is to be 60 percent rather than 25 percent , then , with the same increase in population , the reduction in per capita emissions in the United States would be to a level found by dividing 40 percent ( the emissions remaining after the 60 percent reduction ) by four - thirds .
Since division by four - thirds is always multiplication by three - fourths , the per capita reduction would be to a level of 30 percent of today 's emissions instead of 56.25 percent .
The per capital reduction in emissions in the United States would be 70 percent rather than 43.75 percent .
But there is yet a further major reduction in US per capita carbon dioxide emissions to contend with .
And that is that while global emissions will be reduced by 25 percent , or by 60 percent , emissions in China , India , and the rest of the so - called third world will be allowed to go on increasing , presumably until there is equality in per capita emissions across the world .
At present , even though it has only 5 percent of the world 's population , the US consumes 25 percent of the world 's supply of energy and is responsible for approximately 25 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions .
Assuming the US population to remain at 5 percent of the world 's population , the achievement of global equality in per capita carbon dioxide emissions would require a reduction in US energy consumption from its present 25 percent to 5 percent , corresponding to the size of its population .
This implies a further reduction of 80 percent in per capita emissions in the US .
This is because 5 percent divided by 25 percent is 20 percent ; a fall to 20 percent of the initial percentage is a decline of 80 percent from the initial percentage .
This further decline of 80 percent in per capita carbon dioxide emissions would apply to the already very substantial percentage declines calculated above .
Thus , with a rollback of 25 percent in global emissions , the decline in the US would be to 20 percent of 56.25 percent , i.e. to 11.25 percent .
This , of course , would be an 88.75 percent reduction in per capita US carbon dioxide emissions .
With a rollback of 60 percent in global emissions , the decline in the US would be to 20 percent of 30 percent , i.e. to 6 percent .
This would be a 94 percent reduction in per capita US carbon dioxide emissions .
Whether the per capita reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is to 6 percent or to 11.25 percent , whether or not a few percentage points of reduction can be avoided by virtue of obtaining additional power from windmills and solar panels ( the environmentalists will not allow atomic power , which they regard as the death ray and oppose even more than carbon dioxide emissions , nor will they allow hydro - power insofar as it interferes with the migratory patterns of fish ) , the clear implication is economic devastation .
It is devastation in the production and use of energy and devastation in the production of everything that depends on energy .
The implications of imposing environmentalism 's demands include those that I have discussed in previous articles on the subject .
In terms of the life of individuals , they are precisely of the kind described in the newspaper articles I quote in " After the Hideous Light Bulbs . "
They also include such paradoxes as attempting to fight global warming by means of destroying air conditioners , refrigerators , and freezers .
( I presented this particular paradox in " Environmentalist Zen . "
That it is present in environmentalism is something that should be glaringly obvious from the present article . )
It follows that inasmuch as anything may serve as an opening wedge in getting people to accept environmentalism 's agenda of destruction and impoverishment , it needs to be opposed as strongly as possible .
Such is the case with the organized campaign now underway to get people to accept the use of compact fluorescent light bulbs in place of customary , incandescent bulbs .
As a prelude to their imposition by law , the sale of these bulbs is currently being highly subsidized by business firms seeking to curry favor with environmentalists , in order to mitigate the harm that they expect would otherwise be done to them .
It should be obvious that it is necessary to fight acceptance of these bulbs , as I argue in " Say No to the Hideous Light Bulbs . "
There is tremendous public pressure today to join the environmentalist cause .
Business firms that had long opposed it are now rushing to join it .
Opposition is evaporating .
Where there are still pockets of serious resistance , environmentalist smears serve to undercut their effectiveness .
This has been the case , for example , with respect to the British television documentary " The Great Global Warming Swindle , " which presents the views of numerous scientific experts on climate and the causes of climate change who are opposed to the environmentalists ' claim that global warming is caused by carbon dioxide emissions .
The public embrace of a movement as dreadfully destructive as environmentalism brings to mind the rush to embrace Hitler and the Nazi Party in the Germany of 1932 and 1933 , once their victory at the polls seemed to become inevitable , and then once they actually came to power .
However the views of serious people , who hold their views first - hand , based on their own , independent judgment , do not change merely because the views of others have changed .
Nazism was a catastrophe .
Environmentalism has the potential to be an even greater catastrophe — a far greater catastrophe than Nazism : one that will result in the deaths of billions rather than millions .
This is because it is the diametric opposite of economic liberalism on a global scale .
In contrast to liberalism and its doctrine of the harmony of the rightly understood self - interests of all men , environmentalism alleges the most profound conflict of interests among people .
It implies that there is a major economic benefit to be obtained through the death of billions of fellow human beings , that , indeed , the well - being and prosperity of the survivors depends on the extermination of those billions .
Thus , for example , from the depraved perspective of environmentalism , if global carbon dioxide emissions equal to 25 percent of present emissions were to disappear , because those responsible for them ceased to exist , there would be no need for the global cutback in emissions urged by the Stern Review , and thus no need for any diminution in economic well - being on the part of the survivors ( provided , of course , their number did not increase ) .
If still more emissions could be eliminated by the elimination of still more people , there would be room for actual economic improvement among the survivors , according to environmentalism .
Obviously , the magnitude of mass murder that is invited is the greater , the greater is the alleged need to curb carbon dioxide emissions .
Those who recognize the astoundingly evil nature of environmentalism must never cease opposing it .
On the trail of the ' Indian yeti '
By Alastair Lawson
BBC News , Meghalaya
In pictures : ' Yeti ' hunt
In the US it 's known as bigfoot , in Canada as sasquatch , in Brazil as mapinguary , in Australia as a yowie , in Indonesia as sajarang gigi and , most famously of all , in Nepal as a yeti .
The little known Indian version of this legendary ape - like creature is called mande barung - or forest man - and is reputed to live in the remote West Garo hills of the north - eastern state of Meghalaya .
I was invited by passionate yeti believer Dipu Marak to travel throughout the area to hear for myself what he says is compelling evidence of the existence of a black and grey ape - like animal which stands about 3 m ( nearly 10 ft ) tall .
There have been repeated reports of sightings over many years by different witnesses in the West , South and East Garo hills .
Mr Marak estimates the creature weighs about 300 kg ( 660 lb ) and is herbivorous , surviving on fruit , roots and tree bark .
Intense heat The Garo hills comprise more than 8,000 sq.km of some of the thickest jungle in India .
And as I soon discovered , there is no shortage of people who say they have seen the creature at first hand .

Take woodcutter Nelbison Sangma , for example , who works on the fringes of the Nokrek national park in the Garo hills .
In November 2003 , he says that he saw a yeti three days in a row .
He took me from his village to the spot where he says he made the sighting , a five - hour walk in intense tropical heat from his house .
" I saw the creature quite clearly on the other side of the river .
It was breaking branches off trees and eating the sap .
Its strength was amazing .
" Obviously I wanted to photograph it , but I knew that if I left the area , it would take at least 10 hours or more to get a camera as I do not own one .
By that time the creature would have disappeared . "
Mr Sangma says that he told the state forestry department of his sighting , but they did not believe him .
He took me to the spot where he says the yeti destroyed a tree - an exhausting uphill walk through thick jungle infested with blood - sucking leeches .
Mr Sangma showed me where the creature broke the tree 's branches and clearly visible scratch marks on its bark .

It is an extremely remote area , where the hum of insects clicking in the undergrowth sounds like a series of disconnected power cables .
Balpakram is famous for its vast jungle - filled canyon which spans several miles and is surrounded by spectacular cliffs .
Any descent is a treacherous exercise .
If ever there was terrain where a peace - loving yeti could live its life undisturbed by human interference , then this has surely got to be it .
Perhaps the most famous reported sighting was in April 2002 , when forestry officer James Marak was among a team of 14 officials carrying out a census of tigers in Balpakram when they saw what they thought was a yeti .
According to the author and environmentalist Llewellyn Marak , such stories cannot be dismissed out hand .
" I saw the footprints for myself last year , " he said , and they cannot easily be explained away .
" The prints were different from other animals - and were almost human in appearance - apart from the fact that they were about 18 inches [ 46 cm ] long .
" Both my father and grandfather also saw the creature at different times .
Each said that it resembled a large gorilla . "
Mr Marak argues that the Meghalayan forestry department has not seriously investigated the sightings because they are " uninterested and too lazy " .
The western side of the state of the Meghalaya is predominantly made up of Garo tribespeople .
They are traditionally a matrilineal community , where property is inherited through the female line .
They are also a community where stories and fables are deeply ingrained culturally , which is why senior politicians and officials are reluctant to discount openly tales of a yeti roaming about .
Meghalaya 's Divisional Forestry Officer Shri PR
Marak denies suggestions that his officers have not properly investigated alleged yeti sightings - which he argues is an expensive exercise in thick jungle only accessible by foot .
He uses diplomatic language when discussing whether yetis exist in the state .
" I have gone to see the evidence for myself and have even taken a plaster cast of one of the footprints , " he says .
" As you know the presence of such a creature is an important part of our culture - passed down to us by our parents and grandparents .
" But we have no concrete evidence it exists , and there may even be a possibility that some of the evidence has been manipulated to create a stir .

Advertisement " Because the area where it is believed to live is thick jungle , it will be very difficult to know the truth . "
But Dipu Marak has voluminous correspondence from various eyewitnesses to support his contention that there is something out there .
To critics who say he has no photographs of this mysterious creature , he insists that " absence of evidence is not evidence of absence " .
" We have so many reports of sightings that I sincerely believe there is some sort of huge creature in the Garo hills , " he said .
" This is not just a fairy tale , nor is it an effort to woo tourists .
It 's deeply embedded in our folklore and scientifically it is possible too .
" While I can not prove conclusively that this creature definitely exists , nobody can say conclusively that it does not exist either . "
Such is the impenetrability and extent of jungle in the Garo hills that the legend of mande barung looks likely to live on in the foreseeable future .
" The truth is out there somewhere , " says Dipu Marak sincerely .
" But like the Loch Ness monster this creature is obviously not fond of giving too many photo opportunities . "

Drinking or even showering in tap water can double the risk of having deformed children , says study
Harmful : Tap water may not be a good choice for pregnant women
Drinking tap water while pregnant may double the risk of serious heart or brain defects in the unborn child , research suggests .
A study of almost 400,000 babies found a clear link between chemicals formed during chlorination and the occurrence of a trio of birth defects .
Drinking water , showers , swimming pools and even the steam from a boiling kettle can all contain the problem chemicals called trihalomethanes , or THMs , the researchers said .
While the study was carried out in Taiwan , it is thought up to one in six British homes is exposed to levels even higher than those found to cause concern , with concentrations tending to be particularly high in the spring and autumn .
The researchers stressed it would be impractical for pregnant women to avoid tap water and said the onus was instead on the use of disinfection methods which limit levels of the chemicals .
The Birmingham University study compared details of birth defects with the level of THMs in tap water .
The analysis of almost 400,000 babies showed those born into regions where levels were around 80 per cent more likely to have a hole - in - the - heart defect and more than 50 per cent more likely to have a cleft palate .
Their odds of suffering anencephalus - a condition that causes much of the brain , skull and scalp to be missing - were almost doubled , the journal Environmental Health reports .
While birth defects are rare - occurring in about 2 per cent of births - the three flagged up in the study are among the most common .
It is thought the chemicals may harm the unborn baby directly .
Alternatively they may damage the woman 's eggs .
Although the study did not prove that the chemicals caused the birth defects , it is not the first to make the link .
Researcher Professor Jouni Jaakkola said : ' Our findings do n't just add to the evidence that water chlorination may cause birth defects , but suggest that exposure to chlorination byproducts may be responsible for some specific and common defects .
THMs are the products of a chemical reaction between chlorine and organic compounds common in lakes , rivers and reservoirs .
The amount of THMs made during chlorination vary according to where the water comes from and the disinfection process , meaning highly chlorinated water does not necessarily have the highest levels .
Home water filters may not be entirely effective at removing the chemicals and bottled water may also be tainted .
Professor Jaakkola said the solution was for water companies to use disinfection procedures that keep the production of THMs to a minimum .
He said : ' Water disinfection has an important purpose in reducing microbial load and reducing acute gastro - intestinal infections .
' Some have claimed it is the best public health measure ever introduced .
' We are talking about rare health effects and a modest risk increase .
' I do n't suggest stopping using tap water but we have to be conscious that at population level some risks may be related to increased levels . '
The Drinking Water Inspectorate , which is tasked by the Government to monitor the safety of tap water , said its own , larger - scale research had failed to find a link between THMs and birth defects .
Principal inspector Sue Pennison said : ' Obviously we will review this research , engage our health expert colleagues , and look to see if it means we need to do anything more .
But there 's no reason for people to be worried .
' Chlorination is reliable and has been used for centuries .
The only reason diseases like cholera and typhoid are not in our water supply is because of chlorination . '
The water industry trade body , Water UK , said it would consider the findings but chlorination in the UK meets World Health Organisation guidelines .

China has clearly overtaken the United States as the world ’s leading emitter of carbon dioxide , the main heat - trapping gas produced by human activity , a new study has found , its emissions increasing 8 percent in 2007 .
The Chinese increase accounted for two - thirds of the growth in the year ’s global greenhouse gas emissions , the study found .
The report , released Friday by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency , found that in 2007 China ’s emissions were 14 percent higher than those of the United States .
In the previous year ’s annual study , the researchers found for the first time that China had become the world ’s leading emitter , with carbon emissions 7 percent higher by volume than the United States in 2006 .
Many experts had been skeptical of the earlier study , whose results were less clear - cut than those released Friday .
The International Energy Agency had continued to say only that China was projected to overtake the United States by the end of 2007 .
Now there is little doubt .
“ The difference had grown to a 14 percent difference , and that ’s indeed quite large , ” said Jos Olivier , a senior scientist at the Dutch agency .
“ It ’s now so large that it ’s quite a robust conclusion . ”
How Did Judaism Start ?
What support is there for the claim that God spoke to all the Jewish people at the foot of Mount Sinai ?
CLICK HERE for short outline
Who did God give the Torah to at Mount Sinai ?
Most people reply , “ God gave the Torah to Moses . ”
And what were the Jewish people doing while Moses was receiving the Torah ?
“ Worshipping the Golden Calf . ”
Correct answers –- but NOT according to the Bible .
The above answers come from Cecil B. DeMille ’s classic film , “ The Ten Commandments . ”
Amazing the impact one movie can have on the Jewish education of generations of Jews .
It ’s a great film , but DeMille should have read the original .
The version found in the Torah is quite different .
The Torah ’s claim is that the entire people heard God speak at Mount Sinai , experiencing national revelation .
God did not just appear to Moses in a private rendezvous ;
He appeared to everyone , some 3 million people .
This claim is mentioned many times in the Torah .
[ Moses told the Israelites ] : ‘ Only beware for yourself and greatly beware for your soul , lest you forget the things that your eyes have beheld .
Do not remove this memory from your heart all the days of your life .
Teach your children and your children ’s children about the day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horev [ Mount Sinai ] ...
God spoke to you from the midst of the fire , you were hearing the sound of words , but you were not seeing a form , only a sound .
He told you of His covenant , instructing you to keep the Ten Commandments , and He inscribed them on two stone tablets . ’
( Deut.4:9-13 ) ‘ You have been shown in order to know that God , He is the Supreme Being .
There is none besides Him .
From heaven he let you hear
His voice in order to teach you , and on earth
He showed you His great fire , and you heard His words amid the fire . ’
( Deut . 4:32 -36 ) Moses called all of Israel and said to them : ‘ Hear , O Israel , the decrees and the ordinances that I speak in your ears today — learn them , and be careful to perform them .
The Lord your God sealed a covenant with us at Horev [ Mount Sinai ] .
Not with our forefathers did God seal this covenant , but with us — we who are here , all of us alive today .
Face to face did God speak with you on the mountain from amid the fire . ’
( Deut. 5:1-4 )
CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL LIST OF NARRATIVES
The Torah claims that the entire Jewish nation heard God speak at Sinai , an assertion that has been accepted as part of their nation ’s history for over 3,000 years .
DeMille ’s mistake is such a big deal because the Jewish claim of national revelation , as opposed to individual revelation , is the central defining event that makes Judaism different than every other religion in the world .
How so ?
HISTORY AND LEGENDS
Two types of stories are part of any national heritage .
The first kind is legends .
Included in this category is George Washington ’s admission to chopping down the cherry tree , along with his statement , “ I can not tell a lie . ” Johnny Appleseed planting apple trees across America with his discarded apple cores is another legend .
Then there is history .
For example , George Washington was the first president of the United States .
William the Conqueror led the Battle of Hastings in 1066 in which Harold , King of England , was killed .
The Jews of Spain were expelled from their country in 1492 , the year Christopher Columbus set sail .
What is the difference between legend and history ?
A legend is an unverified story .
By their very nature legends are unverifiable because they have very few eyewitnesses .
Perhaps little George did chop down the cherry tree .
We ca n’t know if it happened .
This does not mean that the legend is necessarily false , only that it is unverifiable .
No one thinks legends are facts , therefore they are not accepted as reliable history .
History , however , is comprised of events we know actually happened .
It is reliable because we can determine if the claimed event is true or false through a number of ways .
One key to verification is the assertion that large numbers of eyewitnesses observed the specific event .
Why is the number of claimed original witnesses a principal determining factor in making historical accounts reliable ?
This can be understood through looking at the nature of the following series of claims and weighing their levels of credibility .
The nature of the claim itself can often determine its degree of believability .
THE BELIEVABILITY GAME
Gauge the level of credibility of the following scenarios .
Some claims are inherently unverifiable .
For example , would you believe me if I told you the following :
Scenario # 1 :
“ Last week after dinner , I went for a walk through the forest near my house .
Suddenly everything was awash in a tremendous light and God appeared to me , designating me as His prophet .
He told me to announce this revelation to you at this time . ”
Believable ?
In theory this could have happened .
It does n’t seem likely , but you do n’t know I ’m lying .
Would you choose to believe me ?
Without any substantiating evidence , why choose to believe me ?
A foolish move , indeed .
Scenario # 2 :
Would you believe me if I told you the following :
“ Last night while I was eating dinner with my family , the room started to suddenly shake and God ’s booming voice was heard by all of us .
He designated me as His prophet and commanded me to announce this revelation . ”
Believable ?
This could have happened too .
If I were to bring in my family to confirm the story it would be more believable than the first story .
You certainly do n’t know if I ’m lying .
Would you believe me ?
Would you fork over $ 10,000 dollars if I told you God commanded you to do so ?
No way .
There is still not enough evidence to trust my claim — because it is very possible that my family is lying .
Scenario # 3 :
There is another type of claim that you can know is false .
For example , would you believe me if I told you this :
“ Do you remember what happened 10 minutes ago just as you began reading this article ?
Remember how the room started shaking , then the ceiling opened up to the skies , and you and I together heard God ’s booming voice come down and say ‘ Thou shalt hearken to the voice of Nechemia Coopersmith for he is my prophet ! ’
And then the room went back to normal and you continued reading .
You remember that , do n’t you ? ”
Is this believable ?
This kind of claim is completely different .
The two previous scenarios at least had the possibility of being true .
You chose not to accept them because they were unverifiable .
However this third scenario is impossible to believe .
I ’m claiming something happened to you that you know did not happen .
Since you did n’t experience it , you know I ’m lying .
I cannot convince you of something that you yourself know did n’t happen .
This first type of claim — that something happened to someone else — is unverifiable , because you do not know for certain that the claim is a lie .
Therefore it is possible for a person to decide to accept the claim as true if he really wanted to and take that leap of faith .
However , the other type of claim — that something happened to you — you know if it is inherently false .
People do not accept patently false assertions , especially those that carry significant consequences .
SINAI : AN IMPOSSIBLE HOAX
So far we have seen two types of claims — one is unverifiable and the other is inherently false .
Could the revelation at Sinai have been a brilliant hoax , duping millions of people into believing that God spoke to them ?
Let ’s imagine the scene .
Moses comes down the mountain and claims , “ We all today heard God speak , all of you heard the God ’s voice from the fire … ”
Assuming Moses is making it up , how would the people respond to his story ?
“ Moses !
What are you talking about ?!
Boy , you sure had us going there for awhile .
We may have even believed you if you came down and claimed that God appeared to you personally .
But now you blew it !
Now we know you ’re lying because you ’re claiming an event happened to us that we know did n’t happen !
We did not hear God speak to us from any fire ! ”
If the revelation at Sinai did not occur , then Moses is claiming an event everyone immediately knows is an outright lie , since they know that they never heard God speak .
It is preposterous to think Moses can get away with a claim that everyone knows is lie .
REVELATION CLAIMED LATER IN HISTORY
Perhaps a hoax such as this could have been attempted at a later period in history .
Perhaps the claim of national revelation did not originate at Sinai , but began , for example , 1,000 years after the event was said to have occurred .
Perhaps the leader Ezra , for example , appears on the scene , introducing a book purported to be written by God and given to a people who stood at Sinai a long time ago .
Could someone get away with this kind of hoax ?
For example , would you believe the following :
“ I want to let you in on a very little - known , but true fact .
In 1794 over 200 years ago , from May until August , the entire continent of North America mysteriously sank under the sea .
For those four months , the whole continent was submerged and somehow all animal , plant and human life managed to adapt to these bizarre conditions .
Then , on August 31 , the entire continent suddenly floated up to the surface and life resumed to normal . ”
Is there a possibility that I ’m telling the truth ?
Do you know for a fact that it is a lie ?
After all , it happened so long ago , how do you know it did n’t happen ?
Maybe you learned about in school and just forgot about it .
You know North America did not sink hundreds of years ago for one simple reason :
If it did , you would have heard about it .
An event so unique and amazing , witnessed by multitudes of people would have been known , discussed , and passed down , becoming a part of history .
The fact that no one has heard of it up until now means you know the story is not true , making it impossible to accept .
An event of great significance with a large number of eyewitnesses cannot be perpetuated as a hoax .
If it did not happen , everyone would realize it is false since no one ever heard about it before .
Thus , if such an event was indeed accepted as part of history , the only way to understand its acceptance is that the event actually happened .
INTRODUCED LATER ?
Let ’s assume for the moment that the revelation at Mount Sinai is really a hoax ; God did not write the Torah .
How did the revelation at Sinai become accepted for thousands of years as part of our nation ’s history ?
Imagine someone trying to pull off such a hoax .
An Ezra figure shows up one day holding a scroll .
“ Hey Ezra – what are you holding there ? ”
“ This is the Torah . ”
“ The Torah ?
What ’s that ? ”
“ It ’s an amazing book filled with laws , history and stories .
Here , take a look at it . ”
Very nice , Ezra .
Where did you get this ? ”
“ Open up the book and see what it says .
This book was given thousands of years ago to your ancestors .
Three million of them stood at Mount Sinai and heard God speak !
God appeared to everyone , giving His law and instruction . ”
How would you respond to such a claim ?
The people give Ezra a quizzical look and say ,
“ Wait a second , Ezra .
Something is a little fishy here .
Why have n’t we ever heard of this before ?
You ’re describing one of the most momentous events that could ever happen , claiming that it happened to our ancestors – and we never heard about it ? ” “ Sure .
It was along time ago .
Of course you never heard about it . ”
“ C’mon Ezra !
It ’s impossible that our grandparents or great - grandparents would not have passed down the most significant event in our nation ’s history to some of the people !
How could it be that no one has heard about this up until now ?!
You ’re claiming all my ancestors , the entire nation , 3 million people heard God speak and received a set of instructions called the Torah , and none of us have heard about it ?!
You must be lying . ”
If one can not pull off a hoax with regard to a continent sinking , so too one cannot pull off a hoax to convince an entire people that their ancestors experienced the most unique event in all of human history .
Everyone would know it ’s a lie .
For thousands of years , Sinai was accepted as central to Jewish history .
How else can this be explained ?
Given that people will not fall for a hoax they know is a lie , how could national revelation have been not only accepted — but faithfully followed with great sacrifice by the vast majority of Jews ?
The only way a people would accept such a claim is if it really happened .
If Sinai did not happen , everyone would know it ’s a lie and it would never have been accepted .
The only way one can ever claim a nation experienced revelation and have it accepted is if it is true .
SINAI : THE ONLY CLAIM OF NATIONAL REVELATION
Throughout history , tens of thousands of religions have been started by individuals , attempting to convince people that God spoke to him or her .
All religions that base themselves on some type of revelation share essentially the same beginning : a holy person goes into solitude , comes back to his people , and announces that he has experienced a personal revelation where God appointed him to be His prophet .
Would you believe someone who claims to have received a personal communication from God appointing him or her as God ’s new prophet ?
Maybe
He did .
Then again , maybe
He did n’t .
One can never know .
The claim is inherently unverifiable .
Personal revelation is an extremely weak basis for a religion since one can never know if it is indeed true .
Even if the individual claiming personal revelation performs miracles , there is still no verification that he is a genuine prophet .
Miracles do not prove anything .
All they show — assuming they are genuine — is that he has certain powers .
It has nothing to do with his claim of prophecy .
Maimonides writes :
Israel did not believe in Moses , our teacher , on account of the miracles he performed .
For when one ’s faith is based on miracles , doubt remains in the mind that these miracles may have been done through the occult and witchcraft …
What then were the grounds of believing him ?
The revelation on Sinai which we saw with our own eyes , and heard with our own ears , not having to depend on the testimony of others …
( Mishna Torah - Foundations of Torah 8:1 )
A BOLD PREDICTION
There are 15,000 known religions in all of recorded history .
Given this inherent weakness , why do all of them base their claim on personal revelation ?
If someone wanted their religion to be accepted , why would n’t they present the strongest , most believable claim possible — i.e. national revelation !
It ’s far more credible .
No one has to take a leap of faith and blindly trust just one person ’s word .
It is qualitatively better to claim that God came to everyone , telling the entire group that so - and - so is His prophet .
Why would God establish
His entire relationship with a nation through one man , without any possibility of verification , and still expect this nation to obediently follow an entire system of instructions , based only on blind faith ?
Yet , Judaism is the only religion in the annals of history that makes the best of all claims — that everyone heard God speak .
No other religion claims the experience of national revelation .
Why ?
Furthermore , the author of the Torah predicts that there will never be another claim of national revelation throughout history !
‘ You might inquire about times long past , from the day that God created man on earth , and from one end of heaven to the other :
Has there ever been anything like this great thing or has anything like it been heard ?
Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fires as you have heard and survived ? ’ ( Deut. 4:32 -33 )
Let ’s consider the option that God did not write the Torah , and its author successfully convinced a group of people to accept a false claim of national revelation .
In this book , the author writes a prediction that over the course of history no one will ever make a similar claim .
That means if such a claim is ever made at some future time , the prediction will end up being false and his religion is finished .
How could the author include in the book he is passing off as a hoax the prediction that no other person will ever attempt to perpetuate the same hoax when he just made that exact claim ?
If he could do it , he can be certain that others will too , especially since it is the best possible claim to make .
If you are making up a religion , you do not write something you know you cannot predict and whose outcome you would think is guaranteed to be exactly the opposite .
However , aside from the Jewish claim of Mount Sinai , it is a fact that no other nation has ever claimed such a similar national revelation .
Let ’s summarize two primary questions :
1 . Out of 15,000 known religions in recorded history , why is Judaism the only one that claims national revelation , the best of all claims ?
Why do all other religions base themselves on the inherently weak assertion of personal revelation ?
2 . If Judaism ’s claim is indeed an example of a successful hoax that falsely asserts national revelation , the author just got away with passing off the best possible claim , and others will certainly follow suit .
Why then would he predict that no one else will ever make a similar claim , a prediction he knows he cannot foresee , and whose outcome is likely to be the exact opposite ?
There is one simple answer to both questions .
A national revelation — as opposed to personal revelation — is the one lie you can not get away with .
It is one event you cannot fabricate .
The only way to make this claim is if it actually happened .
If the claim is true , the people will believe it because they are agreeing to something they already know .
Either they personally witnessed it , or their ancestors collectively passed down the account as part of their nation ’s accepted history .
If the claim is false , it ’s like trying to convince you that God spoke to you or your parents and somehow you never heard of it .
No one would ever accept such a claim .
Therefore no other religion has ever made the best of all claims , because it is the one claim that can only be made if it is true .
One can not pass national revelation off as a hoax .
When inventing a religion , the originator must resort to personal revelation , despite its inherent weakness , since it is a claim that is unverifiable .
The originator can hope to find adherents willing to take a leap of faith and accept his or her religion .
After all , no one can ever know it is a lie .
[ Of course , no one can know if it ’s true either . ]
This simply cannot work with national revelation since it ’s the one claim that everyone will know is a lie .
Only Judaism can claim national revelation since the Jewish people is the only nation in the history of mankind who ever experienced it .
Furthermore , it is interesting to note that the other major religions of the world both accept the Jewish revelation at Sinai , including the Five Books of Moses in their Bible , and hold the Sinai revelation as a key component of their religion .
When starting their own religions , why did they build upon the Jewish claim ?
Why did n’t they just deny the revelation ever happened ?
The answer is that they knew that if national revelation can never be fabricated ; so too , its validity can therefore never be denied .
Now it is understandable how the Author of the Torah can confidently predict that there will never be another claim of national revelation in history .
Because only God knew it would happen only once , as it did — at Sinai over 3,000 years ago .

Stroll around a typical home - goods store and you might feel as though you ’re walking outdoors – everything is turning green .
Over the past year , more mainstream companies have jumped on the green bandwagon , unveiling “ natural ” cleaners , recycled products and packaging , sustainably made furniture , and housewares aimed at a growing market niche : the green consumer .
Wal - Mart , for instance , is stocking shelves with organic cotton towels and Clorox ’s latest cleaning line , Green Works .
Walk into Crate & Barrel , and you ’ll probably notice chairs made of sustainable wood , teak dining collections , and a shopping environment with a low - energy lighting system .
Companies are realizing that going green – or at least sprinkling some green into their mix of conventional products – is good business .
Indeed , American consumers are expected to double their spending on eco­friendly products and services in the next year to an estimated $ 500 billion , according to Landor Associates .
“ I find myself weighing a green purchase versus a regular purchase , and there were many times in the past when price would have made the decision for me , ” says Leah Ingram of New Hope , Pa. , whose blog , The Lean Green Family , chronicles her family ’s transition to a greener lifestyle .
“ Now that I ’m more aware of [ the environment ] , I ’m willing to spend a little more . ”
Yet it ’s unclear how much of an impact all this green buying will actually have on the environment .
Purchasing anything , regardless of how green it is , adds something to a person ’s carbon footprint .
And concern is growing over “ greenwashing ” – or misleading claims made by companies about the environmental benefits of their products .
“ There ’s so much greenwashing going on .
It can be frustrating to find out which companies are really green , ” says Amy Todisco , owner of GreenLivingNow.com , an online natural products store in Huntington , Vt . “ When you find out that [ some brands ] are not doing what we thought they were doing , it ’s very disheartening . ”
Ms. Todisco has been researching products like laundry detergent , cleaning supplies , and personal - care items for more than 14 years .
She ’s found that many that are marketed as “ natural ” still use synthetic ingredients .
One of the challenges for consumers is that there are no uniform standards for “ green , ” says Celia Lehrman , deputy home editor of Consumer Reports .
As a result , products are appearing on store shelves in shades of green .
One company may remove or substitute a few ingredients and call the result ecofriendly when , in fact , its product still contains traces of harmful elements .
Another company may take an approach in which everything from materials to packaging to distribution is designed to be as ecofriendly as possible .
While this is the ideal , it can get complicated and expensive in a global economy , says Ed Stafford , an associate professor of marketing at Utah State University who has studied green marketing .
Ms. Lehrman suggests that consumers look for third - party certification on products .

One area consumers are n’t likely to overlook in deciding on a product is performance , says Dr. Stafford .
If a company decides to go green , its product has to be as good as the nongreen product .
“ The bottom line is , we do n’t buy carpet cleaner to save the planet .
We buy it to clean our carpets . ”
Testing of green and energy - efficient products has shown that performance is improving on the whole , Lehrman says , although she advises checking the Consumer Reports website for specific product reviews .
Sometimes , just refraining from buying anything is the greenest choice a consumer can make , experts say .
“ If you need something new , you have to weigh the whole life - cycle cost of the product and decide whether or not you ’re really helping the environment by buying something , ” Lehrman says , citing $ 400 organic sheets as an example .
“ Is it better to just not buy new sheets ? ”
“ Buy less , buy better , and when possible , buy local , ” advises Maxwell Gillingham - Ryan , creator of “ Apartment Therapy , ” a book and website that encourages green living .
He advocates “ editing ” your home , buying only what you really need .
“ The whole green mantra is ‘ reduce , reuse , and recycle . ’
It ’s not ‘ shop , ’ ” says Linda Hunter , author of “ Green Clean , ” a guide to green cleaning solutions .
But trying to transform your entire home into a green one overnight can seem daunting , says Ms. Ingram .
“ You have to take it step by step .
I ca n’t change everything about how I live , but ... if you just take it a little at a time , it wo n’t feel so overwhelming . ”
How to tell if a product is really green
When you ’re buying green products for your home , checking the label is n’t enough , consumer advocates say .
It ’s better to check for third - party certification .
Some common ones :
• Designed for the Environment – Introduced by the US Envir­onmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to indicate that products contain environmentally preferable ingredients .
• Green Seal – Aims to reduce the environmental impacts tied to the use , manufacture , and disposal of products and services .
• Energy Star –
An EPA certification whose goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency .
• Water Sense –
It certifies water - efficient products such as faucets and toilets .
• Forest Stewardship Council – Products that bear the FSC logo are guaranteed to contain wood or wood products harvested from a certified , well - managed forest .
• Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) – Promotes sustainable site development , water savings , energy efficiency , sustainable materials selection , and indoor environmental quality .
