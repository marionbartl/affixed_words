The survey confirms money does not buy happiness A new study of more than 65 countries published in the UK's New Scientist magazine suggests that the happiest people in the world live in Nigeria - and the least happy , in Romania .
People in Latin America , Western Europe and North America are happier than their counterparts in Eastern Europe and Russia .
HAPPINESS AROUND THE WORLD
The happiest Nigeria Mexico Venezuela El Salvador Puerto Rico
The least happy Russia Armenia Romania Source : New Scientist Nigeria has the highest percentage of happy people followed by Mexico , Venezuela , El Salvador and Puerto Rico , while Russia , Armenia and Romania have the fewest .
But factors that make people happy may vary from one country to the next with personal success and self - expression being seen as the most important in the US , while in Japan , fulfilling the expectations of family and society is valued more highly .
The survey appears to confirm the old adage that money cannot buy happiness .
PATH TO HAPPINESS Genetic propensity to happiness Marriage Make friends and value them Desire less
Do someone a good turn Have faith ( religious or not )
Stop comparing your looks with others Earn more money Grow old gracefully Don't worry if you 're not a genius
The researchers for World Values Survey described the desire for material goods as " a happiness suppressant " .
They say happiness levels have remained virtually the same in industrialised countries since World War II , although incomes have risen considerably .
The exception is Denmark , where people have become more satisfied with life over the last three decades .
The study was carried out in 1999 - 2001 and published for the first time by New Scientist this week .
Consumerism Researchers believe the unchanging trend is linked to consumerism .
" New Zealand ranked 15 for overall satisfaction , the US 16th , Australia 20th and Britain 24th - although Australia beats the other three for day - to - day happiness , " New Scientist says .
The survey is a worldwide investigation of socio-cultural and political change conducted about every four years by an international network of social scientists .
It includes questions about how happy people are and how satisfied they are with their lives .
Although such surveys are not new , they are being increasingly taken into account by policy makers , the magazine says .

Astronomers at the University of California , Berkeley , and NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center have released a rather remarkable Hubble image of a ring of dust around star Fomalhaut , described by New Scientist as resembling " the Great Eye of Sauron " .
The boffins used the Hubble coronagraph to block light from Fomalhaut and enhance the ring which , as you can see , is " significantly askew " .
The reason for this , they postulate , is that the dust ring is under the influence of orbiting planet ( or planets ) , possibly a body rotating around the star at approximately Pluto 's distance from the sun , or one - third of the ring 's radius .
Fomalhaut , aka Alpha Piscis Austrini , is one of the brightest stars in the night sky , lying around 25 light years from Earth and weighing in at roughly 2.3 solar masses .
Its name comes from the Arabic fum al - ħawt , or " whale 's mouth " , although we reckon " Sauron 's Eye " might be a suitable new moniker . ®
The Purpose Of The Constitution
What the Constitution Does
The founding fathers established the Constitution to do just two things :
Establish a federal government for the United States of America Delegate to the federal government certain , limited ( and enumerated ) powers .
The Constitution was written by the thirteen original states .
The federal government created by the states , via the Constitution , exists to serve the states .
Until the states delegated some powers to the new federal government , those powers belonged to the states .
The states , of course , delegated only some of their powers to the federal government while retaining most of their powers for themselves .
It is important to recognize that the states are the " boss " of the federal government !
The states " hired " the federal government and set forth the rules as to how it should operate .
The Constitution is a list of those rules .
Just as a manager is expected to enforce company rules to manage employees , it is the responsibility of the states to enforce the Constitution to manage the federal government .
The Supreme Court , being itself part of the federal government , has an obvious conflict of interest .
Yes , it pretends to enforce the Constitution against the Executive and Legislative branches , but who will " manage " the Supreme Court ?
Who will watch the watchers ?
The states are the rightful and logical enforcers of the Constitution .
It helps to keep this in mind in the discussion which follows .
What the Constitution Does Not Do
The Constitution does not give you rights .
The founders considered your rights to be " God - given " or " natural rights " — you are born with all your rights .
The constitution does , however , protect your rights by :
Limiting the powers of government by granting to it only those specific powers that are listed in the Constitution ; ( This has not proven to be effective of late . )
of government by granting to it only those specific powers that are listed in the Constitution ; ( This has not proven to be effective of late . )
Enumerating certain , specific rights which you retain .
These are listed in the Bill of Rights .
The rights deemed most important by the founders are specifically listed in the Bill of Rights .
The Bill of Rights also says that , even though a particular right is not listed in the Bill of Rights , you still retain that right .
Any powers not specifically delegated by the Constitution to the federal government are retained by the states and the people ( you ) .
So , without the Constitution , the states and the people have all the rights and there is no federal government .
With the Constitution , the states and the people keep any rights not specifically delegated to the federal government by the Constitution .
The Constitution states this very clearly .
Unfortunately , the government today seems to recognize only those rights specifically listed in the Bill of Rights and even these often receive little more than lip service , when your rights interfere with some government objective .
Steiger 's Law
Sam Steiger is a former Congressman from Arizona .
At a talk given July 31 , 1982 , at The Nevada Libertarian Party " CANDIDATE'S CONVENTION " in Las Vegas , Nevada , he suggested what he called " Steiger 's Law " : " People involved in a structure spend more time and energy maintaining that structure than in working toward its goals . "
How is Steiger 's Law applicable to the Constitutionality Crisis ?
The federal government , having been created to serve the states and the people , has degraded to the point that it is more concerned with perpetuating itself than with carrying out its constitutionally delegated duties .
Rather than serving you by protecting your rights , as charged by the Constitution , the government has goals and objectives of its own , often in conflict with your rights .
While you may have all the rights ( the Constitution specifically says so ) , the government has all the power .
When your rights and the government 's goals are in conflict , you lose .
We the People created the government of the United States to serve us , not the other way around .
Today it would be difficult for an outsider to determine that We the People do n't exist to serve the government .
In order to carry out its grandiose plans and achieve its goals , government has to exercise powers well outside those limited powers granted it by the Constitution .
The Supreme Court has been a willing accomplice , permitting gradual but continuous expansion of government power .
As soon as We the People become accustomed to living with the latest power grab , powers are expanded yet again .
The government sees no practical limits on its power .
In the rare event that some law or part of a law , is found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court , Congress just reworks the text a little and then passes essentially the same ( unconstitutional ) law again .
In its practice of Judicial Review , too often the Supreme Court is not asking : " Are this citizen 's rights being violated by this law ? "
Instead the question is : " Is the violation of this citizen 's rights justified because of overriding government goals and objectives ? "
Too often the answer the court delivers is " yes . "
When your rights get in the way of a government objective , you lose .
Government created to protect your rights should have no goal higher than the protection of those rights .
When government 's own goals override your rights , government is acting unconstitutionally .
Government often states that these violations of citizens ' rights are necessary " for the good of society . "
Society is ill served by laws which violate the rights of the citizens making up that society .
An ( imperfect ) Analogy
The Constitution ( and the federal government it brought into existence ) was created by the states to serve the states .
It sets forth the rules for how the government must behave and says , in effect ( in the tenth amendment ) " Any powers that we did not give to you are ours ; we 're still the boss . "
This is like exercising parental control .
You tell your child how to act , with whom he ( or she ) may associate and what time he must be home .
You assign household chores and responsibilities .
In short , you establish rules of proper conduct .
Suppose that this works fine for a while , but as your child grows , he begins testing the boundaries you had set and breaking the rules , but you do nothing to prevent it .
One day you realize that your child is making his own rules , even telling you what to do and what you cannot do .
If you object that he is not acting within the rules you set down , he says that he knows better than you what your rules mean .
If you try to assert your own rights , you are punished — your child is now bigger and stronger than you are .
Your child 's allowance demands are ever increasing .
If you do n't do something to correct the situation soon , you 'll be declared incompetent and your child will control all aspects of your life .
It 's time to remember who 's the boss , time for the states to regain control of a government which thinks the states are subordinate to it .
The federal government exists to serve the states , not the other way around .
The states have the right and the duty to restrain the federal government .
Unfortunately , most state governments do n't seem to understand this !

The planes were subjected to tremendous force
Origami plane test
Japan is the country , after all , which has all but perfected the electronic toilet and yet still endeavours to better the design .
Professor Shinichi Suzuki of the University of Tokyo is the latest slightly eccentric pioneer .
His team is testing a paper aeroplane they want to launch from the International Space Station to glide back to earth .
The plan is to ask a Japanese astronaut who will travel to the ISS later this year to throw about 100 of the planes into space .
Heat resistant
Professor Suzuki's team are working at a research laboratory at the University of Tokyo .
They are testing prototypes of a paper plane designed by the Japan Origami Airplane Association .
The association approached the professor for help in getting their design into space .
The plane has been touched up and is ready to go
The plane looks somewhat like the Space Shuttle .
The models tested in the laboratory 's hypersonic wind tunnel are made of paper treated with a compound that increases its heat resistance .
Setting up the experiment takes some time .
It is not easy to fix the prototype in place , and then to attach the wires which will measure the temperatures it is subjected to .
So far the planes have resisted wind speeds of up to Mach 7 , seven times the speed of sound .
They have also endured temperatures of around 300 degrees Celsius .
Eventually , though , everything is ready .
The team retreats upstairs to the control room and the experiment gets under way .
Not discouraged
Within a few seconds it is over .
On a monitor the shockwaves can be seen bending back the front of the plane .
After about six or seven seconds it can take no more .
The team are not discouraged , though .
They are testing the plane to its limits .
This experiment has subjected it to far stronger forces that it would face re-entering the earth 's atmosphere .
Professor Suzuki says if he can persuade the US agency NASA and the Japanese space agency , JAXA , to allow Japan 's next astronaut to release the planes , the project would help to inspire new designs for lightweight re-entry vehicles or craft that could explore the upper reaches of the earth 's atmosphere .
The plane eventually used will be slightly larger , as shown
" We think from this experiment we will be able to create new concepts and in the very near future perhaps new types of airship from this design , " he says .
He hopes it will also inspire school children to take an interest in science .
The planes being tested are about 8 cm long and weigh less than 30g .
As 70 % of the earth 's surface is water , the professor 's team estimates that a plane thrown from the space station would have only a 4 - 5 % chance of hitting land .
That is why they would want an astronaut to release around 100 of the planes .
The International Space Station is 400 km above the earth 's surface , and a successful flight would be the longest flight ever by a paper plane .
The team hopes that in future they might be able to develop a tracking device that can be fixed to the plane .
But in the meantime there is just a low - tech alternative - to write messages in various languages on the paper asking people to send it back to Japan if they find it .
Mr Kostunica is at odds with President Tadic
The move follows his failure to get his cabinet to reject closer ties with the European Union in the wake of Kosovo 's declaration of independence .
Mr Kostunica , a nationalist , has described the decision by EU states to recognise Kosovo as illegal .
Serbian President Boris Tadic has said he will call elections , but did not set a date for the poll .
" I respect the prime minister 's decision that he is no longer able to lead the government of Serbia and when I get the government 's decision , I will call an election , " he said in a statement .
" Elections are the democratic way to overcome political crises and the people are the only ones who have right to decide which is the way forward for Serbia . "
Secret plan
Mr Tadic says Belgrade will only be able to defend its right to Kosovo if it joins the EU .
The government of Serbia has no united policy any more on an important issue related to the future of the country - Kosovo as a part of Serbia

Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February .
The United States and major EU countries have recognised it as independent .
Serbia , backed by its ally , Russia , says it will never accept an independent Kosovo .
The government in Belgrade has allegedly agreed a secret plan against Kosovo and countries that recognise it .
It is unclear what it contains .
May polls ?
Mr Kostunica 's Democratic Party of Serbia ( DSS ) split with its coalition partner , the Democratic Party ( DS ) of Mr Tadic , over policy towards the EU in the wake of Kosovo 's independence declaration .
The outgoing prime minister has maintained that ties can improve only if the EU rejects Kosovo 's declaration of independence .
Belgrade has reacted angrily to an EU mission to ease Kosovo 's transition .
The DSS is backing a draft resolution from the opposition nationalist Radical Party , condemning the EU 's 1,800 - strong mission to Kosovo as illegal and calling on countries to overturn their decision to recognise it .
But a number of pro-Western ministers have failed to support Mr Kostunica 's approach .
" The government of Serbia has no united policy any more on an important issue related to the future of the country - Kosovo as a part of Serbia , " Mr Kostunica told reporters as he announced his move in Belgrade .
" Such a government could not function any more , " he said .
Mr Kostunica said " we should return the mandate to the people " - and added that he had scheduled a cabinet meeting on 10 March to propose calling for early elections to be held on 11 May - the date for Serbia 's local elections .
No party has a majority in the Serbian parliament .
The political establishment in Serbia has been deeply divided over the way forward and a general election would be the first opportunity for the people of Serbia to express their views , says the BBC's Nick Hawton in Belgrade .
Kosovo 's declaration of independence came nearly a decade after Nato forces expelled Serbian forces from the mainly ethnic - Albanian territory .
These days , even free - market enthusiasts are talking about increased regulation of securities firms now that the Fed has shown that it will rush to their rescue if they get into trouble .
But Mr. McCain is selling the same old snake oil , claiming that deregulation and tax cuts cure all ills .

Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
Hillary Clinton ’s speech could not have been more different .
True , Mrs. Clinton ’s suggestion that she might convene a high - level commission , including Alan Greenspan  who bears a lot of responsibility for this crisis  had echoes of the excessively comfortable relationship her husband ’s administration developed with the investment industry .
But the substance of her policy proposals on mortgages , like that of her health care plan , suggests a strong progressive sensibility .
Maybe the most notable contrast between Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton involves the problem of restructuring mortgages .
Mr. McCain called for voluntary action on the part of lenders  that is , he proposed doing nothing .
Mrs. Clinton wants a modern version of the Home Owners ’ Loan Corporation , the New Deal institution that acquired the mortgages of people whose homes were worth less than their debts , then reduced payments to a level the homeowners could afford .
Finally , Barack Obama ’s speech on the economy on Thursday followed the cautious pattern of his earlier statements on economic issues .
I was pleased that Mr. Obama came out strongly for broader financial regulation , which might help avert future crises .
But his proposals for aid to the victims of the current crisis , though significant , are less sweeping than Mrs. Clinton ’s : he wants to nudge private lenders into restructuring mortgages rather than having the government simply step in and get the job done .
Mr. Obama also continues to make permanent tax cuts  middle - class tax cuts , to be sure  a centerpiece of his economic plan .
It ’s not clear how he would pay both for these tax cuts and for initiatives like health care reform , so his tax - cut promises raise questions about how determined he really is to pursue a strongly progressive agenda .
All in all , the candidates ’ positions on the mortgage crisis tell the same tale as their positions on health care : a tale that is seriously at odds with the way they ’re often portrayed .

What makes Mathematics hard to learn ?
Feb 16 , 2008 .
An essay from Marvin Minsky
Why do some children find Math hard to learn ?
I suspect that this is often caused by starting with the practice and drill of a bunch of skills called Arithmetic — and instead of promoting inventiveness , we focus on preventing mistakes .
I suspect that this negative emphasis leads many children not only to dislike Arithmetic , but also later to become averse to everything else that smells of technology .
It might even lead to a long - term distaste for the use of symbolic representations .
Anecdote : A parent once asked me to tutor a student who was failing to learn the multiplication table .
When the child complained that this was hard , I tried to explain that this was not a big job because there are less than 50 facts to learn ( because AxB = BxA ) .
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 4 3 6 9 4 8 12 16 5 10 15 20 25 6 12 18 24 30 36 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81
However , that child had a larger - scale complaint : “ Last year I had to learn the addition table and it was really boring .
This year I have to learn another , harder one , and I figure if I learn it then next year there will be another one and there ’ll never be any end to this stupid nonsense . "
This child imagined ‘ Math ’ to be a continuous string of mechanical tasks — an unending prospect of practice and drill .
It was hard to convince him that there would not be any more tables in subsequent years .
To deal with the immediate problem , I made a deck of “ flash cards , ” each of which showed two digits on the front and their product on the back .
The process was to guess each answer and , if it was correct , then to remove that card from the deck .
This made the task seem more like a game in which one can literally feel one ’s progress as the size and weight of the deck diminishes .
Shortly the child excitedly said , “ This deck is a really smart teaching machine !
It remembers which products I ’ve learned , and then only asks for the ones I do n’t know , so it saves me from wasting a lot of time ! ”
However , a more serious problem was that this child had no good image or “ cognitive map ” of what might result from learning this subject .
What function might Math serve in later years ?
What goals and ambitions might it help to achieve ?
Anecdote : I asked a younger child “ how much is 15 and 15 ” and she quickly answered , “ I think it ’s 30 . ” I asked how she figured that out so fast and she replied , “ Well , everyone knows that 16 and 16 is 32 , and then I subtracted the extra 1’s . ”
Traditional teacher : “ Your answer is right but your method was wrong : you should add the two 5 ’s to make a 10 ; then write down a 0 and carry a 1 , and then add it to the other two 1’s . ”
[ Note that the child 's method is not wrong , and is not an approximation . ]
The traditional emphasis on accuracy leads to weakness of ability to make order - of - magnitude estimates — whereas this particular child already knew and could use enough powers of 2 to make approximations that rivaled some adult ’s abilities .
Why should children learn only “ fixed - point ” arithmetic , when “ floating point ” thinking is usually better for problems of everyday life !
More generally , we need to find out more about how each child regards each subject .
How might it answer questions like “ What am I doing here , and why ?
” What can I expect to happen next ? ” “ Where and when am I likely to use this ?
Students need Cognitive Maps of their Subjects
Until the 20th century , mathematics was mainly composed of Arithmetic , Geometry , Algebra , and Calculus ; then Logic and Topology started to rapidly grow .
Then the 1950s saw a great explosion of new ideas about the nature of computation — ideas that are now so indispensable that our primary school curriculum is out of date by a century .
Today , our new computational concepts have become so useful and powerful that we should start teaching them in earlier years .
We usually think of Arithmetic as a subject in itself .
But we can also think of it , instead , as just a certain bunch of algorithms — which suggests that we could begin with simpler and more interesting ones !
For example , if you look at my book on Computation , you ’ll see many concepts that apply to very wide ranges of phenomena — yet in the first hundred pages of that book , you ’ll find virtually no Arithmetic .
For example , we could engage our children ’s early minds with some theories about Finite State Machines , and this would provide them with useful ways to think about the programs that they create with the low - cost computers that they now possess .
Languages like Logo and Scratch can help children to experiment with geometry , physics , math , and linguistics — and then go on to make practical systems that their communities can develop and share .
For Geometry , we can make interactive graphical programs that can lead young children to observe and explore various sorts of symmetries — and thus begin to grasp the higher - level ideas that mathematicians call “ The Theory of Groups ” — which can be seen as a basis for Arithmetic , but could also help to understand many aspects of other subjects .
For Physics , children can have access to programs that simulate the dynamics of structures , and thus become familiar with such important concepts as stress and strain , acceleration , momentum , energy — and vibration , damping , and dimensional scaling .
In any case , we need to provide our children with better cognitive maps of the subjects we want them to learn .
I asked several grade - school teachers how often they actually used long division .
One of them said , " I use it each year to compute the average grade . ”
Another claimed to have used it for keeping track of financial transactions ( but could n’t recall a specific example ) and none seemed to have adequate maps of mathematics as a potential lifetime activity .
Here is a simple but striking example of a case in which a child lacked a cognitive map :
A child was sent to me because he was failing a geometry class , and he gave this excuse : " I must have been absent on the day when they explained how to prove a theorem . "
No wonder this child was confused — and seemed both amazed and relieved when I explained that there was no standard way to make proofs — and that “ you have to figure it out for yourself ” .
One could say that this child simply was n’t told the rules of the game he was asked to play .
However , this is a very peculiar case in which the ‘ rule ’ is that there are no rules !
( In fact , automatic theorem - provers do exist , but I would not recommend their use . )
Bringing Mathematics to Life
What is mathematics , anyway ?
I once was in a classroom where some children were writing LOGO programs .
One program was making colored flowers grow on the screen , and someone asked if the program was using mathematics .
The child replied , “ Oh , mathematics is n’t anything special : it ’s just the smart way to understand things . ”
Here are a few kinds of questions that pupils should ask about the mathematical concepts we ask them to learn :
Geometry :
Why are 2 triangles congruent , when their corresponding sides are equal ?
Answer : a triangle has only 3 degrees of freedom — which means that there is no way to change its shapes once those lengths are constrained .
And that ’s why structures built with triangles are so strong !
We all live in a 3 - D world , but few people learn good ways to think about 3 - D objects .
Should this be seen as a handicap ?
How many different ways can you paint 6 colors on the faces of a cube ?
Can you envision how to make a cube using 3 identical 5 - sided objects ?
We know that gloves come in left - and right - hand forms — but why are there only two such versions of things ?
Arithmetic :
Why is prime factorization unique ?
Few high - school teachers are able to prove this !
How does recursion lead to exponentiation ?
How do populations grow ?
How do animal organs grow ?
Why does “ compound interest ’ tend to add more digits at constant rates ?
Logic :
If most A ’s are B’s , and most B’s are C’s , does this imply that some of the A ’s must also be C’s ?
( Most people say Yes , but the answer is No . )
We all try to use logical arguments , but we should also learn the most common mistakes .
Is it possible that when Mr. Smith moved from Company A to Company B , this raised the average IQ of both institutions ?
Statistics :
Even a small background in mathematics can help to approach many other fields and areas — and few mathematical subjects rival Statistics in the range of its everyday applications .
How do effects accumulate ?
What kinds of knowledge and experience could help children to make better generalizations ?
How should one evaluate evidence ?
What ’s the difference between correlation and cause ?
What are the most common forms of biases — and why one needs to be skeptical of anecdotes .
What are the most common kinds of mistakes , such as Post Hoc vs. Propter Hoc ?
In particular , it seems to me , that we should try to get children to learn use the “ T - test ” method , which is a simple statistical test , yet which handles huge ranges of situations .
Also they should understand using square roots to assess variations .
Example : Basketball scores are frequently not statistically significant !
Combinatorics : Consider that , when we teach about democracy , few pupils ever recognize that , in an electoral - college voting system , a 26 % minority can win an election — and if there are 2 tiers of this , then a mere 7 % minority could win !
How do cultural memes manage to propagate ?
How does economics work ?
At what point should we try to teach at least the simplest aspects of the modern Theory of Games ?
Abstract Algebra and Topology :
These are considered to be very advanced , even postgraduate .
Yet there are many phenomena that are hard to describe if one lacks access to those ideas — such as fixed - points , symmetries , singularities , and other features of dynamic trajectories , all of which appear in many real - world phenomena .
Every large society is a complex organization that can only be well described by using representations at many different levels of abstraction — e.g. , in terms of person , family , village , town , city , country , and whole - world economy — and “ higher mathematics ” has many concepts that could help to better understand such structures .
How can we encourage children to invent and carry out more elaborate processes in their heads ?
Teachers often insist that pupils “ show their work ” — which means to make them “ write down every step . ”
This is convenient for making grades , as well as for diagnosing mistakes , but I suspect that this focus on ‘ writing things down ’ could lead to mental slowness and awkwardness , by discouraging pupils from trying to learn to perform those processes inside their heads — so that they can use mathematical thinking in ‘ real time ’ .
It is n’t merely a matter of speed , but of being able to keep in mind an adequate set of alternative goals and being able to quickly switch among different strategies and representations .
This suggests that OLPC should promote the development of programs that help pupils to improve their working memories , and to refine the ways that they represent things in their minds :
The Impoverished Language of School - Mathematics .
There ’s something peculiar about how we teach math .
If you look at each subject in elementary school — History , English , Social Studies , etc. — you 'll see that each pupil learns hundreds of new words in every term .
You learn the names of many countries and organizations , the names of leaders and battles and wars , the names of many authors and books — thousands of new words every year .
However , in the case of school - mathematics , the vocabulary is remarkably small .
The children do learn the names of various objects and processes — such as addition , multiplication , fraction , quotient , divisor , rectangle , parallelogram , and cylinder , equation , variable , function , and graph .
However , they learn only a few such terms per year — which means that , in mathematics , our children are mentally starved , by having to live in a “ linguistic desert . ”
It really is hard to think about something until one learns enough terms to express the ideas in that subject .
Specifically , it is n’t enough just to learn nouns ; one also needs adequate adjectives !
What 's the word for when you should use addition ?
It ’s when a phenomenon is linear .
What 's the word for when you should use multiplication ?
That ’s when something is quadratic or bilinear .
How does one describe processes that change suddenly or gradually : one needs terms like discrete and continuous .
To talk about similarities , one needs terms like isomorphic and homotopic .
Our children all need better ways to talk about , not only Arithmetic and Geometry , but also vocabularies for the ideas one needs to think about statistics , logic , and topology .
This suggests an opportunity for the OLPC children ’s community : to try to set up discussion groups that encourage the everyday use of mathematical terms — communities in which a child can say “ nonlinear ” and have others admire , and not discourage her .
Mentors and Communities :
If one tries to learn a substantial skill without a good conceptual map , one is likely to end up with several collections of scripts and facts , without good ways to know which of them to use , and when — or how to find good alternatives when what you tried has failed to work .
But how can our children acquire such maps ?
In the times before our modern schools , most young children mainly learned by being forced to work on particular jobs , and ended up without very much ‘ general ’ competence .
However , there always were children who somehow absorbed their supervisors ’ knowledge and skills — and there always were people who knew how to teach the children who were apprenticed to them .
I ’ll come back to this in another Memo about the disadvantages of modern age - based classes .
Today most education is broader , but apprenticeship itself now is rare , because few teachers ever have enough time to interact very much with each of their students : a modern teacher can only do so much .
The result is that no one has time to deal thoroughly questions like “ What am I doing here , and why ?
” What can I expect to happen next ? ” or “ Where and when am I likely to use this ? ”
However , now we can open new networks through which every child can communicate .
This means that we can begin to envision , for each of our children , a competent adult with enough “ spare time ” to serve as a mentor or friend to help them develop their projects and skills .
From where will all those new mentors come ?
Perhaps that problem will solve itself , because our lifespans are rapidly growing .
The current rate of increasing longevity today is one more year for every four , so soon we may have more retired persons than active ones !
Of course , each child will be especially good at learning particular ways to think — so we ’ll also need to develop ways to match up good “ apprenticeship pairs . ”
In effect we ’ll need to develop “ intellectual dating services ” for finding the right persons to emulate !
Developments like these can be shown and displayed with internet reviewers .
In any case , no small school or community can teach all subjects , or serve the needs of individuals whose abilities are atypical .
If a child develops a specialized interest , it is unlikely that any local person can be of much help in developing that child ’s special talents and abilities .
( Nor can any small community offer the range of resources to serve children with limited abilities . )
However , with more global connections , it will be easier to reach others with similar interests , so that each child can join ( or help form ) an interactive community that offers good opportunities .
( Some existing communities will find this hard to accept , because most cultures have evolved to reward those who think about the same subjects in the same ways as do the rest !
This will pose difficult problems for children who want to acquire new ways to think and do things that their neighbors and companions do n't do — and thus escape or break out of the cultures in which they were born .
To deal with this , OLPC will need to develop great new skills of diplomacy . )
Emphasizing Novelty rather than Drudgery ?
Actually , I loved arithmetic in school .
You had to add up a column of numbers and this was fun because there were so many different ways to do it .
You could look here and there and notice three 3's and think , “ that 's almost a 10 so I 'll take a 1 off that 7 and make it a 6 and make that 9 into a 10 . "
But how do you keep from counting some numbers twice ?
In this case , you could think : “ Now I wo n’t count any more 3's . ”
How many children did these things exactly as they were told to do ?
Surely not those who became engineers or mathematicians !
For when you use the same procedure again , there ’s little chance to learn anything new — whereas each new method that you invent will leave you with some new mental skill ( — such as a new way to use your memory ) .
For example , how do you remember when you “ carry ” the number of 10s of a sum ?
Sometimes I ’d mentally put it on my shoulder .
How do you remember a telephone number ?
Most people do n’t have too much trouble with remembering a 7 - digit ‘ local ’ number , but reach for a pen when there ’s also an area code .
However , you can easily learn to mentally put those three other digits into your pocket — or in your left ear , if you do n’t have a pocket !
Why are so many people averse to Math ?
Perhaps this often happens because our usual ways to teach arithmetic only insist on using certain rigid skills , while discouraging each child from trying to invent new ways to do those things .
Indeed , perhaps we should study this subject when we want to discover ways to teach aversion to things !
Negative Expertise
There is a popular idea that , in order to understand something well , it is best to get things right from the start — because then you 'll never make any mistakes .
We tend to think of knowledge in positive terms — and of experts as people who know exactly what to do .
But one could argue that much of an expert ’s competence stems from having learned to avoid the most common bugs .
How much of what each person learns has this negative character ?
It would be hard for scientists to measure this , because a person ’s knowledge about what not to do does n’t overtly show in that individual ’s behavior .
This issue is important because it is possible that our mental accumulations of counterexamples are larger and more powerful than our collections of instances and examples .
If so , then it is also possible that people might learn more from negative rather than from positive reinforcement ?
Many educators have been taught that learning works best when it seems pleasant and enjoyable — but that discounts the value of experiencing frustrations , failures and disappointments .
Besides , many feelings that we regard as positive ( such as beauty , humor , pleasure , and decisiveness ) may result from the censorship of other ideas , inhibition of competing activities , and the suppression of more ambitious goals ( so that , instead of being positive , those feelings actually may reflect the workings of unconscious double negatives ) .

I recently had the chance to shadow New York pediatrician Dr. Barney Softness as he cared for young patients and talked with parents .
I asked Dr. Softness ( yes , that ’s his real name ) to share his thoughts about the mistakes parents make when they visit .
— Tara Parker - Pope
By Barney Softness , M.D.
Recently , a mother and her nervous toddler were waiting for me in my office .
To reassure the child , the mother promised her there would n’t be any needles used during the visit .
“ Right , Dr. Barney ?
No needles ? ”
At that point , I had n’t even examined the child .
I did n’t know what was wrong with her and had no way of knowing if she might need a blood test .
“ That all depends on what is wrong with her , ” I told the mother , who quickly scowled her disapproval , and the child erupted in protests .
Parents are an essential part of their children ’s health care .
Even though pediatricians are trained to treat children , we rely on parents ’ instincts about their child ’s health and their ability to comfort a child during an exam .
Knowing what to say and what not to say can make the experience better for everyone , especially the child .
Yet well - meaning parents , who are really trying to make things as comfortable as possible for their child , can sometimes end up doing the exact opposite .
Here are some examples .
Do n’t make promises you may not be able to keep .
While parents will want to reassure a child who is afraid of needles , it is far worse to make a promise the doctor cannot keep .
Then you have lost trust .
I may look at the child ’s record and discover she is due for a vaccination .
A promise of no needles would mean coming back another time — and the anticipation of coming back for a shot prolongs the agony .
Focus on the positives when you are trying to reassure your child about a doctor visit — a favorite toy in the waiting room , the stickers we give at the end of the visit , or the trip to the playground after the appointment .
Do n’t try to trick kids .
Sometimes parents tell a child he is coming along just to accompany his brother to the doctor , and then surprise him with an exam as well .
Even if it ’s a harmless ear check , it may not seem so to the child , and he wo n’t fall for that one again .
And he wo n’t trust you — or me — next time .
We ’re not the bad guys .
You ’d be surprised how often I hear the phrase : “ Here comes the mean doctor ( or nurse ) . ”
We do sometimes have to do things that are painful or uncomfortable , but it does not do the child any good to portray us as mean or evil .
It makes our job more difficult , and it makes the child think you ’re not doing a very good job protecting her if you ’re allowing us to do the dirty work .
You know it hurts , but we are helping your child , and that is the message you should try to convey .
Do n’t sugarcoat too much .
You may think that a doctor ’s stethoscope on your chest is not much of an issue .
But if a toddler is screaming about it , it is to him .
Telling him that this does n’t hurt , or is even fun , does n’t legitimize his feelings .
And further , if he ’s just learning the language , the next time you tell him you ’re going to the playground to have some fun , he may get the wrong idea .
Do n’t tell me your diagnosis .
Often parents come in to rule out a single ailment — such as Lyme disease or diabetes .
Or they tell me they think their child has another sinus infection or strep throat .
They mean well and usually are worried because someone — or often a Web site — told them their child ’s symptoms match a particular problem .
But , an accurate description of symptoms is much more valuable .
As doctors , we do n’t presume a sore throat is always strep or frequent urination is always diabetes .
It could be any number of things .
However , if you have a specific reason to suspect a particular condition ( for example , her brother has Lyme disease ) , it may help in the analysis .
There ’s no such thing as a quickie .
Squeezing two kids into one appointment is n’t good for your kids , and it ’s not fair to the other children in the waiting room .
Too often parents will bring a sibling along and ask me to “ just check his chest real quick . ”
But even when the quick exam is normal , it often leads to follow - up questions about what else could be wrong .
Each child deserves my full attention .
Let your kids take part in sensitive conversations .
There are obviously certain discussions that need to be conducted out of earshot of the child — divorce , unemployment or the parent ’s health come immediately to mind .
But many times parents do n’t want to embarrass their children by discussing other sensitive subjects in front of them , like bedwetting , constipation , weight or poor school performance .
Sometimes an entire visit is merely a pretense for the real concern , which the parent finally brings up after a child has left the room .
But your child already knows the problem !
Having a parent transmit my advice to the child does n’t work nearly as well as when the child is involved in the original discussion .
If the discussion is handled in a professional matter - of - fact manner , you can almost hear the sigh of relief .
( Even if the child makes no eye contact during the conversation , they are definitely listening . )
It is never as embarrassing as parents expect it to be .

He is on the faculty of Columbia University ’s College of Physicians and Surgeons .

Iodine deficient ?
Neandertal�s prehistoric diet may have lacked a crucial element , says ORNL researcher
Neandertal�s brutish brow and other features are identical to an iodine - deficient human condition called cretinism .
O
Neandertal , who looked very human but was burly and stocky , developed a far less sophisticated culture than Cro-Magnon , the first modern humans in Europe , who emerged about 40,000 years ago .
Cro-Magnon apparently existed alongside Neandertal , but no one knows whether they made contact or not , either culturally or sexually .
After a 200,000 - year run , Neandertal vanished .
No one can say for sure what distinguished Neandertals from modern humans , but Computational Physics and Engineering Division researcher Jerry Dobson has a theory .
In an article soon to be published in the Geographical Review , he suggests that Neandertals may have been iodine deficient .
A single genetic difference in the thyroid gland , which controls iodine extraction from food , could account for many other differences in bone structure and body shape .
The bones of Neandertal ( the spelling scholars prefer over Neanderthal ) were first unearthed in Germany but since have been found in inland areas throughout Europe and Western Asia .
They reveal numerous similarities to modern humans who suffer from iodine deficiency disorder �in its most severe form , cretinism .
� Distinctive Neandertal traits �overall body proportions , heavy brows and muscles , dental development and wear and propensities for degenerative joint diseases �are identical to those of modern humans suffering from cretinism , � Dobson says .
� Whether it was biological �a genetically restricted ability to process iodine �or pathological �a dietary deficiency �I can�t say .
� Neandertals lived in areas away from the coast that are iodine deficient even today .
If you and I took up residence in those same sites without a supplemental source of iodine , we�d suffer from iodine deficiency .
Our children would suffer even more , and our grandchildren would be physically deformed and mentally retarded , as many Alpine Europeans were in the late 1800s .
I suspect Neandertals were even more susceptible than we are .�
Some 30 percent of the world�s current population is at risk from iodine deficiency disorder , and 750 million suffer from goiter , which is caused by lack of iodine in the diet .
� I�ve concluded that a single factor , iodine , can account for most differences between modern humans and Neandertal , and the mechanism of change may have been a single genetic modification that improved the efficiency of modern thyroid glands to extract iodine , � he says .
So how did Dobson , a geographer who specializes in geographic information systems , get onto Neandertal�s case ?
� I started with geographic questions about sea - level rises associated with global warming .
Typical projections run from a few centimeters to a meter or more , but geologists have firmly established that sea level has risen 125 meters since the last ice age , � Dobson says .
� I asked myself :
If the ice age coast of 18,000 years ago is missing , what does that imply about the archaeological record ?
Is what archaeologists find on dry land today identical to what existed in coastal lowlands , now tens of meters beneath the sea ?
Is there , perhaps , some factor that would cause a systematic difference between coastal and interior populations ?
� It was my brother , Jeff , who suggested iodine as a distinguishing factor between coastal and inland populations .
Iodine comes almost entirely from three sources �saltwater fish , shellfish and seaweed �all coastal .
People who didn�t know to take iodine with them when they moved inland would suffer goiter and cretinism .
Jeff also learned that , even today , the most iodine - poor regions on earth are those that are mountainous or formerly glaciated .
That , in turn , led me to ask , � Neandertals lived in mountainous , glaciated Europe .
How did they get iodine ?�
I compared the bones of Neandertals to the bones of modern - day cretins and found they matched .
� Most investigation of the ice ages focuses on glaciers .
But what about tropical lowlands ?
During the ice ages , those would have been the most hospitable habitats on earth .
As the glaciers retreated , sea level rose , inundating those habitats and forcing people inland .
That would create tremendous population pressure and force coastal people to compete for resources .
Those who moved inland would have suffered a terrible fate without sufficient iodine .
Most Neandertal fossils correspond with periods when sea level was high , so they may have been refugees from that coastal competition . �
Much of the archaeological evidence of early humans probably lies undersea .
Even today , Dobson points out , most people live near the sea , which provides ample iodine in the diet .
If Neandertal did suffer an iodine deficiency , either through a dietary dearth or physiological inability to extract it , it would have spread through generations because iodine is very important to fetal development .
Babies , although apparently normal at birth , soon develop the large head and bones , curved spine , mental and physical retardation , achy joints and other infirmities we know as cretinism .
Cro-Magnon , living in those same sites , may have been equipped with a more efficient thyroid gland and undoubtedly obtained iodine from some additional source , perhaps by trading with the iodine - rich coast .
They were able to outcompete Neandertal and prosper , but they , too , suffered from cretinism .
Their sites contain carved squat � Venus� figurines that look precisely like mature women cretins .
They apparently worshiped that particular form , Dobson says , but it�s impossible to say whether they knew those figurines looked like Neandertals .
In his November 1998 column in GeoWorld magazine , Dobson called for better data on iodine�s global distribution that could be achieved by geographic information system techniques .
The iodine theory evolved out of an Laboratory Directed R&D - funded project to explore the coastal - change aspects of global warming since the ice ages .
The Geographical Review article has attracted a number of media requests .

House committee chair defends ' bloody hands ' protest at Rice hearing David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday March 12 , 2008

Print This Email This When Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testified before the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday , a contingent from the antiwar group Code Pink was in the back row , holding up bloody hands in protest .
Rep. Dave Weldon ( R - FL ) found the silent protest difficult to handle and asked the chair if it was possible to eject the protesters .
" I 've never seen anything like this before , " he complained .
" We 're trying to hold a hearing .
I find all these protesters in here really distracting .
Is there any kind of rule or policy ?
...
I 'm all for freedom of speech on the street , but we 're trying to listen to the Secretary of State here and people are holding up placards . "
Rep. Nita Lowey ( D - NY ) , who was chairing the hearing , replied , " Dr. Weldon , let me just say I appreciate your comments , but we 're here in the United States of America , and as long as they do n't disrupt this proceedings , and as long as they 're silent , they will be welcome . "
" It 's a very important hearing but I think it 's being turned into a circus , " Weldon insisted .
" I respect your views but as long as the protesters are quiet and they sit down and they do n't disrupt the hearings , everybody is welcome , " Lowey stated again .
After Rice completed her testimony and was leaving the hearing , the protesters began chanting , " The Blood Is on Your Hands " and " Get Us Out of Iraq ! "

The GNU Configure and Build System consists of autoconf , automake , and libtool .
I wrote an essay about them a long time ago .
Slightly more recently I was a co-author of a book about them .
David MacKenzie started writing autoconf way back in 1991 .
I was an early beta -tester and contributed some early features .
autoconf generates a configure script written in portable Bourne shell script language .
That makes sense .
autoconf at the time was essentially an M4 script .
That made sense at the time , but no longer does .
Today autoconf is essentially a perl script that invokes M4 .
That does n’t make sense today either .
automake is a completely separate program .
It essentially provides a simplified Makefile language .
David MacKenzie started writing it in 1994 as a portable shell script plus Makefile fragments .
In 1995 Tom Tromey rewrote it in perl .
I first used it in 1997 , and added support for conditionals .
automake works with autoconf .
automake translates a Makefile.am file written in the automake language into a Makefile .
in file written in the make language .
The configure script generated by autoconf then applies substitutions to generate a Makefile from Makefile.in .
libtool is essentially a complicated portable shell script which creates shared libraries .
It was written by Gordon Matzigkeit starting in 1996 .
libtool provides a standard set of commands for compiling and linking to create shared libraries , and for installing them .
It does this in a rather baroque manner in which what appears to be library is actually a shell script pointing to the real library , which libtools reads when doing a link to decide just what to do .
automake has support for using libtool .
This build system is used by many different tools , including pretty much all GNU tools .
However , it has a major problem : it is much too complicated .
It is written in portable shell , perl , and m4 .
It does not work in a intuitive or transparent manner .
autoconf input files mix shell and m4 code .
automake input files mix the automake and make languages .
libtool hides its files in a hidden directory named .lib .
The system does work fairly well .
But it is hard to understand and hard to debug .
And configure scripts generated by autoconf are slow .
In a distcc environment , it is not uncommon for it to take longer to run the configure script than it takes to build the program .
We have to get rid of these tools .
There have been many alternative build systems .
Not of them have caught on , at least not in the free software world , because they have to be installed before they can be used .
The great advantage of the GNU system is that it requires nothing more than portable shell and portable make .
However , we can do better today .
The GNU make program is very powerful , much more powerful than the original make program .
GNU make is installed on every popular development platform .
Let ’s take advantage of it by assuming that it is there .
The goal would be to have people write a single Makefile .
instead of configure .
in and Makefile.am or Makefile.in .
( We would probably keep a configure script for compatibility , and to record options like – target ) .
The Makefile would start with a standard include directive which provided all the default commands .
The rest would just be a standard GNU Makefile with some restrictions , like no %.o : %.c command , and with some standard variables to describe compilation options and the like .
The standard include would ensure that every compilation depended on config .h. config.h could be built by grepping the source code for HAVE_xxx strings and the like .
Each string would map to a test which would have an appropriate rule .
These rules could be run in parallel to generate tiny header files with the appropriate # define .
config.h would include all the tiny header files .
This would provide an interface similra to autoconf / automake , but simpler to use and faster to run .
Of course there would be many details to work out .
But I think an approach along these lines has real promise to get us out of the current quagmire .
The FBI on Friday revealed that human error led to surveillance of an entire email network back in 2006 , rather than the single email address approved by the secretive court which approves domestic wiretaps and other forms of e-surveillance .
Although the alleged mistake came to light in an Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) Freedom of Information Act ( FIA ) lawsuit , the internet service provider involved remains unpublished , due to the classified nature of the work involved .
Back doors were built into the nation 's telecommunications infrastructure back in the mid-nineties which allow for almost immediate real - time surveillance of phone conversations - cellular or otherwise - emails , and other forms of electronic communications that pass through the networks of the telecommunications industry .
The ISP involved allegedly misinterpreted a warrant for one email address to be a warrant for - ahem - the entire network .
This kind of mass negligence is really only the flip - side of a surveillance system that allows for almost immediate mass surveillance by the government and its cronies in the telecommunications industry .
This latest controversy comes as President Bush continues to demand that Congress provide retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies involved with illegal warrantless wiretapping of American citizens , and is sure to fan the flames of that ongoing debate .
The simplistic fear - mongering that has characterized the political animus of the present administration is even less persuasive when measured against this level of incompetence - after all , what good does Orwellian spying do if those involved are too incompetent to get it right anyway ?
One intelligence official shrugged it off .
" It 's inevitable that these things will happen .
It 's not weekly , but it 's common . "
This is the most egregious case yet revealed of what is known as " overproduction " - spook - speak for when a third party , for some reason , gives more information than requested .
At least they got a warrant for this kerfuffle .
The controversial warrantless wiretapping program , which has led to gridlock in Congress for the revised Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) - the administration has promised to veto it if retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies is not included , while simultaneously claiming that the act needs to be passed immediately in the interests of national security - has had its own suspect " glitches " .
No one really knows how many purely domestic communications were hoovered up by the National Security Agency under the warrantless wiretapping program , and we probably never will .
Cynics suspect retroactive immunity to be a preemptive strike , should other , more secret , surveillance programs see the light of day .
The FISA court issued a rare rebuke to the FBI last year for submitting false affidavits in support of its warrant applications , and other violations of note include dragging out surveillance long past what has been approved or seeking information beyond what had been authorized .
Inasmuch as the FISA court issues warrants retroactively - and , anyway , almost never denies an FBI surveillance request - one wonders how , or why , they continue to screw things up . ®
A 2×4 BIRDCAGE WITH BIRD
I struggled for over a week on what to build out of a 2×4 !
I searched online what other people have
done , and did n’t get any inspiration .
Then I was getting ready to fall asleep when it came to me .
I
got up and wrote it down so that I would n’t forget it in the morning .
This always seems like the time
I get my best ideas .
I have never seen anything like it before so I knew that it was probably unique .
I figured that to have any chance at all in this contest I would have to make something very different .
I needed a 2×4 with a 20 ” section of straight grain for the bars of the cage and I found the perfect
2×4 at the first place I looked .
A local lumber yard just 1 /2 mile from my house .
Here is the southern
yellow pine ( SYP ) 2×4 and only three knots which I could work around .
.
.
Here is the complete cutting plan .
You will probably have to click here to see the entire thing :
http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh224/grkemper/2x4/022x4Plan.jpg
.
.
The bars were the hardest and most boring part of this project .
Cutting a 20 inch long piece of 2×4
into 119 long square strips on the band saw did n’t take that long but pulling each one of the through
a series of progressively smaller holes did .
I learned this from my model boat making days .
I took a
two feeler gauges and drilled a series of holes each about .005 smaller than the last .
You start by
taking your square piece of wood and sharpen the end so that you can get it through the first
hole .
Then you use a pair of pliers to pull it through the hole .
This will shave a little of the wood
off .
Then on the the next smaller hole and so one until you get to 1/8 inch bars .
I am glad that I
started with about twice as many bars as I would use .
The growth rings in the SYP were not perfectly
straight and did n’t make the job easy .
I ended up with just 5 more of the 60 long bars I would need .
A lot broke and were messed up in too many ways to describe .
But I did salvage enough good sections of
the scraps do the top of the cage .
Here is a bar in process :
.
.
Here is a closeup showing the burr created when the hole is drilled .
That does all the cutting !
.
.
Here are some of the 12 segments that makeup the lower and upper ring :
.
.
Here you can see the band clamp holding the lower ring being glued .
.
.
I made a hardboard template to route the rings round .
I later drilled the 60 holes in the ring to
use for drilling the holes for the bars .
This allowed for both rings to have holes in exactly
the same place .
Here I routed the outside :
.
.
Here the inside :
.
.
And here the completed ring .
.
.
I tried to keep the bird theme in everthing .
Like the bird toes and claws on the bottom
of the stand , as well a the birds heads and wing feathers on the top of the cage .
The bird sitting on the perch inside the cage was my first ever attempt to do a 3D carving .
The hardest part of the entire thing was to drill the holes on the 6 pieces making up the top .
They had to be drilled at compound angles and figureing them out took some head scratchin’ .
They are held in place by the bars extending past the top ring and into a hole .
I made a dado around the inside of the bottom ring to install the floor flush .
Even has working door .
The project is about 29 ” tall .

A chess variant designed by Bobby Fischer , and an odd one at that .
Confronted by the possibility of computers overtaking human players and also confounded by a sharp decline in an interest in chess in the 1990's , Fischer came upon a way of enlivening the rules of the game so that interest would continue .
Basically , Fischerandom chess randomizes the placement of the home row of pieces on a game - by - game basis so that gameplay is as unique as possible .
There are other placement requirements - the bishops must start on opposite - colored squares , the king MUST be placed within the two rooks and castling is a tiny bit more complicated - but essentially the game plays like standard chess .
The advantages are two - fold : computerized opponents have a difficult time coping with opening strategies when the board 's initial position is the definition of uncertain ( there are over 900 different legal opening home row combinations ) , and human players are conversely invigorated by the abrupt change in strategy .
While not played on a tournament level , Fischer random chess remains an important part of the chess pedagogy as the definition of ' out - of - the - box ' thinking .

Climate activist stages protest on Arctic ice floe
Posted
Teenage activist and campaigner Mya - Rose Craig staged the most northerly strike at the edge of the Arctic sea ice to " try and make a statement about how temporary this amazing landscape is and how our leaders have to make a decision now in order to save it . "
TORONTO -- The Los Angeles Lakers bolstered their banged - up
frontline Friday with a key acquisition -- 7 - footer Pau Gasol of the
Memphis Grizzlies .
" It shows a great deal of commitment from the organization , "
All - Star Kobe Bryant said before the Lakers ' game at Toronto .
" It 's a great step .
" It 's a matter of us just gelling now and putting it
together , " added Bryant , who urged management to improve the team
over the summer .
" We 've got a great bench .
We have a lot of
length , a lot of versatility .
Now it 's time to walk the walk . "
The Lakers gave up Kwame Brown , rookie Javaris Crittenton and
two first - round draft picks for Gasol .
The Spaniard is certain to
help a Lakers team reeling from recent injuries to inside players ,
including blossoming center Andrew Bynum .
" We need a little scoring inside without Andrew Bynum , " coach
Phil Jackson said .
" It gives us a post - up threat right now , and
he 's a good passer .
We like that . "
Jackson said Gasol could make his debut when the Lakers visit
Washington on Sunday .
" We 'd like him to play on Sunday , " Jackson said .
" I do n't
know if that 's possible or not .
He 's got to go back to L.A. and
have a physical tomorrow . "
Gasol , averaging 18.9 points , 8.8 rebounds , 3.0 assists and 1.44
blocked shots in 39 games this season , can fill in at center until
Bynum returns in mid-March , then move to power forward .
" He 's a great player , " forward Lamar Odom said .
" With him and
Andrew down there , I 'm really excited to see how that works out .
We 'll protect the basket a little bit more .
I 'm looking forward to
seeing those guys playing together . "
The Grizzlies will get the Lakers ' first - round draft choices in
2008 and 2010 ; guard Aaron McKie , signed earlier Friday for salary
cap purposes ; cash considerations , and the rights to Gasol's
brother Marc , a 2007 second - round pick of Los Angeles .

After reading my previous post , you should have a pretty good understanding of what a BNF definition is all about .
Let ’s put this theory into practice , and write some basic parsers in Python , using Pyparsing !
Pyparsing allows a pretty one - to - one mapping of BNF to Python code : you can define sets and combinations , then parse any text fragment against it .
This is something very important to notice : one basic BNF definition can ( and should ) be reused : if you once wrote a BNF definition for an integer value , you can easily reuse this definition in , eg , a basic integer math expression .
The most basic element using Pyparsing is a Word .
In it ’s most basic form this is a set of characters which will match any arbitrary length string , as long as the characters in this string are part of the Word character set .
A little introduction example : let ’s write a parser which accepts words consisting of small - cap characters , or sentences which consist of words separated by spaces .
First we define a formal definition using BNF :
character ::= a | b | c | d | … | y | z
word ::= character | character word
sentence ::= word | sentence ” ” word
Let ’s port this formal definition to Python code .
First we need to do some imports , as in most Python programs .
I ’d encourage the reader to write this code in an interactive interpreter ( give iPython a try , it rocks ! ) and experiment a little with it ( tab - completion and ‘?’ rock ! ) :
from pyparsing import
Word from string import lowercase
Pyparsing includes several useful pre-defined lists of characters , including
alphas : a-zA - Z
nums : 0 - 9
alphanums : alphas + nums
These are normal Python strings .
In this sample we only want lowercase characters though , so we import this from the string module .
Now we can define one word : a word is a concatenation of lowercase characters .
word = Word( lowercase )
Let ’s play around with this :
print word.parseString ( ' hello ' ) # returns [ ' hello ' ] print word.parseString (' Hello ' ) # raises ParseException : Expected W :( abcd ... ) ( 0 ) , ( 1,1 ) print word.parseString ( ' hello world ' ) # returns [ ' hello ' ]

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iranian - backed militants were behind a bombing that killed 13 Iraqis at a Baghdad pet market , the U.S. military said on Saturday , raising concerns that Shi’ite militias might be switching tactics .
U.S. military spokesman Rear Admiral Gregory Smith said it appeared the Shi’ite militants wanted Friday ’s bombing , the deadliest attack in Baghdad in two months after a lull in violence , to look like the work of al Qaeda .
Most big bombings that cause mass casualties are blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda .
Shi’ite militias , many of which the military says are backed by Iran , are more commonly accused of sectarian killings and kidnappings rather than what the U.S. military calls “ spectacular ” , or large - scale , bomb attacks aimed at civilians .
Smith told a news conference that overnight raids by U.S. and Iraqi forces had captured four people who U.S. forces believed were responsible for the “ horrific act of indiscriminate violence ” at the pet market .
The bomb , placed inside a birdcage , was packed with ball - bearings to maximize casualties .
“ Based on subsequent confessions , forensics and other intelligence , the bombing was the work of an Iranian - backed ‘ special groups ’ cell operating here in Baghdad , ” Smith said .
Washington accuses Iran of funding , training and arming Shi’ite militias in Iraq .
The military has often displayed weapons , including rockets and roadside bombs , it says have been supplied by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards ’ elite Qods Force .
Tehran denies the charge and blames the violence in Iraq , in which tens of thousands of people have been killed , on the U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
“ I ’m not saying that yesterday Iran ordered the bombing of the pet market , ” Smith said .
“ What I ’m telling you is that the forces that are inside Iraq that have historically received training , funding , equipping and so forth by Iran is the group responsible for that attack . ”
“ TWISTED INTENT ”
U.S. officials in Iraq had appeared to soften their tone towards Tehran in recent weeks , noting several positive developments in Iran ’s involvement in Iraq , although the military says Iranian influence is still widespread .
Among those developments , U.S. officials have noted a ceasefire ordered in August by anti-American Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , the head of the Mehdi Army militia which is accused of links to Iran .

“ This bombing demonstrates that there are individuals who continue to ignore Moqtada al - Sadr ’s pledge of a ceasefire , ” Smith said .
In Sadr City , a sprawling Shi’ite slum and Mehdi Army stronghold in northeast Baghdad , thousands of Iraqis rallied on Saturday to pledge their support to the young cleric Sadr .
Many carried banners reading “ No , No America ... Yes , Yes Moqtada ” .
Smith said those behind the market attack intended to make it look like the work of al Qaeda in order to convince Iraqis in the area they needed the protection of Shi’ite militias .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ It was a very twisted intent ... but we accept that to be the motivation , ” he said .
Violence has fallen across Iraq in recent months , with attacks down by 55 percent since an extra 30,000 U.S. troops became fully deployed in mid-June , and something like normal life has been returning to Baghdad .
Baghdad officials reopened Abu Nawas street on Saturday , a famous thoroughfare along the Tigris River that was closed as residents retreated behind concrete blast walls at the height of the violence .
“ We will poke terrorism in the eye , ” said Lieutenant - General Abboud Qanbar , head of the Baghdad security plan .
In the northern city of Mosul , two suicide bomb attacks against an Iraqi police checkpoint on Friday killed 21 people , Smith said , including 10 civilians .
Police had previously said nine people were killed .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A strict curfew was extended indefinitely in the Iraqi capital Sunday as the death toll mounted from clashes between government troops and Shiite Muslim militants .
A member of the Mehdi Army carries his weapon in the streets of Basra , Iraq , on Saturday .
Fighting sparked by a government - led push against " outlaw " militias in the southern city of Basra had left more than 280 people dead by Saturday , according to Iraqi authorities .
The unrest has stretched across southern Iraq 's Shiite heartland up to Baghdad , where a ban on pedestrian and vehicle traffic was kept in place just hours before it was due to expire Sunday morning .
U.S. warplanes and British artillery struck targets in Basra on Saturday , a British spokesman said .
Another Basra airstrike killed 16 " criminal fighters , " and a joint U.S. - Iraqi patrol killed 13 more fighters in southeastern Baghdad 's Suwayrah district , U.S. commanders reported .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki compared the " outlaws " to al Qaeda and vowed not to leave Basra , where he is personally leading the operation , " until security is restored . "
" We will continue to stand up to these gangs in every inch of Iraq , " he said .
" It is unfortunate that we used to use say these very words about al Qaeda , when all the while , there were people among us who are worse than al Qaeda . "
Watch al - Maliki lash out »
Al - Maliki has given the militants until April 8 surrender their arms to a guns - for - cash program that was scheduled to end at midnight Friday .
Supporters of Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , whose Mehdi Army militia has borne the brunt of the fighting , say they have been unfairly singled out by the crackdown .
Al - Sadr has told followers not to surrender their weapons " except to a state that can throw out the occupation , " a top aide , Salah al - Obaidi , said Saturday .
The violence has sparked fears that a seven - month cease - fire by the Mehdi Army -- regarded as a key factor in a dramatic drop in attacks in recent months -- could collapse or that the U.S. military will have to bail out the Iraqis .
Al - Sadr 's political party holds 30 seats in Iraq 's parliament and once held seats in al - Maliki 's cabinet , quitting last year after the prime minister refused to set a deadline for U.S. and coalition troops to leave .
Basra , Iraq 's second - largest city and its chief oil port , has been plagued by turf wars among al - Sadr 's followers , the smaller Fadhila party and the country 's largest Shiite party , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , the major partner in al - Maliki 's ruling coalition .
The prime minister met Saturday in Basra with the area 's leaders , who have expressed support for the government 's efforts to " impose law and save Basra from criminal gangs , " according to a written statement from the prime minister 's office .
Security forces went to Basra to fight " murder and smuggling gangs and outlaws , " the prime minister said , and had n't intended to fight certain groups -- apparently referring to the Mehdi Army .
Al - Sadr 's militia launched two uprisings against U.S. troops in 2004 .
But in August , after a series of clashes between Mehdi Army fighters and security forces linked to the Islamic Supreme Council 's Badr Brigades , he ordered his militia to suspend operations .
In an interview that aired Saturday on the Arabic - language news network Al - Jazeera , recorded before the current fighting broke out , al - Sadr compared al - Maliki to executed former dictator Saddam Hussein .
" Under Saddam 's rule , we complained about how the government distanced itself from the people and operated under dictatorial terms .
Now , the government is also dealing with people on such terms , " al - Sadr said .
This week , President Bush called the current clashes a " defining moment " for Iraq and a key test for the country 's government .
But several U.S. officials said Friday that the Iraqi military push is not going as well as American officials had hoped .
A U.S. military intelligence analysis found that Iraqi security forces control less than a quarter of Basra , officials in both the United States and Iraq said .
" This is going to go on for a while , " one U.S. military official said .
American troops have been supporting Iraqi forces with intelligence , surveillance and occasional airstrikes and raids in Baghdad , according to the U.S. military .
U.S. trainers have also accompanied Iraqi units into combat , as in Saturday 's firefight in Suwayrah .
The U.S. military dropped two bombs Saturday afternoon at a suspected Shiite militia stronghold in the Basra area , said Maj .
Tom Holloway , a British military spokesman .
The strikes were followed by shelling from the British garrison at the city 's airport , aimed at mortar positions manned by militia fighters , he said .
Both attacks were in response to requests by Iraqi forces for air support , Holloway said .
He added that coalition forces were investigating reports of civilian casualties but had no details .
Meanwhile , at least 40 members of Iraq 's national police turned in their uniforms and joined forces with al - Sadr 's militia in Baghdad , al - Obaidi said .
They took their U.S. - supplied weapons with them , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .
Mortar and rocket attacks were directed Saturday at Baghdad 's fortified International Zone , also known as the Green Zone , where Iraqi government buildings and embassies are located .
No injuries were reported , a U.S. Embassy spokesman said .

Mar. 4th , 2008 08:10 pm Never Send a Symbol to do a Method 's Job Chris Shea is destroying Ruby .
( It 's okay though .
Everybody 's doing it . )
Chris just wrote a blog post called a better try -- chaining methods and nil .
I can't really get behind his solution , but he raises some very good points , and I think he 's asking the right questions .
Before I continue , I should point out that I do n't have a better solution , so I do n't mean to be dinging Chris .
I 'm mostly writing this to point out a new aspect of the problem space here .
The problem space , at least , is clear : writing @person && @person.
name is not DRY .
He dislikes Object #andand because it's too wordy ( and I admit , I 'm having trouble adopting it myself , even though I like it about the best of all the available options . )
Chris ' solution is to write a method called Object#try .
You give it the name of a method as a symbol .
If it works , it returns the result .
Otherwise it politely returns ( a non-whiny ) nil .
For example : @person.try ( : name ) returns the person 's name ... or nil .
You do n't have to guard the access to the person object .
Nice and DRY !
The problem is that it changes the syntax .
You 're no longer calling a method on the object , you 're calling try and sending it a symbol .
I look at that think , " why is person trying that symbol ? " .
Hmm .
But is n't that what we 're doing behind the scenes with Object #andand ?
So maybe Chris ' code is a bit more honest ?
No .
It 's just more explicit , and that 's not the same thing .
If sending a message is always more honest than calling a method , why call methods at all , ever ?
Because they express intent clearly .
I do n't like sending symbols when I could be calling methods if what I 'm supposed to be doing is calling methods .
While we 're at it , I do n't like Symbol # to_proc , either .
But now I 'm just being crotchety .
It seems like the real problem here is that whiny nil is just too darn whiny .
Would n't it make more sense to just make whiny nil shut up ?
The guys over at rubyenrails.nl had this idea a few days ago , too .
Unfortunately , I do n't like their solution any better .
Actually , at its heart , their solution is identical to turtles , a bit of code I wrote a month ago .
Only my version was way better :
It could be toggled , it installed cleanly , it had a full suite of RSpec specifications , and everybody knew it was a joke .
Who knows ?
Maybe my joke will turn out to be ... well ... practical .

The nil .
method_missing way was my first thought on encountering this , but it 's too wide - reaching .
What I actually want is for Ruby to know when I 'm expecting a particular class and getting nil instead .
Perhaps some kind of type annotation ?
That will have to happen deeper in the language , though .

so perhaps ensuring that it is initialized _correctly _
( that is not to nil ) is perhaps the issue rather than being constantly on guard .
a NilObject class is one approach .
It implements method_missing as desired .
e.g. it logs the caller and returns self
- eager init
@person = NilObject.new
lazy init
@person ||= NilObject.new
( person=NilObj ect.new )
NilObject can be implemented as a _singleton_
( just to be green ! )
This is an approach which has been used variously - Smalltalk was one context .
Saves messing with the base system .
Just another view .
Cheers !

I do n't know if this is " the issue " , but I certainly would see this as another approach to the solution .
We could instruct all developers to guard against this when they initialize their objects .
Or we could create an alternative initialization path that always returns a valid .
E.g. instead of using ActiveRecord 's find ( ) , which can return nil , you use some other factory method that is always guaranteed to return a valid Person object -- even if it's a dummy / placeholder object .
Like maybe ActiveRecord#find_or_fake ? :-)
That can cause implicit problems later , of course , when other developers assume that a valid Person object is the same thing as a real one from the database , and start doing bigger things with it ( beyond simply trying to print its name ) .
But that 's what communication is for , I guess -- some ratholes you mark off with caution tape and a sign that says " this is a rathole , do n't fall down it " .

It 's better to set this sort of thing as task specific - but the issue I can think of is that there 're often times where we want to have turtles all the way down for a single case , in multiple places .
Then it gets messy when we have with_turtles { some .job.here :abcdef , ...} all over the place , with all these blocks created for once - off usages here and there .

It 's not like I MEAN to destroy Ruby ( Link ) Part of the reason I wrote A better try ( http://ruby.tie-rack.org/53/a-better-try-chaining-methods-and-nil/) was because I thought Chris Wanstrath ’s implementation ( http://ozmm.org/posts/try.html) was a little deficient in its truthiness .
My REAL contention , though , is that I think the need for a try or an andand or turtles is much , much less than all the recent talk about it suggests .
I think as code matures , or requirements change , or you want to know more about where things are failing , the less often you 'll want to just be swallowing NoMethodErrors on nil .
I wrote about that here ( http://ruby.tie-rack.org/54/you-might-be-able-to-stop-trying-to-call-methods-on-nil/).
In the meantime , I 'll try to let Ruby heal some before I do more damage ;)

First off , mostly the comment about destroying Ruby was a nod of agreement that the whole " X is destroying Ruby " is a titch on the histrionic side .
I enjoyed your post and have started reading your blog , so I intended no disrespect .
I also agree with you on the need not matching the talk .

From : msmercenary Date : March 6th , 2008 12:13 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) > @person && @person.name is not DRY
Maybe I 'm just not pragmatic enough , and maybe I 'm just not in - tune enough with the Ruby Way of forcing developers out of their comfort zone and into radical new thought patterns , but I 'm really not seeing how , in this case , creating a brand - new idiom with which people are unfamiliar is in some way superior to this known idiom .
The point to DRY is to increase maintainability .
When you repeat knowledge , the likelihood of a change occurring in only one place but not the other increases .
This leads to bugs introduced during maintenance .
Hence DRY .
Now , I agree , that a violation of DRY such as " person && person.name " does have a nonzero maintenance hit , but practically speaking , that hit is very low .
If later , you need to include non-people , even the most boneheaded maintenance programmer will probably recognize that changing to " sapient && person.name " is most likely wrong .
What seems to be missing here is that when you introduce an entirely new idiom , you increase the chance that the next person to maintain your code will not understand the idiom , and will use it wrong .
I submit to you that the risk of introducing a bug by Making Up Clever Solutions To Nonexistent Problems is significantly higher than the risk of causing maintenance problems with " person && person.name "
As with all arguments , this could be extended a bit too far .
I do indeed think there is a maintenance nightmare present in using " person && person.
name && person.name.firstletter && person.name.firstletter.consonant && person.name.firstletter.consonant.font && person.name.firstletter.consonant.font.p itch & & person.name.firstletter.consonant.font.p itch.pixelcount " .
However , if you ever find yourself writing " person.name.firstletter.consonant.font.p itch.pixelcount " into your code , then I suggest you need to have a long talk with Demeter .

Actually , I think you 've identified the Fundamental Disconnect there .
What I 'm noticing more and more is that Ruby has a very low barrier to entry for new idioms .
If an existing , well - known idiom is painful , it gets reexamined and a different idiom gets tried .
It is expected of programmers to test like crazy and communicate like crazy , both of which reduce the pain of adopting new idioms .
This does not make new idioms free , but it does make entertaining a potential new idiom very cheap .
As a result , we 've already seen most of the new idioms for this problem get rejected , most on the basis of splash damage ( like turtles !
pithing your whole codebase ) , but a few have also been dismissed simply because the new idiom has been tasted and found to not improve the flavor appreciably .
( Like replacing a method call with a symbol send . )
I would agree that the Demeter - angering call chain is Of Teh Debbil , but I would further say that so is the " person && person .
name && ... " version .
If you 're doing that 20 - level indirect , even with guards , you are writing some pretty fragile code .
Then again , the last time I suggested that calls like this should be proxied , I got shouted down and told that Demeter was too old school to be useful to modern programmers .
So I dunno .
I 'm starting to think that you 're all bunch of knuckledragging bastards who feel that writing code should be considered harmful .

Please do n't ever do this in a production environment .
NilClass is a pretty fundmental class in Ruby -- it has its own keyword -- and altering its behavior globally to quietly eat all errors is just plain stupid .
If you 're experiencing a lot of NoMethodError exceptions on nil you need to figure out why your code is executing in an inconsistent environment .
Why can't you rely on @person existing , and why is your first instinct to just make it be quiet about this failed assumption ?

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
There was perhaps no better vantage point from which to chronicle the twilight months of the Bush administration and its national security policy than the Israeli resort town of Herzliya , where in January the Interdisciplinary Center , a private college and research institute , convened its annual international security confab .
The four - day conference , organized by Uzi Arad , a former national security advisor to onetime Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , brought together Israeli policymakers and thought leaders with their American and European counterparts .
Attending the event , dubbed “ Israel at Sixty : Tests of Endurance , ” were a host of prominent Washington hawks , among them , former United States ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton , neoconservative and former Rudy Giuliani advisor Norman “ World War IV ” Podhoretz , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s national security advisor Samantha Ravich , and former Middle East advisor David Wurmser .
Given the D.C. - centric crowd , it was at times easy to forget that the conference was taking place on the Mediterranean coast and not inside the Beltway .
While their numbers were strong , the hawks this year appeared less confident about their influence on Washington ’s foreign policy , and resentful of an American bureaucracy perceived by many attendees as having hijacked Iran policy from the weakening grasp of the White House .
“ It ’s close to zero percent chance that the Bush administration will authorize military action against Iran before leaving office , ” Bolton told the conference .
“ No one should be under any illusions about the United States ’ part in the Iranian situation in the coming year . ”
Podhoretz , for his part , agreed : “ Unless Bush realizes or fulfills my fading hope of air strikes , it is undoubtedly up to Israel to prevent ” Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons .
Bolton , like Podhoretz , urged Israeli policymakers to prepare to take matters into their own hands , saying “ Israel should be willing to see themselves as a possible last resort . ”
Though his call for Israel to prepare to strike Iran on its own–as well as his outspoken exasperation with the administration he until recently served–were met with chuckles from the Herzliya audience , the prospect of Israel ultimately choosing to act unilaterally came up again and again .
Speaking at the conference , Labour Party Knesset member Brig .
Gen. Efraim Sneh said , “ The military option is not preferable .
It has bad ramifications which are surpassed only by those of a nuclear Iran .
That is why sanctions are not for [ Israel ] to implement .
The leaders of the free world should do it . ”
But , he warned , “ We have to prepare for a situation , which has happened before , that the Jews are on their own .
And there are things we can do on our own if there is no other choice . ”
In the past , Middle East experts say , the Herzliya conference has been used as a high profile platform from which Israeli leaders have heralded major security policy shifts .
“ This is where [ former Israeli prime minister Ariel ] Sharon first floated the unilateral disengagement idea [ from Gaza ] , ” said Douglas Bloomfield , foreign policy analyst and syndicated columnist for Jewish newspapers .
“ It is where …[ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud ]
Olmert floated his realignment plan [ to get out of the West Bank ] before he was elected prime minister .
He used Herzliya to try out what became his platform under the Kadima party to leave 90 percent of the West Bank . ”
But this year ’s conference was–at first glance–absent such major policy announcements .
As Israeli prime minister Olmert , defense minister Ehud Barak , and foreign minister Tzipi Livni addressed the Herzliya audience at various points during the conference , hanging over their heads was the imminent release of the final Winograd Commission report determining political accountability for the outcome of the 2006 Israeli war with Hezbollah , a war that was widely considered a failure .
“ Everyone was so concerned with the Winograd report , ” said one American Herzliya attendee who closely follows Israel and who asked not to be named .
“ Olmert was on the defensive , so was Barak . ”
( The report , released last week , mostly exonerated Olmert , placing the blame largely on the Israeli Defense Forces . )
But other long - time conference observers did detect another sort of trial balloon being floated , particularly in the use of the phrase “ defensible borders , ” not by Israel ’s current top Israeli leadership , but its right - flank opposition .
“ ‘ Defensible borders ’ basically means Israel cannot get out of the West Bank , or from only very limited areas , ” says a long time conference attendee .
“ These guys [ who advocate so - called ‘ defensible borders ’ ] no longer believe in the two - state solution . ”
“ This year ’s conference was much more right wing than previous years , ” he noted .
“ And that is very , very strange to me .
Because I believe Israel is moving center . ”
One reason for the perceived rightward tilt : the conference ’s backers .
This year the conference was co-sponsored by the Jerusalem - based Shalem Center ’s Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies , which is funded by Las Vegas - based billionaire and Republican philanthropist Sheldon Adelson , among others .
Adelson is also a leading backer of Freedom ’s Watch , a well - funded Washington advocacy group that is pushing for the U.S. to maintain the troop surge in Iraq and take a hardline on Iran .
Among other American philanthropists in attendance : Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune heir Ronald Lauder , who is the benefactor for the Herzliya policy graduate school that bears his name at the IDC university ; Chicago philanthropist Lester Crown , a prominent supporter of Barack Obama ; and former president of the Israel lobby group AIPAC Bob Asher — the latter who received an award at the conference .
Among the conference speakers to advocate a more moderate Iran policy was Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East studies program at the Washington - based Center for Strategic and International Studies , who argued for a continuation of tough diplomacy along with economic sanctions .
“ When you ’re dealing with uncertainty , people often default to emotion , ” Alterman told me , reflecting on the hardline views expressed by Iran hawks like Podhoretz and Bolton at Herzliya .
Asked whether he noticed any softening of their positions in the waning months of the Bush presidency , he said , “ There were people who argue that they were right before , they are right now , and they will be proven right .
There ’s frustration with the realism of the last months of the Bush administration .
But from John Bolton and others , there was no crisis in confidence that they see the world in the proper way . ”

When all thoughts
Are exhausted
I slip into the woods
And gather
A pile of shepherd ’s purse .
Blending with the wind ,
Snow falls ;
Blending with the snow ,
The wind blows .
By the hearth
I stretch out my legs ,
Idling my time away
Confined in this hut .
Counting the days ,
I find that February , too ,
Has come and gone
Like a dream .
Like the little stream
Making its way
Through the mossy crevices
I , too , quietly
Turn clear and transparent .

The state of Nouveau , part I
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
Nouveau is an effort to create a complete open source driver for NVidia graphics cards for X.org .
It aims to support 2D and 3D acceleration from the early NV04 cards up to the latest G80 Cards and work across all supported architectures like x86 - 64 , PPC and x86 .
The project originated when Stéphane Marchesin set out to de-obfuscate parts of the NVidia - maintained nv driver .
However , NVidia had corporate policies in place about the nv driver , and had no plans to change them at the time .
So they refused Stéphane 's patches .
This left Stéphane with the greatest open source choice : " fork it " !
At FOSDEM in February 2006 , Stéphane unveiled his plans for an open source driver for NVidia hardware called Nouveau .
The name was suggested by his IRC client 's French autoreplace feature which suggested the word " nouveau " when he typed " nv " .
People liked it , so the name stuck .
The FOSDEM presentation got the project enough publicity to engage the curiosity of other developers .
Ben Skeggs was one of the first developers to sign up .
He had worked on reverse engineering the R300 ( one of ATI graphics chips ) shader components and writing parts of the R300 driver ; as a result , he had great experience with graphics drivers .
He initially showed interest in the NV40 shaders only , but he got caught in the event horizon and has worked on every aspect of the driver for NV40 and later cards .
The project engaged other developers with short and long term interest .
It also generated a large amount of interest due to a pledge drive that an independent user started .
However , the project was mainly developed on IRC and it was quite difficult for newcomers to get any insight into previous development ; reading IRC logs is unpractical at best .
With this in mind , KoalaBR decided to start summarizing development in a series of articles known as the TiNDC ( The irregular Nouveau Development Companion ) .
This series of articles proved very useful for attracting developers and testers to the project .
TiNDC issues are published every two to four weeks ; as of this writing , the current issue is TiNDC # 34 .
Linux.conf.au 2007 saw the first live demo of Nouveau .
Dave Airlie had signed up to give a talk on the subject ; he managed to persuade Ben Skeggs that showing a working glxgears demo would be a great finish to the talk .
Ben toiled furiously with the other developers to get the init code into shape for his laptop card and the presentation was a great success .
After missing a Google Summer of Code place , X.org granted Nouveau a Vacation of Code alternative .
This saw Arthur Huillet join the team to complete proper Xv support on Nouveau .
Arthur saw the light and continued with the project once the VoC ended .
In autumn 2007 Stuart Bennett and Maarten Maathuis vowed to get Nouveau 's RandR1.2 into a better shape .
Since then a steady stream of patches has advanced the code greatly .
The project now has 8 regular contributors ( Stéphane Marchesin , Ben Skeggs , Patrice Mandin , Arthur Huillet , Pekka Paalanen , Maarten Maathuis , Peter Winters , Jeremy Kolb , Stuart Bennett ) with many more part time contributors , testers , writers and translators .
NVidia card families
This article will use the NVidia GPU technical names as opposed to marketing names .
GPU name Product name(s ) NV04/05 Riva TNT , TNT2 NV1x GeForce 256 , GeForce 2 , GeForce 4 MX NV2x GeForce 3 , GeForce 4 Ti NV3x GeForce 5 NV4 x ( G7x ) GeForce 6 , GeForce 7 NV5 x ( G8 x ) GeForce 8
Where there are " N " and " G " naming the " N " variant ( NV4x , NV5x ) will be used .
Further information can be found on the Nouveau site .
Graphic Stack Overview
Before jumping into the Nouveau driver , this section provides a short background on the mess that is the Linux graphics stack .
This stack has a long history dating back to Unix X servers and the XFree86 project .
This history has lead to a situation quite unlike the driver situation for any other device on a Linux system .
The graphics drivers existed mainly in user space , provided by the XFree86 project , and little or no kernel interaction was required .
The user - space component known as the DDX ( Device - Dependant X ) was responsible for initializing the card , setting modes and providing acceleration for 2D operations .
The kernel also provided framebuffer drivers on certain systems to allow a usable console before X started .
The interaction between these drivers and the X.org drivers was very complex and often caused many problems regarding which driver " owned " the hardware .
The DRI project was started to add support for direct rendering of 3D applications on Linux .
This meant that an application could talk to the 3D hardware directly , bypassing the X server .
OpenGL was the standard 3D API , but it is a complex interface which is definitely too large to implement in - kernel .
GPUs also provided completely different low - level interfaces .
So , due to the complexity of the higher level interface and nonstandard nature of the hardware APIs , a kernel component ( DRM ) and a userspace driver ( DRI ) were required to securely expose the hardware interfaces and provide the OpenGL API .
Shortcomings of the current architecture have been noted over the past few years ; the current belief is that GPU initialization , memory management , and mode setting need to migrate to the kernel in order to provide better support for features such as suspend / resume , proper cohabitation of X and framebuffer driver , kernel error reporting , and future graphics card technologies .
The GPU memory manager implemented by Tungsten Graphics is known as TTM .
It was originally designed as a general VM memory manager but initially targeted at Intel hardware .
On top of this memory manager , a new modesetting architecture for the kernel is being implemented .
This is based on the RandR 1.2 work found in the X.org server .
GPU architecture
Graphics cards are programmed in numerous ways , but most initialization and mode setting is done via memory - mapped IO .
This is just a set of registers accessible to the CPU via its standard memory address space .
The registers in this address space are split up into ranges dealing with various features of the graphics card such as mode setup , output control , or clock configuration .
A longer explanation can be found on Wikipedia .
Most recent GPUs also provide some sort of command processing ability where tasks can be offloaded from the CPU to be executed on the GPU , reducing the amount of CPU time required to execute graphical operations .
This interface is commonly a FIFO implemented as a circular ring buffer into which commands are pushed by the CPU for processing by the GPU .
It is located somewhere in a shared memory area ( AGP memory , PCIGART , or video RAM ) .
The GPU will also have a set of state information that is used to process these commands , usually known as a context .
Most modern GPUs only contain a single command processing state machine .
However NVidia hardware has always contained multiple independent " channels " which consist of a private FIFO ( push buffer ) , a graphics context and a number of context objects .
The push buffer contains the commands to be processed by the card .
The graphics context stores application specific data such as matrices , texture unit configuration , blending setup , shader information etc .
Each channel has 8 subchannels to which graphics objects are bound in order to be addressed by FIFO commands .
Each NVidia card provides between 16 and 128 channels , depending on model ; these are assigned to different rendering - related tasks .
Each 3D client has an associated channel , while some are reserved for use in the kernel and the X server .
Channels are context - switched by software via an interrupt ( on older cards ) or automatically by the hardware on cards after the NV30 .
Now what to store within the FIFO ?
Each NVidia card offers a set of objects , each of which provide a set of methods related to a given task , e.g. DMA memory transfers or rendering .
Those methods are the ones used by the driver ( or on a higher level , the rendering application ) .
Whenever a client connects , it uses an ioctl ( ) to create the channel .
After that the client creates the objects it needs via an additional ioctl ( ) .
Currently we do have two types of possible clients : X ( via the DDX driver ) and OpenGL via DRI / MESA .
An accelerated framebuffer using the new mode setting architecture ( nouveaufb ) will also be a future client to avoid conflicts with nvidiafb .
Let 's have a look at a small number of objects :
object name Description Available on NV_IMAGE_BLIT
2D engine , blit image from one image into another one NV03 NV04 NV10 NV20 NV12_IMAGE_BLIT
An enhanced version of the above NV11 NV20 NV20 NV30 NV40 NV_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT
DMA memory transfer NV04 NV10 NV20 NV30 NV40 NV50
From this list , you can see that there are object types which are available on all cards ( NV_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT ) while others are only available on certain cards .
For example , each class of card has its own 3D - engine object , such as NV10TCL on NV1x and NV20TCL on NV2x .
An object is identified by a unique number : its " class " .
This id is 0x5f for NV_IMAGE_BLIT , 0x9f for NV12_IMAGE_BLIT and 0x39 for NV_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT .
If you want to use functionality provided by a given object , you must first bind this object to a subchannel .
The card provides a certain number of subchannels which correspond to a certain number of " active " ( or " bound " ) objects .
A command in the FIFO is made of a command header , followed by one or more parameters .
The command header usually contains the subchannel number , the method offset to be called , and the number of parameters ( a command header can also define a jump in the FIFO but this is outside the scope of this document ) .
Each method the object provides has an offset which has to be set in the command .
In order to limit the number of command headers to be written , thereby improving performance , NVidia cards will call several subsequent methods in a row if you provide several parameters .
How do we refer to an object ?
The data written to the FIFO does n't hold any info about that ...
Binding an object to a subchannel is done by writing the object ID as an argument to method number 0 .
For example : 00044000 5c00000 c binds object id 5c00000 c to subchannel 2 .
This object ID is used as a key in a hash table kept in the card 's memory which is filled up when creating objects .
The creation of an object relies on special memory areas .
RAMIN is " instance memory " , an area of memory through which the graphics engines of the card are configured .
A RAMIN area is present on all NVIDIA chipsets in some form , but it has evolved quite a bit as newer chipsets have been released .
Basically , RAMIN is what contains the objects .
An object is usually not big ( 128 bytes in general , up to a few kilobytes in case of DMA transfer objects ) .
Card - specific RAMIN areas Pre-NV40 Area of dedicated internal memory accessible through the card 's MMIO registers .
NV4x A 16MiB PCI resource is used to access PRAMIN .
This resource maps over the last 16 MiB of VRAM .
The first 1MiB of PRAMIN is also accessible through the ( now " legacy " ) MMIO PRAMIN aperture .
NV5x A 32MiB PCI resource , which is unusable in the default power - on state of the card .
It can be configured in a variety of different ways through the NV5x virtual memory .
The legacy MMIO aperture can be re-mapped over any 1MiB of VRAM that 's desired .
There are also a few specific areas in RAMIN that are worth mentioning :
RAMFC , the FIFO Context Table .
It is a global table that stores the configuration / state of the FIFO engine for each channel .
It does n't exist in the same way on NV5x , where the FIFO has registers that contain pointers to each channel 's PFIFO state , rather than a single global table .
RAMHT , the FIFO hash table .
A global table , used by PFIFO to locate context objects , except on NV5x , where each channel has its own hash table .

A US district court judge is expected to rule this week on whether the drug company can force the NEJM to release the information , which some scientists claim would damage the confidential peer - review system that science uses to evaluate the merits of prepublication research .
Pfizer , which is based in New York , is being sued for damages allegedly caused by the drugs Celebrex and Bextra .
Both pain killers belong to the same class of Cox - 2 inhibitors as Vioxx , which was withdrawn in September 2004 because of fears that it had caused thousands of heart attacks and strokes .
Although Bextra has been withdrawn , Celebrex is still on sale .
As part of its defence , Pfizer is seeking any additional information that may support its case .
" Scientific journals such as NEJM may have received manuscripts that contain exonerating data for Celebrex and Bextra which would be relevant for Pfizer 's causation defence , " the company says in its motion .
But Donald Kennedy , the editor of the journal Science , said that this amounts to a fishing expedition .
" If this motion succeeds , what journal will not then become an attractive target for a similar assault ? " he wrote in a signed editorial .
At stake is the public 's interest in a fair system of evaluating and publishing scientific work .
The motion filed by Pfizer claims that the public has no interest in protecting the editorial process of a scientific journal .
USDA nonsense and the betrayal of the public
America faces the facts on animal cruelty and the criminal beef industry
( Natural News )
Following the unprecedented recall of 143 million pounds of beef that was potentially contaminated with mad cow disease , the USDA has decided that it 's okay for children and consumer to eat that beef as long as it is comingled with beef from other cows .
This startling decision appeared in a USDA memo reported in the , which stated : This statement from the USDA reveals that This is a curious -- if not downright laughable -- stance to take on public safety .
If the meat is potentially contaminated with mad cow disease ( which is the whole reason why it was recalled in the first place ) , then mixing mad cow disease - contaminated meat with non-contaminated meat does not reduce the potential danger of the " commingled " meat in any way whatsoever .

How does adding another cow 's meat to the downer cow 's meat make the downer cow 's meat any safer ?
It does n't , of course , but the USDA is n't really interested in consumer safety .
That 's why they 've issued this statement that means a meat packing company can use 99 % of its beef from mad cow disease " downer " cows , and 1 % of its beef from healthy cows , and it's all declared " safe " by the USDA with no need to recall the beef !
Now you can see why I consider the USDA to be such a joke .
Much like the FDA , the USDA is primarily focused on protecting the profits of the industry it claims to regulate .
What 's important to the USDA is , not protecting the public , and that 's exactly why you also see these intentional delays in the USDA issuing beef recalls .
These delays are specifically designedby making sure most of the meat is already eaten by consumers before the recall is issued .
It 's yet another campaign of extreme incompetence -- or perhaps fraud -- by the USDA , an organization that believes too much in promoting milk and beef products that it has insisted for decades that all Americans eat more beef and drink more milk .
That 's the whole point behind the USDA 's laughable food guide pyramid -- a marketing document designed to fatten up the population by telling consumers to eat and drink more animal products , regardless of the health consequences .

Better yet , download my free Honest Food Guide ( www.HonestFoodGuide.org ) - a replacement for the USDA 's ridiculous food guide pyramid .
The Honest Food Guide has been downloaded over one million times , and it tells the truth about foods that enhance health vs. foods that destroy health .
Beef , milk and other animal products are in the " destroys health " category , and that 's even when they are n't contaminated !
What 's especially notable in all this talk about beef slaughterhouses ( which was only made possible by the Humane Society 's secret video , by the way ) is that for the first time , For as long as I can remember , Americans have simply pretented to not know where their meat really came from .
They would buy and eat meat products under the hallucination that somehow all this meat was extracted from cows without any sort of harm or pain .
They were kidding themselves , of course , but through clever beef marketing and slaughterhouse secrecy , the industry was able to hide the truth about its criminal activities for many decades .
But now , all of a sudden the discussion about cruelty to cows and slaughterhouse practices is front page news .
All of a sudden Americans are being forced to look in the mirror and realize what kind of industry they 're supporting .
Of course , many consumers just blame the slaughterhouse .
" It 's THEIR fault ! " they say , as if their own purchasing of that very same beef had nothing to do with it .
The disconnect works like this : " The slaughtering of cows is BAD , and it 's THEIR fault , but the eating of the beef we buy is just fine , no problem ! "
In this way , consumers fail to connect their own purchasing demand with the cruel treatment of cows in factory farms and slaughterhouses across America and around the world .
When it comes to food , They 'd rather not think about or talk about it .
They hold their noses when they swallow , and they talk about comedy TV , or politics or sports ... anything to take their minds off the truth hidden in the steak they 're swallowing for dinner .
Nobody dares acknowledge the truth about what they 're eating :
Angry flesh torn from the bodies of screaming , suffering cows who are exploited and killed by profit - hungry slaughterhouse owners who care nothing about other living creatures .
The beef industry exemplifies everything that 's wrong with America today : Extreme greed , the exploitation of living beings for profit , a shocking lack of compassion , non -stop pollution , environmental destruction and the complete disregard of consumer safety .
See the exclusive video clip on Factory Farms and Slaughterhouse Cruelty at https://www.naturalnews.com/022702.html .
You are directly supporting the destruction of the environment and the torture and killing of cows .
If you eat meat from factory - farmed cows , you are willfully participating in a system of extreme evil that operates without ethics and without any concern for living creatures or the natural environment .
All meat is taken from the carcass of an animal that once breathed , lived , observed and experienced .
When you consider your dietary choices , think carefully about what practices you wish to promote and what businesses you wish to see succeed .
The best way to end cruelty to cows is to .
Eat no more red meat .
That includes meat from cows and pigs .
If you must eat animal meat , consider switching to chickens and fish .
There is still cruelty in those industries , no doubt , but the experiences of fish are much lower in intelligence than those of a cow , which is an intelligent mammal .
Better yet , eat quinoa , which is a complete protein containing all eight essential amino acids .
Or supplement your protein from free - range eggs , spirulina or broccoli juice .
You can get all the protein you need from plants by juicing them and drinking the juice .
( Cooking destroys about half the protein content of plants , so eat them raw to get your protein . )
There is absolutely no requirement for meat in the human diet .
Consumers only eat meat because they were trained to do so by their parents .
In the long run , that practice is entirely unsustainable , and the future of humanity depends on switching to a primarily plant - based diet .
Remember : It 's as simple as this : Be part of the solution .
End cruelty to cows .
Stop eating red meat ( and save yourself from mad cow disease at the same time ) .
Jerome Kerviel
At nearly €5bn , the fraud uncovered at Société Générale dwarfs any previous example of a single trader running up massive losses .
Kerviel was sentenced to five years in prison in October 2010 , but his sentence was suspended .
The former trader claims that his bosses at the French bank knew of his trading activities .
Barings Bank - £ 827 m
The most famous ' rogue trader ' in history , Nick Leeson brought down one of the grandest names in British banking .
Working in Barings ' Singapore office , Leeson initially made large profits for the bank by dealing in derivatives and futures .
But after running up losses , he hid his bad trades in a single account in 1992 .
These losses grew over several years , forcing him into a series of increasingly desperate but unsuccessful attempts to make the money back .
Leeson finally fled in February 1995 after a bet that the Tokyo stock market would rise went badly wrong .
Once the full scale of the losses became apparent , Barings was sold to Dutch banking giant ING for just £ 1 .
In the aftermath , Leeson 's managers were criticised for giving him too much leeway .
Crucially , he had been allowed to settle his own trades , letting him disguise his actions .
In December 1995 Leeson was sentenced to six years imprisonment in Singapore , and was released in 1999 .
He is now the commercial director of Galway United .
Allied Irish Bank – £ 697 m
Friends and colleagues saw John Rusnak as a typical ' Mr Middle America ' , but the Baltimore - based trader was jailed after hiding trading losses of almost $ 700 m ( £ 355 m ) .
He was hired by Allfirst Financial , a division of Allied Irish Bank , in the mid-90s as a dealer on the foreign exchanges .
Betting mainly on the Japanese yen , Rusnak used fictitious options contracts to hide his losses over several years .
Some outsiders suspected that all was not well , with Goldman Sachs reportedly refusing to do business with Rusnak .
But it took until 2002 before routine checks finally uncovered the true nature of the bank 's exposure .
By that stage , rather than sticking to his trading limit of $ 2.5 m , Rusnak had secretly bet $ 7.5 bn of AIB 's money on the yen rising against the dollar .
At his subsequent trial , prosecutors said he had created a false identity under the name David Russell and used an address in New York to send confirmations of false trades .
Rusnak was jailed for seven - and - a- half years in a plea bargaining deal .
Daiwa Bank - $ 1.1bn
The president of Japan 's Daiwa Bank received a particularly nasty shock on July 13 1995 .
Toshihide Iguchi , one of its senior US executives , confessed in a 30 - page letter that he had lost $ 1.1 bn through unauthorised bond trading .
Like Leeson and Rusnak , Iguchi ran up the losses over several years .
Having risen from the back offices to become a trader in 1984 , a lack of segregation within his division meant he could hide his losses from his superiors while he tried , and failed , to trade back to profit .
Following his confession , it emerged that he had conducted the cover - up for over a decade , falsifying some 30,000 trading slips .
Having once been seen as the golden boy of the department , in 1996 he was jailed for four years and fined $ 2.6 m .
In court , he told the judge that his life was filled with guilt , fear and deception after 11 years trying to recover his losses .
Interviewed in jail , Iguchi said he had seen his earlier actions as merely a violation of internal rules .
" I think all traders have a tendency to fall into the same trap .
You always have a way of recovering the loss " , he told Time magazine .
Daiwa was also penalised heavily .
The Federal Reserve ordered it to end all of its operations in America , leading to a sale of most of its US assets in January 2006 .
Sumitomo Corporation - $ 2.6bn
Yasuo Hamanaka was jailed for eight years for fraud and forgery in 1997 after the one - time king of the copper market was found to have conducted rogue trading and fraud for more than a decade .
At the height of his power , Hamanaka was said to control 5 % of the global copper market .
His off - the - book trades forced prices up and generated large profits for years , but ultimately cost Sumitomo $ 2.6bn when the scandal was uncovered .
A year after his conviction , Sumitomo paid about $ 150 m to settle claims from British and US regulators , though it did not admit or deny allegations that it knew that Hamanaka was using bogus trades to drive the copper price higher for several years .
In 1999 , Merrill Lynch was fined a total of £ 16 m for helping to finance a copper trading scandal .
The London Metal Exchange said it had provided the finance to clients to undertake actions that it should have known was the basis of an attempt to manipulate the market
Other huge trading losses :
Although actual convictions for fraud are rare , many other traders have run up huge losses simply through a bad call on the markets .
These include Brian Hunter , an energy trader at hedge fund Amaranth .
He had made large profits by speculating on natural gas prices , but ended up losing $ 6.6 bn in 2006 after betting that the price of gas would rise .
Unfortunately for him ( but not for traders who took the opposite view ) , they plunged after a heatwave helped to slash the price of gas future contracts .
In 2003
a jury ruled that Peter Young , the former Morgan Grenfell fund manager , had orchestrated a complex fraud to try and steal more than £ 350,000 .
Morgan did not face trial , after being diagnosed with an acute schizophrenic condition and repeatedly attempting self - castration .
The Serious Fraud Office alleged that Young had conducted a wider fraud that had cost Deutsche Bank , which owned Morgan Grenfell , about £ 300m .

Four Opponent Powers Practice of Purifying Negative Actions
To purify our negative karma we must practice the four opponent powers : the power of regret , the power of reliance , the power of remedy , and the power of resolve .
Within these four , one begins by reflecting on regret ; the awareness that actions we have committed bring suffering to ourselves and others .
We further identify the reliance ( or refuge ) of one such as the Buddha , who inspires us with his example ; with the power of remedy we ...

Bay Area rents jump , especially in S.F. and San Jose With foreclosures and weak home sales , average Bay Area tenant shelling out 9 % more
Bay Area Rental Market .
Chronicle graphic by John Blanchard Bay Area Rental Market .
Chronicle graphic by John Blanchard Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Bay Area rents jump , especially in S.F. and San Jose 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Even as Bay Area home values weaken , a new report shows rents are soaring - indicative of the curious mix of a sturdy economy and a faltering housing market .
Average monthly rents in the region 's financial and high - tech hubs have jumped more than 10 percent in the last year , and occupancy rates hover around 95 percent , according to a quarterly rental survey by RealFacts .
While robust hiring is boosting apartment prices , the purchase side of the market languishes amid the subprime crisis and a supply of homes for sale that far outstrips demand .
" We have very strong employment , and typically it increases demands for rentals and raises home prices , " said Michael Carney , director of the Real Estate Research Council of Northern California .
" But because we 've had these problems with the mortgage market , the shift is toward rentals . "
The average rent for an apartment in San Francisco stood at $ 2,243 in the third quarter , up nearly 12 percent from one year ago ; in San Jose , the average rent also jumped 12 percent to $ 1,622 , said RealFacts of Novato , which tracks rents in mostly large buildings across the nation .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Across the nine counties , the average rent in the third quarter was $ 1,539 , up 9 percent from $ 1,411 twelve months ago .
In part , property owners say they see an influx of new hires from outside the region .
In renting out 15 apartments in San Francisco in recent weeks , Raymond Scarabosio has not signed one agreement with a person who had a Bay Area cell phone number .
Through Jackson Group Property Management , Scarabosio manages about 500 apartments in 90 buildings across the city .
Also , tighter lending standards pushed more would - be buyers out of the market , while others are waiting to see if prices slide .
" The fringe players have become renters again , and people who owned homes that are now in foreclosures are now renters again , too , " Scarabosio said .
That 's not likely to change in the near term , as many economists like Carney say it could be years before home values stabilize .
If the economy can weather the housing downturn and Bay Area firms continue hiring , that could add more pressure to the rental market .
" Once home prices start to fall , they 're going to fall for a while ... because people are waiting around trying to time it for the bottom , " Carney said .
" Assuming the economy stays the way it is , the demand for rentals will remain quite high . "
Jamie Fougner , a commercial mortgage broker in San Francisco , is feeling the squeeze .
For a few months , he 's been staying with a friend in the West Portal neighborhood .
But with his girlfriend scheduled to move here from Minneapolis next month , he 's desperately trying to find an affordable place that will accommodate the couple and their 10 - year - old Australian cattle dog .
A few years ago , after the dot - com implosion , landlords welcomed pets if it meant filling a vacant apartment .
But Fougner , in his mid-30s , said online apartment searches turn up few that allow pets .
Even then , he said , prices are usually at the very high end of his range - around $ 2,500 .
Meanwhile , he has stopped going to open houses ; even when Fougner would show up 15 minutes early , he found five or six people waiting .
" We might just end up getting a spot for $ 2,400 or $ 2,500 ( a month ) , which will just make me sick every month writing that check , " Fougner said .
" But if it 's not a dump and has a patio , then we 'll want to stay home more anyway . "
At the end of the Arc tutorial I included a couple web app hello - worlds .

Here 's what it has to do .
First generate a page with an input field and a submit button .
If the user clicks on submit , he gets a second page with a link saying " click here . "
If he clicks on that , he gets a third page saying " you said : ... " where ... was whatever he put in the input field .
This has to happen without the value being passed in the url ; it should not be possible to change the behavior of the third page by editing the url in the second .

( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain cemented his front - runner status Tuesday , piling up big wins coast - to - coast , according to CNN projections .
Democratic voters remain evenly split over which of their candidates they would rather see get the nomination .
Sen . Barack Obama won more states Tuesday , but Sen. Hillary Clinton won states with higher delegate counts .
McCain capped the night by taking California and its 170 delegates .
After having been nearly written off last summer , the Arizona senator finally felt comfortable enough to call himself the front - runner .
" Tonight I think we must get used to the idea that we are the Republican Party front - runner for the nomination of president of the United States .
And I do n't really mind it one bit , " he said as results came in Tuesday .
Watch McCain claim front - runner status »
On the Democratic side , Clinton took California , according to CNN projections .
While most Republican contests are winner - take - all , most Democratic contests are awarded proportionally based on the number of congressional districts won .
Clinton took the larger share of California 's 370 Democratic delegates .
More about delegates
" We know what we need is someone ready on day one to solve our problems and seize those opportunities , " Clinton said Tuesday .
" Because when the bright lights are off and the cameras are gone , who can you count on to listen to you , to stand up for you , to deliver solutions for you ? "
Watch Clinton speak to her supporters »
McCain also won Connecticut , Illinois , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , Oklahoma , Delaware and Arizona , his home state , according to CNN projections .
Full February 5 results
McCain has gathered 514 delegates so far in his presidential campaign , including Tuesday night 's projections .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has 177 delegates , and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has 122 .
What do the results mean ? »
In Georgia , Huckabee edged out McCain , who held a slim margin over Romney .
Romney got wins in Alaska , Colorado , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Montana and Utah .

" One thing that 's clear -- this campaign 's going on , " Romney said .
" I think there 's some people who thought that it was all going to be done tonight , but it 's not all done tonight .
We 're going to keep on battling . "
Watch Romney vow to fight »
In addition to Georgia , Huckabee picked up Alabama , Arkansas , Tennessee and West Virginia .
Watch what Huckabee says about Tuesday 's results »
Going into Super Tuesday , the Republican race had largely been viewed as a fight between McCain and Romney .
" Over the past few days , a lot of people have been trying to say that this is a two - man race .
Well , you know what ?
It is , and we 're in it , " Huckabee said as the results came in .
In all , 1,020 Republican delegates were up for grabs Tuesday .
To clinch the nomination , a candidate must win 1,191 delegates .
Tuesday 's contests did not produce a front - runner on the Democratic side .
" Our time has come , our movement is real and change is coming to America , " Obama said Tuesday .
" We are more than a collection of red states and blue states .
We are and always will be the United States of America . "
Watch Obama rally his supporters »
The biggest prizes that Obama won were his home state of Illinois and Georgia , and a larger share of the 288 delegates in those states .
Obama also won Alabama , Alaska , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Idaho , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , North Dakota and Utah .
Between those states , he would be awarded the larger share of 278 delegates .
Watch what the early results mean »
Clinton was also projected to win her home state of New York , New Jersey and Massachusetts , and the larger share of the 329 delegates at stake in those states .
Clinton also won Arizona , Arkansas , Oklahoma and Tennessee , and the larger share of the 235 delegates in those states .
Republican conservative voters appear to be evenly split between Romney and Huckabee , according to preliminary exit polls of Super Tuesday voters .
Of those who voted for Huckabee or Romney , about 80 percent identified themselves as conservative , according to the polls .
Watch why voters picked their candidates »
Only 49 percent of McCain 's voters said they were conservative , a sign that the Arizona senator 's efforts during the past week to placate conservative voters have not paid off .
On the Democratic side , those who made up their mind in the past three days appear to be torn between Obama and Clinton .
According to the exit polls , Obama and Clinton are essentially splitting those voters , with 47 percent going for Obama and 46 percent for Clinton .
Watch how CNN analysts view the GOP race »
On the Republican side , front - runners McCain and Romney have engaged in bitter exchanges over their conservative records in recent weeks .

This list is a work in progress .
I welcome suggestions .
Anyone who has more items to add to the list , post them in the comments .
The intent of the list is to illustrate the futility of the multicultural approach to Islam .
Sharia law demands submission not only from Muslims , but from non-Muslims as well .
This makes respectful coexistence nearly impossible with Muslims in Infidel lands .
The examples below serve as reminder that submitting to one complaint or another only emboldens Muslims to seek to further their ultimate goal of establishing sharia .
The West needs to come to grips with this fact and start standing up for our God - given rights of free speech , free expression and freedom of religion , lest we surrender those rights to a theocratic movement bent on removing our Constitutional freedoms that we hold dear .
In this case , our tolerance will lead to intolerance .

The Rainwater Prophecy
Richard Rainwater made billions by knowing how to PROFIT FROM A CRISIS .
Now he foresees the biggest one yet .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) – Richard Rainwater does n't want to sound like a kook .
But he 's about as worried as a happily married guy with more than $ 2 billion and a home in Pebble Beach can get .
Americans are " in the kind of trouble people should n't find themselves in , " he says .
He 's just wary about being the one to sound the alarm .
Rainwater is something of a behind - the - scenes type -- at least as far as alpha - male billionaires go .
He counts President Bush as a personal friend but dislikes politics , and frankly , when he gets worked up , he says some pretty far - out things that could easily be taken out of context .
Such as :
An economic tsunami is about to hit the global economy as the world runs out of oil .
Or a coalition of communist and Islamic states may decide to stop selling their precious crude to Americans any day now .
Or food shortages may soon hit the U.S.
Or he read on a blog last night that there 's this one gargantuan chunk of ice sitting on a precipice in Antarctica that , if it falls off , will raise sea levels worldwide by two feet -- and it 's getting closer to the edge ....
And then he 'll interrupt himself : " Look , I 'm not predicting anything , " he 'll say .
" That 's when you get a little kooky - sounding . "
Rainwater is no crackpot .
But you do n't get to be a multibillionaire investor -- one who 's more than doubled his net worth in a decade -- through incremental gains on little stock trades .
You have to push way past conventional thinking , test the boundaries of chaos , see events in a bigger context .
You have to look at all the scenarios , from " A to friggin ' Z , " as he says , and not be afraid to focus on Z .
Only when you 've vacuumed up as much information as possible and you know the world is at a major inflection point do you put a hell of a lot of money behind your conviction .
Such insights have allowed Rainwater to turn moments of cataclysm into gigantic paydays before .
In the mid-1990s he saw panic selling in Houston real estate and bought some 15 million square feet ; now the properties are selling for three times his purchase price .
In the late '90s , when oil seemed plentiful and its price had fallen to the low teens , he bet hundreds of millions -- by investing in oil stocks and futures -- that it would rise .
A billion dollars later , that move is still paying off .
" Most people invest and then sit around worrying what the next blowup will be , " he says .
" I do the opposite .
I wait for the blowup , then invest . "
The next blowup , however , looms so large that it scares and confuses him .
For the past few months he 's been holed up in hard - core research mode -- reading books , academic studies , and , yes , blogs .
Every morning he rises before dawn at one of his houses in Texas or South Carolina or California ( he actually owns a piece of Pebble Beach Resorts ) and spends four or five hours reading sites like LifeAftertheOilCrash .net or DieOff.org , obsessively following links and sifting through data .
How worried is he ?
He has some $ 500 million of his $ 2.5 billion fortune in cash , more than ever before .
" I 'm long oil and I 'm liquid , " he says .
" I 've put myself in a position that if the end of the world came tomorrow I 'd kind of be prepared . "
He 's also ready to move fast if he spots an opening .
His instincts tell him that another enormous moneymaking opportunity is about to present itself , what he calls a " slow pitch down the middle . "
But , at 61 , wealthier and happier than ever before , Rainwater finds himself reacting differently this time .
He 's focused more on staying rich than on getting richer .
But there 's something else too : a sort of billionaire - style civic duty he feels to get a conversation started .
Why could n't energy prices skyrocket , with grave repercussions , not just economic but political ?
As industry analysts debate whether the world 's oil production is destined to decline , the prospect makes him itchy .
" This is a nonrecurring event , " he says .
" The 100 - year flood in Houston real estate was one , the ability to buy oil and gas really cheap was another , and now there 's the opportunity to do something based on a shortage of natural resources .
Can you make money ?
Well , yeah .
One way is to just stay long domestic oil .
But there may be something more important than making money .
This is the first scenario I 've seen where I question the survivability of mankind .
I do n't want the world to wake up one day and say , ' How come some doofus billionaire in Texas made all this money by being aware of this , and why did n't someone tell us ? ' "

It feels like the last place you 'd go looking for a rich man .
Lake City , S.C. , is a town of 6,500 in the low country two hours northwest of Charleston .
Once the bustling home to small , independent tobacco farmers , now it 's mostly a collection of abandoned gas stations , roadside churches , and fading brick walls with TRUST JESUS painted on them in big black letters .
Unemployment hovers around 10 % and would be worse if the Taiwanese plastics manufacturer Nan Ya had n't opened up a sprawling factory on the edge of town .
Rainwater spends a lot of time in Lake City because of his wife , Darla Moore .
A former star in bankruptcy financing at Chemical Bank who was once dubbed the " toughest babe in business " by FORTUNE , Moore , 51 , grew up here .
Her grandfather was one of the small tobacco farmers .
Nowadays she lives on her grandparents ' old farm .
( Moore and Rainwater also own a lavish home in Charleston . )
Rainwater calls Lake City the " middle of bum - fuck nowhere . "
But the truth is he 's got everything he needs here : cable TV , a telephone , an automatic coffeemaker , a decent golf course up the road , and a fast Internet connection .
Measured against the languid pace of the surroundings , Rainwater 's usual surplus of physical energy seems even more pronounced in Lake City .
Tall , tan , and sturdily built , he has a hard time sitting still .
He 's run four marathons and offers that , when he was 40 , he unexpectedly set the record in his age group on something called a " modified Balke protocol " treadmill test , a measure of the body 's efficiency in absorbing oxygen .
Rainwater bounces around the farm in shorts , a polo shirt , and a baseball cap , maintaining a running dialogue with Moore ( whom he calls " Precious " ) , his staff , and anyone else who happens to be within earshot or on his speed dial .
" He 's maternal , " says Moore .
" And I 'm paternal . "
In the ongoing Richard and Darla show , Moore supplies the dry one - liners to his constant chatter .
Lately she 's been affectionately calling him " Dr. Doom . "
But she 's not dismissing his concerns .
Or harboring any illusions that she can talk him out of making a big investment once he settles on a theme .
As president of Rainwater Inc. in the '90s , she was his partner in his last two big bets .
And though she 's at a stage in life where she might prefer to simplify her affairs rather than go off on another wild ride , she knows that soon he 'll have to act .
" We 've been married for 15 years , " she says .
" This is the third time I 've seen this .
The massive intake of information has been complete .
Now he 's agonizing .
We 're in what I refer to as the raving mode -- the latter stages of rave .
This is the refinement stage .
Then we 're going to make decisions . "
" It 's not raving , " he says .
" I promise I am not a kook . "
" You 're kooking out a little .
But I 've seen the process before .
I saw you go from zero to 100 miles per hour in real estate . "
" And you saw me get into oil ten years ago , " he says , then protests , " But I 'm on the edge of being so old that it does n't matter anymore .
I 've won the heavyweight championship before .
Instead of taking one more swing , maybe I should just retire a winner . "
Moore 's not buying it .
" Buckwheat , " she says , using her nickname for him , " There 's not a chance in a million you wo n't swing .
He can't not .
It 's the nature of the animal . "

" Rainwater , " the voice on the phone announces .
" Now , type L - A - T - O - C into Yahoo , and scroll down to the seventh item . "
Rainwater does n't use e-mail .
Rather , he uses rapid - fire phone calls to spread the gospel he discovers every morning on the web .
One day it might be the decline of arable land in Malaysia .
The next it could be the Olduvai theory of per capita energy consumption .
" L - A - T - O - C " stands for LifeAfterTheOilCrash.net , a blog edited by Matt Savinar , 27 , of Santa Rosa , Calif .
( which Rainwater calls " a hotbed for survivalist types " ) , who was on his way to being a lawyer when his side project began climbing up Google 's rankings .
The site is now the No. 2 result of a search on " oil . "
Savinar keeps a running diary of all manner of news and information relating to " peak oil , " a once - wonkish geological debate that has recently crossed over not only to late - night talk shows but even onto the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives .
" Peak oil " theorists posit that global production is at or near its historic ceiling and will begin a long , inexorable decline .
They worry that America is not ready for the downturn , for skyrocketing prices and even shortages .
Savinar 's site 's opening line is , " Civilization as we know it is coming to an end . "
Rainwater has been checking it every morning since September , when his personal anxiety alert level moved to orange .
" I can almost pinpoint the date , " says Moore .
" It was right after he read that book . "
In August a friend gave Rainwater a copy of The Long Emergency , a dystopic view of the future written by ex-Rolling Stone writer James Kunstler , otherwise known for his passionate dislike of suburbia .
Taking peak oil as a given , Kunstler argues that Americans have been " sleepwalking " through the end of a " 100 - year fossil fuel fiesta . "
The problem , he points out , is not that the world will run out of oil tomorrow , but rather that the lack of growth in oil production will wreak havoc on a global economic system predicated on perpetual expansion .
Kunstler 's " long emergency " is a decidedly unpleasant interval during which the world -- and Americans in particular - - must adapt to a post - oil regime of scarce energy and economic stagnation , a time of likely wars and the disappearance of all - American things like Wal - Mart and cul - de- sac homes 45 minutes by minivan from the office .
Rainwater does n't completely buy into Kunstler 's doom and gloom .
" It 's the Z scenario , " he says .
But at the same time , he worries that Kunstler is n't wrong enough , and he 's been buying extra copies of the book and passing them around to the many titans of capitalism who are his protégés .
It 's not the first doomsday book in Rainwater 's life :
His big bet on oil in the late '90s was kicked off by a work called Beyond the Limits , the sequel to a ' 70s sensation called The Limits of Growth .
Written by three professors armed with an MIT - bred computer called World3 , the Limits books projected that , left unchecked , human population would , within 100 years , overshoot the capacity of the planet to serve up sufficient vitamins and minerals -- let alone absorb all the waste and pollution -- to keep everyone healthy .
Rainwater took the book to heart .
" Right after I read it , I said , ' They 've figured it out , I 'm going to follow this thing . ' "
His ensuing oil bet was only the latest triumph for the grandson of a Lebanese immigrant ( on his mother 's side ) who , according to family lore , picked up his last name from a Cherokee ancestor .
His mother had worked at J.C. Penney to put him and his brother through the University of Texas .
In 1970 , after a short stint at Goldman Sachs , he joined Stanford Business School pal Sid Bass in managing the Bass family money in Fort Worth .
Over the next decade and a half , he helped turn the family 's modest $ 50 million fortune into one worth upwards of $ 5 billion .
In the process Rainwater 's investing style emerged : analytically rigorous but opportunistic and Texas - sized in its audacity .
He 'd buy public companies or private .
He 'd use futures and leverage , sometimes 20 to 1 .
He even started companies .
If he thought an idea was right , he put capital behind it .
With the Basses , he resurrected the likes of Disney - - recruiting Michael Eisner to be CEO -- and bet early on cellphones .
Later , when he went out on his own in 1986 , his office drew a who 's who of hard - charging capitalists to Fort Worth .
In the heyday of Rainwater Inc. , Eddie Lampert , the hedge fund tycoon turned head of Sears Holdings , had a desk , as did Daniel Stern , now of $ 3 billion Reservoir Capital .
Ken Hersh , who has compounded money at 31 % annually for 17 years at Natural Gas Partners , started there .
With Rick Scott , Rainwater founded Columbia Healthcare , which merged with HCA and became the country 's biggest for - profit hospital company ( Scott was later forced out as CEO amid a federal fraud investigation ) .
Even George W. Bush kept an office , when he and Rainwater were putting together the Texas Rangers stadium deal .
***
On a Tuesday afternoon in mid-November , Rainwater and Moore are holding court in the 14th - floor conference room of Reservoir Capital in Midtown Manhattan , where he camps out when he's in New York ( he has money invested with the fund ) .
He has gathered Reservoir 's Stern , Goldman alum and Crestview Partners co-founder Barry Volpert , and a couple of guests , and he is expounding on the implications of the peak - oil theory : " I believe in Hubbert 's Peak .
I came out of Texas .
I watched oil fields reach peak and go over , and I 've watched how people would do all they could , put whatever amount of money into the field , and they could n't do anything about it . "
In the 1940s and 1950s , a Shell geologist named M. King Hubbert observed that the production from any given oil field follows a bell curve , with annual volumes increasing until half the oil in the field is depleted , and declining thereafter .
Basically , the bottom oil is harder to extract .
King reasoned that production from all U.S. fields would follow a similar curve and predicted in 1956 that total U.S. oil production would peak in the early 1970s .
His analysis caused a furor and was widely disparaged , but proved correct .
" Hubbert 's Peak " entered the lexicon of oil analysis -- one of the great geological I - told - you - so's .
Forty - nine years later , a growing number of noted geologists and industry analysts suggest that the global oil supply may now be topping out , a claim that has been met by skepticism from yet other geologists and economists who say higher prices will spawn both more discovery and improved recovery from existing fields .
Rainwater sides with the imminent peak crowd , and can rattle off facts to back up his argument .
" In 1988 there were 15 million barrels a day of shut - in production " -- meaning surplus that could be tapped --" and the world was using about 55 million barrels of oil .
Today the world is using over 80 million , and there 's no shut - in production left .
We 've used it up , through the combination of depletion and growth . "
In other words , the spigot can't be opened any wider .
What concerns him most is the conflict that he thinks an oil shortage will precipitate .
What happens when people get blindsided by prices rocketing past any level they have contemplated -- especially when you factor in other challenges America faces ?
" We 've got a lot of things going on simultaneously , " he says .
" The world as we know it is unwinding with respect to Social Security , pensions , Medicare .
We 're going to have dramatically increased taxes in the U.S.
I believe we 're going into a world where there 's going to be more hostility .
More people are going to be asking , ' Why did God do this to us ? '
Whatever God they worship .
Alfred Sloan said it a long time ago at General Motors , that we 're giving these things during good times .
What happens in bad times ?
We 're going to have to take them back , and then everybody will riot . '
And he 's right . "
***
Part of Rainwater 's routine when he 's down on the farm is to go for gizzards at Allison's , a no- frills truck stop up the road .
Driving in a red BMW SUV on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving , he points out who lives where : the local doctor , the Taiwanese Nan Ya workers .
He chokes up momentarily passing the home of a woman who worked at the farm , whose son has just returned from serving in Iraq .
The sheer incongruity of his wealth in Lake City is not lost on him .
But at Allison 's he seems right at home , lathering the deep - fried gizzards with hot sauce and self - serving a large coffee which he spices at the hot chocolate machine .
Back on the farm that night , he and Moore discuss future projects with their landscaper , Jenks Farmer , over a glass of wine .
Farmer , who has a master 's in horticulture and lives on the property , maintains Moore 's extensive gardens , including vegetable beds that produce all year round .
That morning Rainwater had been surfing the web , researching greenhouses in his quest to further ensure a steady flow of food through the winter .
At his prodding , Moore has installed an emergency generator and 500 - gallon storage tanks for diesel fuel and water .
When Rainwater says that he 's thinking about opening a for - profit survivability center , it 's not entirely clear that he 's joking .
Later in the night Rainwater returns to musing on how different his lot is from the residents of Lake City .
And then , returning to the debate in his head , he gets a serious look on his face and says : " This is going to get a little religious .
I ask why I was blessed with this insightfulness .
Everyone who has achieved something , scientists , ballplayers , thinks they were given their talent for a reason .
Why me ?
Was I given this insightfulness at this particular time ?
Or was I just given this insightfulness ? "
He pauses .
" I just want people to look out .
' Cause it could be bad . "

UN police clashed with Serb demonstrators trying to cross a bridge in the ethnically divided city of Kosovoska Mitrovica , a day after violent riots broke out in Belgrade .
UN police face off against angry Serbian protesters Friday in Kosovoska Mitrovica . ( ( CBC ) )
The protesters attacked police with stones , glass bottles and firecrackers as they tried to keep the demonstrators — protesting Kosovo 's declaration of independence — off the bridge that separates the Serb and ethnic Albanian sides of the city , the Associated Press reported .
The clash followed a rally of around 5,000 Serbs who waved Serbian flags and chanted " Kosovo is ours ! "
In Belgrade , the streets were calm Friday as police stood guard at the U.S. and other Western embassies following violent overnight riots that left at least one person dead and nearly 150 injured .
The attacks came after a swarm of rioters had broken away from a massive state - sponsored rally held earlier Thursday attended by up to 200,000 people who also protested recognition of Kosovo 's declaration of independence .
In a statement Friday , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica appealed for an end to the violence .
" This directly damages our … national interests .
All those who support the fake state of Kosovo are rejoicing at the sight of violence in Belgrade , " he said .
Serbian President Boris Tadic called an emergency meeting of the national security council and said the rioting that engulfed the capital must " never happen again . "
" I most sharply condemn the violence , looting and arson , " Tadic said in a statement .
" There is no excuse for the violence .
Nobody can justify what happened yesterday . "
Shops ransacked
Serbian police said that one person died and more than 150 people were injured in the recent spate of violence .
Nearly 200 people were arrested and 90 shops ransacked , police said in a statement .
Early Friday morning , the streets were swept clean of debris , as maintenance crews repaired smashed traffic lights along the main avenues .
" A lot of these shops and stores were targeted by looters last night , " said Shiv Sharma , a freelance journalist reporting from Belgrade .
Shop items and broken glass strewn across the street were being cleared away so the morning rush hour could get underway , Sharma told CBC News .
Sharma said the police presence was highly visible on the streets , with many officers surrounding the U.S. Embassy .
Putin calls Kosovo split ' a terrifying precedent '
More than a dozen countries have recognized Kosovo 's declaration of independence , which was made on Sunday .
They include the United States , Britain , France , Italy and Germany .
Russia , China and Spain have condemned the declaration .
On Friday , Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a sharp warning to the West about recognizing Kosovo 's independence .
He said the decision would have dire consequences .
" In the end , this is a stick with two ends and that other end will come back to knock them on the head someday , " he said in a televised statement .
" The Kosovo precedent is a terrifying precedent , " he added .
" It in essence is breaking open the entire system of international relations that have prevailed not just for decades but for centuries . "
In Canada , former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Canada should proceed with caution as it decides whether to recognize Kosovo 's independence or not .
Chrétien , who described the situation as a political powder keg with far - reaching implications , appeared to back the go - slow approach of the Harper government .
" Canada has to be careful because we have people who want to separate from Canada , " he said in Ottawa , where he was receiving the Order of Canada .
But in Washington , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said it was time for Serbs to accept that Kosovo is no longer theirs .
She also suggested it was time to drop centuries of grievance and sentimentality in the Balkans .
" We believe that the resolution of Kosovo 's status will really , finally , let the Balkans begin to put its terrible history behind it , " Rice said Friday .
" It 's time to move forward . "
U.S. critical of security
The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade burns after masked attackers broke into the building and set an office on fire .
( ( Associated Press ) )
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Freed criticized the Serbian government for not doing enough to protect the U.S. Embassy on Friday when hundreds of rioters torched the building .
The fire killed one person , likely a protester .
" I think it was negligent .
And whether it was deliberate or simply negligent is something we can't say , " Freed said .
" But it was deeply irresponsible because the Serbian government certainly knew that there would be large crowds …
It was not a satisfactory situation . "
The nearby Croatian Embassy was also attacked , and a residential building next door was damaged by flames .
Rocks were pelted at the Canadian Embassy and the missions of Turkey , Bosnia and Belgium were also targeted .
The Department of Foreign Affairs has " strongly advised " Canadians travelling to Serbia " to avoid all demonstrations and political gatherings and to stay away from areas where they might occur , as they may turn violent without warning . "
The Do Not Call registry is on its way to becoming permanent .
The Senate on Wednesday followed the House and unanimously passed Do-Not - Call Improvement
Act of 2007 that will permanently prevent salesmen and other telemarketers from making those irritating dinner - time phone calls looking to sell you everything from aluminum siding to Zebra insurance ( fine if you owned a Zebra I suppose ) .
There are actually two bills that make up the Do Not Call change .
One gives the Federal Trade Commission the permanent authority to enforce the registry , the other spells out the details .
About 150 million Americans have signed the Federal Do Not Call registry since 2003 and experts say without the permanent extension , up to one - third of those names could have fallen off the list by this coming Fall .
The new legislation will let consumers avoid having to renew their listing every five years .
Most states will continue to have their own registries , experts said .
Aside from what telemarketing junk the bill does prevent , experts note what may also be a big deal is a provision that is NOT in this bill and that is protection for those other annoying time wasters : political robo calls .
The previous Federal Do Not Call act had a provision in it that protected political , charitable or survey calls .
Not this time , at least for now .
Such calls have been roundly lambasted in recent days on the presidential nomination trail .
John McCain 's campaign sent out robo-calls in the Sunshine State ahead of its high - stakes GOP presidential primary last month , prompting Romney to complain on national TV about what he deemed aggressive and negative calls , according to an Associated Press report .
The Romney campaign also used robo-calls in Florida .
In New Hampshire , which held the nation 's first primary , Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign complained that automated calls from the Obama campaign went to voters on the " do not call " list , which is a violation of state law .
Obama aides maintain the calls were legal .
The Clinton campaign also made robo-calls in the state but said its calls did not violate the law , according to the AP .
( There is a group called StopPoliticalCalls.org that says it can protect consumers from these calls . )
Beyond the robo call issue , the Do Not Call Extension Act , S.781 , will reauthorize the FTC ’s ability to collect fees from telemarketers to cover the operational costs of the program permanently .
Currently , telemarketers pay $ 62 for each area code , with the first five area codes free and total fees capped at $ 17,050 .
They are required to search the registry every month and drop from their call lists the phone numbers of consumers who have registered .
Sen. Mark Pryor , D - Ark. , who sponsored the Senate bill , noted in a release that compliance with the registry has been high , but that the FTC has brought enforcement action against 52 individuals and 73 corporate defendants .
Violating the Do Not Call Registry subjects telemarketers to civil penalties of up to $ 11,000 per violation .
On April 10 , 2007 , FTC Chairman Deborah Majoras testified at a Commerce Committee Hearing that the FTC has obtained settlements with orders requiring payment of approximately $ 9 million in civil penalties and more than $ 8.2 million in consumer redress and disgorgement .
The FTC last Fall announced that it is cracking a few heads in an effort to get it through the thick skulls of telemarketers that " do not call " means you 're not supposed to call .
There are only four teams left in these 2008 NFL Playoffs , and while the remaining matchups are n't exactly what the network suits wanted ( no Tom - vs - Peyton rematch ? ) , there are still plenty of questions left to be answered during this weekend 's conference championship games :
Can the Patriots keep their perfect season alive and punch a ticket to Glendale ?
Can the Chargers , perhaps without their QB and the league 's best RB , prove that their win at Indy was n't a fluke ?
Will Brett Favre keep Green Bay 's magical season going , and leave the game a winner ?
Or will much - maligned Giants QB Eli Manning finally emerge from his brother 's shadow and lead NY to a Super Bowl ?
Fortunately , you do n't have to wait until Sunday to get these questions answered ... because I 'm going to run a COM - vs - COM sim of every matchup ahead of time using Tecmo Super Bowl , giving you the 8 - bit lowdown on which teams will advance to the Super Bowl and which teams will be starting their summer vacations early .
But first , here 's the usual business that we have to take care of :
For all of those who have been asking , the basic version of the rosters I 'm using can be found here , and you need an emulator to play the ROM , so pick up Nestopia here .
Again , thanks be to Greg the Ex - ' Burgher , for originally doing something like this two years ago , and for introducing me to the wonderful world of the TSB Repository .
Also , special shout - outs to Deadspin and The Globe for continually linking to these articles -- it 's nice to know people are enjoying the sims !
Finally , feel free to point out any roster flaws you see , so that I can fix them before the next batch of games .
I think they 're pretty accurate at this point ( although Michael Strahan 's name is misspelled ) , but if you see anything incorrect , give me a holla .
Okay , to the Conference Championship matchups !
Last week , Tecmo called 3 of the 4 games correctly ( including San Diego 's upset of Indianapolis ) , the only slip - up coming when it picked Dallas to top the Giants .
And , believe me , it 's apparently learned not to pick against Eil and the G - Men again ...
Anyway , for each game I 'll tell you what Tecmo's simulated score was , and also what I think the outcome will be -- of course , I make no guarantees as to the accuracy of either .
Accompanying each game is the " Matchup Breakdown " chart , which is based on a percentile ranking of each team using Football Outsiders ' DVOA metric -- remember , it is a measure of a team 's real - life strengths and weaknesses , and has nothing to do with Tecmo per se .
But I thought it would be cool to include nonetheless .
Enjoy the sims , kids !
San Diego vs. New England
First Half
Second Half
Game Summary : True to their dominating form ( and perhaps inspired by LaDainian Tomlinson's " classless " comments a year ago ) , the Patriots sprinted out to a 14 - 0 lead on San Diego almost immediately .
For his part , Tomlinson -- fighting the effects of the bruised right knee he suffered against Indy -- would answer with a spectacular 87 - yard touchdown run early in the 2nd quarter , but Tom Brady immediately connected with Donte ' Stallworth for his third TD pass of the day .
After San Diego 's final drive of the quarter only resulted in a Nate Kaeding field goal , New England found themselves up 21 - 10 at the half on a team without their QB and with their star RB at less than 100 % .
But much like he had done a week earlier against the heavily favored Colts , Chargers backup QB Billy Volek tried to will San Diego back into the game , this time capping the opening drive of the 2nd half with a TD pass to Vincent Jackson .
San Diego was within striking distance at 21 - 17 , but Brady and the Pats continued their pattern of answering every Charger touchdown with one of their own , closing out the 3rd quarter with Brady finding Stallworth for another TD , which pushed the lead to 28 - 17 .
The Bolts would not simply go away , though , and as the 4th quarter began , Volek connected with Jackson again , cutting New England 's lead to 4 .
The Patriots would offer no hope for a San Diego comeback , however , embarking on a clock - killing drive that ended when Laurence Maroney scampered into the end zone to make the score 35 - 24 with 1:42 remaining in the game .
Volek would end up tossing a meaningless TD to Chris Chambers as time expired ( explaining the 35 - 31 final ) , but in the end , the Patriots simply did what they 've done every week since the middle of August -- move on with a victory .
35 -31 Patriots , final score .
My Prediction : New England 35 , San Diego 14 .
NY Giants vs. Green Bay
First Half
Second Half
Game Summary : Favored by a touchdown and playing at home , the Green Bay Packers had every reason to expect a favorable result on this frigid Wisconsin Sunday .
But what happens when your opponent believes they are a team of destiny , as Eli Manning and the Giants do ?
The Giants had gone on the road and won in each of the previous two weeks , and fully intended to make it three - for - three , single - digit temperatures or not .
In a mistake - filled first half , the G - Men struck first when Manning found Plaxico Burress for a 72 - yard score .
Brett Favre would respond quickly , hitting Greg Jennings for a game - tying TD as the 1st quarter came to a close , but the cold conditions were really taking a toll on the offenses as the game wore on .
Punts and interceptions abounded in the 2nd quarter , although Lawrence Tynes did find the time to hit a 27 - yard FG and give the Giants a 10 - 7 lead at the half .
Mason Crosby started the 2nd half with a chance to tie the game at 10 , but he pushed his 55 - yard field goal attempt wide left , and N.Y. maintained their slim 10 - 7 advantage .
After the teams traded punts for the rest of the 3rd quarter , Manning and the Giants weighed their options to start the 4th , and then made the biggest play of the game .
Starting at their own 20 after a touchback , and having run the ball reasonably well in the cold weather , everyone expected New York to lead off this drive by pounding the ball with the punishing Brandon Jacobs .
Instead , Manning froze the defense with a great play - action fake , and lobbed an 80 - yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer that gave N.Y. a 10 - point lead .
Favre and the Packers were not finished , however , as # 4 led Green Bay down the field on a 50 - yard drive that ended only when Ryan Grant found the end zone .
But the Giants continued to prove that destiny was on their side ...
New York pushed the ball into the red zone on the ensuing drive , and Manning uncorked an ill - conceived pass headed right for Charles Woodson .
Woodson was in position to make the pick , but the ball bounced right off of his hands , giving the Giants a second chance to capitalize on the field position .
They would not disappoint , as Jacobs found the end zone on the very next play , giving N.Y. a commanding 24 - 14 lead with 1:25 on the clock .
Favre tried to work his magic and lead a comeback , but he had run out of miracles , getting sacked twice by Michael Strahan and turning the ball over on downs .
With the win , the cinderella Giants make it to their first Super Bowl since 2000 , and once again they will be facing a ferocious team with a take - no - prisoners head coach .
Does this fairy tale have a happy ending ?
Only time will tell ...
24 - 14 Giants , final score .
My Prediction : Green Bay 24 , NY Giants 16 .
OFHEO released their Q1 2005 report showing a 12.5 % annual housing price increase nationwide over the past year .
Kash on Angry Bear breaks down the data by key metropolitan areas and provides a graph of inflation adjusted house prices : New House Price Data .
Another way to look at the data is to compare house prices vs. equivalent owner 's rent for different areas of the Country .
This measure of fundamental housing value , called the price - rent ratio , was suggested by the Federal Reserve 's Krainer and Wei in " House Prices and Fundamental Value " .
The following graph shows the U.S. and Los Angeles price - rent ratios since 1982 .
The price component is from the OFHEO home price index and the rent series is from the BLS owner 's equivalent rent index .

Krainer and Wei " found that most of the variance in the price - rent ratio is due to changes in future returns and not to changes in rents .
This is relevant because it suggests the likely future path of the ratio .
If the ratio is to return to its average level , it will probably do so through slower house price appreciation . "
The owner 's rent equivalent data series from the BLS starts in ' 97 for many areas .
Using ( 1997 = 1 ) the following graph compares the Price - Rent ratio for Los Angeles , Washington D.C. , Miami and Wichita / Peoria .
It should come as no surprise that LA , DC and Miami house prices are all significantly above the Owner 's equivalent rent .
But is there a bubble in Peoria ?
The data suggests that housing in Peoria , Wichita , and Indianapolis are all about 15 % overvalued .
However I do n't expect nominal price decreases in those areas .
More likely is slow appreciation ( below the inflation rate ) for a few years until rents catch up with house prices .
The Price - Rent ratio suggests that housing is overvalued in most of the United States and significantly overvalued in the larger metropolitan areas .

Over the next several weeks , we 're sure to hear plenty about Microsoft 's attempt to buy Yahoo .
Yahoo released a statement on Friday indicating that its board would indeed evaluate the deal seriously , saying that it would evaluate Microsoft 's and any additional offers closely .
How does Google feel about all this ?
Moments ago , Google 's top counsel , senior vice president David Drummond posted Google 's first official response to the proposed deal , and it has some bite .
Drummond asks some questions that are clearly meant to sketch out a dark future should a deal go through :
" Could Microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the Internet that it did with the PC ?
While the Internet rewards competitive innovation , Microsoft has frequently sought to establish proprietary monopolies — and then leverage its dominance into new , adjacent markets , " he writes .
It is n't an understatement to say that Google apparently opposes this deal .
Going for the jugular , Google 's Drummond instantly suggests that the Redmond giant could ( would ? ) use unsavory tactics for unfair advantage , ultimately harming the Internet and the very open and innovative environment that 's driving it .
Yet Drummond does n't explain just how Microsoft could accomplish this .
While we all know that Microsoft utilized special OEM pricing deals for Windows to influence those very same OEMs , for instance , it remains unclear on what basis Google sees this threat taking shape online .
Where is their new leverage stemming from in this deal ?
Drummond goes on to worry about specific threats , asking if a Microsoft - Yahoo marriage could result in Microsoft extending " unfair practices from browsers and operating systems to the Internet " or if the combination of two webmail and IM giants is unhealthy .
" Could a combination of the two take advantage of a PC software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to freely access competitors ' e-mail , IM , and web - based services ? , " Drummond asks .
" Policymakers around the world need to ask these questions — and consumers deserve satisfying answers . "
Google is right to raise these issues , but beginning the discussion with a veiled accusation that Microsoft could unfairly limit the abilities of users to use competing services is a bit strong in the absence of any illustration as to how Microsoft could accomplish this .
It 's no small feat to hijack the Internet , e-mail and IM , yet Google 's Drummond seems to be suggesting that when we think about Microsoft - Yahoo , that 's what we ought to be thinking about .
Is this a reasonable response , or fear mongering ?
It strikes me as more of the latter , to be honest .
THE bystander was a mild - mannered academic from the University of Melbourne .
Passing a building site on the Yarra 's south bank , he witnessed a confrontation between a union official and a building manager .
No punches were thrown but the two men pushed each other and grabbed at each other 's shirts .
But agents of the federal building industry watchdog soon tracked the witness down and hauled him in for several hours of secret questioning , under powers that rival those of Australia 's national security services .
The man cannot be named and cannot discuss the details of his interrogation for fear of imprisonment .
Building unions say the innocent citizen 's experience proves the Australian Building and Construction Commission is out of control , wielding powers greater than the police and equal to those of anti-terrorism bodies such as ASIO .
A spokeswoman for the commission confirmed it was the first time a bystander , not connected with a building company or a union , has been subjected to these powers .
The legislation gives the commission the authority to question people - with or without a lawyer present - and overrides the right to silence .
Witnesses cannot reveal the contents of the interview , even to their spouses , and risk up to six months in jail if they breach the law .
When contacted by the Herald , the witness declined to answer questions about his experience , saying only : " The laws governing
In the first installment of this series , we encountered the common misconception that the order of the terminal nodes ( " tips " ) on an evolutionary tree reflects the actual relatedness among the species represented .
Simply rotating some internal nodes without affecting the branching order ( " topology " ) of the tree -- and thus , making no change to the relationships among species -- showed that that the order of tips on a tree is actually arbitrary .
What matters is the way that the species are connected through their common ancestors .
This time , we will deal with misconceptions about the change that actually occurs along the branches in between nodes , especially between an internal node and a terminal node .
Here again is a tree showing relationships among major groups of vertebrates .
In this case , each terminal node represents a living species and all internal nodes reflect extinct ancestors .
Looking at the tree above , there may be a tendency to assume that very little change has occurred in the lineage leading to modern bony fishes , whereas it is clear that a great deal of change has happened in the lineage leading to mammals .
But is this an accurate interpretation ?
Does the long straight line with no branching depicted in the fish lineage mean that no change has occurred in fishes since the split between their lineage and our own ?
Is n't the outermost branch ( " outgroup " , or less appropriately " basal lineage " ) the most " primitive " ?
Before answering those questions , consider this tree .
It shows hypothesized relationships among the major echinoderm lineages , which includes sea lillies , brittle stars and sea stars , and sea cucumbers and sea urchins .
The outgroup in this case is humans .
Looking at this tree , would you assume that no change has occurred on the branch leading to humans from the common ancestor of vertebrates and echinoderms ?
Can you conclude that humans are more " primitive " than sea cucumbers ?
There are several reasons that trees like the first one above can be confusing .
First , it is an " unbalanced " tree , which means that more diversity is depicted on one side of each internal node , even if this does not reflect reality .
As a matter of fact , bony fishes make up about half of all vertebrate species , whereas in the tree above they are represented by only one terminal node as compared to five nodes representing the non-fish vertebrates .
Second , there is a tendency to draw conclusions based on the order of terminal nodes , and humans or some other species of interest are usually placed at the far right of the tree ( or at the top , depending on the orientation ) when , as we saw last time , the order of tips is arbitrary as every node can be rotated .
Third , there is an assumption that a long branch means that no change has occurred , a misinterpretation that becomes evident when humans are placed as the " basal lineage " on a tree .
So , not only is it inaccurate to read the order of terminal nodes , it is also not valid to assume that a branch without internal nodes means that no change has happened in that lineage -- more likely , it simply is not depicted as a result of incomplete sampling .
Assuming that no change has occurred even on short branches can also create misunderstandings about evolutionary relationships .
For example , consider the following tree , which reflects relationships among several primates .
This diagram indicates that humans and chimpanzees are each others ' closest living relatives , these two having shared an ancestor ( at node U ) more recently than either has with any of the other living primates shown in the tree ( there are actually two species of chimpanzees , the common chimpanzee Pan troglodytes , and the bonobo , Pan paniscus ) .
The species that is represented by node U was neither a human nor a chimpanzee .
In fact , a great deal of change has occurred along the lineage from node U to modern humans , and involved several more ancestors that are not shown on the tree .
There was also change along the lineage of which modern chimpanzees are the present representatives .
In short , humans are not descended from chimpanzees any more than chimpanzees are descended from humans .
Chimpanzees and humans are cousins , and neither is the grandparent of the other .
One often hears the question asked , at least among those who do not understand evolutionary concepts , " If humans are descended from apes , then why are there still apes ? " .
The answer is simple : humans are not descended from other modern apes , rather humans and the other apes are all descended from common ancestors that are extinct .
This is possible because new species often arise through a process in which an ancestral species diverges into two or more descendant lineages ( a process known as " cladogenesis " ) rather than simply transforming into a new species ( a process called " anagenesis " ) .
Thus , humans and other apes can all exist in the same way that Canada , Australia , and New Zealand can all exist .

We think it 's possible that the time has come to admit that Ben Heck ( aka Benjamin Heckendorn ) has officially taken it to the limit , put the pedal to the metal , and a large number of other cliches that suggest something has been pushed just about as far as you can take it .

From WikiLeaks
You can lead a trojan horse to a Bierzelt , but can you make it Skype ?
DANIEL SCHMITT
January 24 , 2008
The pdf file obtained by Wikileaks and also released by the german political party PiratenPartei , contains two scanned documents relating to activities of the Bavarian police , Ministry of Justice and the Prosecution office in intercepting encrypted data submitted via SSL or Skype via the internet .
The first one , presenting a communication on splitting cost between Bavarian police and the prosecutors offices , the second one presenting the related offer for the software by a German company called Digitask .
The technology works via a local installation of malware on the clients computer .
Digitask 's offer gives a high - level explanation of this .
RELATED : Bavarian_trojan_for_non-germans - TRANSLATION FOR NON - GERMAN SPEAKERS
A n offer on interception technology
The offer , dated September 4th 2007 , responds to an inquiry by Bavarian officials on the possibility of Skype interception .
It introduces a basic description of the cryptographic workings of Skype , and concludes that new systems are needed to spy on Skype calls .
Next , it introduces the so - called Skype Capture Unit .
In a nutshell : malware is installed onto a target machine , to intercept Skype Voice and Chat .
Another feature introduced is a recording proxy , that is not part of the offer , yet would allow for anonymous proxying of recorded information to a target recording station .
Access to the recording station is possible via a multimedia streaming client , supposedly offering real - time interception .
Another part of the offer is an interception method for SSL based communication , working on the same principle of establishing a man - in - the - middle attack on the key material on the client machine .
According to the offer , this method works for Internet Explorer and Firefox web browsers .
Digitask also recommends using overseas proxy servers , to cover the tracks of all activities .
T he eventuality of delivery
The document interestingly holds some information on future dependencies , time schedules and similar things , and it quickly becomes clear that the solution presented here eventually delivers something .
While the recording server offered now might only be able to handle a small amount of new Skype client features like Video Chat , the first striking factor is a delivery time of 4 - 6 weeks for a single installation .
Perhaps by then or at some other time the software will also be Windows Vista compatible .
Interestingly , in 2008 , software for Windows 2000 and Windows XP only is offered .
The delivery time also does not include installation on the target machine , but only provisioning of the software .
Methods of delivery , which would be one of the more interesting features of such software , include personal delivery to the target machine , and sending it as an e-mail attachment .
While other methods , not being further specified , can always be integrated , this will only happen at full development cost and the delivery is still fully up to the purchaser of the software .
Digitask will also not take on any responsibility for use of the software or damage caused by it .
T he high cost of governmental eavesdropping
The licensing model presented here relates to instances of installations per month for a minimum of three months .
Each installation of the Skype Capture Unit will cost EUR 3500 , SSL interception is priced at EUR 2500 .
A one - time installation fee of EUR 2500 is not further explained .
The minimum cost for any installation on a suspect computer for a comprehensive interception of both SSL and Skype will be EUR 20500 , if no more than one one - time installation fee are required .
S oftware versus bulletproof vests ?
The letter gives a tabular overview of the cost .
Interestingly , this includes the proxy server to disguise police officers ' identity .
After stating that no law currently clearly regulates these costs , and concentrating on various legal aspects of this statement , it is declared that all costs for hardware and software must be covered by local German police budgets , which are well known to be tight .
According to a decision by the State Ministry of the Interior and the State Ministry of Justice , this includes all costs for acquisition and maintenance .
China has added ghosts , monsters and other things that go bump in the night to its list of banned video and audio content in an intensified crackdown ahead of the Beijing Olympics .
Producers have around three weeks to look through their tapes for " horror " and report it to authorities , the General Administration of Press and Publications said in a statement posted on the government website .
Offending content included " wronged spirits and violent ghosts , monsters , demons , and other inhuman portrayals , strange and supernatural storytelling for the sole purpose of seeking terror and horror " , the administration said .
A. Garrett Lisi has largely avoided traditional academic appointments , preferring to do his physics research in between surfing , snowboarding and working odd jobs . *
Photo : Courtesy A. Garrett Lisi * Freelance physicist A. Garrett Lisi made headlines last year when he published his " Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything " to an online wiki .
The theory purports to be a blueprint of the universe , showing how all of the particles and forces of the universe are connected .
Lisi , who is speaking at the TED conference in Monterey , California this week , rejects string theory – currently the dominant model of the universe .
Instead , his unification theory places all known particles and the four fundamental forces of nature ( electromagnetic , the strong force , the weak force and gravity ) onto an exceptionally complex 248 - point mathematical model known as E8 that was formulated in the late 19th century .
Lisi 's schema uses 228 points of the model , with 20 points left over for what he predicts will belong to 20 as - yet - undiscovered particles .
His theory met with enthusiastic media coverage , but to date , the scientific community has been far more skeptical about the validity of Lisi 's model .
Lisi left academia after obtaining his Ph.D. in 1999 , and since then has been working odd jobs to support himself while spending the rest of his time working on physics , surfing and snowboarding .
Wired.com interviewed him by e-mail before his appearance .
Wired :
Your entire career has been focused , in essence , on your rejection of string theory .
What do you have against strings and extra dimensions ?
Garrett Lisi :
It 's more accurate to say my career ( or , often , lack of one ) has been focused on doing what I wanted .
There are a lot of good things about string theory , and it 's great that some people want to work on it .
But , to me , it seemed too disconnected from real particle physics and gravitation .
It seemed unlikely that many of these string constructions could ever be experimentally tested , or connected up with the real world .
So I set off to follow my own interests .
Wired :
Please explain in layman 's terms why the gravitational force fits this model when it has so resolutely resisted fitting other models except , presumably , string theory ?
Lisi :
The way gravity fits came from recent research in the Quantum Gravity community .
This research provided a framework in which gravity could be treated as one of the other three forces , while still agreeing with Einstein 's general relativity .
When this was combined with a description of the Higgs field , it all fell into place perfectly .
I was shocked to see it work so well ; but that shock quickly diffused into excitement , which then congealed into a physics paper .
Wired :
If your theory is proven correct , what will the implications be ?
What will we know about the universe and how it works other than that its structure is incredibly beautiful and ordered ?
Lisi :
For me , it would be enough to know that the fundamental structure of the universe is incredibly beautiful .
I do n't think there would be any practical implications within our lifetime .
( Physicist Richard )
Feynman put it the best when he said : " Physics is like sex .
Sure , it may give some practical results , but that 's not why we do it . "
Wired :
Will it be able to tell us anything about the Big Bang or about Neil Turok 's multiple Big Bangs ?
If not , will it at least be able to explain some of the confounding mysteries of Lost ?
Lisi :
If this theory turns out to be true about nature , it will certainly provide some new insights into the conditions of the universe shortly after the big bang .
It might also lead to interesting speculation on multiple universes .
As to resolving the ( mysteries ) in Lost . . .
I 'm afraid the workings of J.J. Abrams ' mind falls outside the predictive capacity of any coherent theory .
Wired :
Your model predicts the existence of 20 mysterious and as - yet - undiscovered particles .
Have you been able to calculate masses for those mysterious particles that would help researchers find them ?
Lisi :
These suggested particles are not so mysterious – they would be a lot like the Higgs particle , but with color charges that keep them in bound states .
I have n't yet solved the problems required to predict their masses , but they would still be recognizable if detected .
Of course , if a bunch of particles are detected that are clearly not any of these 20 , then this theory is in trouble .
And if the Large Hadron Collider ( scheduled to go online later this year in Switzerland ) finds superparticles or other evidence for strings , I 'm going to have to pay out some bets .
Wired :
Tell us about your decision to pursue your research independently .
Why , after getting your Ph.D. , did you decide to mostly avoid academic teaching and research positions ?
Lisi :
It is extraordinarily difficult , even in academia , to find a job that will let you do whatever you want with your time .
If you are determined to spend your time following your own interests , you pretty much have to do it on your own .
After my Ph.D. , there just were n't any positions open to support the research I wanted to do .
And , of course , the surfing and windsurfing in Maui is amazingly good .
I did the best I could to make my daydreams happen – and that did n't put me in an office .
Wired :
You 're used to working in isolation .
But this is a theory that 's being developed in the wiki tradition with input from others .
Have there been any exciting and noteworthy contributions from others to further the theory ?
Lisi : Sure , I 've made all my physics open source , and documented it as well as possible .
I 've got a personal wiki , Deferential Geometry , where I work on ideas out in the open .
Many people have taken ideas from my work and run with them , to advance their own , which is good to see .
The biggest help with the theory that I 've received from others has been from mathematicians , who have provided answers to some of the trickier aspects of E8 group theory .
And there has been practical help as well : friends who have offered me places to stay , or donated support , and there 's even a surfboard shaper making me a new board – from 42 Surfboards .
Wired : A media storm ensued last year after New Scientist published a piece about your theory .
Since then you 've been hailed a genius and likened to Einstein .
But you 've also received some pretty sharp ridicule .
Does it worry you that so much could be riding on this for you personally ?
Do you regret putting your ideas out there for public consumption before they were fully formed ?
Lisi :
The comparisons to Einstein really are n't well justified – he accomplished much more in physics than I ever possibly will .
This story has been sensationalized in the media , which has been quite stressful .
Although , the media spectacle has also been pretty amusing at times .
Some of the harsher personal criticism is an unfortunate but understandable backlash .
I try to pull what I can from useful criticism , but most of it has been from people encountering unfamiliar mathematics and being confused by it .
I 'm not worried about being portrayed as amateurish , because I 'm not an amateur , and my work reflects that .
As it develops , this theory may or may not turn out to be true about nature , but it 's a solid beginning founded on well - established mathematics .
I thought the theory was well enough along to present it to the greater community , get some feedback , and develop it from there .
Wired :
You 've no doubt received a lot of interesting correspondence from people who interpret your findings to support their own beliefs about various things .
What have been some of the wilder e-mails and comments you 've received ?
Lisi :
After this story broke , I awoke to Pandora 's Inbox .
I received the oddest e-mails you can imagine : Hundreds espousing their own grand Theories of Everything which they conceived while on acid , many from readers of Kabbala , mystic incantations , religious revelations , astrology . . . you would n't believe some of it .
Some of the e-mail has been rather charming and random , such as poems , songs , funny pictures and encouragement .
The only thing I have n't received yet is a theory of everything expressed through interpretive dance – I 'm still waiting for that one .
I swear never again to complain that a paper I published did n't get enough attention .
Wired :
You said recently : " Since E8 is perhaps the most beautiful structure in mathematics , it is very satisfying that nature appears to have chosen this geometry . "
Did nature have a choice ?
Could the E8 framework be the result of an evolutionary process of trial and error that adapted until the universe got it right or do you think that beautiful structure was " ready made " ?
I guess the equivalent philosophical question for this would be , which came first – the mathematics or the forces ?
Lisi :
This is a very unusual aspect of this theory .
The largest simple exceptional Lie group , E8 , is a unique structure in mathematics .
If this structure turns out to be fundamental to how the universe works , then it seems to indicate our universe is not one that exists in a landscape of other possibilities .
It would mean our universe is exceptional , and perhaps singular .
Of course , it is philosophically questionable to consider other universes to begin with , since we 're only aware of one .
But , whether this theory works perfectly or not , it is undoubtedly true that the fundamental nature of our universe can be described by mathematics .
Wired :
What 's the connection , if any , between the board sports you pursue and your interest in physics ?
Lisi : Surfing and snowboarding are what I do for fun – to get out and play in nature .
We live in a beautiful universe , and I wish to enjoy it and understand it as best I can .
And I try to live a balanced life .
Surfing is simply the most fun I know how to have on this planet .
And physics , and science in general , is the best way of understanding how everything works .
So this is what I spend my time doing .
I do what I love , and follow my interests .
Should n't everyone ?

The Bible and homosexuality Same - sex relationships in the Bible Sponsored link .
Conservative and Liberal Views : Standard Disclaimer
We will attempt to give interpretations of key passages of the Bible from both a conservative ( fundamentalist and other evangelical ) and from a liberal position .
Speaking generally : Conservative Christian theologians tend to accept English translations of the Bible , such as the New International Version ( NIV ) and the King James Version ( KJV ) as authoritative .
They generally accept the inerrancy of the Bible .
They interpret passages literally , unless there is a good reason not to .
They consider all Bible passages as instructive in today 's society .
When they see any same - sex activity condemned , they believe that this applies to all homosexual activities , regardless of the nature of the relationship .
Homosexuality is a chosen , unnatural , abnormal , changeable , and perverted lifestyle , which is hated by God .
Liberal Christian theologians tend to follow a wider variety of translations , and to be more concerned with instances of copying errors in the original Hebrew or Greek , of forgeries , and of biases among the translators .
They consider some passages ( e.g. those referring to slavery , burning some hookers alive , forcing rape victims to marry their rapists , raping female prisoners of war , etc. ) as not being valid today , as immoral , and against the will of God .
They differentiate among various homosexual and heterosexual sex practices , treating some ( rape , prostitution , temple sex rituals ) as immoral and some ( consesual activity within committed relationships ) as positive .
Homosexual orientation and behavior is seen as a normal human sexual expression among a minority of adults .
It is discovered , not changeable or chosen .
Like all sexual behavior , it can be a sin if it is exploitive , r manipulative , or not carried out safely within a committed relationship .
Summary : The Bible describes three emotionally close relationships between two people of the same gender .
They appear to have progressed well beyond a casual friendship .
There is , however , no unmistakable evidence that they were sexually active relationships .
The individuals are : Ruth and Naomi
David and Jonathan
Daniel and Ashpenaz Ruth and Naomi Ruth 1:16 - 17 and 2:10 - 11 describe their close friendship Perhaps the best known passage from this book is Ruth 1:16 - 17 which is often read out during either opposite - sex and same - sex marriage and union ceremonies : " Where you go I will go , and where you stay I will stay .
Your people will be my people and your God my God .
Where you die I will die , and there I will be buried .
May the Lord deal with me , be it ever so severely , if anything but death separates you and me . "
( NIV ) Ruth 1:14 , referring to the relationship between Ruth and Naomi , mentions that " Ruth clave onto her . " ( KJV ) The Hebrew word translated here as " clave " is identical to that used in the description of a heterosexual marriage in Genesis 2:24 : " Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh . "
( KJV )
This book was probably included in the Hebrew Scriptures because King David was one of the descendents of Ruth .
Although this same - sex friendship appears to have been emotionally very close , there is no proof that it was a sexually active relationship .
David and Jonathan Passages in 1 Samuel & 2 Samuel describe , among other events , a extremely close bond between David and Jonathan .
Jonathan was the son of King Saul , and next in line for the throne .
But Samuel anointed David to be the next king .
This produced a strong conflict in the mind of Saul .
Interpretation : Religious conservatives generally view the friendship of David and Jonathan as totally non-sexual .
They find it inconceivable that God would allow a famous king of Israel to engage in same - gender sexual activity .
Some religious liberals believe that David and Jonathan had a consensual homosexual relationship - in many ways , a prototype of many of today 's gay partnerships .
7
Some important verses which describe their relationship are : 1 Samuel 18:1 " ... Jonathan became one in spirit with David and he loved him as himself . " ( NIV ) " ... the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul " ( KJV )
Most translations use the term " soul " rather than " spirit " to describe the bond .
They speak of an " immediate bond of love " , their souls being " in unison , " their souls being " knit " etc.
Genesis 2:7 , as written in the original Hebrew , describes how God blew the spirit into the body of Adam that God had formed from earth , so that Adam became a living soul .
This means that " soul " , in the ancient Israelite times , represents a combination of body and spirit .
Thus the two men appear to have loved each other both physically and emotionally .
1 Samuel 18:2
" From that day , Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father 's house . "
( NIV ) David left his parent 's home and moved to Saul 's where he would be with Jonathan .
This is a strong indication that the relationship was extremely close .
It echoes the passage marriage passage in Genesis 2:24 : " Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh . "
1 Samuel 18:3 - 4 " And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself .
Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David , along with his tunic , and even his sword , his bow and his belt . "
( NIV )
Since people in those days did not wear underwear , Jonathan stripped himself naked in front of David .
That would be considered extremely unusual behavior ( then and now ) unless their relationship was sexual in nature .
1 Samuel 18:20 - 21 " Now Saul 's daughter Michal was in love with David , and when they told Saul about it , he was pleased .
' I will give her to him ' , he thought , ' so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him ' .
Now you have a second opportunity to become my son - in - law " ( NIV ) In the King James Version , the end of Verse 21 reads : " Thou shalt this day be my son - in - law , in the one of the twain . " ( KJV ) Saul 's belief was that David would be so distracted by a wife that he would not be an effective fighter and would be killed by the Philistines .
He offered first his daughter Merab , but that was rejected , presumably by her .
Then he offered Michal .
There is an interesting phrase used at the end of verse 21 .
In both the NIV and KJV , it would seem that David 's first opportunity to be a son- in - law was with the older daughter Merab , and his second was with the younger daughter Michal .
The KJV preserves the original text in its clearest form ; it implies that David would become Saul 's son - in - law through " one of the twain . "
" Twain " means " two " , so the verse seems to refer to one of Saul 's two daughters .
Unfortunately , this is a mistranslation .
The underlined phrase " the one of " does not exist in the Hebrew original .
The words are shown in italics in the King James Version ; this is an admission by the translators that they made the words up .
Thus , if the KJV translators had been truly honest , they would have written : " Thou shalt this day be my son - in - law , in the twain . "
In modern English , this might be written : " Today , you are son - in - law with two of my children " That would refer to both his son Jonathan and his daughter Michal .
The Hebrew original would appear to recognize David and Jonathan 's homosexual relationship as equivalent to David and Michal 's heterosexual marriage .
Saul may have approved or disapproved of the same - sex relationship ; but at least he appears to have recognized it .
The KJV highlight their re-writing of the Hebrew original by placing the three words in italics ; the NIV translation is clearly deceptive .
1 Samuel 20:41
" After the boy had gone , David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times , with is face to the ground .
Then they kissed each other and wept together - but David wept the most . "
( NIV )
Other translations have a different ending to the verse : " ... and they kissed one another and wept with one another , until David exceeded . " ( KJV )
" ... and they kissed one another and wept with one another until David got control of himself . "
( Amplified Bible )
" and they sadly shook hands , tears running down their cheeks until David could weep no more . "
( Living Bible )
" They kissed each other and wept together until David got control of himself . " ( Modern Language )
" They kissed each other and wept aloud together . " ( New American Bible )
" Then David and Jonathan kissed each other .
They cried together , but David cried the most . "
( New Century Version )
" Then they kissed one another and shed tears together , until David 's grief was even greater than Jonathan 's . "
( Revised English Bible )
" ... and they kissed one another and wept with one another until David recovered himself . "
( Revised Standard Version )
The translators of the Living Bible apparently could not handle the thought of two adult men kissing , so they mistranslated the passage by saying that the two men shook hands !
This is somewhat less than honest .
The original Hebrew text says that they kissed each other and wept together until David became large .
The word which means " became large " in this passage is " gadal " in the original Hebrew .
The same word is used elsewhere in the Hebrew Scriptures to refer to King Solomon being greater than all other kings .
Some theologians interpret " gadal " in this verse as indicating that David had an erection .
However , the thoughts of David becoming sexually aroused after kissing Jonathan may have been too threatening for Bible translators .
They either deleted the ending entirely or created one of their own .
2 Samuel 1:26 " I grieve for you , Jonathan my brother ; you were very dear to me .
Your love for me was wonderful , more wonderful than that of women . "
In the society of ancient Israel , it was not considered proper for a man and woman to have a platonic relationship .
Men and women rarely spoke to each other in public .
Since David 's only relationships with women would have been sexual in nature , then he must be referring to sexual love here .
It would not make sense in this verse to compare platonic love for a man with sexual love for a woman ; they are two completely different phenomena .
It would appear that David is referring to his sexual love for Jonathan .
Sponsored link : Daniel and Ashpenaz Daniel 1:9 refers to Ashpenaz , the chief of the court officials of Nebuchadnezzar , the King of Babylon .
Various English translations differ greatly : " Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel " ( NIV )
" Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs " ( KJV )
" Now God made Daniel to find favor , compassion and loving - kindness with the chief of the eunuchs " ( Amplified Bible )
" Now , as it happens , God had given the superintendent a special appreciation for Daniel and sympathy for his predicament " ( Living Bible )
" Then God granted Daniel favor and sympathy from the chief of the eunuchs " ( Modern Language )
" Though God had given Daniel the favor and sympathy of the chief chamberlain ... " ( New American Bible )
" God made Ashpenaz want to be kind and merciful to Daniel " ( New Century Version )
" And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs " ( Revised Standard Version )
" God caused the master to look on Daniel with kindness and goodwill " ( Revised English Version ) Interpretation : Religious conservatives generally view the friendship of Daniel and Ashpenaz as totally non-sexual .
It is inconceivable that God would allow a famous prophet of Israel to engage in a same - gender sexual relationship .
Some religious liberals detect the possibility of a homosexual relationship here .
The Hebrew words which describe the relationship between Daniel and Ashpenaz are chesed v'rachamim
The most common translation of chesed is " mercy " .
V'rachamim is in a plural form which is used to emphasize its relative importance .
It has multiple meanings : " mercy " and " physical love " .
It is unreasonable that the original Hebrew would read that Ashpenaz " showed mercy and mercy . "
A more reasonable translation would thus be that Ashpenaz " showed mercy and engaged in physical love " with Daniel .
Of course , this would be unacceptable to later translators , so they substitute more innocuous terms .
The KJV reference to " tender love " would appear to be the closest to the truth .
One might question whether Daniel and Ashpenaz could sexually consummate their relationship .
They were both eunuchs .
Apparently , when males are castrated after puberty , they still retain sexual drive .
It is interesting to note that no other romantic interest or sexual partner of Daniel was mentioned elsewhere in the Bible .

Parts of Beni's main city Trinidad are under water
Floods caused by rain have left more than 60 dead in the eastern lowlands .
Mr Morales on Monday toured the worst - hit province , Beni , where thousands of people have had to leave their homes amid rising floodwaters .
It is the second year in a row that Bolivia has seen such floods , which officials blame on climate change .
The floods have left more than 40,000 people homeless , officials say .
Rivers have broken their banks and floodwaters are threatening to breach a raised road surrounding the provincial capital of Trinidad , home to some 90,000 people .
The government has been distributing food and tents in Trinidad , while rescue teams backed by helicopters from Brazil have been stepping up operations , a presidential spokesman said .
Mr Morales ' declaration authorises the government to release funds to help tackle the crisis .
The president had been under pressure to act from opposition governors in the eastern states , who had accused him of reacting too slowly , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Since November , several parts of Bolivia have suffered floods .
The United Nations says the flooding is expected to get worse as more rain is forecast .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Nearly 26 years after his death , Army Master Sgt. Woodrow " Woody " Keeble was awarded the Medal of Honor on Monday for his efforts during the Korean War .
Master Sgt. Woodrow Keeble was the recipient of two Purple Hearts and many other medals .
Keeble is the first full - blooded Sioux Indian to receive the honor and the 10th person to receive the medal from President Bush .
Keeble 's stepson , Russell Hawkins , accepted the medal at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House .
" The Sioux have a saying : The life of a man is a circle .
Well , today , we complete Woody 's circle from an example to his men to an example for the ages , " Bush said .
" And if we honor his life and take lessons from his good and noble service , then Master Sgt. Woody Keeble will serve his country once again . "
Watch Bush recount Keeble 's heroism »
Bush said the ceremony honoring the decorated war veteran was a sad one and one that should have happened decades before .
A series of paperwork errors and missed deadlines caused a roadblock in the nominating process .
After a long effort by Keeble 's family , fellow soldiers , tribal members and four U.S. senators , Congress approved the nomination in 2002 .
" I 'm pleased that this good and honorable man is finally getting the recognition he deserves , " Bush said .
" But on behalf of our grateful nation , I deeply regret that this tribute comes decades too late . "
Bush said Monday 's ceremony was an effort to set things right .
" We can tell his story , we can honor his memory , and we can follow his lead by showing all those who followed him on the battlefield the same love and generosity and spirit that Woody showed his country every day . "
A veteran of World War II and the Korean War , Keeble was born May 16 , 1917 , in Waubay , South Dakota , on the Sisseton - Wahpeton Sioux Reservation , which stretched into North Dakota .
Keeble was being recruited by the Chicago White Sox when he was called to duty in World War II .
The U.S. Army said his " gallant actions " serving on the battlefields in the two wars resulted in top honors , including two Purple Hearts , the Silver Star , the Bronze Star , a Combat Infantryman Badge and the Distinguished Service Cross .
In 1942 , Keeble joined the North Dakota National Guard , and in October of that year , he " found himself embroiled in some of the fiercest hand - to - hand combat of World War II on Guadalcanal , " according to the U.S. Army .
" Guadalcanal seemed to be on his mind a lot , " Hawkins told the Army News Service .
" His fellow soldiers said he had to fight a lot of hand - to - hand fights with the Japanese , so he saw their faces .
Every now and then , he would get a faraway look in his eyes , and I knew he was thinking about those men and the things he had to do . "
Bush spoke of Keeble 's service in Korea .
" One soldier remembered the time when he walked through a minefield , leaving tracks for his men to follow .
Another recalled the time when he was shot twice in the arm and kept fighting without seeming to notice , " Bush said .
According to the Army , Keeble once said of his time in the military that there " were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime , an endlessness , when terror was so strong in me , that I could feel idiocy replace reason .
... I have never left my position , nor have I shirked hazardous duty .
Fear did not make a coward out of me . "
His return to North Dakota was marked by a string of devastating events , including the death of his first wife and ongoing recovery from battle wounds .
Later , a series of strokes paralyzed him and took away his ability to speak .
He died in 1982 , according to the Army .
In addition to Hawkins , Keeble is survived by a stepdaughter , Kathryn Akipa .

JEALOUS lovers will wish they could adjust the height of their heels , for the power of the green - eyed monster depends on how tall you are .
So say researchers from the Universities of Groningen and Valencia who asked 549 men and women in the Netherlands and Spain to rate how jealous they felt and to identify the qualities in a romantic competitor that were most likely to bug them .
Men , who generally felt most nervous about attractive , rich and strong rivals , were increasingly relaxed , the taller they were themselves .
Women , on the other hand , were most jealous of others ’ beauty and …
Los Angeles , CA ( August 21 , 2007 ) --
At a press conference in Ottawa , George W. Bush belittled growing fears of a coming North American Union without specifically denying that this is the ultimate goal of the benignly - named  Security and Prosperity Partnership ,  according to Dr. Jerome Corsi , author of the New York Times bestseller  The Late Great U.S.A : The Coming Merger with Mexico and Canada ( WND Books , ISBNs 0-9790451 -4-2 , $ 25.95 , July 2007 ) .
 That s exactly the same type of response Europeans got from their leaders , even as the EU noose was tightening around the necks of the millions who wanted nothing to do with a European super - state ,  observes Corsi .
And theres plenty to be suspicious about when it comes to Bushs motives and the ultimate goal of the Security and Prosperity Partnership .
Ridicule , says Corsi , is always the last resort of someone whos losing an argument .
The evidence of Bushs perfidy , as shown in  The Late Great U.S.A ,  is just too overwhelming to paper over .
When Bush failed to respond to the Fox News question with a categorical denial of the plans for a North American Union ,  He underestimated the intelligence of people listening .
People realize that the question wasnt answered .
Furthermore , Corsi said ,  Bush did not address the fact that Texas Gov. Rick Perry vetoed a two - year moratorium on the Trans - Texas Corridor project ,  believed to be the starting point for an eventual continent - wide grid of NAFTA Superhighways , as outlined in  The Late Great U.S.A . 
 Just to ridicule the idea , when Bush had a change to categorically deny it , raises doubts in peoples  minds , especially when these meetings arent transparent ,  Corsi added .
The meeting , which focused on economic issues , was attended by representatives of dozens of multinational corporations anxious to have their manufacturing and sales processes smoothed . 
And therein lies so much of the danger .
 When multi-nationals and bureaucrats talk about smoothing  and harmonizing  trade , hold onto your wallets and say goodbye to the America of our forefathers .
What Bush & Co. are talking about isnt harmonization , its integration . 
Which makes even more ludicrous Canadian Prime Minister Harpers claim that  the SPP discussions that were held concerned such pressing issues as jelly beans .
For Corsi , that argument doesnt amount to a hill of beans .
 If the issues being addressed - and decided - at the SPP conference in Ottawa were so meaningless , then why arent they open to the public and transparent ?
Why is it that not one person with objections or questions was allowed into the meeting rooms ? 
The only heartening thing to come out of the press conference for Jerome Corsi was the fact that the question about a coming North American Union was asked by a reporter from Fox News .
 Perhaps this means that the mainstream media is finally taking note of the extreme danger our nation is facing from Bush , his corporate cronies and enablers both to the north and the south .
Maybe it wont just be up to sites like WorldNetDaily and people like me to sound the alarm . 
Thanks to  The Late Great U.S.A , the tide is beginning to turn against George W. Bushs traitorous legacy , and not a moment too soon .

The TSA has designed a miraculous , terrorism - proof laptop bag that will prevent planes from being exploded by word - processing .
Now they want some sucker to build it for them .
• The carrying bag cannot exceed any one of the proposed dimensions – 16 inches in height , 24 inches wide and 36 inches long .
• The materials that make up the bag cannot degrade the quality of the X - ray image of the laptop .
• No straps , pockets , zippers , handles or closures of the bag can interfere with the image of the laptop .
• No electronics , chargers , batteries , wires , paper products , pens or other contents of the bag can shield the image of the laptop .
TSA is inviting bag designers and manufacturers to come up with creative ways to meet these design requirements , but it has also suggested three concepts of its own :
• A bag that would open completely , and lie horizontally on the X - ray belt , such that one side with hold only the laptop .
• A bag that would open completely , leaving the laptop standing vertically , supported by clips .
• A bag that would pull apart in separate compartments , with one compartment containing only the laptop .

For the last several years , HPV vaccines have been marketed to the public and mandated in compulsory injections for young girls in several states based on the idea that they prevent cervical cancer .
Now , NaturalNews has obtained documents from the FDA and other sources ( see below ) which reveal that the FDA has been well aware for several years that Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) has no direct link to cervical cancer .
NaturalNews has also learned that HPV vaccines have been proven to be flatly worthless in clearing the HPV virus from women who have already been exposed to HPV ( which includes most sexually active women ) , calling into question the scientific justification of mandatory " vaccinate everyone " policies .
Furthermore , this story reveals evidence that the vaccine currently being administered for HPV -- Gardasil -- may increase the risk of precancerous cervical lesions by an alarming 44.6 percent in some women .
The vaccine , it turns out , may be far more dangerous to the health of women than doing nothing at all .
If true , this information reveals details of an enormous public health fraud being perpetrated on the American people , involving FDA officials , Big Pharma promoters , and even the governors of states like Texas .
The health and safety of tens of millions of young girls is at stake here , and what this NaturalNews investigative report reveals is that HPV vaccinations may not only be medically useless ; they may also be harmful to the health of the young girls receiving them .
This report reveals startling facts about the HPV vaccine that most people will find shocking :
• How it may actually increase the risk of precancerous lesions by 44.6 percent .
• The FDA has , for four years , known that HPV was not the cause of cervical cancer .
• Why mandatory HPV vaccination policies may cause great harm to young girls .
• Why HPV infections are self - limiting and pose no real danger in healthy women
• Little - known FDA documents that reveal astounding facts about Gardasil
• How Big Pharma promoted its Gardasil vaccine using disease mongering and fear mongering

Zimbabwe 's opposition party claimed an overwhelming victory against President Robert Mugabe in yesterday 's presidential election , saying that the flow of results showed its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , had ' massacred ' the ruling Zanu - PF party .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) defied a government ban on pre-empting the official announcement of the election results and released the count from polling stations that showed Tsvangirai beating the man who has ruled Zimbabwe for 28 years , even in the president 's home territory of Mashonaland .
' We 've won this election , ' said Tendai Biti , the MDC 's secretary - general .
' The results coming in show that in our traditional strongholds we are massacring them .
In Mugabe 's traditional strongholds they are doing very badly .
There is no way Mugabe can claim victory unless it is through fraud .
He has lost this election . '
The government 's electoral commission has yet to release the counts formally .
But the MDC said that declarations posted at polling stations across Zimbabwe last night , and gathered from its agents observing the counts , showed Tsvangirai ahead of Mugabe in every province where results were available .
The most dramatic gap was in Mashonaland West , where the MDC candidate had 88 per cent of the vote to the president 's 12 per cent .
Even in rural areas , where Mugabe has traditionally commanded support , he was taking only half as many votes as Tsvangirai , according to the MDC .
In Harare , the opposition candidate was pulling in three times as many votes as the president .
It was not clear what proportion of the overall vote the results represented , but Biti claimed it was substantial and the trend was ' irreversible ' .
He said the MDC was releasing the results ahead of the electoral commission to head off any attempt by the government to tamper with the figures when they are centrally collated , as they believe happened in the presidential election that Mugabe won by a narrow margin six years ago .
' We do n't trust the electoral commission .
It is n't independent .
We made the mistake in 2002 of not claiming our victory , ' he said .
' If they arrive at figures which are different , we will not accept that , pure and simple . '
Asked how the MDC will challenge any attempt to fix the figures , Biti hinted at popular protest .
' We will not make the same mistake again of taking court action .
But we will remain restrained as a movement .
The MDC will act inside the law .
But the MDC cannot speak for the people of Zimbabwe , ' he said .
The MDC 's move came despite a warning by Zimbabwe 's police chief , Augustine Chihuri , who said he will not permit the opposition to declare victory .
He also warned against a plan by the MDC to call large numbers of people on to the streets to defend the result .
Police were posted at all major intersections in Harare yesterday , while riot police were held in reserve .
The MDC 's claim of victory came despite its protests about election irregularities earlier in the day .
Poll monitors raised concerns at the large numbers of people who were told they could not vote because of errors on the electoral roll .
African election monitors wrote to the electoral commission questioning the registration of more than 8,000 voters on vacant lots in Harare or crammed by their hundreds into small shacks .
Before the vote , Tsvangirai said the MDC had uncovered evidence of widespread vote - rigging including the names of a million ' ghost ' voters on the electoral roll .
Thousands of Zimbabweans slept at polling stations and queued for hours before they opened after the opposition called for a large turnout to counter efforts by Mugabe to rig the election .
The state - run Herald newspaper published a poll giving the president 57 per cent of the vote , enough to avoid a run-off .
The opposition says that number is no more than a guide to the scale of the fraud the government has planned .
“ The one disconcerting thing about the number is the rate that prices are falling is accelerating , ” said Patrick Newport , an economist at Global Insight , a research firm outside Boston .
The housing market will probably exert significant influence on the health of the broader economy in the coming year .
In recent months , growth has slowed but strong exports and rising wages have offset some of the weakness in housing and the financial markets .
Consumer spending in the holiday season has been weaker than some retailers had hoped , though reports indicate it is still growing .
“ It has been surprisingly resilient , ” Robert J. Shiller , the Yale economist and a creator of the home price indexes , said about the economy .
He added that it was difficult to determine what impact the weakness in housing would have on the economy going forward .
“ We are in uncharted territory , ” he said .
“ This was the biggest housing boom we have ever seen . ”
By Mr. Shiller ’s calculation , the decline in home prices is greater than at any time since 1941 when the housing market was faltering at the start of World War II .
Since their peak in July 2006 , home prices in the 20 regions have dropped 6.6 percent .
Many economists are predicting that home prices will fall 10 percent to 15 percent from their peak to their trough , though some pessimists believe the drop could be as large as 30 percent .
Prices are dropping fastest in the Midwest , which has been hit hard by job losses in manufacturing , and in California , Florida and the Southwest , where the housing boom was at its frothiest .
Prices have fallen the most in Miami ( 12.4 percent from a year ago ) , Tampa ( 11.8 percent ) and Detroit ( 11.2 percent ) .
Prices are also falling in the nation ’s two largest metropolitan areas  Los Angeles ( 8.8 percent ) and New York ( 4.1 percent ) .
The victim's boot got stuck in wooden slats on the crossing A woman was hit and killed by a train when her foot became trapped on a level crossing in Essex .
The victim's boot got stuck in wooden slats as she attempted to cross the line in Hythe Station Road , Colchester , while the barriers were down .
Two men attempted to pull her free as the train approached but were unable to release her and she was struck , British Transport Police ( BTP ) said .
One of the men suffered minor injuries in the accident on Thursday night .
A BTP spokesman said that the incident was not being treated as suspicious .
This was a tragic and harrowing incident for everyone concerned
Det Insp Terry Pearce BTP
" A woman in her late 20s died at the scene after she attempted to cross the line when the barriers were down and got her foot stuck in the wooden guards of the crossing and became trapped , " the spokesman said .
" Two men attempted to pull her free from the crossing as the train , which was travelling between 40 mph and 50 mph , approached . "
The crash at 1950 GMT involved a service from London 's Liverpool Street station to Clacton .
Det Insp Terry Pearce , of BTP , said : " This was a tragic and harrowing incident for everyone concerned .
" Level crossings can be very dangerous places and it is vital that members of the public use them in the correct way . "
Two girls died on a level crossing in December 2005 at Elsenham station in Essex and this prompted a safety review at locations where pedestrians cross the tracks .
Olivia Bazlinton , 14 , and Charlotte Thompson , 13 , died when they were hit by a train .
The Rail Safety and Standards Board report said the girls ignored crossing warnings and ran onto the tracks .

What are these ?
LAKE BUENA VISTA , Florida –
When images of a mysterious figure in a Disney theme - park attraction made their way online late last year , bloggers speculated that the unnamed geek in the garage was supposed to be either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak .
Instead , the scene that illustrates the birth of the personal computer in Epcot 's Spaceship Earth ride depicts neither :
It is intended to honor all those who worked in garages to fuel the technology revolution , according to the attraction 's designers .
" We all looked at that scene as an homage to ... the innovation ( that ) happened in garages in California , " Disney Imagineer and show writer Pam Fisher said , citing the humble roots of companies like Hewlett - Packard and Apple .
" There 's a lot of this notion of young people in Northern California ( working ) on kitchen tables , in garages , making the personal computer possible . "
When the attraction , which is housed in the Florida theme park 's iconic geodesic sphere , reopened for previews in December , the model in the garage scene was first identified by bloggers as one of Apple 's founders .
Theme park blog Lifthill noted that " the figure is dressed much like Wozniak was in a photo taken in the garage during the period , " following the distant creations blog 's suggestion that the figure " looks a whole lot like Apple founder Steve Jobs . "
The ride 's narrator , Judi Dench , does n't identify the specific figure .
Instead , the script she recorded refers to " a garage in California " in the 1970s , where " young people with a passion for shaping the future put the power of the computer in everyone 's hands . "
Computer History Museum curator Dag Spicer agrees that the figure is " a composite of several people and events rather than one specific person , " as it " has the build of Woz , ( such as a ) broad chest , but Jobs ' hair , hair color and sideburns . "
" This appears to be a visual reference to Apple 's founders , merged into one single , imaginary ur - founder , " he said in an e-mail message .
Although some speculated otherwise , the inclusion of the new scene has nothing to do with Jobs becoming a member of Disney 's board of directors following the 2006 sale of Pixar Animation Studios to Disney .
The refurbishment has been in development for at least two or three years , and as long as five , according to the company .
The new " scene was thought up long before the merger was , " Imagineer and show producer Bob Zalk said .
The cluttered workspace in the scene is also not Apple - specific , Spicer noticed , as " Microsoft is also referenced in the ' re - imagining ' of the classic early Microsoft company photo that appears on the wall in front of " the character .
The design was primarily determined by the available physical space , according to Disney .
" We basically designed this garage around the existing track , the best sight lines , what played best from the ride track , " Zalk said .
The scene was added , Disney 's Fisher said , because " the personal computer ranks right up there with the printing press and papyrus in terms of their power to exchange ideas .
With this new story of inventing the future , the computer was going to be a very big part of that story . "
The evocative and powerful " garage myth " has become embedded in our culture almost like an urban legend , said John Durant , director of the MIT Museum .
The true story of tech pioneers producing work " much cooler and much more powerful than the things the multinational corporations are capable of doing " recalls " David and Goliath , the little guy , without many resources except that he 's smart and entrepreneurial , " Durant said .
That contrast is demonstrated in the new Spaceship Earth scenes leading up to the garage .
A family that used to be watching Walt Disney on television is now tuned in to the moon landing , and that 's followed by a depiction of mainframe computers .
Both are connected to the garage scene by Dench 's conversational narration : " To send a man to the moon , we had to invent a new language , spoken not by man , but by computers .
At first very large , very expensive computers .
But we see the potential .
What if everyone could have one of these amazing computers in their own house ?
There 's just one problem – they 're as big as a house .
The solution comes in , of all places , a garage in California . "
The garage scene is just one of many changes to Spaceship Earth .
During the updated ride , visitors answer questions about their lives through their vehicle 's touch screen , and are then shown retro-futuristic animated versions of their future , with passengers ' photographs superimposed over animated characters ' faces .
Spaceship Earth is scheduled to officially reopen in late February .
White candidates should be barred from standing for Parliament in up to eight constituencies in order to get more black and Asian MPs elected , says a controversial report commissioned by Labour 's deputy leader , Harriet Harman .
Positive discrimination is illegal in the UK , but the report concludes that , without a change in the law allowing parties to impose all - black shortlists , it would take more than 75 years for Britain 's ethnic make - up to be fairly reflected at Westminster .
The findings come amid questions over Britain 's failure to develop a home - grown equivalent of Barack Obama , the black presidential hopeful .
Although there have been three black cabinet ministers since 1997 - Paul Boateng and Valerie Amos , both of whom have since moved on , and Baroness Scotland , the Attorney General - no politician of the stature of Obama , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice or her predecessor , Colin Powell , has emerged .
Harman is understood to be still considering the report 's findings in detail , but has expressed personal support for a change .
Simon Woolley of Operation Black Vote and the author of the review , said talented candidates were not ' getting past go ' at the moment .
' The change in the law is not a sledgehammer to crack a nut ; it 's not forcing parties to use all - black shortlists , ' he said .
' But unless we take positive action measures we are not going to have a representative democracy for more than 75 years .
It 's not that we do n't have Obamas , but we do n't have the mechanisms for them to see the light of day . '
His report is understood to conclude that all - black shortlists would be needed for two decades , after which talented candidates could be expected to make it on their own .
It identifies 100 constituencies with large ethnic minority communities as prime targets for shortlists , but concludes that positive discrimination would be needed in only four to eight of those seats for four elections in a row to ensure that the proportion of ethnic minority MPs matches the proportion in the population .
Woolley 's findings are likely to be controversial , with any proposal to change the law risking a rough ride in the Commons .
Last week , former minister Keith Vaz introduced a backbench bill proposing all - black shortlists , which was instantly condemned by Tory backbencher Philip Davies as ' politically correct ' and divisive .
However , Vaz is lobbying Harman for the measure to be included in a bill on equality issues later this year - meaning it could be on the statute book by 2009 .
' She is the person who has a huge history of supporting these issues , ' he added .
Woolley said that a change in the law could help the Tories by putting David Cameron 's A - List - a pool of candidates , many of them women or from ethnic minorities , singled out for the fast track to the irritation of some white men - on a firm legal footing .
His report was commissioned by Harman last autumn to examine the merits of positive discrimination .
Only 2 per cent of MPs are black or Asian , compared with more than 7 per cent of the general population .
Urban Geometry
Posted January 2008 .
The tradition of mathematical playfulness set in motion by Euler is still alive and well today ...

The geometry of urban services
Although we have moved from 2007 to 2008 , the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the birth of Leonard Euler ( born April 15 , 1707 ) is still in full swing .
Euler , in 1736 , created the field of graph theory with his famous paper in which he solved the Königsberg Bridge Problem .
In a nutshell , this problem posed the question of whether or not it was possible to design a tour of a certain collection of Königsberg 's bridges so that each bridge was traversed once and only once .
The first diagram below shows an historic map of Königsberg and the second diagram some of the bridges highlighted .
Figure 1
Figure 2
While at first glance what Euler did seems to be an elegant solution to a problem in recreational mathematics , it eventually opened the door to a wide variety of improved ways to provide a host of urban services such as : street sweeping , garbage collection , and snow removal .
Euler 's work is a gift of geometric insight into mathematics which eventually , in the hands of other clever people , evolved into a tool to make all of our lives better .
A graph theory primer
To solve the bridge problem we can , following in Euler 's footsteps , use a geometrical tool called a graph .
A graph is a diagram consisting of a finite number of dots called vertices , which are joined by a finite number of line segments ( which can be straight or curved ) called edges .
( Here we will not allow an edge to join a vertex to itself , just as a matter of convenience , but it is not difficult to modify our discussion to take into account the allowing of " loops . " )
Typically the dots represent a collection of objects , perhaps ATM machines , and two dots are joined by an edge if objects they represent obey some condition or property .
For example , in the case of ATM machines we might join two vertices representing ATM machines by an edge if it were possible to drive under 1 /2 mile to get between them .
To follow in the spirit of what Euler did , we can use a dot to represent a " land mass " and join two dots by an edge if the land masses they represent have bridges between them .
In the famous problem Euler attacked there were cases where two bridges connected the same land masses ( banks of the river or an island ) , so we use two edges to connect the dots in such a case .
The diagram below shows a graph theory model ( representation ) that can be used to analyze the problem Euler faced .
Figure 3
It is often convenient to gives names to the vertices ( and / or edges ) to help with describing what is going on .
The diagram below shows a labeling of the graph above .
Figure 4
The question that was posed to Euler , in more modern terms , was :
Is it possible to find a route which crosses each of the bridges in Königsberg once and only once ?
We will also require that the tour begin and end in the same place .
A version of this problem can be formulated in a much more tantalizing way as a problem about urban services .
Suppose we interpret the diagram in Figure 4 as a street network in an urban neighborhood , with a snow plow located at B .
Is it possible for the plow to traverse each street once and only once , returning to B ?
If such a tour for the snow plow exists , then we will call it an Eulerian circuit , in honor of Euler .
It is relatively easy by trial and error ( brute force ) to verify that this is not possible for the graph in Figure 4 .
However , Euler being the extraordinary mathematician that he was , did not only care about the particular problem for this graph .
He also wanted to know : Given a graph , when is it possible to find a route ( e.g. an Eulerian circuit ) which traverses each edge of the graph once and only once and starts and ends at the same vertex ?
To answer this question it is first helpful to have some additional terminology and insight into properties that different kinds of graphs can have or not have .
First , the graph in Figure 4 has 4 vertices and 7 edges .
However , unlike the graph in Figure 4 which has only one " piece , " the graph in Figure 5 has two pieces .
If a graph M has more than one piece , that means that there are two vertices in M such that it is not possible to move along edges to get between the two vertices .
We will say that a graph is connected if , given any two vertices in the graph , it is possible to move along edges of the graph to get between these vertices .
Figure 5
Another useful piece of information about a graph is to know for a particular vertex Q of the graph what is the number of edges that meet at vertex Q .
This number is called the valence or degree of the vertex .
The degree of vertex X is 3 and the degree of D is 3 , while the degree of vertex E is 4 .
As an example of a " puzzle " that these new ideas allow one to quickly formulate , the sequence of numbers below is a list of all of the valences of the vertices in Figure 5 .
4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 2
Can you find a connected graph with these valences ?
Here are three more puzzles in the same spirit .
Can you find a connected graph which has the valences shown for each sequence ?
6 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2
6 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2
7 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 1
( Can you find connected graphs which work for the sequences above if given any two vertices , there is at most one edge joining these two vertices ? )
One of the exciting aspects of mathematics , especially important mathematics , is how quickly one can get to " puzzles " based on easy - to - understand ideas and concepts .
The crux of mathematics is not its signature strange symbols but its ability to engage the mind with problems involving the search for patterns .
Sometimes it may not be apparent how to apply solutions of such puzzles to the world outside of mathematical investigation .
However , over and over again the " pure mathematics " of the past has become the " applicable mathematics " of today .
One fact about graphs is related to the puzzles above and was among the first facts about graphs that were discovered , in this case by Euler himself .
Since every edge has exactly two end points ( remember we are not allowing a vertex to be joined to itself by an edge ) , if we add up the degrees ( valences ) of all the vertices in a graph we must get an even number , and this number is twice the number of edges of the graph .
When we sum the valences of all of the vertices of a graph we count each edge twice , once at each of its endpoints .
We can state this as a theorem , and deduce a surprisingly useful corollary of this theorem :
Theorem :
The sum of the valences of the vertices of a graph is even and equals twice the number of edges .
Corollary :
The number of vertices of odd valence in a graph must be even .
Proof :
If there were an odd number of vertices of odd valence , then summing the valences of the vertices of the graph would give an odd number which contradicts the theorem .
You can verify that the graph in Figure 3 has four odd - valent vertices while the graph in Figure 5 has six odd - valent vertices .
Euler 's spectacular insight
Euler 's insight into the Königsberg Bridge Problem was to notice that not only is it not possible to find what has come to be known as an Eulerian circuit in the graph in Figure 3 , but he found an extremely simple condition that can be applied to any connected graph .
A graph is connected ( as mentioned above ) if it is possible to get between any two vertices of the graph by moving along the edges of the graph .
Suppose a graph has an odd - valent vertex , that is , a vertex at which an odd number of edges meet .
If this odd - valent vertex w is the initial vertex of an Eulerian circuit T which visits each edge once and only once , we are in trouble .
Every time we leave and reenter w in the tour T we use up a pair of edges .
Thus , if the valence of w is odd , we will leave w one more time than we are able to reenter it .
Thus , an odd - valent vertex can not be the initial vertex of an Eulerian circuit .
A very similar argument shows that if a vertex w is not the initial vertex of a tour visiting each edge of a graph once and only once , and returning to its starting point , then w can not be odd .
Again , the reason is that one must have entered such a vertex one more time than one left the vertex .
Hence , such a vertex would have to be odd - valent .
We have shown that in order for an Eulerian circuit to exist , a connected graph must have every vertex be of even valence .
If a graph is connected and even- valent , does it have an Eulerian circuit ?
There are numerous ways one can show that a graph will have an Eulerian circuit when the graph is connected and even- valent .
The process can be illustrated using the even- valent ( and connected ) graph in Figure 6 .
Figure 6
If a graph G has every vertex being even - valent , then G can be written as the disjoint union of ( simple ) circuits .
In the graph above , for example , the color - coded edges that form ( some of the ) circuits of the graph .
For example , d , e , f , g , h , d is a simple circuit ( in red ) while w , j , k , w is a simple circuit ( in green ) .
We can form an Eulerian circuit by piecing together these simple circuits : w , j , f , e , c , a , d , e , b , d , h , , g , f , h , i , j , k , w .
The circuits of different colors have been pieced together to form longer tours of edges at vertices that the circuits have in common .
( It is worth noting that usually a graph can be written as the union of circuits whose edge sets are disjoint in more than one way .
For example , in the graph above we could have used dbed and adhgfeca instead of adeca and bdhgfeb . )
Typically , there are many Eulerian circuits in a connected even - valent graph , which means in applied problems one can choose an Eulerian circuit that allows one to achieve some additional special goal .
An alternative approach to finding an Eulerian circuit is insightful in a different way .
Suppose one uses the wander at random rule T for traversing a graph which is connected and even - valent :
If one is at a vertex u , one can move on to another vertex along any edge that is present at u that has not already been traversed earlier in the tour .
If one applies this rule starting at w , and one can no longer apply the rule , where must one be ?
It is easy to see that one must be at w !
Suppose you are not at w but are at the vertex v .
It must be the case that you have entered v one more time than you were able to leave v.
Thus , v has odd valence , contrary to the assumption that the graph G has every vertex having even valence .
Hence , applying the wander at random rule returns one to w .
If the edges traversed include all the edges of G , we have an Eulerian circuit already .
If not , then there are even - valent sub - graphs of G that have not yet been traversed .
One of these pieces , because the original graph is connected , must have a vertex t in common with the tour which is being built up to an Euler circuit that has been constructed up to this point .
We can apply the wander at random rule starting at t to get edges of G that are used once and only once that return to t .
We can piece this partial tour with the previous tour to get a longer partial tour , or an Eulerian circuit .
Continuing in this way an Eulerian circuit is finally produced because a graph must have a finite number of vertices and edges .
The final result , inspired by Euler 's amazing start is :
A connected graph G has an Eulerian circuit if and only if G is even - valent .
As a theorem in mathematics , of interest for its own sake , this result has been extended in many directions .
One such relatively simple direction is to consider tours that traverse each edge of a connected graph once and only once but begin and end at different vertices .
Here is the result for this situation :
A connected graph G has a tour that starts at vertex v and ends at vertex w where v and w are different vertices of G if and only if the valence of v and w are odd and the valence of all the other vertices of G is even .
This result can be proven by using the previous result for Eulerian circuits .
Thus , for example , if G has a tour from u to w ( distinct vertices ) such that each edge is traversed once and only once , then if we add an additional edge e to G which joins u to w , we can now find an Eulerian circuit which starts and ends at u using the additional new edge .
Thus , this graph must be connected and even- valent , which means that the original graph must have had exactly two odd - valent vertices ( and been connected ) before the edge e was added to G !
Our motivation in looking at Euler circuits was to be able to provide urban services such as street sweeping , snow removal , mail delivery and garbage collection in an efficient manner .
However , we now see that many situations , when the graph to be traversed has odd - valent vertices , can not be handled as ideally as we would like .
However , people will still want their snow removed , so we have to find a better way of thinking of the applied situation .
When one uses mathematics to solve an applied problem , one has to check that the proposed insight that mathematics provides is robust enough for general circumstances .
Here , when a graph G has an Eulerian circuit , that is , G is connected and even- valent , then one can get a wonderfully efficient solution .
One never has to do any unnecessary work .
However , when the graph is not even - valent , what does one do ?
We have to modify our goal to be more realistic .
Obviously , if one is collecting garbage , removing snow , or sweeping the streets , one can not achieve " efficiency " at the expense of not providing the underlying urban service for some customers .
Thus , one will have to do some " needless " work in order to guarantee that all customers get served .
If the graph model for providing the urban services is not even - valent , we will have to repeat some of the edges of the graph even when no work is being done when we retraverse an edge , which represents some section of street or highway .
It should be clear that when edges have different lengths ( traversal times ) , there may be situations where retraversing more edges with lower cost will be better than retraversing fewer edges with high costs of retraversal .
For the moment , let us assume that the time ( or cost ) to traverse each edge of a graph is the same .
( There are some situations where this is actually realistic . )
In this case , what we want to find is a route that starts and ends at the same place and traverses each edge of the graph at least once and which repeats a minimum number of edges .
For example , in the graph below ( Figure 7 ) we see that the graph has no Eulerian circuit because it is not even - valent .
Figure 7
Suppose we duplicate existing edges in this graph in such a manner as to make the resulting graph even - valent .
The graph with the duplicated edges will have an Eulerian circuit and we can interpret moving along a duplicated edge as retraversing an edge in the original graph .
These retraversals are sometimes referred to as deadheads since no work is being done during the second traversal .
Might it be necessary to retraverse some edge more than twice in achieving the minimum repetition route ?
A moment 's thought will show that if , say , 3 repeats were necessary to make the ends of edge e even - valent when they started as odd - valent , we could leave off two repeats , getting down to 1 repeat , and still have the ends of e even - valent .
In the graph below the blue edges show those that correspond to duplicated edges .
Figure 8
Finding an Eulerian circuit in the graph where the blue edges are duplicated results in a route which retraverses 4 edges .
However , there is a route that retraverses only three edges .
Figure 9
Is it possible to get an efficient algorithm for finding which edges to duplicate in order to get a route which repeats as few edges as possible ?
We can start to see what is involved by considering the graph below :
Figure 10
Since this graph has exactly two odd - valent vertices , those with the labels 0 and 7 , we need to duplicate the edges on some path from vertex 0 to vertex 7 .
However , there are many such paths .
Which one should be chosen ?
If all of the edges have the same weight , then to find a minimum cost tour we need to find a shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 7 .
In this graph , the shortest path from 0 to 7 has length 3 and there are several such paths .
If there were weights on the edges , we would need an algorithm for finding the shortest weight path between 0 and 7 .
Chinese postman problem
Our improved model , which goes beyond the analysis of Euler and yet involves ideas concerning Eulerian circuits , is often referred to as the Chinese postman problem .
The reason for this is that at the surprisingly recent date of 1962 , the Chinese mathematician Meigu Guan ( also often known as Mei- Ko Kwan ) raised issues related to efficient urban service in a paper published in Chinese .
The general solution of this problem for undirected graphs where weights were assigned to the edges of the graphs required sophisticated work .
Here , I will try only to suggest the flavor of what is involved and give the idea of what is going on for a simple example .
Given an ( undirected ) connected graph G with an even number of vertices , a perfect matching for the graph is a collection of disjoint edges which includes all of the vertices of the graph .
For example , the graph below has several perfect matchings , though all of them must contain the edge joining vertices 6 and 7 .
Figure 11
Not all graphs which have an even number of vertices have perfect matchings , even when there are other conditions such as having each vertex have valence 3 ; however , we are not particularly interested in the existence questions for matchings .
In the particular graphs that concern us such perfect matchings will always exist .
More specifically , we are concerned with having a complete graph with an even number of vertices , a graph where every pair of vertices are joined by exactly one edge , and with weights ( usually positive ) on the edges .
We want to find a perfect matching such that the sum of the weights of the edges in the matching is a minimum over all perfect matchings .
To give you the flavor of what is involved , suppose we have a graph with exactly four odd - valent vertices .
Unlike the analysis we were able to make when we had exactly 2 odd - valent vertices , the complexity of matters grows rapidly here .
If we have general weights on the edges , and even if we do not , we need to know how to duplicate existing edges to minimize the cost of the edges that we duplicate .
To do this we need to know the length in terms of weight ( not number of edges , in the case where the edges can have different weights ) between pairs of odd - valent vertices .
Mathematicians and computer scientists have developed efficient algorithms for various kinds of shortest path problems .
For example , one might want to find the shortest path between one vertex and many other vertices in a weighted graph .
A generalization is to find an efficient algorithm for the shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a weighted graph .
( If all of the vertices of a graph are odd - valent , then to solve the Chinese postman problem this would be required . )
One breakthrough result here was the work of Edsger Dijkstra , a physicist who became a pioneer of computer science .
One of Dijkstra 's important contributions was to developing shortest path algorithms for graphs .
( A recent application of shortest path algorithms is in the software that is used in many automobiles to provide directions for drivers to get from one location to another as quickly as possible . )
We can record the information about the shortest paths between the four vertices involved ( the four odd - valent vertices ) either in a 4x4 matrix ( table ) or along the edges of a complete graph on 4 vertices , as shown below .
Figure 12
By trial and error it is easy to see that there are three different perfect matchings in this graph : 7 + 17 ; 10 + 16 ; 11 + 14 .
The minimum sum corresponds to repeating the edges on a shortest path from A to C and from B to D .
Putting the germs of the ideas laid down here to find practical , rigorous and computationally efficient algorithms for the Chinese postman problem is no easy task .
The task was achieved by work due to Jack Edmonds and to the joint work ( 1973 ) of Jack Edmonds and Ellis Johnson .

Although the work of Edmonds and Johnson gives rise to a polynomial time algorithm for solving the general Chinese postman problem , many new developments were set in motion by their work .
In particular , practical versions of Chinese postman problems are modeled not only by undirected graphs with weights but also call for " directed " graph models where there are directed edges ( each edge has an arrow on it , corresponding to , say , a certain road that only allows one - way traffic ) .
Sometimes it is natural to use a network ( graph ) where some of the edges are directed and some are undirected .
A somewhat unexpected development was that the undirected and directed network cases of the Chinese postman problem have polynomial time algorithms , while the mixed Chinese postman problem ( directed and undirected edges are allowed ) has been shown to be NP - complete .
( This means that there is no known polynomial time algorithm for this problem , nor a proof that the only way to solve the problem will require an exponential time algorithm . )
The work of Edmonds and Johnson still inspires workers to find variant models for the Chinese postman problem with additional conditions , specialized algorithms which can be shown to be better for special classes of weighted graphs , and new applications of the older ideas , all having been inspired by a problem in recreational mathematics of Leonhard Euler !
The tradition of mathematical playfulness set in motion by Euler is still alive and well today .
Mathematical puzzles beget new mathematics , applications of mathematics , and in turn new mathematical puzzles to stimulate and amaze us , in a never ending progression .

The Great Credit Card Debate was launched when I challenged Ana at Debt Free Revolution to a credit card match .
I love credit cards , so much so , that I have 89 accounts .
Ana hates them !
Others have even noticed our opposing views , most recently highlighted by Father Sez .
Ana ’s official stance is on Ways Credit Card Companies Separate You From Your Money .
However , Ana could n’t wait and got started early in Dirty Credit Card Company Tricks .
I countered with reason number 1 ( you wo n’t lose money if you lose your credit card ) .
Here ’s 25 more reasons to love credit cards :
Earn cashback and rewards .
We earn between 2 % - 5 % cashback on all our purchases on our credit card .
It ’s like buying everything on sale !
Here ’s a list of some of the best cash rewards credit cards .
Make money on balance transfers .
Credit card arbitrage is profitable .
Credit cards frequently offer balance transfers at 0 % .
Leverage it by transferring this money to a high yield interest account .
We ’re able to make over $ 11,000 per year using this strategy .
Rent a car .
Some car rental companies will not allow a rental without a credit card .
My in - laws do n’t use a credit card and were turned away from a car rental company in Houston .
The policy varies depending on the company , but I would n’t want to be standing at a rental car company unable to get a car .
Make online purchases .
Try asking Amazon if they take cash !
Float .
A great thing about using credit is just that … you are purchasing on credit and the payment is n’t due until a month later .
That leaves the money in the checking account for an extra month to earn interest .
Raise your credit scores .
Most credit scores have a mix of business component that gives you points for holding a credit card .
In addition , using it responsibly can help boost your score .
Corporate reimbursements .
If you have expenses for work using a credit card is the only way to go .
Not only do you get to earn rewards but you do n’t have to pay the bill until later , giving you time to get your expense report turned in and paid .
Post bail .
As I already mentioned in the roundup last week Five Cent Nickel shared with us that you can now use a credit card to post bail .
Take advantage of affiliate offers .
Recently American Express hosted it ’s wishlist for customers and partnered with Etrade for a signup bonus ( now expired ) .
Fraud Protection .
The companies call you when they see unusual spending patterns .
It ’s a great feature .
When a charge does get through you can always do a dispute .
I ’ve done one a couple times at different companies .
All painless processes and the charges were removed .
Limits on fraud .
If a charge does go through , you will never be responsible for more than $ 50 .
Convenience at gas stations .
With sleeping kids in carseats it ’s much easier to pay at the pump than to have to run in and pay cash .
Check in quickly at the airport .
We fly Northwest a lot and they have a convenient kiosk that can read your name off your credit card to speed up your check - in .
Get coupons .
Being a cardholder gets you on the mailing list for coupons at some stores .
We get Macy ’s coupons all the time which I ’ve found you can sell on eBay and make even more money .
Shop for others .
Credit cards work well when you want to buy things on behalf of other people .
I can purchase things for my mom using her credit card .
Pay negative ATM fees .
When out to lunch with friends , charge the bill and have them pay you in cash .
Earning those reward dollars on other peoples ’ money is like getting paid to go to the ATM !
Try out purchases .
You do n’t need to front the money for items that will be returned .
For example , if I need to purchase two shirts for one of my boys because I ’m not sure which one will fit better , I can purchase both on credit and return one later .
As long as the credit posts before the statement closing date it ’s essentially a try - before - you - buy program .
Deposits .
I remember that many places that we worked with during our wedding wanted a deposit .
With a credit card they can place a temporary charge eliminating the need to come up with money that will later be returned .
Buy a car .
Thinking of financing another item ?
Lower your interest rate using creative debt reduction strategies .
Access to emergency money .
Have you ever been caught when an ATM was down ?
If the bank is closed for a holiday or if the ACH feature is unexpectedly down at a bank ( which was the case at one of our banks recently ) a credit card can come in handy to make a purchase .
Documentation .
Credit card statements are handy little records of your purchases .
Qualify for better rates and services .
Our local credit union has tiers of service depending on how many qualifying services you have .
A credit card counts as a service and adding it to our package qualifies us for higher interest on deposits and less fees for other services .
Billpay features .
Our FIA Card Services card has a great billpay program that gives you the ability to pay other cards and reoccurring bills .
This enables us to simplify and organize our finances .
No more cash discounts .
It violates the terms of service for Mastercard and Visa , therefore there is no longer a monetary benefit to using cash that once existed .
My dad got one .
My dad does n’t use a computer , does n’t email and does n’t believe in credit cards .
I was pretty sure he would be the last person on earth to get a credit card .
If he got one , then they must have something good to offer !
Of course , I ’m not saying credit cards are perfect .
Occasionally they make mistakes but they do get fixed .
This does happen with any company though ( I have many more errors on our cell phone bill but that ’s another story ) .
Patrick at Cash Money Life debated Ana previously .
Patrick had some additional points including short term loans and extended warranties .
In addition , Ana challenged him to go three months without using a credit card .
Whoa !
I hope that is n’t in store for this debate ….
credit cards are making us way to much money for me to give them up .
Action Plan
Your financial goals likely involve money : making it , saving it , investing it , and enjoying it .
Credit cards can be used to help meet those goals .
Why not use them ?
Add your comments here and at Debt Free Revolution .
If you have a blog , join the debate and let us know why you love or hate credit cards !
The Great Credit Card Debate Continues ….
This is really unbelievable .
Today ’s NY Times tells us the McCain campaign “ stepped up its criticism of Mr. Obama ” on the issue of campaign finance .
Seriously , how can the NY Times or any publication even listen to the McCain campaign when it is in the midst of breaking the campaign finance laws ?
McCain is scamming the system but has the audacity to attack Obama .
Even worse , the so - called brain trust of campaign finance advocates are focused on Obama ’s “ commitment ” to campaign finance .
So McCain is breaking the law .
Obama is not only adhering to the law , he wo n’t take PAC money or contributions from lobbyists .
But the concern is Obama of Joan Claybrook and Fred Wertheimer .
It ’s bizarro world . :
“ You ought to be able to run a campaign for two months on $ 85 million , ” said Joan Claybrook , president of Public Citizen , which lobbies for stricter campaign finance laws .
She called Mr. Obama ’s recent remarks “ a very bad signal . ”
“ This whole idea started with Senator Obama , and we think he and whoever the Republican nominee is ought to follow through , ” said Fred Wertheimer , founder of the advocacy group Democracy 21 .
Um , Joan , “ a very bad signal ” is breaking the campaign finance law .
That ’s what your champion , John McCain , is doing .
He is making a mockery of the system .
Obama ’s campaign should n’t listen for a second to any of these campaign finance types now .
By ignoring the McCain scandal , they ’ve lost any credibility .
Noam Scheiber at The Plank explains the situation pretty succinctly in his post , “ McCain May Be Screwed ” :

Kudos to Dan Abrams .
If he is sincere he is golden .
I hesitate and use " if " because I have become shell shocked after 12 years of republican fascism .
I hope he is a true light to all the republicans I hope exist still who will not stand for the downfall of America and replacing it with Amurka .

I ’ve been following Ian Lance Taylor ’s updates on the status of gold , the new binutils linker , for a while , so when he announced that he ’d added it to the binutils tree , I decided to make a little time to try it out .
I have a fairly large C++ application handy , so I tried linking it on my dual core Thinkpad with 2GB of memory , running Fedora 8 .
When I compile this application with debugging symbols enabled , it ’s not exactly fast to link : it takes about a minute .
Because the amount of data the linker has to chew through is impressively large , the actual time varies by up to 20 % from one run to the next : all of those object files do n’t fit into memory at once .
This also has the unpleasant effect of paging out parts of apps I ’m trying to use , such as Emacs and Firefox .
Hmph .
In this situation , gold does indeed improve linking performance , bringing the linking time down to about 40 seconds .
The poor laptop ’s disk still spends a lot of this time grinding away due to the sheer volume of data , so once again the number is n’t very repeatable .
To eliminate the effect of memory pressure , I used “ strip - g ” to drop the debug information from the main app ’s object files .
( The libraries it links against still contain debug info , but they ’re much smaller than the app itself . )
Stripping the object files speeds up the regular binutils linker by a factor of four , reducing linking time to 14 seconds .
The laptop ’s disk is no longer being touched .
I can still edit text files after a link without big initial stutters .
Whew !
When I switched to using gold as the linker , I was at first a little surprised to find that it actually works at all .
This is n’t especially common for a complicated program that ’s just been committed to a source tree .
Better yet , it ’s as fast as Ian claims : my app now links in 2.6 seconds , almost 5.4 times faster than with the old binutils linker !
When I ran “ ld –help ” , I noticed the tantalising options “ –threads ” and “ –thread - count ” , so I tried those .
It turns out that thread support is not enabled by default : I reconfigured , rebuilt , and tried again .
Running with “ –thread - count 2 ″ , the linking time drops slightly , to 2.3 seconds : that ’s nearly 6.1 times faster than before .
Does the application actually work when linked by gold ?
Yes , so far with no signs of problems .
It ’s about 3 % larger than the version produced by the old linker .
I have n’t looked into why this might be .
Is gold ready for prime time ?
It ’s not too far off .
It does n’t support the – build - id flag , which my copy of gcc 4.3 is convinced it wants ( perhaps because I ’m running Fedora ) .
It does n’t link the Linux kernel properly , because the kernel tortures the linker in twisted and innovative ways .
Also , I have run into a few non-reproducible crashes when running in threaded mode , such as the following :
internal error in find_runnable_or_wait , at ../../gold/workqueue.cc:262
Overall , though , I ’m very impressed , and I ’m looking forward to the point where gold entirely supplants the existing binutils linker .
I expect that wo n’t take too long , once Mozilla and KDE developers find out about the performance boost .
Great work , Ian !
How Myspace Was Born Posted on 20/2/08
I was working on some myspace - related stuff today which required me to draw the infamous photo of Tom , Myspace 's founder .
I got a little creative with it and decided to create the above webcomic .
We all know myspace is terrible , so I 'll spare you a lengthy blog post about all the things that are wrong with that abomination they call a website .
Instead , I 'll talk about designer stuff .
I 'm trying to get better at using simple lines and shapes to represent things visually .
With Fireworks
I 'm at a slight disadvantage because I can't simulate pressure when drawing with the pen tool , so I have to kind of hack it and manually draw thicker lines where needed .
Normally , when a line simulates pressure it gets thicker around curves in the same way that a pen would .
Photoshop and Illustrator both have this feature , and if I 'm serious about doing more of this type of design I really need to get on the bandwagon and start using Illustrator full - time .
I was particularly happy with Tom 's head and face .
It still looks like Tom , but also has a happy - go - lucky 1950 's illustration feel to it :
The UPS guy delivered my Sinulator the morning of the day I was giving a party .
I signed , sent him on his way and returned to my preparations .
It was n't until hours later , draped around the room with about 20 friends , that I remembered my new toy .
The Sinulator is a device that lets you connect a sex toy to your computer so that other people can control it for you over the internet .
After announcing to the room that I had one of these , I really had no choice but to open the box and pass the thing around .
If you 've ever been to a baby shower , you 're familiar with the " oooohs " and " aaaaahs " that ensued .
We were all impressed with the surprisingly substantial vibrator , which features rotating plastic pearls in the shaft and a vibrating bunny for external stimulation .
Also , it 's pink .
Here 's how it works .
Your Sinulator package includes the transmitter , a vibrator and a receiver .
You download the client application from Sinulator.com .
During installation , you connect the transmitter to a USB port .
( If you use Windows XP , make sure to read the installation note in the user guide and save yourself some frustration . )
When you 're all installed and have the client running , you attach your toy to the wireless receiver and switch it on .
Finally , you go to Sinulator.com and choose a name for your toy .
After that , anyone who knows your toy 's name can set your toy a - buzzin ' using the Sinulator control panel .
Neither of you has to register or divulge any personal information – not even an e-mail address .
The control panel looks like a grown - up version of a driving toy for baby , with buttons and levers and sliders that you manipulate with your mouse .
I laughed when I first saw it – now you can have sex and drive a race car at the same time !
If that 's not a popular male fantasy , I do n't know what is .
But it gets even better .
You probably want to stick to the dashboard if you 're at the office , but for home use , the Interactive Fleshlight is where it 's at .
The Fleshlight is a standard , sleeve - style vibrator for men , with a twist :
It 's also a transmitter .
It measures the speed and force of each thrust and communicates those metrics to the software , which translates them into vibration and pulse on the other end .
In other words , a man can be thrusting in Cleveland while a woman is penetrated in Seattle , and the cybersex experience gets one step closer to the holodeck .
In part , cybersex appeals to women because it takes place in writing .
The attention , the wordplay , the sensual imagery of great cybersex attracts us because it requires both parties to be present and to communicate .
It 's like starring in your own erotic story .
Even when you add the visual excitement of a webcam , you can't tune out and get a woman off in cybersex .
The Sinulator relies on communication , too .
The better you communicate , the better your Sinulator experience will be .
Just watching my vibrator propel itself across my desk onto the floor was enough to tell me that anyone who wants to spend time with me is going to have to use the Jackhammer button sparingly , or it 's going to be over real quick .
( You can set local overrides , so no matter what the other guy does , the vibrator wo n't exceed the intensity levels you set .
But we do n't have to tell him that , now , do we ? )
Like with real sex , you can thrust too hard or too fast , or finish too soon , or not finish at all .
You can leave each other hanging or draw the experience out as long as you can stand it .
If you 're on your own , you can log on to SinulatorCams and pay to play .
Cybersex gets blamed for a lot of things , including social isolation , infidelity and divorce .
It 's a temptation previous generations of lovers did n't have to face , and it 's technology , and therefore it 's scary for a lot of folks .
Yet remote interaction technology – or , as I like to call it , teledildonics – has as much potential to bring people together as it does to drive people apart .
If you travel often , or if you 're in a long - distance relationship , this technology provides another avenue for intimacy , especially if it 's harder for you to use toys with a partner than have sex au naturel .
( More on that in a future column . )
As for me , well , I 'm enjoying the novelty of it .
I'm on the road as I write this week 's column , and I can honestly say that the Sinulator beats the pocket rocket hands down , even if I am getting strange looks from the other Starbucks patrons .

US war veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have announced they ’re planning to descend on Washington , DC this March to testify about war crimes they committed or personally witnessed in Iraq .
" The war in Iraq is not covered to its potential because of how dangerous it is for reporters to cover it , " said Liam Madden , a former Marine and member of the group Iraq Veterans Against the War .
" That ’s left a lot of misconceptions in the minds of the American public about what the true nature of military occupation looks like . "
Iraq Veterans Against the War argues that well - publicized incidents of American brutality like the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the massacre of an entire family of Iraqis in the town of Haditha are not the isolated incidents perpetrated by " a few bad apples , " as many politicians and military leaders have claimed .
They are part of a pattern , the group says , of " an increasingly bloody occupation . "
" This is our generation getting to tell history , " Madden told OneWorld , " to ensure that the actual history gets told  that it ’s not a sugar - coated , diluted version of what actually happened . "
Iraq Veterans Against the War is calling the gathering a " Winter Soldier , " named after a similar event organized by Vietnam veterans in 1971 .
In 1971 , over 100 members of Vietnam Veterans Against the War gathered in Detroit to share their stories with America .
Atrocities like the My Lai massacre had ignited popular opposition to the war , but political and military leaders insisted that such crimes were isolated exceptions .
" Initially even the My Lai massacre was denied , " notes Gerald Nicosia , whose book Home to War provides the most exhaustive history of the Vietnam veterans ’ movement .
" The US military has traditionally denied these accusations based on the fact that ‘ this is a crazy soldier ’ or ‘ this is a malcontent ’  that you ca n’t trust this person .
And that is the reason that Vietnam Veterans Against the War did this unified presentation in Detroit in 1971 .
" They brought together their bonafides and wore their medals and showed it was more than one or two or three malcontents .
It was medal - winning , honored soldiers  veterans in a group verifying what each other said to try to convince people that these charges cannot be denied .
That people are doing these things as a matter of policy . "
Nicosia says the 1971 " Winter Soldier " was roundly ignored by the mainstream media , but that it made an indelible imprint on those who were there .
Among those in attendance was 27 - year - old Navy Lieutenant John Kerry , who had served on a Swift Boat in Vietnam .
Three months after the hearings , Nicosia notes , Kerry took his case to Congress and spoke before a jammed Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Television cameras lined the walls , and veterans packed the seats .
" Many very highly decorated veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia , " Kerry told the Committee , describing the events of the " Winter Soldier " gathering .
" It is impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit  the emotions in the room , and the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam .
They relived the absolute horror of what this country , in a sense , made them do . "
In one of the most famous antiwar speeches of the era , Kerry concluded : " Someone has to die so that President Nixon wo n’t be  and these are his words  ‘ the first President to lose a war ’ .
We are asking Americans to think about that , because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam ?
How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake ? "
Nicosia says Americans and veterans find themselves in a similar situation today .
" The majority of the American people are very dissatisfied with the Iraq war now and would be happy to get out of it .
But Americans are bred deep into their psyches to think of America as a good country and , I think , much harder than just the hurdle of getting troops out of Iraq , is to get Americans to realize the terrible things we do in the name of the United States . "

One of Britain 's most important informers inside the IRA has warned new agents who are asked to penetrate terrorist organisations to ensure that they get a contract from their handlers to secure their future .
Hunted for the last 25 years by ex-comrades in the Derry IRA , Raymond Gilmour suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder and a heart condition .
Now virtually penniless and cut off by his former handlers , Gilmour spoke to The Observer this weekend about his sense of betrayal and the need for future agents to ensure that they are looked after for the rest of their lives .
Speaking from a secret location in England , Gilmour said : ' If I was a young kid , say from the Muslim community in Britain , thinking of working for the state inside one of the Islamic terrorist groups I would make sure I obtained a contract .
I would ask for a legal document ensuring that , given the risks I was about to take , the state looked after me for the rest of my life .
Because what happened to me would discourage anyone from signing up as an agent . '
From the age of 16 , Gilmour served the state as an informer , first inside the Derry Brigade of the Irish National Liberation Army and later the Provisional IRA in the same city .
In 1983 he gave evidence against dozens of alleged Derry IRA members as a supergrass , although the courts later dismissed his testimony as unreliable .
The RUC Special Branch officer who recruited him , Alan Barker , wrote in his memoir Shadows that Gilmour was arguably the most important informer the security forces ran inside the IRA within Derry .
Living under a false identity for 25 years and cut off permanently from his large family back in Derry , Gilmour contacted The Observer because ' I feel an enormous sense of betrayal by some of those I worked for ' .
He said : ' The people I have dealt with over the last few years I assume are from MI5 , and they basically do n't give a shit about me .
A couple of years ago they stopped paying for a psychiatrist whom I had been seeing for nine years , a counsellor that helped me deal with the flashbacks and the post - traumatic stress I have had to suffer .
' I feel as if I 've been discarded .
As well as the mental anguish , I have a serious heart condition and underwent major heart surgery a few years ago .
I live on £ 177 per fortnight and I am only 47 .
' Even my old RUC contacts have stopped returning calls .
It 's as if I have been blackballed .
You risk your life to stop others getting murdered and maimed , but in the end you are forgotten about .
You are an embarrassment from the past ; you are no longer useful .
' I always thought that , once my career as an agent was over , I would be looked after for the rest of my life .
I was an agent of the state , but the state does n't want to know .
That is a dangerous thing for the recruitment of future agents .
Anyone thinking of infiltrating or working on the inside to bring down terrorist organisations should get it nailed down , on paper , legally binding , that they will receive a pension long after they have retired from this deadly game . '
Like many of the Irish republican informers who worked for Britain , Gilmour has suffered from depression , ill - health and alcoholism .
' You have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life .
There are times when I have been on holiday abroad where I have panicked , sensing that I saw old IRA men I worked with .
It never goes away and no matter what people in Sinn Féin say , about informers being safe to go home , that is a lot of rubbish .
' Having said all that , I have absolutely no regrets about undermining the INLA and the IRA in Derry .
They were murderers and they had to be stopped .
There are dozens upon dozens of people in Northern Ireland today who are alive because of what I and other agents did .
That was why it was worth all the hassle and the danger - lives were saved , they were stopped . '
However , the former supergrass said he was prepared to ' fade away ' if the security services help him out .
' I am not asking for a house , all I want is a pension .
But when I first started spying on the INLA , and later the IRA , I honestly believed that one day the Queen would give me a medal . '
" Five fascists in Tennessee were caught on tape openly torturing a
guy to sign a " consent " form to let them search his home without a
warrant .
They wanted to catch him selling drugs , but did n't want to
bother with all that constitutional stuff of getting a warrant .
Luckily , before leaving the home so the fascists could
" interrogate " the guy , his wife left an audio recorder running .
As
a result , five fascists are now doing time .
Okay , so what can we learn from this ?
Well , for starters , the
police are not our friends .
( Some of us already knew that . )
And
they could n't care less about the constitution , individual rights ,
or any of that stuff .
They are , in every sense of the term ,
fascists .
They believe that it 's just fine to physically TORTURE
someone into signing a form saying the guy " consents " to having his
home searched .
By the way , consider how weird this is : the guy was
tortured BECAUSE we have a Constitution .
They really wanted his
" consent " so they could get around the Fourth Amendment .
If not for
that amendment , they would n't have needed to torture him to get his
" consent . "
How ironic .
The story ought to infuriate anyone with a shred of humanity .
How
many cops do this who AREN 'T caught on tape ?
Plenty .
How do I know
that ?
Well , how many people get struck by lightning ?
Several
hundred every year .
And how many get caught on tape ?
I 've never
seen one , though they may be out there .
Cameras are n't always
running in all places , so if something DOES get caught on tape ,
especially more than once , it 's a safe bet that it happens a LOT
when tape is n't rolling .
To think that police abuse is rare , and
that by blind luck the bad apples HAPPEN to get caught on tape , is
naive , in addition to being statistically clueless .
If it happens
once on tape , it most likely happened a hundred times NOT on tape .
( Thankfully , the advent of handheld cameras is starting to prove
that , by giving us a seemingly endless supply of evidence of police
abuse and brutality . )
So , are you infuriated enough ?
Well , try this .
The sentences of the
five fascists caught torturing , and threatening to kill someone , in
order to coerce him into surrendering his constitutional rights ,
ranged from just over four years to six years .
What do you think
you would get if you tortured a cop ?
You 'd get dead .
That 's what
you 'd get .
I know people who got longer sentences than those
fascists for not sending a piece of paper to the IRS .
Still think
" justice " is what your government is all about ?
This ought to be a rude awakening for the American people -- though
it probably wo n't be .
Why not ?
Well , that 's where the second rude
awakening comes in .
The story described above happened YEARS ago ,
and the mainstream media did n't think it was worth telling you
about .
( I only just heard about it myself . )
Heck , it 's even on
Wikipedia , as you can see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Eugene_Siler
So we live in a fascist police state which will never do more than
give a slap on the wrist to anyone in their club of Nazis , even
when they get caught TORTURING and threatening to MURDER someone ,
while the mainstream media intentionally covers it up .
But do n't
point that out , or you 'll be labeled a paranoid fringe kook -- like
all those silly people who said bad things about the Nazi party
when it was taking over Germany . "

The federal investigation into the firing of nine U.S. attorneys could jolt the political landscape ahead of the November elections , according to several people close to the inquiry .
Washington ’s attention has been diverted from the scandal since the August resignation of Alberto Gonzales as attorney general , and has focused instead on Democrats ’ efforts to hold White House officials in contempt for ignoring congressional subpoenas to testify on Capitol Hill about the firings .
But recent behind - the - scenes activity in several investigations suggests that the issue that roiled Congress in 2007 could re-emerge in the heat of the election year .
Two inquiries by the House and Senate ethics committees are examining whether several congressional Republicans , including one running for the Senate this year , improperly interfered with investigations .
Â As potent as the congressional probes might be , they appear to be far narrower than a sprawling inquiry launched by the Justice Department ’s Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) and the Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) .

Paul E. Singer is the founding partner of one of the oldest hedge funds around .
And while he has become a major donor to Republican and conservative causes in recent years , he has largely managed to stay out of the limelight , even avoiding having his picture appear in newspapers .
But this year Mr. Singer became one of the biggest supporters of Rudolph W. Giuliani ’s presidential campaign , making his jet available to Mr. Giuliani , while Mr. Singer and workers at his companies have donated $ 200,000 to the campaign .
And he became the largest individual backer of a California ballot initiative that many Democrats believe could sink their chances of winning the presidency .
Suddenly , the normally low - profile Mr. Singer , a New Yorker , found himself singled out by Democrats intent on beating back the California effort before it gained any steam .
Howard Dean , the chairman of the Democratic Party , questioned “ Paul Singer ’s involvement in this dirty trick aimed at stealing the White House . ”
A group of Democrats filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission charging that Mr. Singer had been acting on behalf of Mr. Giuliani in his efforts to change the California law — which Mr. Singer and the campaign deny .
And the Democratic National Committee drew attention to the part of Mr. Singer ’s business that involves buying the debt of poor countries at a discount and then seeking repayment in full — prompting an article in The Times of London labeling his firm , Elliott Associates , a “ vulture fund . ”
The FCC does n't look interested in regulating cable more heavily after all , despite pressure from Chairman Kevin Martin .
Today 's open meeting , at which an important FCC finding on the cable industry was to have been considered , has been delayed indefinitely , and Martin 's plan to bring cable to heel may have backfired .
Martin wants increased control over the cable industry , and he is trying to get it by invoking something called the " 70/70 rule " from a 1984 cable bill .
That law says that the FCC has broad authority over the cable companies should they ever pass more than 70 percent of all US households , and should more than 70 percent of those households actually subscribe to cable .
No one doubts that the first threshold has been reached , but there is substantial uncertainty about the second one .
Martin has been the driving force behind an FCC finding that was to have been considered this morning .
That finding would state that cable had in fact exceeded both thresholds , opening the door to possible à la carte regulations and certain kinds of price controls .
Martin has already led the charge to abolish exclusive contracts between cable operators and apartment buildings .
But Martin's own Republican colleagues were n't sold on the idea .
Commissioners Tate and McDowell generally vote along strong free market and deregulatory lines , and neither was pleased with Martin 's attempt at more regulation .
Two weeks ago , the two commissioners sent a joint letter ( PDF ) to one of the research companies that provided some of the FCC data , expressing concern about the " trustworthiness , truthfulness , and viability " of the data in question .
Congress has also been applying pressure on the Commission , most of it negative .
The issue is that estimates of cable uptake range from 58 percent to 71.4 percent , so Martin 's finding would have sided with the highest possible number .
With the two Democrats also reluctant to take action on the issue , an FCC meeting this morning was delayed several hours , then into the afternoon .
Late this evening , the FCC finally announced the results : because the 70/70 threshold was disputed , the Commission would not find that it had been exceeded .
Instead , the FCC opted to collect more data , and it directed the cable operators to provide it with accurate customer data under penalty of perjury .
When that information is available in several months , the issue will be revisited .
Commissioner Adelstein , who had previously expressed his own skepticism about some of the numbers used to justify Martin 's proposed finding , took the opportunity to sound off on the way the matter had been handled .
" Unfortunately , the most important data we have -- the FCC 's own numbers -- were suppressed from the Commissioners until the last minute .
I did not learn until after 7:00 pm last night that the FCC's own 2006 survey found that only 54 percent of homes passed subscribe to cable .
Similarly , the FCC 's cable price survey came in at 55.2 percent penetration .
Based on these newly unearthed facts and the conflicting evidence on the record , I am unable to support afinding that 70 percent of homes passed subscribe to cableat this time .
The data is inconclusive . "
Martin used his own late - night statement to talk about the numbers as well , and he argued that the highest number ( 71.4 percent ) from Warren Communications News was the most accurate .
Still , he pronounced himself " pleased " at the decision not to use Warren data in the future .
" While I would have been comfortable relying on the data submitted by Warren , " he wrote , " I am pleased that we have determined to avoid the debate in the future about which sources of data are the most accurate and will now receive data from the companies themselves . "
Feb. 1 , 2008  --
Although the Bush administration calls it a vital weapon against terrorism , its domestic wiretapping effort could become a devastating tool for terrorists if hacked or penetrated from inside , according to a new article by a group of America 's top computer security experts .
The administration has said little about the program except to defend it against charges it amounts to illegal spying on U.S. citizens .
When news of the program broke in 2006 , then - White House spokesman Scott McClellan called the program a " limited " effort " targeted at al Qaeda communications coming into or going out of the United States . "
But documents submitted in an ongoing court case indicate the program involves data centers at major telecommunications hubs that siphon off and analyze billions of bytes of Americans ' emails , phone calls and other data .
By diverting the flow of so much domestic data into a few massive pools , the administration may have " [ built ] for its opponents something that would be too expensive for them to build for themselves , " say the authors : " a system that lets them see the U.S. 's intelligence interests ...[ and ] that might be turned " to exploit conversations and information useful for plotting an attack on the United States .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred a request for comment on the article to the interagency National Counterterrorism Center , which directed calls to the National Security Agency , which reportedly runs the program .
The NSA declined to comment for this story .
The White House referred calls to the NSA .
The article , slated to appear in an upcoming issue of the journal IEEE Security & Privacy , was written by six experts from Sun Microsystems , Columbia University , Princeton University , the University of Pennsylvania and California - based research giant SRI International .
The data centers for the classified program are reportedly housed in " secure " rooms within telecommunications hubs around the country , and connect to operations buried within the NSA 's highly classified facilities .
But judging by past breaches , the authors conclude this system could be compromised also – from within or outside .
In 2004 , hackers cracked a wiretapping function on a Greek national cell phone network .
For 10 months , they intercepted conversations by the country 's prime minister and its ministers of defense , foreign affairs and justice , and roughly 100 other officials and parliament members , the authors note .
The hackers were never caught .
" Although the NSA has extensive experience in building surveillance systems , that does not mean things cannot go wrong , " the authors state .
" When you build a system to spy on yourself , you entail an awesome risk . "
Just as dangerous is the possibility that an insider could access the system undetected , according to the experts .
Poorly - designed surveillance technology used by the FBI relies on a " primitive " system to track people who use the operation to wiretap phone conversations , the authors say , creating what they call a " real risk " of an insider attack .
They note that convicted spy Robert Hanssen , one of the most destructive moles in the bureau 's history , exploited similar weaknesses to steal information and follow the investigation into himself on FBI computers without leaving a trail .
Last August , a federal judge ruled the program was unconstitutional .
The administration is appealing the decision .
The Senate is currently considering a White House - backed effort to retroactively immunize telecommunications companies which have participated in the program from civil suits , several of which have been filed since the program came to light .
The legislation , the authors say , would allow the program to continue without ensuring proper oversight , accountability and security , creating " a long - term risk . "

Peak
Oil is a large and scary concept to get one 's mind around .
If there are arguments around the water cooler about finite resources , large depletion rates , Peak everything , etc. , there are probably cognitive biases underlying these polarized opinions .
In the first two parts of this series , we looked at some of the factual reasons why people disagree on the timing and importance of Peak Oil : gross versus net oil production , better technology vs depletion , productive capacity vs flow rates , differing definitions of " Peak " , etc .
This post will address some social and psychological reasons why the urgency of our energy situation may not be being addressed on an individual level and only at a snails pace on the governmental level .
Among the phenomena we will explore are a ) why we have beliefs and how they are changed , b ) our propensity to believe in authority figures , c ) our penchant for optimism , d ) cognitive load theory , e ) relative fitness , f ) the recency effect , and several others .
The fact is , even if the world 's energy data was transparent and freely available to everyone , it would be an open question whether people would agree on any near term action to mitigate future oil scarcity .
This post is a first stab at examining our cognitive belief biases .
It 's long , but I believe it will be well worth your time to read .
( Note - This is an updated version of a post that first ran in May . )
Our societal infrastructure was built with and expected to continue on cheap liquid fuels .
This fixed infrastructure coupled with a pretty much insatiable human demand drive for energy services may result in a once - in - a - species crisis if our planetary resource and ecosystems can no longer keep pace .
But Peak
Oil ultimately is not about geology or technology .
At its core it is a human problem .
Our collective cognitive belief systems and the resulting behaviours they engender will play pivotal roles in our failure or success in mitigating and adapting to the vast challenges of both Peak Oil and Climate Change .
This post will outline many of the behavioral tendencies we can expect to encounter as we attempt timely and logical solutions to declines in per capita energy availability .
It will explore how we process new information and culminate in an examination of our belief systems themselves .
As in my recent posts , I preface this one with a discussion I recently had with my Wall St. friend Thomas , ( who fittingly has still ' not had time ' to read the oildrum story on steep discount rates ) :
N : Thomas -
I 'm writing another story for theoildrum.com and would like your comments since you seem to represent the ' non - believer camp ' .
T : It 's not that I do n't believe that oil will peak someday - it 's just that the doom and gloom people are always wrong - somehow something will come along and in 5 years you 'll say " well , how could I have known about ' XXX ' ?
No one knows the future - including you Nate .
N : I 've never said when Peak Oil would be , only that it would eventually mean the end of economic growth as we know it - and that technology and capital can't ' create ' energy .
The market will be too late to react to the signals once they come .
The asset allocators on Wall St have used a formula for the 70 years of stock market history based on cheap oil and high energy gain .
That era is over - new rules or maybe a new game .
T : No offense buddy - I know you 're very intelligent .
But there are thousands of smart people on Wall St and elsewhere analyzing data - do n't you think it 's a little odd that YOUR opinion is the right one over all those people whose full time jobs it is to pore over oil demand and supply figures ?
N : Well , when put like that it always shakes my confidence , but I do believe the street is missing the main tenets of Peak oil - that environmental limits and declining net energy will overtake conventional market and technology solutions .
And by the way - there ARE a lot of analysts talking about Peak and its implications - the new GAO report on Peak Oil came out last week and pointed out how unprepared we are ..
T : Now you trust what the Government is saying ?
You used to say the government energy forecasts were terrible and we should n't believe in them - now they write something that fits your position and you use it for support ?
N : Were you always this argumentative ?
Wait - do n't answer that - I 've known you since grad school .
Can you honestly say that you 've read things on theoildrum and other sources for objective information on this topic ?
T : I have 3 kids and work 60 hour weeks so I choose how to spend my reading time .
Can you say YOU'VE read all the research saying we have plenty of oil until at least 2040 after which there will be plenty of substitutes ?
You should talk to some of my biofuel entrepreneur friends - they are telling my 10:1 energy return on cellulosic within 3 years .
N : I 've started from scratch 3 or 4 times on the core Peak Oil tenets , thinking I might have something very wrong , but I 've been over it enough to unfortunately feel pretty confident I 'm right , though less certain on the timing of rationing , etc .
T : Nate , I should n't tell you this but our asset management arm is in the top 10 in the world in terms of assets and do you know what our number one position is ?
N : Starbucks ?
T : No .
We 're short oil futures .
We think its going back to $ 40 well before it goes to $ 100 .
( ED NOTE :
This piece originally ran in May 2007 , when oil was $ 65 .
It subsequently went to $ 145 . )
N : Thomas this is all besides the point .
I 'm not predicting what will happen in the next 3 months or next 3 years - what I 'm saying is that very soon , in our lifetimes , energy is going to be scarce and cause ripple effects we cant even imagine .
The bullish supply forecasts either siphon that ' energy gain ' from other economic sectors via inflation or by robbing it from the environment via water and ecosystem depletion and increased GHGs .
T : Whatever .
And even if you 're right .
We 're here to live life .
I 'm not going to sit around waiting for ' the next big change ' when I can enjoy life with my kids and live large .
I work hard you know .
N : Actually you 're a grifter .
But you 're still my friend , even though you 're closed minded at times .
Later .
The above discussion is in many respects a synopsis of this post - that despite facts , we exhibit certain cognitive biases that prevent us from acting on complex or frightening subjects outside of our day to day realities .
What follows below is a brief overview of 10 cognitive phenomenon that may inhibit wider understanding and action on oil depletion .
( Caveat - Neuroscience is a complex and growing field that has many valuable contributions to offer .
In discussing human tendencies for various behaviours , I am of course generalizing , as are most of the scientific studies - when I say ' people value the present more than the future ' , I make that claim in the same vein that ' men are taller than women ( on average ) ' )
DENIAL / COGNITIVE DISSONANCE
Denial is a defense mechanism where a person is faced with a fact that is too painful to accept and rejects it instead , insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming evidence .
A related psychological concept is that of cognitive dissonance , originally coined by social psychologist Leon Festinger .
Cognitive dissonance describes the negative tension that results from having two conflicting thoughts at the same time , or from engaging in behavior that conflicts with one 's beliefs .
From Wikipedia ,
" The theory of cognitive dissonance states that contradicting cognitions serve as a driving force that compels the mind to acquire or invent new thoughts or beliefs , or to modify existing beliefs , so as to reduce the amount of dissonance ( conflict ) between cognitions .
Experiments have attempted to quantify this hypothetical drive .
Some of these have examined how beliefs often change to match behavior when beliefs and behavior are in conflict . "
Jared Diamond , in " Collapse " quotes the behaviour of people living below a dam that may break :
" “ Consider a narrow river valley below a high dam , such that if the dam burst , the resulting flood of water would drown people for a considerable distance downstream .
When attitude pollsters ask people downstream of the dam how concerned they are about the dam ’s bursting , it ’s not surprising that fear of a dam burst is lowest far downstream , and increases among residents increasingly close to the dam .
Surprisingly , though , after you get to just a few miles below the dam , where fear of the dam ’s breaking is found to be the highest , the concern then falls off to zero as you approach closer to the dam !
That is , the people living immediately under the dam , the ones most certain to be drowned in a dam burst , profess unconcern .
That ’s because of psychological denial : the only way of preserving one ’s sanity while looking up every day at the dam is to deny the possibility that it could burst .
If something that you perceive arouses in you a painful emotion , you may subconsciously suppress or deny your perception in order to avoid the unbearable pain , even though the practical results of ignoring your perception may prove ultimately disastrous .
The emotions most often responsible are terror , anxiety , and grief . ”
Peak
Oil is potentially a world - sized dam break .
It 's no wonder initial reactions to hearing how the world we know might change are met with skepticism .
( Note : interestingly , and something I intend to explore on a subsequent post , is the concept of denial is related to the study of addiction . )
COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY
" Chocolate Cake ? " " or Fruit Salad ? "
Cognitive load theory suggests humans have a maximum capacity of working memory .
At around 7 ' chunks ' of information , our working memory maxes out and we can't accept anything else without losing some of the previous ' chunks ' .
Try remembering the following numbers 1-9-1-4-7-6-7-5-9 - 5 - 9 .
Its quite hard to do .
But if they are rearranged in chunks 1-914-767-5959 , it becomes much more manageable .
Numerous studies have measured this phenomenon - a notable study by Shiv and Fedhorkhin ( 1 ) asked a group of people to memorize a two digit number , walk down a corridor and at the end choose a dessert - either chocolate cake or fruit salad .
A different sample of people were then asked to memorize a 7 digit number and walk down the corridor ( while internally reciting this 7 digit number ) and also choose a dessert .
When required to memorize the 7 digit number , almost twice as many people chose the chocolate cake as in the sample only memorizing the 2 digit number - the implication being - 'my short term memory is full - I cant access my rational , long term decision - making hardware - just give me the damn cake ' .
Of course , in a society with cell phones , taxi-cabs , internet , coffee , soccer practice , Grays Anatomy , corporate ladders and a plethora of other chocolate cake - like stimuli , meaningful contemplation and education about oil depletion and the environment usually represents the fruit salad .
Many people are just too cognitively taxed to take on much more .
RECENCY EFFECT
Cognitive psychologists have recognized that people tend to overweight the most recent data and stimuli they receive in their decision - making processes .
A possible reason for the recency effect is that these items still linger in working memory when recall is solicited .
This recency effect has two important relationships to the peak oil and global warming issues .
First , we collectively assume that today will be much like yesterday and tomorrow will be like today - grocery stores chock full of oil - subsidized tasty treats , gas stations with cheap and easy fill - ups , and a plethora of novel entertainment and diversion options preclude our mind from thinking tomorrow will be any different .
Second , in the various campaigns to educate and inform the public and policymakers on the dangers of oil depletion , any ' recent ' optimistic piece in the mainstream media that dismisses Peak Oil has a tendency to mentally ' overwrite ' some of the prior Peak Oil education one might have achieved .
Part of the reason I looked into research on the recency effect is that I noticed myself yo - yo- ing on peak oil and climate change depending on who I talked to or what I 'd seen .
I started to notice a pattern that my ' belief ' was highly correlated to whatever I 'd read or whoever I 'd spoken to most recently .
Since there are so many unknowns on both topics , to hear demonstrative language from confident sources does a lot to sway one 's opinion , until and if one has time to methodically explore the arguments during subsequent individual research .
I am not a climate expert but do know enough to believe global warming is being anthropogenically influenced and is of at least moderate concern .
As a graduate student under Robert Costanza , a scientist very concerned about climate change , I felt almost embarrassed after viewing The Great Global Warming Swindle .
Even though I recognized a few factual mistakes , the rhetoric and confident tone in the movie pulled me in - the general tenor made me feel that climate change is relatively benign and concerns about it are overblown .
That is , until the next morning when I got a series of emails from my professors about its content after which my opinion completely flip - flopped again .
I expect this is a common experience .
The central issues of climate change and oil decline are so broad and complex that both science and advocacy fall victim to the recency effect .
Advertisers however , must be aware that the recency effect is both valid and powerful , otherwise we would have long ago decided on which product is superior between Miller and Budweiser on the facts alone .
STEEP DISCOUNT RATES
" The rational vs emotional discount rate "
As discussed in a recent oildrum post , we have evolved neural mechanisms to steeply favor the present over the future ( measured by what economists call ‘ discount rates ’ ) , and modern OECD culture exacerbates this trait .
The higher the rate , the more one is ' addicted ' to the present moment .
Lower discount rates suggest more control of the neocortex in subverting mammalian impulses of ' living for the moment ' .
Different products are discounted at differing rates .
Different subsets of people ( drug addicts , young people , gamblers , men , risk - takers , low math scorers , alcohol drinkers , etc ) have steeper discount rates - are less able to act for the future and are easier pulled in by short term desires .
( 2) Steep discount rates work backwards as well - the oil crises and gas lines in the 1970s are like stories in the history books - nothing that carries too much emotional weight in the present - its almost as if our action and motivation triggers are like one of those maps that show the areas of daylight , only caring about the areas that are lit up - the dark areas are too far beyond our ken .
We have evolved to have instant access to our emotional minds in times of stress or danger - a million years ago too much rational thought would have essentially been suicidal .
Oil depletion , climate change and loss of planetary ecosystems are long lead time problems .
As such , information leading us to believe a peak in global oil production is either a ) no big deal or b ) beyond 2030 is essentially not ' received ' by our emotional minds .
The average person and politician will process such information as a free pass to continue the business as usual path .
This is especially true if the assessment comes from a confident , respected , mainstream source ( such as CERA ) , because it trickles down through corporate hierarchical society .
Collectively it will be difficult to act until these issues become ' in the moment ' too .
BELIEF IN AUTHORITY FIGURES
" I have it from high authority that there is plenty of Oil Resource "
theoildrum.com contributor says " Net energy to fall - society needs to change ' metrics of success ' quickly "
Think about your initial reaction to the above two assertions .
Depending on your walk of life , your gut reaction and thought process might differ .
However , science ( and history ) has shown that humans have a propensity to be externally validated - we believe in and follow instructions from confident authority figures .
Though theoildrum.com contributor is clearly confident , he certainly is not an authority figure , at least outside pike fishing circles .
The Pope however , influences billions .
With few exceptions , most voices advocating immediate steps for mitigating peak oil are not what society would perceive as ' authority figures ' .
But what if the tables were reversed ?
NEWS FLASH ---“ EXXON - MOBIL SAYS THE WORLD HAS PASSED PEAK OIL – THEOILDRUM .COM SAYS NOT TIL 2030 ”
Imagine if that headline ran through the media around the country .
Corporate leaders would hold emergency meetings on how to lock in prices or even supplies .
( Some might liquidate their 401 ks and not even show up ) … .
Politicians would be on television urging people to wear sweaters or even winter coats ….
A gasoline tax would be quickly implemented ….
Purchases of wind turbines and solar panels would soar …
Tuna and chocolate hoarding ... Cats living with dogs – real Old Testament stuff .
However , the situation is precisely opposite that .
Astute , reasoned analysis by concerned individuals gets easily drowned out by rhetorical op - ed pieces in respected newspapers .
Portrayal of concern for peak oil as a ' chicken little ' , ' Cassandra ' and ' boy who cried wolf ' phenomenon by a credible news source effectively erases what nagging concern or belief about oil depletion someone had started to foment .
Sociology recognizes that we have a propensity to believe in authority figures .
Though the why of this is yet to be sussed out , Richard Dawkins believes it is an adaptive byproduct of children who unquestioningly followed adult instructions during the thousands of generations of our ancestral environment .
(3) Presumably , the penchant for adults to easily believe things that are confidently told to them is a carryover from the children who did NOT eat the berries , touch the snake , or swim over a waterfall – these children survived to have children of their own .
Social psychologist Robert Cialdini has written a book related to this phenomenon , on how certain people can have outsized influence on others using certain authoritative tactics .
( I wonder aloud if Messrs .
Jackson and Yergin own copies )
Irrespective of its origins and as uncomfortable as it sounds , we DO inherently believe in authority figures , as the famous and controversial Milgram experiments evidenced .
65 % of volunteers delivered what they thought were fatal doses of 450 volt electric shocks to human subjects while being calmly assured to continue by the experiment ' administrators ' ( doctors in lab coats ) .
The other 35 % of participants still delivered high voltage shocks to the point of unconsciousness but refused to administer the ' highest level ' shocks .
Interestingly , none of these 35 % insisted that the experiment itself be terminated , nor left the room to check that the victim was O.K. without first asking for permission .
So much for independent thinking .
In interviews prior to the experiment respondents predicted that only the most ' sadistic ' 1.2 % of participants would be willing to hurt another participant with electric shocks , yet 100 % of the participants DID administer the shocks .
The power of authority figures is indeed strong .
To be honest , when preparing this post , I read and reread CERAs analyses and interviews – the recency effect combined with the utter confident tone they were written in made me ( again ) question that maybe I have this all wrong – that we have smooth sailing until 2030 .
But , after some malted milk balls and a quick review of my colleagues work , which at a minimum shows CERA does not incorporate net energy , understand Hubbert Linearization or include environmental externalities , Peak Oil again had me very worried .
RISK AVERSION
Risk aversion is a financial and psychological concept that posits consumers ( people ) prefer a certain but possibly lower payoff than an uncertain but possibly higher payoff .
With respect to Peak Oil , there is such a societal Sunk Cost that even if the average person or politician is on board with the understanding of fossil fuel depletion , the risk of stepping outside the warm cocoon of modern grid - connected energy intensive society can be emotionally daunting .
Too , there are n't too many blazed paths as of yet illustrating exactly what one person or family can and should do to adapt .
Our society is SO dependent on oil that most alternatives are too risky for the average family to pursue .
Or at least that may be the perception .
RELATIVE FITNESS
My Dad is stronger than your Dad .
And Peak
Oil is not a ' theory ' buddy
As evidenced by the size difference between males and females ( sexual dimorphism ) , our species is midway between a tournament species and a pair bond species .
This is suggestive that in our evolutionary past , selection pressures for male / male competition at least partially contributed to higher mating success ( though not as much as in sea lions ) .
The advent of language in tribal living expanded the scope of reputation and its influence on mating competition .
An individuals comments , actions and opinions thus contributed to increasing or decreasing his status within the tribe .
One could argue that a good part of human communication is concerned with getting other people to think , behave and believe as we do .
At the same time , those others are trying to get us to behave and believe like they do – it ’s the culmination of our biological and political ( social ) heritage .
This concept has many demand side implications for Peak Oil not the least of which will be some variant of resource grab when per capita liquid fuel availability declines .
But it also plays a large role in peoples differing and sometime entrenched viewpoints on the topic of Peak Oil , irrespective of their future actions .
My friend Thomas has a career in finance - his income is dependent on his clients buying stocks , which are in turn dependent on the economy growing .
He has 3 children and a huge house full of gadgets and requires alot of fuel to continue his planned trajectory ( though he admits he could be happier on much less ) .
A Peak Oil world as I 've painted it could be perceived as a threat to him , his family and his lifestyle .
For him to accept my worldview is in some ways admitting that his own life is built around the wrong premises .
Similarly , if our current Disneyland culture continues to extract resources and environmental costs and the day of reckoning comes well beyond my lifetime , perhaps I have wasted some of my time on this planet unnecessarily calling attention to what I view as urgent risks associated with net energy decline and human social traps .
Oh , How sweet it is to hear ones own convictions from another 's lips .
- Goethe ( 1749 - 1832 )
Some who are very vocal about the urgency of Peak Oil will take a ' perceived fitness hit ' if information comes to light that delays or moderates the impact of a peak and decline in world oil supply .
Similarly , those who think we have plenty of oil production and flow capacity for the next 20 - 30 years will look foolish ( e.g damage their reputation leading to a ' perceived ' drop in fitness status ) , if it turns out we never see 90 million bpd and have 5 % annual depletion rates beginning in a few years .
In truth , for many the facts are mostly irrelevant - their belief systems are relatively immutable and new facts coming to light that support their convictions are viewed as ' victories ' even if they add pain to the world as a whole .
Similarly , new facts contrary to their beliefs are perceived as ' failures ' and are responded to defensively .
Curiously , it puts certain people , myself included , in a position of cognitive dissonance - I sincerely hope society manages to amass an armory of silver BBs and reduces consumption enough so that Peak Oil is a seamless transition to a sustainable future , but if that happens , most everything Ive written about in the past few years will have been incorrect .
( But maybe I impacted the experiment ... ;)
Those oildrum.com readers who 've participated in these forums for some time now are especially aware that certain people seem to be ' rooting ' for peak oil and an end to the current capitalist consumptive system .
I believe at least part of this is even though post peak oil they will have less ' absolute fitness ' , their ' relative fitness ' , compared to Joe-Mortgage - Trader - Millionaire - Next - Door , will increase .
In the end , we are wired to respond to relative fitness .
BELIEF IN OPTIMISM
People vocal about the risks of Peak Oil are often viewed as pessimists , though I suppose they prefer the word ' realists ' .
We are taught from an early age to ' look at the bright side ' and ' every cloud has a silver lining ' .
Humans do in fact have a penchant for optimism , and this sets up for an immediate bout of cognitive dissonance when discussions of peak oil nasties are undertaken .
Individuals have a tendency to be overly optimistic , and therefore naturally discount ' pessimistic ' viewpoints and worldviews .
Adults are particularly vulnerable to self - deception when comparing their own intelligence and attractiveness to others .
(5) Research has shown that we systematically exaggerate our chances of success , believing that we are more competent and more in control than we really are .
88 % of people think they are better drivers than average .
94 % of professors believe they are better at their jobs than the average professor , etc .
( By definition , almost half of those surveyed are ' overly optimistic ' . )
There are good neural explanations for being optimistic .
Even if the pessimistic view may be the more accurate , the stress of incorporating the particular negativity into ones worldview releases a cascade of stress - activated hormones that can seriously compromise a persons health .
(6) In addition , pessimism can lead to depression , which suppresses the normal functioning of important neurotransmitters such as serotonin , which in turn can lead to reduced physical activity , mood swings , and a number of other physical symptoms and diseases .
Optimistic attitudes also reduce secretion of cortisol , a stress hormone that inhibits the immune system , as well as produce more helper T - cells ( 4 ) .
The placebo effect is a well known but little understood medical phenomenon that improves patients physical response with no actual medication .
In depression patients , placebos increase wellbeing by an average of 30 - 50 % .
Apparently , when we ' think ' positively that something is helping us medically - even if its a sugar pill , it ' works ' .
We are now seeing that the brain is helping this healing to occur through a different neurotransmitter mix .
" Peak Oil - Glass Half Full or Half - Empty ? "
An optimistic outlook actually is neurochemically self - fulfilling .
Optimism leads to increased frontal cortical activity which itself is a strong predictor of idea generation , positive emotion and overall liveliness of thought .
Similarly , sadness is marked by decreased activity in the frontal cortex , which has the negative side affect of reducing the number of overall thoughts and ideas produced .
Cognitive neuroscientist Antonio Damasio points out that our brain exaggerates reality - when the glass is half full - the brain adds a little more for zest - when the glass is half empty , the brain subtracts some and things seem worse than they really are .
Being introduced to peak oil can be quite a shock .
Its tough to be cheerful about the facts and implications about oil depletion , though ultimately we definitely could ( and should ) be happier with less energy .
But initiation to the concept of upcoming shrinkage of the lifeblood of society can easily cause internal conflict in a species obviously wired to gravitate towards optimism .
GROUP THINK / HERD MENTALITY
We originated in tribal settings where consensus was important .
Consensus building and group projects are taught and experienced in our culture from an early age - though in an era facing true scientific problems , the warm fuzzy group decisions can backfire .
One famous example of ' Groupthink ' was the Bay of Pigs invasion , where President Kennedys key advisors had serious misgivings about the strategy , but in group strategy sessions refused to speak up for fear of disrupting the seemingly overwhelming consensus .
The invasion went so badly that the President specifically ordered his staff to speak up and offer dissenting opinions in future discussions , an order that may have averted a war during the Cuban missile crisis .
As most media is quick to dismiss Peak Oil , our nation could use another such warning against ' groupthink ' .
" Monkey - see - activate mirror neuron Monkey - do "
There is comfort in the herd .
The recent discovery of mirror neurons helps explain why our brains are prone to absorb the beliefs and behaviours of others .
Neurobiologically , when we see someone performing an action , whether it is a yawn , a smile or eating an ice cream cone , unique parts of our brains respond in the same way as if we were performing the action ourselves .

Homo Sapiens See - Homo Sapiens Do .
Interestingly , USC neuroscientists ( Arbib and Rizzolatti ) are suggesting that the origin of language began as facial expressions and hand gestures - these communication tools , along with actual speech , are regulated by Brocas area , a small knob found in the left hemisphere of the cortex .
As we will see below this has important implications .
BELIEF IN MAGIC , MYSTICISM , CORRELATION , ETC .
( AS OPPOSED TO SCIENTIFIC METHOD )
Knowledge is a disposition to behave that is constantly subject to corrective modification and updating by experience , while belief is a disposition to behave that is resistant to correction by experience .
Eichenbaum , Howard – Boston University ( 5 )
The previous nine points were tenderizer for the meat of the article to follow .
If you 've read this far you 're either unemployed , retired , a psychologist , a blood relative , my girlfriend or someone on the edge of a paradigm shift .
Thank you in any case .
The difficult transition to a lower energy gain society by definition has a ' best path ' .
Also by definition we wo n't ever know what that path is , or at least until well into the future .
How we collectively assimilate beliefs , attitudes , science and policy will be the key determinant in how we sink or swim with the Peak Oil tide .
Unfortunately , we have baggage .
So far we 've looked at our propensity to believe in authority , optimism , recent events , group behaviour , etc .
Taken together , these leanings might suggest that we have some sort of pre-packaged neural software for abstract systems of ' belief ' .
In truth , we actually have no choice BUT to believe .
From the moment of birth we depend on others to instruct us about the world .
While young , we are given a specific language , a specific religion , a smattering of science and history and all the while we implicitly assume we are learning facts about the world .
But we are not .
We are simply being told what to believe .
Though this is of course practical , it has resulted in 6.5 billion different ( but overlapping ) belief systems , somewhat modifiable as we grow up but increasingly less malleable as we get older .
What is a belief ?
As defined by the Oxford English Dictionary , ‘ belief ’ is : 1 . A feeling that something exists or is true , especially one without proof .
2 . A firmly held opinion
3 . Trust or confidence in .
4. Religious faith .
The English word ' belief ' originated in the twelfth century , as an adaptation of the German word gilouben , which means ' to love ' or ' to hold dear ' .
It was first used in association with religious doctrines referring to one 's trust and faith in God - faith rather than fact being the operative word , as this particular type of belief cannot be tested by the rigorous proofs developed by science .
What is the Scientific Method ?
a. Observe some aspect of the universe .
b. Invent a theory that is consistent with what you have observed .
c. Use the theory to make predictions .
d. Test ( attempt to falsify ) those predictions by experiments or further observations .
e. Modify the theory in the light of your results .
f. loop back to " c " above for another test . ( 8 )
Famed scientist Richard Feynman offers an excellent description of ' good science ' vs. ' cargo cult science ' here .
At the cottage where I write this , there is the unmistakable sound of sandhill cranes calling for mates - when I first heard it I had no idea what it was .
The fourth time I heard it I was with my father who identified it as a mating pair of sandhill cranes .
The 10th time I heard it I witnessed the actual cranes by a pond .
Mentally , my brain created a hypothesis and eventually ‘ tested ’ it to be ' true ' .
A certain sound represents sand hill cranes mating .
Our ancestors discovered all they needed to know about the natural world in a process something like this one .
However , many stimuli in our society are much less clear cut .
If I see a blue BMW sedan with an attractive blonde in the passenger side 2 or 3 times in a week , my mind will naturally extrapolate the ' ownership of a blue BMW ' as a signal of successful male competition , when there could be myriad other explanations for the womans presence ( the mans personality , his looks , his intelligence , his sister etc )
The fact that he owned that particular car could have been completely random - yet my brain observed this pattern and extrapolated it forward .
" An early hominid couple , forming beliefs . . "
During the 2 million + years of hominid brain growth and development , the environment was roughly constant – in most cases for at least for thousands of years at a time .
Here we developed ‘ pattern - recognition ’ systems of beliefs , the precursors of what economists today call ‘ correlation ’ .
The human brain was exquisitely designed to favor correlation over causation .
We did not evolve mechanisms to follow regimens like the scientific method because our species would have been systematically snuffed out by predators on the african savannah and a different species might be facing oil depletion .
Our neural architecture was being built to adhere to correlations we observed in everyday life , because in these stable environmental timeframes , most correlations DID lead to causations .
The periods of largest brain size increase in hominids were probably when some tribal leaders got good at noticing patterns and successfully made tools , or repeated routines that added fitness - these genes and thought processes then multiplied .
" The human mind evolved to believe in gods ...
Acceptance of the supernatural conveyed a great advantage throughout prehistory , when the brain was evolving .
Thus it is in sharp contrast to [ science ] which was developed as a product of the modern age and is not underwritten by genetic algorithms . "
The Biological Basis of Morality , E.O. Wilson
Our stimuli laden modern world presents us with millions of small sample size events that offer our built - in pattern recognition systems plenty of fodder for creating ' beliefs ' in situations where the scientific method never comes into play .
Our pattern recognition system is essentially misfiring in a world of too many patterns – “ NFC wins Superbowl and stock market goes up " ( I had clients investing on that one ) – “ I ca n’t date guys who are Virgos ” – ‘ Walk under a ladder with a black cat and get really bad luck ’ –‘ Your second Chakra looks a little weak today ’
‘ The market will solve it ’ etc .
We unknowingly conflate correlation with causation , a danger that is learned to be avoided early on in the career of a scientist .
And overriding it all is the theme of relative fitness where we attempt to justify , through social persuasion , that our ' patterns ' are the correct ones .
The upshot of this tendency is that charisma , rhetoric , advocacy , and politics can all too easily trump the scientific method , just when our species will need it most to tackle climate change and the attempted transition to renewables .
( Note : Scientists are humans too , and are not immune to these neural processes – clearly when they write and publish they are accessing the rational neocortex gray matter and take their time to get facts and figures right – but in everyday communication – once emotion gets involved , the built - in genetic priorities fall back on belief systems . )
Our individual constructs of reality are based on beliefs - some beliefs are changed by new information , reflection , and analysis - others are virtually immutable .
( Though my friend Thomas has a decent ' factual ' understanding of Peak Oil - he may never incorporate it in the larger sense into his belief system . )
From recent results of research into brain injury along with those from experiments on animals , we have begun to chart the neural processes active in distinguishing emotions , fantasies and facts .
With fMRI and PET scans we can watch as a priest prays or a monk meditates or even when a person encounters new information that is discrepant with a prior held belief .
On brain scans , meditative and transcendent states are in many ways similar to when a person experiences pleasures from sex , music or a good meal .
(4 ) The very concept of the peaking and subsequent decline of oil - a vital resource to our lives that may become less and less available is a very difficult one to understand let alone accept .
The ' knowledge ' we obtain from scientific research on energy largely depends on how our brains interpret the evidence .
These interpretations are subject to the same rules that govern our perceptions of reality - they are replete with generalizations , assumptions , misunderstandings and mistakes .
By the time newly acquired knowledge reaches consciousness , each of us transforms it into something that fits with our own unique worldview .
This process of reconstructing reality is the foundation from which we build all of our beliefs about our world .
( 4 )
But sometimes , reality is not reality , even to ourselves .
Our time bomb is mysticism .
It 's delivery system is language .
And it 's hiding place ?
The unfathomable coils of our DNA .
Reg Morrison The Spirit in the Gene(9 )
And finally we come to what ( for me ) is the most fascinating piece of the human neural puzzle .
In the discount rate post last month , I pointed out that we have developed a ‘ triune brain ’ , with the 3 layers representing the 3 main periods of our organismal development ( reptilian , mammalian , neocortex regions largely corresponding to primitive , emotional and rational thought ) .
However , the neocortex itself is split into two hemispheres , the left and right , separated by a thin straplike connector called the corpus callosum .
Neurobiologist Roger Sperry states that patients who have the corpus callosum removed ( split - brain patients ) behave as if they have ‘ two separate minds , two separate spheres of consciousness … in regards to cognition , volition , learning and memory . ’
Only our left brain hemisphere has a ‘ voice ’ for communicating with others – emanating from ' Brocas area ’ , the speech control center of our brains .
Any findings and opinions analyzed by the perceptive and intuitive right hemisphere must first travel through the left hemisphere before leaving our mouths as communication .
If you ’ve been following along , you might see how this might relate to Peak oil or climate change .
There are fascinating experiments done on split brain patients - one of note was a brain experiment by Michael Gazzaniga at Dartmouth , a patient with his corpus callosum removed , was shown two large pictures – in front of the left eye – some snow – in front of the right eye , a picture of a bird ’s foot .
Beneath each image were a series of smaller images , only one of which was related to the image above .
When asked to point to the picture below that was linked to the birds foot , the right hand ( left brain ) correctly pointed to an image of a chicken .
Similarly , the left hand ( right brain ) correctly chose an image of a shovel to relate to the larger snow image .
When asked to explain the decisions , the verbally controlling left hemisphere offered the obvious explanation linking its own choice of a chicken to a bird ’s foot .
HOWEVER , when asked why the left hand ( right brain ) had chosen the shovel ( for the snow scene ) , the left brain replied that the shovel had been selected for cleaning out the chicken shed !
Though our brains are not privy to their own internal workings , the left brain should have admitted it did not know why the right brain chose the shovel because it had never seen the snow scene –but instead it fabricated an answer to fit its own part of the story .

Though most of us fortunately still have our corpus calllosums intact , new research is suggestive that the socially conforming and editing power of our left brains is powerful when dealing with pre-existing or strongly held beliefs , such as ' we have plenty of oil ' , or ' the market will find a solution ' .
Thus , in addition to being marketed during the waking hours by Madison Avenue , we are being marketed ' 24 - 7 ' , by ourselves .
Reg Morrison succinctly concludes the following :
“ It seems our loquacious left brain cannot abide a vacuum .
As it ghostwrites our right - brain narrative , it obsessively fills in any gaps and injects snippets of its own propaganda wherever it can .
Here then is the source of the so called ‘ false - memory syndrome ’ , and no doubt the origin of most of our mystic visions and spiritual fantasies ...
By endowing the human brain with its language facility , evolution has ensured that human genes will continue to bypass the cerebral cortex at will , disguising fact with significance and imagination into perceived fact ” Reg Morrison – The Spirit In The Gene(9 )
CONCLUSIONS
As humans , we have tendencies towards certain behaviours that increasingly can be scientifically measured .
While the neurosciences are still expanding and are now asking more questions than they have answered , it is clear that our minds are not entirely rational , or at least not rational all the time .
Thus providing us with ' facts ' does not automatically guarantee we will use them to solve problems .
Competing voices , both from within and without , can easily morph those facts into something different than the pure scientific form they originated in .
Our modern education system , from which arises the standard for our culture and the education of our children , is anchored by an archaic and incorrect premise : that knowledge can come from the human mind based on assertions that require no proof or verification .
The origins of this error go back to ancient philosophers who were quite likely geniuses but did not have access to the real scientific data and physical methodologies available to us today .
Many modern philosophers and social scientists still adhere to the fallacy that knowledge comes from thought .
New evidence from the cognitive neurosciences is demonstrating that pure thought cannot spontaneously come from a brain designed for correlation , emotion and relative fitness .
Special steps need to be taken to teach , understand and adhere to the scientific method , which in turn builds knowledge .
In the calm before the storm , we need to take stock in what our assets and liabilities really are .
We have energy assets and liabilities and we have mental ones as well .
As energy events conspire , and the average person becomes more stressed , we may distance ourselves even further from the rational aspects of our collective behaviour .
Plans should be made ahead of time to address local , regional and national energy ( and environmental ) problems with hope but careful skepticism , for its unlikely we will get too many second chances .
Robert Rapier and I share some viewpoints and disagree on others , but one thing I have always respected about him is his immediate skepticism of high claims .
Whether he is an expert on a topic or a novice , he approaches a problem from a scientific , provable , verifiable foundation .
If more of our countries civic leaders followed the scientific principles of 1 ) observe something in nature 2 ) make a hypothesis 3 ) test the hypothesis using physical methods and 4 ) repeat until statistically satisfied , we would find ourselves better served and better prepared for an era of energy declines .
We must marry facts about geology and the environment with facts about our neural tendencies .
THE BOTTOM LINE
1 ) Peak Oil is a geologic fact .
Global warming is atmospheric climate science .
But the words that define them both also represent belief systems .
Certain people will ' believe ' they are real and others will not , largely irrespective of what future facts come to light .
2 ) Facts are important and we need to continue to analyze and accumulate them about the natural world .
But knowing how our brain will respond to these facts is equally important .
3 ) Homo Sapiens has been the most successful species on the planet .
On a planet now full of humans , our neural tendencies to look for magic solutions will be a blindspot that needs to be acknowledged .
Seeking causative forces through scientific methods as opposed to offering correlation as proof is one important step .
4 ) The stigma of determinism and fear of sociobiology needs to be discarded .
The answers to the large scale human problems cannot be solved by facts and science of the outside world alone - we need to incorporate facts about who we are into the equation .
The nature and nurture debate has raged for too long without meaningful synergy - there is no nurture without nature .
But nurture is how we are going to get through this energy bottleneck .
5 ) The mere recognition of our tendencies to react positively to authority figures , optimism , recent information , etc , gives our brain a neutralizing agent against these real human phenomena .
6 ) The motion picture " Homo Sapiens Sapiens " could be nearing a climax .
Lets collectively write a happy ending .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British man celebrated his 60th birthday in unexpected style at the weekend when a 50 pence ( $ 1 ) bet on the horses turned him into an instant millionaire .
Fred Craggs , from Yorkshire in northern England , was not even aware of his win when he walked into a branch of the William Hill betting agency to see how he had done with his accumulator bet .
When he was informed of his good fortune he was said to have turned rather pale and muttered that he had better go home to tell his wife .
His coup was selecting eight winners running at various courses around the country -- starting with one called " Is n't That Lucky " and finishing with " A Dream Come True " -- at odds of 2,000,000 to one .
" This is the most amazing bet ever placed since betting shops were made legal in 1961 , " William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said on Monday .
With phony outrage pundits continually denouncing John McCain as the “ media ’s choice ” in the election , it seems all McCain needed was a hit - job story to get his campaign rolling again .
Especially for the base that left him in the dust and already began working on Mitt Romney ’s 2012 presidential run .
As we are all well aware , on Wednesday night , the New York Times put up a story on their website insinuating John McCain had an improper relationship with a Washington lobbyist .
In Ann Coulter ’s column this morning , likely written before the story broke , she describes the presidential race as the choice between , “ hemlock , self - immolation or the traditional gun in the mouth . ”
She goes on to say , “ How did we end up with the mainstream media picking the Republican candidate for president ? ”
Now , normally I would n’t go and quote Ann Coulter in anything I write , as I believe she is an entertainer , but people take her seriously in several political circles , and her next column will speak volumes about the right ’s self - pity .
What ’s the worse of two evils for phony outrage pundits : A moderate Republican or a liberal newspaper ?
Hannity and Limbaugh have already okayed McCain as the Republican candidate after Limbaugh said the senator would “ destroy the Republican party . ”
The reasons are mostly unknown , but it may have to do with the fact that McCain is now flip - flopping on the Bush tax cuts and his own immigration reform plan .
( That ’s what I want in a president – someone who denies his own legislation to get liars and racists on his side . )
The Times piece will undoubtedly get the base fired up for McCain , even if he ’s now the “ revenge candidate . ”
This morning I was listening to Laura Ingraham on my way to work and she called the Times story , to paraphrase , what the conservative base needs to get back on track .
It ’s just a news story , but for conservatives who pretend to get angry for ratings , it ’s personal .
For it ’s the New York Times that publishes the editorials of Bob Herbert , Paul Krugman , and the detestable Frank Rich .
It was the New York Times that published Ambassador Wilson ’s pre-war investigative editorial , “ What I Did n’t Find in Africa . ”
It ’s the New York Times that is their greatest example of the “ liberal media elite . ”
It ’s where they get all their “ the media hates us ” self - pity .
It ’s how they can sound as smart as a fifth grader , saying , “ Fox News is liberal , just not as liberal . ”
The Times has supposedly been sitting on this piece since late last year , when McCain met with Times editor Bill Keller .
That in itself could be the ring that cracked the Liberty Bell .
In conservatives ' minds , the Times does n't do anything for news purposes .
They only act out of their own political bias .
If allegations turn out to be true , and McCain had an affair eight years ago , it wo n’t matter .
( Why is anyone ever shocked about political infidelity ?
These people are , by definition , rich , famous , and powerful .
Is n’t that what girls like ? )
The right does n’t care about infidelity or amorality unless it supports them politically .
Larry Craig is still in the senate .
Rush Limbaugh still has 10 million listeners .
Bill O'Reilly is trusted to talk about values .
Newt Gingrich , had an affair during the Lewinsky scandal .
Pat Robertson endorsed the presidential pursuit of Rudy Giuliani , a thrice - married abortionist whose own kids hate him .
But , of course everyone knows Pat Robertson is out there talking to God for the money it brings in .
This is a guy who had more ties to al Qaeda , through a business partner harboring terrorists in Liberia and owning stake in a gold mine , than Saddam Hussein did .
Though , I ’m sure he ’s going to come out for McCain now .
And McCain will embrace him .
They have a common enemy – not terrorists , corporatists and lobbyists – The Times and the Democrats .
Wait for the right ’s response over the next couple days .

We met at a bonfire , wrapped in ski jackets and surrounded by my friends , who whispered to me that he seemed great .
He kissed me that night , and we started dating , a little bit , no computers involved .
Conference XYZ pretty much folded in 1986 , but by then I was over it , like an easy game  tic - tac - toe or a search - a - word .

This morning , I received an e-mail from a friend of more than 40 years .
We went to school together and kept in touch ; she ’s now head librarian in a northern California community with a husband and grown kids .
Her message sounded dire :
“ Hi . I had planned to vote for John Edwards on Super Tuesday .
Who do I vote for now ?
Kay ”
It ’s a fair question .
Although I have been giving money to both John Edwards and Barack Obama , I ’d pretty much decided to vote for Edwards on primary day .
Since midday yesterday , I ’ve had to think a lot about who I would vote for on Tuesday .
I wrote back to Kay saying I had to vote for Obama , giving her six reasons .
First , I think Obama is very smart , has excellent ideas – although I wish his health care plan went farther than it does – and understands how to get people to work together , which he learned on the tough streets of Chicago 's south side .
Second , I think that what he did after graduating near the top of his Harvard Law School class and being editor of the Law Review says a lot about his character and integrity .
With those credentials , Obama could have walked into any major New York or Chicago law firm and start earning a quarter - million dollars a year .
Instead , he took a $ 13,000 social services job in Chicago .
Many years earlier , Hillary Rodham turned down the same job .
Third , I do n't buy the " no experience " argument .
He 's been in government for 10 years , including the US and Illinois State Senate .
That 's enough to understand how government works .
Dick Cheney had a lifetime of government experience and look what we got .
Being president means a lot more than having a three point plan for everything .
Fourth , he is not " all hat and no horse " or whatever the cowboy expression is .
In other words , Obama ’s critics acknowledge his ability to give amazing , uplifting speeches but claim there 's no substance beneath the suit .
Read his website - there 's plenty of substance and a truly progressive agenda .
Fifth , I 've always believed that the real job of a president is to have a vision , set a direction , and then inspire , persuade and lead the country in that direction .
In Richard Neustadt 's groundbreaking book from the early 1960s , The Power of the Presidency , he wrote that the real power of the office is its ability to persuade .
I 've sat in a hall listening to an Obama speech and while he talks about specifics – health care , Iraq and Afghanistan , whatever , that do n't make TV sound bites – he has a unique ability to " touch " the people listening .
To me , he has the ability to give voice to the hopes and needs of the poor the way Bobby Kennedy ( and John Edwards ) did , the rhetorical passion needed to speak to our greater instincts like Jack Kennedy , and an ability to move people the same way as did Dr. King .
That is the very definition of presidential leadership .
And , finally , sixth , as much as I liked Bill Clinton as president , I think the country has had enough of the Clintons already .
Well , I have at any rate .
Hillary has the capacity to be a great Senator the way Ted Kennedy became a great Senator after he realised he'd never be president .
There is nothing wrong with many of her policy positions but I think Hillary would be a disaster as president because she would attract all of the right - wing venom her husband did when he was president .
The country 's polarisation would continue .
It 'd be the 1990s all over again .
So on February 5 , my vote goes to Barack .
When my friend Kay read my reply e-mail , she wrote back with a succinct , “ Sold ! ”

The officers were caught on the way to Weston - super - Mare
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said two other Gwent officers were fined and a fifth resigned ahead of the conduct hearing .
Newspapers reported the Pcs were caught when a vehicle broke down on the way to Weston - super - Mare , after previous visits to Barry Island and Porthcawl .
Gwent Police said officers must face " the consequence of their actions " .
It was claimed colleagues dubbed the group , four men and a woman , " the seaside five " .
The IPCC said the officers have not been subject to a criminal charge .
According to newspaper reports , the unnamed constables dared each other to see how far they could travel away from their station , reaching resorts including Barry Island and Porthcawl - both outside the Gwent force area .
We will not tolerate any behaviour that falls below the standard expected and required to deliver a top quality service to the public of Gwent
Gwent Police
It is understood the matter came to the notice of senior officers after their vehicle broke down while the group had been trying to reach Weston , the other side of the Bristol channel in Somerset .
All four officers at the IPCC hearing were charged with behaving in a way which was likely to bring discredit to the police service .
Three were charged with being neither open nor truthful and one officer was charged with failing to treat a member of the public with courtesy and respect .
IPCC commissioner Tom Davies said : " This investigation has shown that the public can have confidence that the IPCC and the police service will vigorously tackle misconduct .
" Gwent Police has dealt with the officers ' behaviour following the IPCC managed investigation and is to be commended for its willingness to tackle a very small number of officers who have abused the trust put in them .
The claims involve use of cars outside the Gwent force area
" I will now ensure that the investigation concludes with a look at management processes within the force to ensure that appropriate lessons are learnt . "
The IPCC will not be naming these officers as they have not been subject to a criminal charge .
The officers who were fined will each lose 13 days pay .
Gwent Police said the resignation of one of the male officers last week was not related to the investigation .
In a statement , the force said it did not normally comment on internal matters but was " mindful that the public 's confidence in Gwent Police could be compromised by a lack of comment " .
It read : " Our officers , just like employees of other organisations , must face the consequences of their actions .
" We will not tolerate any behaviour that falls below the standard expected and required to deliver a top quality service to the public of Gwent .
" As has been demonstrated in this case , any behaviour that threatens this delivery and the public 's confidence in the force will be dealt with swiftly and fairly . "

Purdue University engineers have developed a new aluminum - rich alloy that produces hydrogen by splitting water and is economically competitive with conventional fuels for transportation and power generation .
" We now have an economically viable process for producing hydrogen on - demand for vehicles , electrical generating stations and other applications , " said Jerry Woodall , a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue who invented the process .
The new alloy contains 95 percent aluminum and 5 percent of an alloy that is made of the metals gallium , indium and tin .
Because the new alloy contains significantly less of the more expensive gallium than previous forms of the alloy , hydrogen can be produced less expensively , he said .
When immersed in water , the alloy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen , which immediately reacts with the aluminum to produce aluminum oxide , also called alumina , which can be recycled back into aluminum .
Recycling aluminum from nearly pure alumina is less expensive than mining the aluminum - containing ore bauxite , making the technology more competitive with other forms of energy production , Woodall said .
" After recycling both the aluminum oxide back to aluminum and the inert gallium - indium - tin alloy only 60 times , the cost of producing energy both as hydrogen and heat using the technology would be reduced to 10 cents per kilowatt hour , making it competitive with other energy technologies , " Woodall said .
The researchers will present findings about the new alloy on Feb. 26 during the conference Materials Innovations in an Emerging Hydrogen Economy , which runs Feb. 24 - 27 in Cocoa Beach , Fla ..
A key to developing the alloy for large - scale technologies is controlling the microscopic structure of the solid aluminum and the gallium - indium - tin alloy mixture .
" This is because the mixture tends to resist forming entirely as a homogeneous solid due to the different crystal structures of the elements in the alloy and the low melting point of the gallium - indium - tin alloy , " Woodall said .
The alloy is said to have two phases because it contains abrupt changes in composition from one constituent to another .
" I can form a one - phase melt of liquid aluminum and the gallium - indium - tin alloy by heating it .
But when I cool it down , most of the gallium - indium - tin alloy is not homogeneously incorporated into the solid aluminum , but remains a separate phase of liquid , " Woodall said .
" The constituents separate into two phases just like ice and liquid water . "
The two - phase composition seems to be critical for the technology to work because it enables the aluminum alloy to react with water and produce hydrogen .
The researchers had earlier discovered that slow - cooling and fast - cooling the new 95/5 aluminum alloy produced drastically different versions .
The fast - cooled alloy contained aluminum and the gallium - indium - tin alloy apparently as a single phase .
In order for it to produce hydrogen , it had to be in contact with a puddle of the liquid gallium - indium - tin alloy .
" That was a very exciting finding because it showed that the alloy would react with water at room temperature to produce hydrogen until all of the aluminum was used up , " Woodall said .
The engineers were surprised to learn late last year , however , that slow - cooling formed a two - phase solid alloy , meaning solid pieces of the 95/5 aluminum alloy react with water to produce hydrogen , eliminating the need for the liquid gallium - indium - tin alloy .
" That was a fantastic discovery , " Woodall said .
" What used to be a curiosity is now a real alternative energy technology . "
The research is partially funded by Purdue 's Energy Center at the university 's Discovery Park .
" This technology has exciting potential , and I hope that it receives a fair and detailed evaluation and consideration from the scientific , government and business communities , " said Jay Gore , the Vincent P. Reilly Professor of Mechanical Engineering and interim director of the Energy Center .
The slow - cooling technique made it possible to create forms of the alloy containing higher concentrations of aluminum .
The Purdue researchers are developing a method to create briquettes of the alloy that could be placed in a tank to react with water and produce hydrogen on - demand .
Such a technology would eliminate the need to store and transport hydrogen , two potential stumbling blocks in developing a hydrogen economy , Woodall said .
The gallium - indium - tin alloy component is inert , which means it can be recovered and reused at an efficiency approaching 100 percent , he said
" The aluminum oxide is recycled back into aluminum using the currently preferred industrial process called the Hall - Héroult process , which produces one - third as much carbon dioxide as combusting gasoline in an engine , " Woodall said .
The aluminum splits water by reacting with the oxygen atoms in water molecules , liberating hydrogen in the process .
The gallium - indium - tin alloy is a critical component because it hinders the formation of a " passivating " aluminum oxide skin normally created on pure aluminum 's surface after bonding with oxygen , a process called oxidation .
This skin usually acts as a barrier and prevents oxygen from reacting with bulk aluminum .
Reducing the skin's protective properties allows the reaction to continue until all of the aluminum is used to generate hydrogen , Woodall said .
" This skin is like an eggshell , " he said .
" Think of trying to fry an egg without breaking the shell . "
The researchers developed the new alloy in late 2007 and are reporting about it for the first time during the conference .
" We now have a simple process for making 95/ 5 , and we know the process splits water and produces hydrogen until all of the aluminum alloy is used up , " Woodall said .
For the technology to be used in major applications such as cars and trucks or for power plants , however , a large - scale recycling program would be required to turn the alumina back into aluminum and to recover the gallium - indium - tin alloy .
Other infrastructure components , such as those related to manufacturing and the supply chain , also would have to be developed , he said .
" So the economic risk is large , but the potential payoff is also large , " said Woodall , who received the 2001 National Medal of Technology , the nation 's highest award for technological achievement .
Aluminum , the most abundant metal on earth , is refined from the raw mineral bauxite , which also contains gallium .
Future research will include work to learn more about the chemical mechanisms behind the process and the microscopic structure of the alloy .

Puerto Rico Governor to endorse Obama
Mike Allen passes on word that later this morning Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Governor Anibal Acevedo - Vila will announce his endorsement of Obama .
There are 63 delegates are at stake in the state , which is the last to vote on June 7 .
Along with playing a role in Puerto Rico -- if we ever get there -- the planned endorsement is a boost for Obama with Latino voters , where his campaign thinks endorsements can really matter .
ALTHOUGH : A Vila downside : FBI probing his campaign finances .
One day , when I got on the net I saw this article : Who ’s REALLY Threatening Your Relationship ?
Basically , it 's a guide for women of the four “ types ” of other women who are threats to ruin your relationship .
According to Yahoo , the four threats to ruining your relationship with your male companions are :
Co-Worker
The Drunk Stranger
The Ex
The Opposite Sex Friend
Wow , thanks for the insight , Yahoo , way to really narrow it down and get specific .
Basically , they “ narrowed ” it down to 50 % of the women a guy will talk to in any meaningful way each day .
Way to be on point with that .
I ca n’t wait for sexual awareness week next year when they do the in depth study of people most likely to molest a child : catholic priests , guys with weird vans and Michael Jackson .
I decided to actually give the ladies out there some valuable information and talk about four people you do need to be concerned with .
Also , for men this serves as a guide to evil vagina that you need to stay away from .
The Slutty Single Mom Friend
While I have the utmost respect for single mothers , there are some who have especially casual moral attitudes .
Follow the logic on this : you are a woman removed from a relationship .
You have to work full time to help support your child or children , when you are n’t at work you are surrounded by said kid(s ) , so when it is time to let your hair down , you do n’t screw around .
I contend that single mothers on the prowl are sluttier than your average everyday girl .
If your husband / boyfriend is friends with one or works with one she will be one of the people you need to watch .
The thing is , because their life is so hectic , they know what they want and will do what they need to get it .
Plus , they do n’t get needy and they are usually discreet -- a warm penis is better than a vibrator 67 % of the time .
( I have no stats to back that last number up , but it sounds good to me . )
His Asian Masseuse
I hate to tell you , but if he goes for a massage once or twice a month , it is a rub and tug .
While therapeutic , it is n’t the same thing Hans gives you at the spa .
He goes there for internationally trafficked , sex worker poon … on the cheap too .
A Waitress / Bartender at His Favorite Restaurant / Bar
There is n’t a connection between you and her .
With a co-worker or a personal friend , the odds are that you probably know her and talk to her semi-regularly .
Unless that co-worker / personal friend is a vindictive bitch that hates you , there is a moral barrier there that might cause her to think twice about sleeping with your man .
But a girl that your man sees a few times a week at lunch has no such barrier .
Plus , they only see each other for brief moments , so he totally cannot fuck things up .
In reality , he is basically always putting his best foot forward .
If he tips well and has some sort of a personality , he might leave a positive impression , which leads to more flirting and eventually a roll in the hay .
Hell , I would sleep with anyone that tipped well and was funny … but I am a whore that way .
The Internet Girl
Here is a riddle , " What lives hundreds of miles away in a town your dude visits occasionally for business , has extremely low self esteem , and has plenty of time on her hands ? "
The slutty girl from the internet that your guy is carrying on an illicit affair with .
Go check myspace ; there are millions of them .
So there you have it ladies , you should n’t let your man on a computer , in a restaurant , in a bar , near a single mom , or within 50 miles of a massage parlor .
Have fun living your entire life in fear and always wondering if any of these potential hook ups are out there .
P.S. -
If you actually follow any relationship advice on Yahoo.com you should either end your life or become a nun .
What other sub group has the best chance of totally fucking up your relationship ?

Legal Analysis of the NSA Domestic Surveillance Program :
Wiretapping to protect the security of the Nation has been authorized by successive Presidents .
The present Administration would apparently save national security cases from restrictions against wiretapping .
We should not require the warrant procedure and the magistrate 's judgment if the President of the United States or his chief legal officer , the Attorney General , has considered the requirements of national security and authorized electronic surveillance as reasonable .
Further , the instant case requires no judgment on the scope of the President 's surveillance power with respect to the activities of foreign powers , within or without this country .
The Attorney General 's affidavit in this case states that the surveillances were " deemed necessary to protect the nation from attempts of domestic organizations to attack and subvert the existing structure of Government . "
There is no evidence of any involvement , directly or indirectly , of a foreign power .
(1 ) the acquisition by an electronic , mechanical , or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire or radio communication sent by or intended to be received by a particular , known United States person who is in the United States , if the contents are acquired by intentionally targeting that United States person , under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes ;
( 2 ) the acquisition by an electronic , mechanical , or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication to or from a person in the United States , without the consent of any party thereto , if such acquisition occurs in the United States .
. . .
Notwithstanding any other law , the President , through the Attorney General , may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for periods of up to one year if the Attorney General certifies in writing under oath that --
( A ) the electronic surveillance is solely directed at --
( i ) the acquisition of the contents of communications transmitted by means of communications used exclusively between or among foreign powers , as defined in section 1801 ( a ) ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 3 ) of this title ; or
( ii ) the acquisition of technical intelligence , other than the spoken communications of individuals , from property or premises under the open and exclusive control of a foreign power , as defined in section 1801 ( a ) ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 3 ) of this title ; [ and ]
( B ) there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party .
(1 ) a foreign government or any component thereof , whether or not recognized by the United States ;
( 2 ) a faction of a foreign nation or nations , not substantially composed of United States persons ;
(3 ) an entity that is openly acknowledged by a foreign government or governments to be directed and controlled by such foreign government or governments ;
( 4 ) a group engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor ;
( 5 ) a foreign - based political organization , not substantially composed of United States persons ; or
( 6 ) an entity that is directed and controlled by a foreign government or governments .
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES .
( a) IN GENERAL .-- That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations , or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such organizations or persons , in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations , organizations or persons .
The AUMF authorizes the President to use " all necessary and appropriate force " against " nations , organizations , or persons " associated with the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
115 Stat. 224 .
There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban , an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks , are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF .
We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering , for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured , is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the " necessary and appropriate force " Congress has authorized the President to use .
The capture and detention of lawful combatants and the capture , detention , and trial of unlawful combatants , by " universal agreement and practice , " are " important incident [s ] of war . "
Ex parte Quirin , 317 U. S. , at 28 .
The purpose of detention is to prevent captured individuals from returning to the field of battle and taking up arms once again .
. . .
. . .
In light of these principles , it is of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific language of detention .
Because detention to prevent a combatant 's return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war , in permitting the use of " necessary and appropriate force , " Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here .
. . .
Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize indefinite or perpetual detention .
Certainly , we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized .
Further , we understand Congress ' grant of authority for the use of " necessary and appropriate force " to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict , and our understanding is based on longstanding law - of - war principles .
. . .
The United States may detain , for the duration of these hostilities , individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who " engaged in an armed conflict against the United States . "
If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan , those detentions are part of the exercise of " necessary and appropriate force , " and therefore are authorized by the AUMF .
The President Has Inherent Authoritv to Conduct Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Protect National Security from Foreign Threats .
In considering the constitutionality of the amended FISA , it is important to understand that FISA is not required by the Constitution .
Rather , the Constitution vests in the President inherent authority to conduct warrantless intelligence surveillance ( electronic or otherwise ) of foreign powers or their agents , and Congress cannot by statute extinguish that constitutional authority .
Both before and after the enactment of FISA , courts have recognized the President 's inherent authority to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance .
See , e.g. , Butenko , 494 F.2d at 608 ( grounding exception to warrant requirement in the President 's Commander - in - chief and foreign - affairs powers ; noting that the country 's self - defense needs weigh on the side of reasonableness ) ;
Truong , 629 F.2d at 914 ( citing the President 's foreign affairs power as justifying an exception to the warrant requirement ) ; cf. United States v. United States District Court ( Keith ) , 407 U.S. 297 , 308 ( 1972 ) ( reserving the question whether the President 's foreign - affairs powers justify exception from warrant requirement ) .
Both executive authority in the foreign affairs area and society 's interest in privacy are of significance , and are equally worthy of judicial concern .
. . .
The importance of the President 's responsibilities in the foreign affairs field requires the judicial branch to act with the utmost care when asked to place limitations on the President 's powers in that area .
As Commander - in - Chief , the President must guard the country from foreign aggression , sabotage , and espionage .
Obligated to conduct this nation 's foreign affairs , he must be aware of the posture of foreign nations toward the United States , the intelligence activities of foreign countries aimed at uncovering American secrets , and the policy positions of foreign states on a broad range of international issues .
To be sure , in the course of such wiretapping conversations of alien officials and agents , and perhaps of American citizens , will be overheard and to that extent , their privacy infringed .
But the Fourth Amendment proscribes only ' unreasonable ' searches and seizures .
And balanced against this country 's self - defense needs , we cannot say that the district court erred in concluding that the electronic surveillance here did not trench upon Ivanov 's Fourth Amendment rights .
Perhaps most crucially , the executive branch not only has superior expertise in the area of foreign intelligence , it is also constitutionally designated as the pre-eminent authority in foreign affairs .
The President and his deputies are charged by the constitution with the conduct of the foreign policy of the United States in times of war and peace .
Just as the separation of powers in Keith forced the executive to recognize a judicial role when the President conducts domestic security surveillance , so the separation of powers requires us to acknowledge the principal responsibility of the President for foreign affairs and concomitantly for foreign intelligence surveillance .
In sum , because of the need of the executive branch for flexibility , its practical experience , and its constitutional competence , the courts should not require the executive to secure a warrant each time it conducts foreign intelligence surveillance .
Of course you ’re right that Keith and Katz reserved the question whether the President may engage in warrantless surveillance of foreign - based threats to the national security .
While the Supreme Court has never addressed the issue , a number of federal appellate courts , some of which you cite at the end of your post , answered that question in the affirmative in the years immediately after Keith .
See , e.g. , United States v. Brown , 484 F.2d 418 ( 5th Cir. 1973 ) ; United States v. Butenko , 494 F.2d 593 ( 3d Cir. 1974 ) ( en banc ) ; United States v. Buck , 548 F.2d 871 ( 9th Cir. 1977 ) ; United States v. Truong , 629 F.2d 908 ( 4th Cir. 1980 ) .
But see Zweibon v. Mitchell , 516 F.2d 594 ( D.C. Cir. 1975 ) .
The interesting question is whether FISA somehow extinguishes this inherent Presidential power to conduct foreign - intelligence surveillance .
There ’s a respectable argument that it does .
FISA repealed Title III ’s reservation clause ( 18 USC 2511 ( 3 ) ) , in which Congress expressly had forsworn any intent to regulate the collection of foreign intelligence .
Given that repeal , we might be in Category Three from Justice Jackson ’s Steel Seizure concurrence —
" When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress , his power is at its lowest ebb , for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter .
Courts can sustain exclusive Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject . "
Was the secret NSA surveillance program legal ?
Was it constitutional ?
Did it violate federal statutory law ?
It turns out these are hard questions , but I wanted to try my best to answer them .
My answer is pretty tentative , but here it goes :
Although it hinges somewhat on technical details we do n't know , it seems that the program was probably constitutional but probably violated the federal law known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
My answer is extra-cautious for two reasons .
First , there is some wiggle room in FISA , depending on technical details we do n't know of how the surveillance was done .
Second , there is at least a colorable argument — if , I think in the end , an unpersuasive one — that the surveillance was authorized by the Authorization to Use Miltary Force as construed in the Hamdi opinion .
This is a really long post , so let me tell you where I 'm going .
I 'm going to start with the Fourth Amendment ; then turn to FISA ; next look to the Authorization to Use Military Force ; and conclude by looking at claim that the surveillance was justified by the inherent authority of Article II .
And before I start , let me be clear that nothing in this post is intended to express or reflect a normative take of whether the surveillance program is a good idea or a bad idea .
In other words , I 'm just trying to answer what the law is , not say what the law should be .
If you think my analysis is wrong , please let me know in the comment section ; I 'd be delighted to post a correction ..
On the whole , I think there are some pretty decent arguments that this program did not violate the Fourth Amendment under existing precedent .
There are a bunch of different arguments here , but let me focus on two : the border search exception and a national security exception .
Neither is a slam dunk , by any means , but each are plausible arguments left open by the cases .
The border search exception permits searches at the border of the United States " or its functional equivalent . "
United States v. Montoya De Hernandez , 473 U.S. 531 , 538 ( 1985 ) .
The idea here is that the United States as a sovereign has a right to inspect stuff entering or exiting the country as a way of protecting its sovereign interests , and that the Fourth Amendment permits such searches .
Courts have applied the border search exception in cases of PCs and computer hard drives ; if you bring a computer into or out of the United States , the government can search your computer for contraband or other prohibited items at the airport or wherever you are entering or leaving the country .
See , e.g. , United States v. Ickes , 393 F.3d 501 ( 4th Cir. 2005 ) ( Wilkinson , J. ) .
As I understand it , all of the monitoring involved in the NSA program involved international calls ( and international e-mails ) .
That is , the NSA was intercepting communications in the U.S. , but only communications going outside the U.S. or coming from abroad .
I 'm not aware of any cases applying the border search exception to raw data , as compared to the search of a physical device that stores data , so this is untested ground .
At the same time , I do n't know of a rationale in the caselaw for treating data differently than physical storage devices .
The case law on the border search exception is phrased in pretty broad language , so it seems at least plausible that a border search exception could apply to monitoring at an ISP or telephone provider as the " functional equivalent of the border , " much like airports are the functional equivalent of the border in the case of international airline travel .
[ UPDATE : A number of people have contacted me or left comments expressing skepticism about this argument .
In response , let me point out the most persuasive case on point : United States v. Ramsey , holding that the border search exception applies to all international postal mail , permitting all international postal mail to be searched .
Again , this is n't a slam dunk , but I think a plausible argument -- and with dicta that seems to say that mode of transportation is not relevant . ]
The government would have a second argument in case a court does n't accept the border search exception : the open question of whether there is a national security exception to the Fourth Amendment that permits the government to conduct searches and surveillance for foreign intelligence surveillance .
Footnote 23 of Katz v. United States left this open , and Justice White 's conccurrence in Katz expanded on this point :
The Supreme Court also left this question open in the so - called " Keith " case , United States v. United States District Court , in 1972 .
Justice Powell 's opinion in the Keith case concluded that there was no national security exception to the Fourth Amendment for evidence collection involving domestic organizations , but expressly held open the possibility that such an exception existed for foreign intelligence collection :
The administration presumably takes the position that the President does have such power in cases involving foreign evidence collection , and that the NSA surveillance is such a case .
The Supreme Court has never resolved the question , so it 's an open constitutional issue .
Nonetheless , between the border search exception and the open possibility of a national security exception , there are pretty decent arguments that the monitoring did not violate the Fourth Amendment .
Maybe persuasive , maybe not , but certainly open and fair arguments under the case law .
Now let 's turn to FISA , a 1978 law that Congress enacted in response to the Keith case .
FISA goes beyond the Keith case , including foreign intelligence surveillance in its scope even though it was left open as a constututional question .
Specifically , 50 U.S.C. 1809 prohibits " electronic surveillance " except as authorized by statutory law : " A person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally . . . engages in electronic surveillance under color of law except as authorized by statute . "
" Electronic surveillance " is defined in 50 U.S.C. 1801 ( f ) to mean , in relevant part : A " United States person " is defined in 50 U.S.C. 1801 ( i ) as " a citizen of the United States [ or ] an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence . "
A " wire communication " is defined as a communication that is traveling by a wire ; I do n't know if " radio communication " is a defined term , but I assume it refers primary to satellite communications .
Putting aside the AUMF and statutory exceptions for now , let 's consider whether the NSA surveillance program violates the basic prohibition of 50 U.S.C. 1809 — intentionally conducting electronic surveillance .
I think the answer is probably yes .
If the surveillance tapped wire communications under 1801 ( f ) ( 2 ) , the case is pretty clear : the surveillance involved people in the U.S. and survillance in the U.S. , and that 's all that is required .
If the surveillance involved radio communications ( satellite communications , I 'm guessing ) , that 's a bit trickier .
There is at least a little wiggle room in Section 1801 ( f ) ( 1 ) .
For example , you could say that the border search exception eliminates Fourth Amendment protection , such that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore there would be no warrant required in an analogous criminal case .
In that case , the tapping of the radio communication would n't count as " electronic surveillance . "
I do n't think we know the details of how the communucations were obtained , so I think it 's fair to say that the surveillance probably violated the basic proibition but it at least arguably depends on some of the technical details we do n't know .
Now , on to the exceptions .
50 U.S.C. 1802 ( a ) ( 1 ) provides in relevant part : Does this exception permit the monitoring ?
Note that ( i ) and ( ii ) are both dealing with " foreign power , as defined in ( a ) ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 3 ) of this title . "
FISA 's definition of " foreign power " appears in 50 U.S.C.
1801 : So as I read the statutes , Congress was trying to give an exception for monitoring foreign governments ( a1 , a2 , a3 ) but not terrorist groups ( a4 , a5 , a 6 ) , so long as no citizens or lawful permanent resident aliens were being monitored .
There are interesting questions of how that might have applied to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan , but I do n't think we need to reach them .
It 's my understanding that the program monitored both citizens and non-citizens , so I do n't see how the exception is applicable .
( Aside : Remember back in 2003 when a copy of the Administration 's " Domestic Security Enhancement Act " — sometimes dubbed " Patriot II " — was leaked to the press ?
Section 501 of that Act would have made " providing material support " to a terrorist group an automatic ground for terminating citizenship .
This is just a guess , but I wonder if the thinking was that this would make the NSA warrantless monitoring program legal under FISA .
An individual who made regular contact with Al Qaeda could be giving them material support , and the individual would then no longer be a United States person and could then be legally subject to monitoring .
Just speculation , but it might explain the thinking behind the legislative proposal .
Anyway , back to our regularly scheduled programming . )
The next question is whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force , Pub .
L. No. 107-40 , 115 Stat. 224 , justified the monitoring .
The authorizaton states in relevant part : I assume that the Administration 's claim is that the AUMF counts as a " statute " that authorizes the surveillance : 50 U.S.C. 1809 states that " A person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally . . . engages in electronic surveillance under color of law except as authorized by statute , " so if the AUMF authorized the electronic surveillance , then the NSA program did n't violate FISA .
The Supreme Court considered the legal effect of the AUMF in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld .
Yaser Hamdi was being held as an enemy combatant , and claimed that his detention violated 18 U.S.C. 4001 .
Section 4001 ( a ) states that " [ n ] o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress . "
Given Justice
Thomas 's very broad reading of the AUMF in his dissent , I think the key interpretation is that of Justice O'Connor 's plurality opinion , joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist , Justice Kennedy , and Justice Breyer .
Justice O'Connor concluded that the the AUMF was " an act of Congress " that authorized Hamdi 's detention , such that the detention did not violate 4001 ( a ) : So does the AUMF authorize the surveillance ?
As often happens when you 're trying to draw guidance from an O'Connor opinion , it 's not entirely clear .
Under her opinion , the key question is whether the act is " so fundamental and accepted an incident to war " that it falls within the authorization .
But that depends on the level of generality you chose to use to define " the act . "
Is " the act " spying on the enemy ?
In that case , perhaps it is a fundamental incident to war .
Or is " the act " conducting U.S. domestic surveillance of U.S. citizens ?
In that case , the answer is no , it 's not a fundamental incident to war .
In the end , my best sense is that the AUMF does n't extend to this .
I have three reasons .
First , O'Connor 's opinion says the following about detention for interrogation : " Certainly , we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized . "
It seems to me that surveillance and wiretapping is pretty similar to interrogation : the point of both is getting information about your enemy .
Second , it does n't seem like wiretapping counts as a " use of force . "
If you read the text of the AUMF , it does n't seem to me that it authorizes wiretapping .
Finally , note that Congress passed the Patriot Act about a month after passing the AUMF ; if Congress had intended the AUMF to give the president wide authority to conduct domestic surveillance against Al Qaeda , I do n't think they would have spent so much time amending FISA for terrorism investigations .
So at bottom , I think the AUMF probably did n't authorize this , although the Hamdi case gives some colorable ( if ultimately unpersuasive ) arguments that it might .
The final argument is that Article II of the Constitution gives the President inherent authority to conduct such monitoring .
The Administration introduced this theory in a supplemental brief filed in the FISA Court of Review : So the argument , as I understand it , is that Congress has no power to legislate in a way that inteferes with the President 's Commander - in - Chief power , a judgment made , I suppose , by the President himself .
I have been unable to find any caselaw in support of this argument .
Further , the argument has no support from the cases cited in the government 's brief .
In all three of those cases — Butenko , Truong , and Keith - the Courts were talking about whether the President 's interest in conducting foreign intelligence monitoring creates an exception to the Warrant Requirement of the Fourth Amendment .
In other words , the issue in those case was whether the Constitution bars warrantless surveillance absent Congressional action , not whether Congressional prohibitons in this area cannot bind the Executive branch .
Consider the citation to the Butenko case .
Here is the relevant section , from 494 F.2d at 608:
As I read this analysis , it is entirely focused on the Fourth Amendment , and specifically whether the President 's Commander in Chief power should trigger a relaxed Fourth Amendment standard .
That seems quite different from a claim that Article II makes Congressional regulation inoperative .
The same goes for the citation to Truong , 629 F.2d at 914 .
In the course of discussing whether the Courts should require a warant for foreig intelligence surveillance , the court tried to balance the ability of courts to regulate intelligence surveillance with the strong governmentg interest :
While the Court was recognizing the President 's constitutional role , it was in a very specific context : balancing reasonableness in the context of Fourth Amendment law to determine whether the surveillance required a warrant .
Again , this does n't seem to go to whether Congress can impose binding statutory prohibitions beyond the Fourth Amendment .
Anyway , that 's my tentative take ; I hope it 's helpful .
It 's entirely possible that I goofed the analysis somewhere along the way ; FISA , the AUMF , and Article II are n't my area of expertise , so we should consider this post a work in progress .
I look forward to comments — civil and respectful , please .

If you 're in the mood for more , check out posts on this from Marty Lederman and Daniel Solove
Local residents brought newspapers to complete the house
The interactive artwork by artist Sumer Erek , was created with the help of the public who brought old newspapers to fit into the structure .
The building has been installed as a piece of public art in Gillet Square in Dalston , Hackney .
The house , more than 12ft tall , aims to highlight the need for recycling .
On Monday the artist erected the wooden structure in a local church and residents were encouraged to bring and place newspapers into it .
Train companies donated about two tonnes of newspapers left by commuters while another 10,000 papers were collected by Project Freesheet .
Newspapers were tightly rolled up to fit in the structure
The project was undertaken by a group called Creative City and funded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation .
Mr Erek said : " Newspaper House covers our era's three aspects - news , paper and house ... and also brings communities together and people contributing into the construction and adding into the piece in a physical active way . "
He added that the rain would help congeal the paper turning it into an " even stronger and more solid material " .
" Even things that do n't have value can be transformed into artwork and it could be something beautiful , " he said .
Nargis Khan , cabinet member of Hackney Council 's Community Services , said : " Newspaper House is a really great example of how public art can bring communities together and actually raise the profile of issues like recycling and reducing waste . "
The house was on display until Sunday after which it will be recycled .
Web frameworks and web hosts
Today John Gruber linked to a post on the official Dreamhost blog lamenting the state of web - framework deployment on consumer - level shared hosting ; while the post itself is largely concerned with Ruby on Rails , the current state of deploying popular ( non- PHP - based ) web frameworks on hosts like Dreamhost is , well , abysmal .
A search for “ dreamhost ” in the archives of the django - users mailing list turns up nearly five hundred results , many of them people struggling to get Django working , and I imagine that similar searches of list archives for other frameworks would turn up similar numbers of problems .
So .
What ’s so hard about this , and what can be done to improve the situation ?
The problem
Well .
Actually , “ problems ” .
As I see it , there are three major issues facing frameworks on shared hosting .
First off , the new wave of popular frameworks all make a clean break from a traditional CGI - style model where the application is simply loaded and executed fresh on each and every request ; this is a necessary change ( reloading a framework like Rails or Django on every request would result in horrific performance ) , but one that causes headaches for web hosts .
Second , the deployment options are so varied as to be bewildering ; even when there ’s some sort of standard gateway protocol — as with WSGI in Python — there ’s still plenty of room for disagreement on how to actually deploy an application .
To run with the WSGI example ( and pick on Python a bit just to show I ’m not engaging in any favoritism here ) : I can write an application that speaks WSGI fairly easily , and WSGI applications are for the most part interchangeable .
But on the server side , it ’s not so clear : should the server learn to speak WSGI directly ( à la mod_wsgi ) ?
Should there be an intermediary to bridge the gap , like flup ?
If so , what protocol should the server and the intermediary use ( flup can speak FastCGI , SCGI and AJP , for example ) ?
Third , the new wave of frameworks are bringing languages like Ruby and Python onto shared hosting for the first time , and with that comes the problem of library support ; there ’s a whole new world of standard modules hosts need to be aware of and be ready to support if they want to get serious about these frameworks , because asking the typical shared - hosting customer to go out and compile database adapters or image - manipulation libraries ( if your AUP even allows that ) simply wo n’t work .
Go long
The fact that the deployment model for the new frameworks centers around long - running processes — rather than launching a clean copy of the application on each request — is one that ’s hard on hosting providers .
Unlike traditional CGI or PHP setups , a framework like Rails or Django or TurboGears simply can’t be run on a “ launch a new copy every time ” basis ; the overhead of loading and initializing the framework makes it unusable in that situation .
Having a persistent process which loads the code once and keeps it in memory is the only way this can work .
But hosts have traditionally been reluctant to allow users to launch long - running processes of the type needed to efficiently serve a framework - based application ; more than once in my freelancing days , I ran into hosts with automated process monitors which simply killed any user - owned process that stayed resident for more than about thirty seconds .
Others have been known to kill anything not on an approved whitelist ( read : Rails ) , which has led to the amusing phenomenon of people renaming their non-Rails FastCGI handlers to dispatch.rb as a workaround .
This situation is slowly getting better , but a whole lot more progress is needed .
Yes , a long - running process will chew up valuable memory even when it ’s not actually serving a request , but that ’s something that has to be accepted ; hosts which do n’t support this are going to be hosts that do n’t get business ( or word - of - mouth referrals ) from framework users .
One obvious way to do it
One of the reasons behind PHP ’s ubiquity is the fact that , for the longest time , the deployment pattern was simple and standard : install PHP and mod_php , tell Apache to use that for anything ending in .php and you ’re pretty much done .
These days there ’s a bit of fragementation in the options — mod_php versus FastCGI versus straight CGI — but they ’re all well - documented , well - understood and easy to set up ( and , from the perspective of an application author , they all work the same way : just upload a . php file ) .
What ’s more , most Linux distributions can set up the whole thing for you with a single dip into the package manager .
Ruby and Python , right now , have nothing approaching this .
Yes , Python has WSGI , but see above for why that does n’t solve the problem .
At most , there needs to be one standard stack per language , preferably of the form “ install this Apache module ” .
For Python
I think the most promising option is mod_wsgi which , though it does n’t let you do everything in .htaccess , seems like it ’d lend itself quite easily to a plugin for the popular hosting control panels .
For Ruby I do n’t know ; I ’m not familiar enough with the various options to be able to form an opinion .
This does n’t mean that frameworks should n’t support multiple deployment options , but it does mean that , for whatever language you ’re working in , there should be a standard option and the framework should support it .
import this
The other big reason behind PHP ’s success is that it targets web development specifically , and comes with everything and the kitchen sink .
The downside is that PHP ’s standard function namespace is horrifically crowded , but at least there are n’t a whole lot of common cases where you have to go out and install a new library just to get something basic like database support .
Ruby and Python , on the other hand , are general - purpose modular languages ; this means there are a number of modules which , though necessary for web application development , are n’t included in the standard library of either language .
Database connectivity , for example , largely comes from third - party modules ; Python only supports SQLite out of the box ( and only in Python 2.5 and up ) , and as far as I know Ruby does n’t ship modules for any of the “ big three ” open - source databases ( SQLite , MySQL and PostgreSQL ) in its standard library .
Some of this could be helped by changes to standard libraries or by more convenient packaging of some of the important third - party items , but if hosts want to get serious about frameworks they need to be ensuring the availability of any key modules that do n’t come as part of the language ; telling someone to go compile their own copy of , say , MySQLdb for Python is a non-starter .
Work with me here
You ’ll note that , of the three things I ’ve outlined above , two lay a lot of responsibility on the hosting providers ( though if you think that solving the “ standard deployment ” issue is going to be easy on the framework side , I ’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I ’d like to sell you ) .
That ’s pretty much inevitable : when a new method of building web applications becomes popular , web hosting needs to change to keep up .
But by and large , this process needs to be a dialogue between hosts who want to offer solid framework support , and developers and users of frameworks who want to make the hosting experience as painless as possible .
Neither side can afford to sit back and hope that the other will deal with the problem , and neither side alone has enough expertise or resources to solve all of the issues .
And there are certainly hosts out there which are doing their part : Joyent , with whom this site is happily hosted , pride themselves on Rails support and have also done a lot of largely - unsung work to ensure that Python frameworks will be easy to use on their shared offerings ( to the point of contributing patches to key third - party modules so they ’ll work on Joyent ’s Solaris environment ) .
WebFaction has literally gone all - out , with integrated support for popular frameworks right in their control panel ( see their Django deployment screencast for an example ) .
Going forward , I think that ’s going to be the only way to resolve the issues I ’ve listed above : the hosts who want to provide a great framework experience will get together with the frameworks which want to provide a great hosting experience , and sit down and solve these issues .
And if they ’re looking for good solutions to the problems they ’re having with frameworks , I ’d love to see Dreamhost get in on that .
A Clinton spokesman , Mo Elleithee , said of the Michigan proposal : “ Nearly 600,000 Americans participated in the Michigan primary in January , and we have a solemn obligation to ensure that their voices are heard .
The best way to make that happen is to honor their votes , but if that is n’t possible there should be a new state primary that does n’t leave taxpayers footing the bill . ”
He said the Clinton campaign was waiting to hear more details .
The plan was negotiated by Senator Carl Levin , Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick , Debbie Dingell , a member of the Democratic National Committee , and Ron Gettelfinger , president of the United Auto Workers .
The four Democrats , who all claim neutrality in the presidential contest , have been working with state and national party officials and representatives of the two campaigns to try to find a solution to the delegate impasse .
“ We agree that the Michigan delegation should be seated at the convention , and without a fight before the Credentials Committee or on the floor of the convention , ” they said in a statement Friday afternoon .
A person close to the negotiations , who requested anonymity to discuss private talks , said the Clinton campaign was receptive to the June revote plan but the Obama forces were holding back for now .
The person said that Michigan Republicans , who control the State Senate , said they would not stand in the way .
But Democrats , who control the state House of Representatives , are divided between Clinton supporters and Obama supporters .
“ The Clinton people say they ’re not going to block it , ” the source said .
“ The question is what the Obama people are going to do . ”
The situation in Florida seemed more intractable , with Clinton supporters arguing the party ’s prospects in November could be jeopardized if a satisfactory resolution is not found .
Some Clinton backers said they were intentionally withholding their contributions to the party , arguing that Howard Dean , the D.N.C. ’s chairman , has left the situation in the hands of the states and the candidates , as opposed to exercising leadership to resolve it .
“ My wife and I could max out , and we won’t , ” said Ira Leesfield , a Miami lawyer who has given $ 61,500 to the committee since 1997 .
“ We ’re dissatisfied with the D.N.C. not taking the bull by the horns . ”
My last Pixelmator tutorial was inspired by the DVNO clip , which was full of design inspiration from the 80’s .
But where does this inspiration come from ?
How can you give your work that retro feeling ?
The first thing to do is finding references , images that represent those years .
These images will give us an idea of the colors , the typography style , and the graphic elements that were mostly used in that period of time .
In my case I chose the video - game influence in that decade .
In the early 1980s , the first generation of computer graphics in arcade games produced the popular Space Invaders arcade game ( first released in 1978 ) , followed by Pac - Man , Donkey Kong , and Frogger .
Towards the end of the decade , home video game consoles began to outstrip the arcade game .
The Japanese Famicom was released to the American public as the Nintendo Entertainment System ( also known as the NES ) in 1985 and renewed public interest in video games following a brief decline caused by the Video Game Crash of 1983 .
Wikipedia
For my Pixelmator tutorial for example , I 've used some of these ideas like the perspective grid and the color palette using red , green , and blue with a dark background .
Besides that , it was inspired by the DVNO clip which is full of 80's design .
Now if we take a look at the James White ’s Atari design , we will see , again , where some of the elements came from and why his work gives us the feeling of the Atari ’s era .
So the question is where can we find these images and references ?
Fortunately for us we , there are such sites as Flickr , Youtube , Wikipedia , where we can learn more about that time in history and check some pictures of products , designs , and videos that were produced on those days .
Below I list some images I used for reference to my Pixelmator tutorial .

“ The work plan is finished , ” Ali Asghar Soltanieh , Iran ’s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency , told Reuters , referring to a pact between Tehran and the IAEA to answer outstanding questions about its nuclear activities one by one .
In its latest report published on Friday , the IAEA said Iran had responded to questions and clarified issues raised in the context of the work plan struck in August , with the exception of alleged studies into the possible deionization of nuclear materials .
The agency said it confronted Iran for the first time with Western intelligence reports of work linked to making atomic bombs , adding Tehran had failed to provide satisfactory answers .
Soltanieh said the intelligence , coming mainly from the U.S. and a laptop spirited out of Iran in 2005 , was fake .
“ This is 100 percent fabricated and forged , ” said Soltanieh .
Tehran was only shown some of the documents in mid-February , after it had already given its final assessment on the outstanding issues to the agency and in any case too late to be addressed in time for the February report , said Soltanieh .
United States envoy to the IAEA Gregory Schulte rejected the accusations , saying indications that Iran had conducted weapons related work had come from multiple sources , involved a number of activities and were “ very consistent ” with findings in the National Intelligence Estimate published in December .
Schulte also added that Iran has had years to answer .
“ Quite frankly , Iran could have explained these matters some years ago , ” Schulte told Reuters .
“ This should not be a matter of Iran waiting to see information . ”
The IAEA ’s 35 - nation board of governors is scheduled to meet March 3 - 7 .
Western powers suspect Iran is seeking to build atomic bombs , but Tehran insists it is seeking to master nuclear technology so it can make fuel for a planned network of nuclear power plants and save its huge oil and gas reserves for export .
“ & Teller ” is a great short video by the comedy magician Teller ( of Penn and Teller ) about being the sole survivor of a zombie epidemic in Las Vegas .

Whadda you mean “ we , ” Mr. TV Pundit ?
When you say “ we ” are doing better in Iraq or , even more absurd , that “ we ” were right to invade that country in the first place , are you putting Joe Blow American in the same bag as the top officers of Exxon , which made $ 40.6 billion in profit last year thanks to the turmoil in the energy markets ?
That royal “ we ” is good for the royals who control our government , but its persistent use embodies a pernicious lie that betrays the core ideal of representative democracy .
Ever since “ we ” invaded Iraq , most of us have gotten nothing to show for it other than an enormously increased national debt that we will be paying off for decades to come and an economy that is sputtering into recession .
Oil sold for $ 22.81 the year before the war was launched against a country with the world ’s second - largest holding , and the average price last year was almost three times that , at $ 64.20 .
With oil bouncing up to $ 100 in the fourth quarter , Exxon recorded the highest corporate quarterly return ever .
Chevron , the country ’s second - biggest oil company , saw profits rise 29 percent that quarter , contributing to an enviable profit of $ 18.7 billion for 2007 .
Clearly , what ’s good for big oil is not good for most Americans , few of whom would look back on 2007 with favor .
It ’s easy for the Bush big shots to equate the fortunes of big oil with that of the nation .
After all , George W. got to be president only because his failed career in the Texas oil industry exposed his charms to the big energy guys , who then bankrolled his political career .
Dick Cheney was an out - of - work defense secretary when picked to be CEO of Halliburton , which has profited mightily from its dealings with Exxon , not to mention running the Iraq franchise .
And the image we should all recall is of the Chevron tanker named Condoleezza Rice .
Only in America would we think it not a conflict of interest that Rice was paid handsomely for being on the board of Chevron from 1991 until she resigned to go to work in the Bush White House .
How worried can she be about the deteriorating position of the United States in the world when her oil company buddies are doing so well ?
We are conned since early childhood to look with dark suspicion upon anyone who points a finger of accountability at the robber barons of the corporate world .
It is for that reason that Exxon ’s outrageous profits made in exploiting an energy crisis that has hurt so many ordinary Americans barely elicits media outrage of any sort .
Nor does this fact get much play in the presidential race .
To her credit , Hillary Clinton took umbrage over Exxon ’s then record - setting profit of $ 39 billion last year , stating : “ I want to take those profits and put them into an alternative energy fund … that will actually begin to move us toward the direction of independence . ”
From the hysterically negative response of the right - wing media , you would have thought she had hailed the second coming of Karl Marx .
No wonder this year with even higher profits there was no similar outcry from any of the leading candidates .
They should be outraged because the taxpayers they are supposed to represent are forking over a lot of money for the military in order to make the world safe for Exxon .
The lifeline of Exxon is not its oil drilling skills but rather the power of the U.S. government , particularly the military , that can be marshaled to intimidate those nations that would dare challenge Exxon ’s right to profit exorbitantly .
Whether it ’s about pushing for a pipeline crossing Afghanistan or tying up Venezuela ’s foreign assets in international courts , as Exxon managed to do last week , the U.S. - based oil giants strut with the full confidence that Uncle Sam will back them up .
But who will back up Uncle Sam except ordinary American soldiers and taxpayers who sacrifice to fight and fund battles that have nothing to do with their national interest ?
What a sorry record U.S. oil companies have compiled in places like Venezuela , Nigeria and the Persian Gulf down through the decades .
But throughout those imperial adventures backed by U.S. gunboat diplomacy , there was the illusion that the plundered loot would be shared with the folks back home .
The next time you fork it over at the pump remember the $ 40.6 billion Exxon got , and you will get the point that “ they ” and “ we ” are hardly in the same boat .
He ’s running as a conservative in a party that touts “ the sanctity of marriage ” as one of their top issues .
Therefore his having divorced his first wife because she was involved in a bad accident , and his having married his second wife , 17 years his junior , shortly thereafter , is relevant .
John McCain likes to talk about he was a POW .
He does n’t like to talk as much about how he ditched his wife a few years after returning home .
If we ’re being asked to consider 8 more years of these people , and their morality , then it ’s time we inquired about their morality .
McCain would like us to remember the hero part , then forget the trophy bride part , even though they both happened around the same time .
You get one , you get the other .
And he was 42 years old at the time , so let ’s stop excusing Republicans for their “ youthful indiscretions ” that happened about the time of menopause .
The Bible does n’t have a statute of limitations .
If we have to live by it , they have to live by it .
From the NYT eight years ago :
Mr. McCain has acknowledged running around with women and accepted responsibility for the breakup of the marriage , without going into details .
But his supporters and his biographer , Robert Timberg , all suggest that the marriage had already effectively ended and that the couple had separated by the time he met Cindy , his present wife .
That might be the most soothing way of explaining a politician ’s divorce from a disabled wife and his remarriage to a wealthy heiress , but it does not jibe with accounts of family members and friends .

The Farm Worker Myth
In recent years , ripening crops regularly are accompanied by stories suggesting we need illegal immigrant labor to bring in the harvest .
For example , on July 20 , 2007 , a Wall Street Journal editorial entitled “ Immigration Non-Harvest , ” breathlessly began with this paragraph :
“ Peak harvest season is approaching in much of the country , and the biggest issue on the minds of many growers is n’t the weather but how in the world they ’ll get their crops from the vine or off the tree .
Thanks to Congress ’s immigration failure , farmers nationwide are facing their most serious labor shortage in years . ”
Visions of crops rotting in the fields make for vivid journalism .
But in September , 2007 a Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) Report for Congress ( updated from a 2004 version ) entitled “ Farm Labor Shortages and Immigration Policy , ” found little cause to worry about crops ripening and spoiling , stating that ,
“ Trends in the agricultural labor market generally do not suggest the existence of a nationwide shortage of domestically available farm workers … Employment on farms did not show the same upward trend as other industries during the 1990s expansion .
While nonfarm jobs generally have risen thus far in the current decade , farm jobs generally have fallen .
The length of time hired farm workers are employed has changed little or decreased over the years .
Their unemployment rate has varied little and remains well above the U.S. average , and underemployment among farm workers also remains substantial .
These agricultural employees earn about 50 cents for every dollar paid to other employees in the private sector . ”
Any significant shortage of farm workers ought to have been reflected in an increase in their wages , according to the law of supply and demand .
But , from 2001 to 2006 , the ratio of hourly field worker wages ( those engaged in planting , rending and harvesting crops ) to private nonfarm worker wages maintained a constant 0.54 for six consecutive years .
That does n’t preclude the existence of temporary spot shortages , but it does argue against a systemic shortage of farm workers .
[ A 2007 study written by Philip Martin , a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California , Davis , for the Center for Immigration Studies ( CIS ) entitled “ Farm Labor shortages : How Real ?
What Response ” further substantiated the conclusions of the CRS Report , and , consequently , challenges the premise of the WSJ editorial . ]
Busting The Myth Across Industries
Employment statistics invariably lag behind the calendar .
A March 2006 CIS study of the top 22 occupations in 2005 indicated that in no occupational category did immigrant employees outnumber native employees .
In other words , native - born U.S. workers are already doing jobs where high concentrations of illegal immigrant are also employed .
The largest share of immigrant employees was 44.7 % , and the category was “ Farming , fishing and forestry . ”
The largest raw number of immigrant employees was in “ Construction and extraction ” where 2,209,000 immigrants ( 26.1 % of the total labor force ) were outnumbered by 6,250,000 native employees .
A deeper examination into statistics that focuses on less - educated workers ( high school degree or less ) indicates a higher concentration among immigrant employees .
In “ Farming , fishing and forestry , ” less - educated immigrants outnumber natives 364,000 to 338,000 .
But , there were an estimated 56,000 unemployed ( 14.2 % ) native workers in that category .
In construction , native unemployment was 12.1 % with 577,000 unemployed native workers .
The point : low - skilled illegal immigrant workers are wage leveraging native workers out of the occupational categories typically cited by perpetuators of the myth .
The job categories include , but not limited to : farm workers , construction laborers , cleaning and maintenance providers , and food preparers .
Here ’s one example of that wage - leveraging impact from the Federation of American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) :
“ In Los Angeles , unionized black janitors had been earning $ 12 an hour , with benefits .
But with the advent of subcontractors who compose roaming crews of Mexican and El Salvadoran laborers , the pay dropped to the minimum wage of $ 3.35 per hour .
Within two years , the unionized crews had all been displaced by the foreign ones , and without any other skills , most of the native workforce did not find new work . ”
The myth becomes truth if amended to read : Illegal immigrants accept jobs that American workers wo n’t do for poverty level wages and no benefits ( including healthcare ) .
The Truth Behind The Myth
Some conspiracy theorists claim that an open borders policy aims to create poverty in the U.S. while relieving poverty in Mexico as part of a grand scheme to eventually unite the two countries into one , minimally in the style of a European Union .
The truth , though , is alluded to in a December 2006 “ Special Report ” entitled “ Undocumented Immigrants In Texas : A financial Analysis of the Impact to the State Budget and Economy , ” released by Carole Keeton Strayhorn , Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts .
Strayhorn , the mother of President George W. Bush ’s former press secretary , Scott McClellan , and an unsuccessful opponent of Texas Governor Rick Perry in the last election , offered this summary of her study :
“ The absence of the estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants in Texas in fiscal 2005 would have been a loss to our gross state product of $ 17.7 billion .
Undocumented immigrants produced $ 1.58 billion in state revenues , which exceeded the $ 1.16 billion in state services they received .
However , local governments bore the burden of $ 1.44 billion in uncompensated health care costs and local law enforcement costs not paid for by the state . ”
In other words , sure there are costs involved in hiring “ undocumented workers . ”
But , forget the laws against illegal immigration and employing illegal immigrants , say some .
The benefits are good for the Texas economy and outweigh the costs .
Two famous , now deceased , Americans warned us against uncontrolled immigration .
Barbara Jordan , Chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform , testifying before a Joint Congressional Committee on June 28 , 1995 , said ,
“ The Commission recommends the elimination of the admission [ as legal immigrants ] of unskilled workers .
Unless there is another compelling interest , such as in the entry of nuclear families and refugees , it is not in the national interest to admit unskilled workers .
Especially when the U.S. economy is showing difficulty in absorbing disadvantaged workers and efforts towards welfare reform indicate that many unskilled Americans will be entering the labor force . ”
Jordan ’s warnings were ignored , as were the words earlier of the founder and president of the American Federation of Labor , Samuel Gompers , who , in a Letter to Congress in March , 1924 , wrote :
“ America must not be overwhelmed .
Every effort to enact immigration legislation must expect to meet … two hostile forces of considerable strength .
One of these is composed of corporation employers who desire to employ physical strength ( broad backs ) at the lowest possible wage and who prefer a rapidly revolving labor supply at low wages to a regular supply of American wage earners at fair wages .
The other is composed of racial groups in the United States who oppose all restrictive legislation because they want the doors left open for an influx of their countrymen regardless of the menace to the people of their adopted country . ”
To paraphrase Will Rogers , it ’s not the warnings you do n’t hear that hurt you ; it ’s the ones you hear and do n’t heed .

CSIs now have a new tool in their belt : the chemical signatures left by local drinking water in human hair .
Scientists at the University of Utah have found that the ratios of different forms of hydrogen and oxygen in local drinking water vary from region to region across the country .
These elements are incorporated into the hair as it grows .
Traces in the hair can show where a person has recently lived or traveled , and could help police track the recent movements of criminals .
" You are what you drink — and that is recorded in your hair , " said lead researcher Thure Cerling .
Changing isotopes
Water is of course composed of two elements : hydrogen and oxygen .
But these elements can come in different forms , called isotopes , which are versions of the same chemical element but with different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei .
Most hydrogen atoms have one proton and no neutrons ( hydrogen - 1 ) , but some have one neutron ( hydrogen - 2 ) .
Similarly , oxygen commonly has eight protons and eight neutrons ( oxygen - 16 ) , but can have 10 neutrons ( oxygen - 18 ) .
Cerling and his colleague James Ehleringer found a strong link between hydrogen and oxygen isotope levels in hair and drinking water .
These different levels of isotopes can be pinned to different locales because of how rain patterns change over the country .
As clouds move off the ocean and over the land , the water with heavier isotopes generally falls first , so drinking water near the coast has more oxygen - 18 and hydrogen - 2 than water farther inland .
Cerling and Ehleringer 's team collected hair samples from barbershops and tap water samples in 65 cities in 18 states across the United States .
From tests run on the samples , they created color - coded maps that show how isotope ratios change between regions .
While they can't pinpoint an exact location , they can give a general idea of where a person has been .
" You can tell the difference between Utah and Texas , " Ehleringer said .
But Cerling added , " You may not be able to distinguish between Chicago and Kansas City . "
Tracking movements
The method developed by Cerling and Ehleringer , detailed in the Feb. 25 online issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is already being used by police to learn where unidentified murder victims might have been prior to their deaths .
Salt Lake City Police Department detectives contacted the researchers after facial reconstructions of a female murder victim found in 2000 failed to turn up any identification .
Samples of the victim's hair told detectives where she had traveled prior to her murder .
" The samples I gave to Jim told me her approximate location for the last two years of her lifetime , " said Detective Todd Park .
" She moved around within the Northwest — mainly in the Idaho - Montana - Wyoming area and maybe into Oregon and Washington . "
Police could also use this technique to check an accused criminal 's alibi as to his whereabouts at the time of a crime .
Anthropologists and archaeologists may also be able to use the method to analyze hair samples to show how ancient groups migrated .
During one horrible year starting in 1932 , the truth of Stalinism came to be seen in the massacre by starvation of as many as ten million people in what has come to be known as the Ukranian Terror Famine .
The massacre started 75 years ago today when the Soviet Government issued an order increasing the portion of their harvests that Ukranian farmers were required to give to the state , and it resulted in a wholesale collectivization of agriculture in the region .
Now , the government of Ukraine is seeking official recognition for what some say was the massacre that gave Hitler the idea that murdering every Jew in Europe might just be possible :
KRASYLIVKA , Ukraine ( AP ) —
After authorities broke into Yakiv Atamanenko ’s home in autumn of 1932 and confiscated the family ’s food , his mother and two brothers died of starvation and their bloated bodies were tossed among others in a freshly dug grave on the outskirts of this farming village .
Mr. Atamanenko and other survivors said their neighbors , Oleksandra Korytnyk and her husband , ate their two children .
“ They cut their children into pieces and ate them , ” recalled Mr. Atamanenko , now a frail , gray - haired 95 - year - old .
In the end , he and others said , the Korytnyks died as well .
Today , Ukraine marks the 75th anniversary of the terrible famine of 1932 - 33 , engineered by Soviet authorities to force peasants across what was then the U.S.S.R. to give up their privately held plots of land and join collective farms .
Millions perished .
It will offend the heck out of the Russians , but it ’s time that history recognized an event as equally evil as the Holocaust .
March 4 , 2008  -- Latinos , working - class voters , women and late deciders helped Hillary Clinton push back against Barack Obama 's recent winning streak , while some Texas and Ohio Republicans fired a warning shot at John McCain even as he clinched his party 's presidential nomination .
Latinos , Lunch Bucket Voters Put Clinton on Top
The Democratic races in these states were more closely fought , with demographics -- more Latinos in Texas , more lunch bucket voters in Ohio -- assisting Clinton after her string of losses since Feb .
9 .
She also did well with late deciders , winning those who made up their minds in the final few days by 18 points in Ohio and 23 in Texas .
Latinos in Texas accounted for a record 34 percent of voters , up from 24 percent in 2004 -- second only this cycle to New Mexico -- and they backed Clinton by 67 - 31 percent , crucial to her fortunes .
Obama hit back with 83 percent support from African - Americans , two in 10 Texas voters .
And while Clinton won white women in Texas by 21 points , the two candidates split white men evenly .
Ohio was different ; there Clinton won white men , a swing group in many Democratic primaries this year , by 58 - 39 percent .
That partly reflected the working - class nature of the state : Obama won white men who 've been graduated from college , albeit by narrower - than - usual 52 - 45 percent ; as elsewhere , Clinton won white men who do n't have a college degree , here by a wide 66 - 31 percent .
And those lacking a college education made up a greater share of white men in Ohio , 60 percent , than in Texas , 48 percent , or all primaries to date , also 48 percent .
Familiar Change vs. Experience Theme
While the theme of change continued to resonate in Ohio and Texas , it was n't by as wide a margin as in most previous primaries .
The ability to " bring needed change " beat " experience " as the most important quality in a candidate by a 17 - point margin in Ohio and by 15 points in Texas , 43 - 28 percent .
Both had among the fewest to pick change as the top attribute in any primary this year .
It mattered , given the correlation of these views and vote preferences .
Obama won " change " voters by more than 2 - 1 margins in Texas and Ohio alike , while those more concerned with experience went for Clinton almost unanimously in both states .
If a contrast were needed , the two smaller states voting Tuesday , Vermont and Rhode Island , provided it .
Obama won across demographic groups in Vermont , beating Clinton among senior citizens as well as among white women , two of her mainstays .
There his change theme prevailed over experience by more than a 30 - point margin , at the high end in primaries to date .
In Rhode Island , though , Clinton won easily ; there change beat experience by just 10 points , less than anywhere but Arkansas , and late deciders again went heavily to Clinton , by 62 - 37 percent .
Warning Signs for McCain
McCain lost few groups in Texas , but they were telling ones in terms of his challenges in the Republican base : the most religious and most conservative voters , evangelicals and those looking mainly for a candidate who shares their values , all backed Mike Huckabee .
McCain was comparatively weak among those same groups in Ohio .
But Texas was tougher to him .
There he lost values voters -- the top candidate attribute in both states -- by a wide 59 - 30 percent .
And in Texas a substantial 44 percent in preliminary exit poll results classified him as " not conservative enough . "
As noted , there were challenges within McCain 's broader victory .
In Texas , Huckabee won those who attend church more than once a week , 28 percent of GOP voters , by 27 points , 60 - 33 percent .
Evangelicals , a hefty 60 percent of Texas Republican voters , went 49 - 42 percent for Huckabee .
And Huckabee won " very " conservative voters , a third of the electorate , by 12 points .
But McCain came back with broad leads among " somewhat " conservative and moderate Republicans .
He won non-evangelicals by a huge margin , 63 - 21 percent .
He prevailed among less - frequent churchgoers , and won 82 percent of voters focused on the No. 2 attribute , experience .
He also beat Huckabee by more than 2 - 1 , 65 - 27 percent , among senior citizens , compared to with a dead heat among GOP voters younger than 65 , 44 - 43 .
In Ohio McCain did better ; he won " very " conservative voters , 51 - 41 percent .
And McCain came closer to Huckabee than usual among Ohio evangelicals , Huckabee 's mainstay , while winning non-evangelicals by nearly 50 points .
But as in Texas , a candidate who " shares my values " was the most important attribute in Ohio , and Huckabee won them there , too , albeit by a closer 48 - 40 percent .
Democratic Turnout
At 19 percent , African - Americans did n't increase their turnout in Texas , and it was well down from their 34 percent share in 1984 , when Jesse Jackson ran .
In Ohio , though , blacks ' 18 percent share was up from 14 percent in 2004 ; that aided Obama , albeit not enough .
Women increased their turnout in both states -- to 59 percent in Ohio and 57 percent in Texas , up from 52 and 53 percent , respectively , in 2004 .
And Clinton won white women by more than 2 - 1 in Ohio , as well as by 60 - 39 percent in Texas .
The upscale / downscale division among white voters was striking .
In both states Obama won college - educated white men , while Clinton won those who do n't have degrees .
In both states Clinton won college - educated and non-college - educated white women alike , but won less - educated women by broader margins .
As previously there were huge generation gaps .
Clinton again easily won seniors , by 73 - 26 percent in Ohio and 67 - 30 percent in Texas , while voters under 30 went for Obama by 16 points in Texas and 26 points in Ohio .
In both states turnout among young voters was up from 2004 , by seniors , down .
Seniors accounted for 13 percent of voters in Texas and 14 percent in Ohio , fewer than in most states this year .
Interestingly , in Texas Obama came close to Clinton among Latinos under 30 , losing them by 7 points , while she swamped him among older Latinos .
Also in both states , Clinton prevailed among mainline Democrats .
Obama approximately tied her among independents and Republicans voting in both open Democratic primaries .
It 's the Economy ... Again
The economy was the top issue in Texas and Ohio alike , and most strikingly so in Ohio , where 59 percent of Democrats ranked it as the single most important issue , second only to Michigan in the importance of the economy to Democratic voters this year .
Almost eight in 10 in Ohio were worried about their family 's finances , 38 percent were " very " worried about it and voters there almost unanimously said the national economy is in bad shape .
Slightly fewer in Texas were " very " worried about their own finances , 33 percent .
The exit poll indicated a smaller - than - previous turnout by union voters in Ohio -- 34 percent were from union households , down from 44 percent in 2004 .
At the same time it also found broad anti-trade sentiment : Eight in 10 said that trade with other countries takes more jobs from Ohio than it creates .
Anti-trade sentiment was lower in Texas , with 57 percent there saying trade takes jobs .
Whatever their candidate preference , Democratic voters had some greater criticism for Clinton than for Obama on negative campaigning -- 54 percent in Ohio and 52 percent in Texas said Clinton attacked unfairly , while fewer than four in 10 both states said Obama did .
However , more said Clinton , rather than Obama , had offered " clear and detailed plans " to address the country 's problems .
BEACH HAVEN TERRACE , N.J. , July 10 — Tired of paying as much as $ 340 per month for gas and electricity at the Cape Cod home here where he has lived for 18 months , Michael Mercurio erected a 35 - foot windmill in his backyard last fall that helped reduce his bill to about $ 114 — a year .
“ It just makes sense , ” said Mr. Mercurio , who is 61 and runs a company selling and installing windmills .
“ This is a clean , renewable source of energy . ”
Some of his neighbors say it is also annoying .
They say it is too big .
They say it is too noisy .
And some residents in this middle - class borough on Long Beach Island have gone to court to try to make him take it down , while the township has stilled it since winter .
It is a collision between the ideals of alternative energy and the suburban reality of New Jersey ’s notorious not - in - my - backyard culture , casting Mr. Mercurio in the role of a latter - day environmental knight errant and his neighbor and principal adversary as the ecological equivalent of Cruella De Vil .

The remains of the missing gorilla were found by patrolling rangers
Rangers patrolling the area of the Virunga National Park where four of the great apes were killed discovered the remains of the female , called Macibiri .
Conservation group WildlifeDirect said it would continue searching the area to locate the body of the infant , Ntaribi .
The latest casualties brings this year 's gorilla death toll to nine .
Earlier this year , two silverback male gorillas were shot dead in the same area of the park in the north - east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , while a female was killed in May .
A census carried out in 2004 estimated that 380 mountain gorillas , more than half of the world 's population , lived in the national park and surrounding Virunga volcanoes region .
Missing infant
The pair had been missing since the attack in July , which resulted in four members of the group , known to researchers as the Rugendo family , being shot dead .
At the time , conservationists in the area described the killings as " executions " because the bodies were left at the scene , whereas poachers would have sold the carcasses as either food or trophies .
Breaking the news on his Gorilla Protection blog on Thursday evening , WildlifeDirect 's Paulin Ngobobo wrote : " Macibiri , the female adult who went missing the day of the attack , is dead .
" Just 20 minutes ago , the guards came back from their patrol with her remains .
" Her infant , Ntaribi - born 26 January of last year , has not been found .
But now that the mother has been found , we are sure that the infant is dead too . "
Robert Muir , project manager for the Frankfurt Zoological Society , said the news confirmed his worst fears .
" Seeing the bones being brought back today is equivalent to seeing the dead gorilla ; it is a massive tragedy for everyone , " he told BBC News .
We have never seen a family of mountain gorillas torn apart in this way

" We had indeed hoped to find them alive ; it is very sad that we have not . "
The body of the 18 - month - old infant has not been located , but Mr Muir said no - one held out any hope of finding it alive .
" It is just the case of finding the bones , or what is left of the baby 's body , and bringing it back to the station for burial with the others .
" There is no way it would have survived without its mother . "
As for the welfare of the remaining six members of the group , he said the gun attack was unprecedented and had left conservation groups uncertain about the family 's future .
" We have absolutely no idea to how the family is going to respond .
In the absence of a silverback ( dominant male ) , the family unit has been destroyed .
" It is quite likely that a wild silverback will try to take over the group , which will cause a fair amount of stress for the family .
" But we just do n't know because it has never happened before , we have never seen a family of mountain gorillas torn apart in this way . "
The news comes on the same day that conservation groups launched an appeal to raise funds to increase the protection of the remaining gorillas .
The Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) , working with other organisations , has developed a three - month emergency action plan .
The strategy includes providing round - the - clock monitoring , increasing the number of patrols and funding an investigation into the July killings .
Dr Noelle Kumpel , ZSL's Bushmeats and Forests Conservation Programme Manager , said : " Shockingly , this is not the first time that gorillas in the park have been slaughtered in this way .
" We are calling on the public to support our appeal for funds to help us ensure that it does not happen again . "
Halloween is banned at a Brooklyn high school – and Hitler ’s to blame .
A year after Walter Petryk , 17 , came to school in a fuhrer - style mustache and Nazi uniform , Leon M. Goldstein HS for the Sciences sent home a letter on Thursday banning Halloween costumes – and Petryk is peeved .
Petryk – a senior who has already rounded up a group of about 20 students to protest the ban by dressing up anyway – is mulling masquerading as Jesus or a Hasidic Jew this year .
“ This whole ban is ridiculous and they ca n’t enforce it , ” said Petryk , of Park Slope .
“ Obviously , it ’s because of me .
“ I ’m trying to tell as many students as possible that they ca n’t do anything to us . ”
The Department of Education disagrees – and says school Principal Joseph Zaza is within his rights to ban costumes on the premises that they are “ disruptive to the educational process . ”
The DOE does n’t have an umbrella policy on costumes .
Schools , however , can require students to remove clothing that “ interferes with the learning process , ” and if students refuse , they can be suspended for up to 10 days .
But Petryk is n’t worried in the slightest – in fact , he ’s looking to fan the flames .
“ We ’re going to dress up the day before or the day after , just to annoy them , ” he said .
While students at the school told The Post they ’re split on Petryk ’s behavior , they ’re universally up in arms over the Halloween ban .
“ I do n’t care what the guy wears , ” said sophomore Brian St. Jean , 15 .
“ I just wanted to wear my ‘ Scream ’ mask at school this Halloween .
Now I can ’t . ”
“ I ’m really upset that I ca n’t dress up , ” added Karina Litvinova , 15 , a sophomore .
“ That one guy ruined it for all of us . ”

As Los Angeles struggles to restore its namesake river , a considerable obstacle has arisen -- NBC Universal , which is trying to block a public bike path from traversing its property along the waterway .
The flap over the long - planned path comes as the company is touting the green credentials of a massive residential development proposed for its back lot .
So , while the studio paints itself as a friend of the environment -- its real estate project will have hiking trails -- others see moguls trying to keep the public at bay .
One bike advocate said Universal executives told him they feared that people would use the path to lob unsolicited screenplays onto the studio ’s nearby production lot -- something that apparently happens at other spots when a Universal film scores big at the box office .
“ I think they need to build a higher fence if they ’re that worried about it , ” said Kent Strumpell , a member of the city of Los Angeles ’ bicycle advisory committee .
But the dispute may be only a harbinger of Hollywood clashes to come as bike path promoters push farther upriver .
The CBS Studio Center in Studio City sits on both sides of the waterway , and a spokesperson there declined to say if a bike path would be allowed .
City officials said Tuesday that they are trying to work with the studio .
Public plans have long called for a bike path to extend north and west from downtown Los Angeles to Canoga Park as a centerpiece of the city ’s efforts to revive the long - moribund river .
Bike paths along scenic waterways have become a staple attraction of many cities , including Boston , Chicago , Denver , Portland and Sacramento .
In fact , there is a bike path along the Los Angeles River from Vernon to Long Beach .
Universal executives said Tuesday that they are not opposed to a bike path on their property -- they just do n’t want it to run along the river .
Tom Smith , senior vice president of West Coast real estate for NBC Universal , said a riverside service road where the path would be is , for one thing , very narrow .
It is also important for studio operations and traffic .
A bike path is already penciled into Universal ’s development plan , Smith said .
The company just wants it to loop south , away from the river , deeper into the complex -- and around riverfront production offices that include those for director Steven Spielberg .
“ We have some very important , high - profile production companies that are located along that road as well , and security is a concern , ” Smith said , adding that NBC Universal plans to create a river gateway park on the northeast edge of the property .
At the same time , the media and entertainment giant is trying to gather public and political support to build 2,937 residential units on the Universal Studios back lot .
The company also wants to be a major tenant in a project next to the Red Line subway stop on nearby Lankershim Boulevard .
That proposal includes a television production facility , an office tower of up to 24 stories and another building that could be up to 34 stories .
The two projects are still in the planning stages , and the Universal Studios development needs both city and county approvals .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has already pledged his support for the projects , although other area politicians have expressed concern over their size .
In the meantime , politicians are growing impatient with Universal ’s stance on the bike lanes .
“ In my conversations with them , they say it ’s not practical , but I do n’t think they understand it ’s one of my personal priorities , ” said Councilman Tom LaBonge .
The city has already built five miles of the bike path from Riverside Drive in northern Griffith Park to Fletcher Drive near Silver Lake .
Although the river was lined with concrete decades ago to protect against flooding , narrow strips of land along both sides have been preserved as rights - of - way for maintenance workers .
City officials hope to use those strips to build a bike path on one side of the river and a pedestrian walkway on the other .
Jennifer Klausner , executive director of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition , said the bike path potentially offers the chance to give cyclists a way to get across the city without dealing with streets .
“ The beauty of the river path is that it ’s basically flat and separated from the road for people who want a quieter ride and do n’t want to hump it over a hill , ” she said .
Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said he wants Universal to study the bike path as part of its environmental reports on its project .
“ The fact is that we have a public bike path along some of the most expensive and reclusive properties along the ocean -- from Will Rogers [ beach ] to Torrance , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think it ’s a mutually exclusive proposition to have a bike path and a secure studio in the same location . ”

もうちょっと真面目にテストしないといけないが。
その後はVと（GRUB 2用の）Reiserfsと格闘する。 まだちゃんと動かない。 エンディアン問題っぽい。 一応コミットはした。 PPC では動くらしい。 ちょっとむかつく 。
今日は朝は久々に市場へ。 vieuxlille に行ったのは本当に久しぶりだった気がする。 以前とあんまりやっている人たちが変わってなくて、 ちょっと安心した。 昨日Vの家で食べた Comté がおいしかったので、市場で買ってしまった。 いっぱい買ったら高かった。 しかしおいしいので、まあいい。 パン屋はあいかわらずバイト（？）の入れ替わりが激しいな。 いっつも若い娘が何人もいるのはうれしいが 。
昨日は AVPr を観に行った。 何かいろいろ言いたいことがあったけど、 IMDbのコメントで言い尽くされているので、もういいや。 コミックをスクリーン上で再現したかっただけちゃうかと。
CG が作りやすいからって、暗くするんじゃねー。
「 なぜ動くのか」を意識す る を読んで、前に思っていたことを思い出したのだが、
中身に関心があるのかないのか、よくわからん人っているよな。
ないとしたら、それはそれでエンジニア的に問題なんだが、
少なくとも筋は通っている。
「 プログラムはなぜ動くのか」はかなり売れたらしいので、
関心を持っている人はそれなりにたくさんいて、
一応勉強しようと思うから購入するんだろう。
しかし、このぐらいの本でカバーできる範囲なんて、

スケーラビリティに興味がある。それはすばらしい。
現代のコンピューティング環境で、非常に重要で需要もあるテーマだ。
スケーラビリティを必要とするような機会は、個人ではなかなか得られない。
それは全くその通りだ。 よっぽど運が良くない限り、個人がそこまでヒットを飛ばすことはないだろうし、必要なインフラを手に入れるのも簡単ではない。
しかしだ、だからと言って、 手に入らないからと、何も勉強しなかったら、一体どうなるんだ？
そういう機会に恵まれて、 そこから急に勉強するつもりなのか？
研究者ならともかく、普通、ビジネスでは基礎からちまちま勉強している余裕なんて、ほとんど存在しないんだぜ？
分からなければ分からないままで、結局分かっている人の言うことを聞いて、言われた通りのことをやるだけで終わりなんだよ？
スケーラビリティと一言で表すのは簡単だが、 本当にやろうと思ったら、必要な知識は膨大だ。 すでに利用できるソフトウェアやハードウェア製品等はもちろんのこと、 計算量理論、グラフ理論、トランザクション管理、バス・アーキテクチャ、 イーサネットの仕組み、スイッチの仕組み、ハードディスクやメモリの故障率、TCP/IPスタック、OSのネットワーク関連システムコール、

そりゃ、 skynet のdocumentation に書いてあるように、 大して分かってない人でも分散処理を活かせるようになるのはすごいことかもしれない。 しかし、それでやれることには限度ってもんがある。 使うのが簡単になるのは結構だが、 分かってなくてもいいと言うには 現在のコンピュータはまだまだ遅すぎる。 例えば、ネットワーク遅延の間にどれだけの命令をCPUが実行できるか、 直感的に掴めるか？ こういうことがわからないと、 どう分割して効率が上がるのか／下がるのか理解できないから、 設計も実装もロクなことができない 。
個人的にはしばしば叫びたくなるんよね。 興味があるなら、ちゃんと勉強しなさい、と。
本当に興味があるなら、勉強が苦痛になるわけがないんだし。

The temple is a mile from the zig - zagging Sacsayhuaman fortress
The discovery
The temple on the periphery of the Sacsayhuaman fortress includes 11 rooms thought to have held mummies and idols .
The discovery at the famous spot overlooking the Incan capital of Cuzco includes ancient roadway and irrigation systems , said the team of experts .
Researchers are still waiting for carbon dating tests to verify the age of the ruins .
The find was made in the archeologically rich region of southern Peru that includes the famed Machu Picchu ruins .
Sequence
Made of stones and adobe , the temple is said to measure 2,700 sq ft ( 250 sq m ) and includes an area in the shape of a Chacana , an Incan religious symbol .
" It 's from both the Inca and pre-Inca cultures , it has a sequence , " Washington Camacho , director of the Sacsayhuaman Archaeological Park , told AP news agency .
" The Incas entered and changed the form of the temple , as it initially had a more rustic architecture . "
The Inca empire flourished along the western edge of South America during the 1400s , prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the next century .
The archaeologists believe the apparent irrigation system they have found was built by the Ayarmaca , who occupied the region between 900 to 1200 .
Researchers said they had been lucky to find the temple , as part of it was destroyed nearly a century ago by dynamite blasts at a nearby rock quarry .
The team 's excavations began last summer and are expected to continue for another five years .

Ominous news coming from Belgrade , the Serbian capital , which saw a huge and very nationalistic rally today led by Serbian prime minister Vojislav Kostunica against Kosovo ’s declaration of independence on Sunday .
“ Kostunica ’s rally was scary .
It is condensed clero - nationalism never seen before , not even in the 90s , ” a Belgrade - based analyst writes me .
“ Initiation of new generation .
Messages are terrifying and the night will be tough .
Groups ( many drunk ) are devastating everything they come upon .
Many embassies are targets .
Turkish embassy is the constant target — there is chaos in front of the embassy .
Ambassador is in the building and they [ are ] ready to shoot if they break in . ”
Another Belgrade contact writes that independent Radio B92 is reporting that “ the American embassy is on fire ….. and the people are coming in …. police try to put out the people who come in . ”
He later writes that his sister who lives near the U.S. embassy says , “ Now is all peaceful … two floors of the American embassy are still on fire but fireworkers try to locate the fire ….. ”
MSNBC is reporting that all U.S. staff had already been evacuated from the embassy .
But news services later reported that “ a charred body was found in the U.S. Embassy . ”
With all US embassy personnel accounted for , “ Belgrade ’s Pink TV said the body appeared to be that of a rioter . ”
My question :
How could the international community led by Washington have screwed this up so badly once again ?
A Hill staffer comments on these developments : “ Amazing .
Everything I read / heard in the weeks leading up to the Kosovar independence announcement was that the Serbs would bitch and complain , but grudgingly accept .
For what it ’s worth , the Administration briefings I received in the preceding months from [ State Department officials ] were generally assuring — they were on top of the situation and closely coordinating with European allies . ”
A U.S. official says : “ The Serbs are famous for ‘ dancing around the campfires of myth and distorted history . ’
Unfortunately it now appears that today ’s campfire is made out of our Embassy .
If it were up to me we would break dip relations , cancel all assistance programs , and expel all their dips from DC .
Using US embassies for either target practice or kindling is becoming too common . ”
Meantime , the New York Times ‘ Dan Bilefsky reports :
Serbs in northern Kosovo on Wednesday continued what appeared
to be a drive to force a partition three days after the ethnic Albanian
majority declared the province ’s independence from Serbia .
A mob of 300 Serbs wielding clubs and tools gathered on a road near this small village of ethnic Albanians in northern Kosovo ,
prompting NATO to send armored vehicles and tanks to head them off .
“ Of course the Serbs are now going to force a partition of northern Kosovo , playing by the same logic that was used to take the province away from Serbia , ” one astute Balkan watcher observes .
Does the international community have a game plan for that widely anticipated development ?
What about for if the Serbs in Bosnia decide to try to break away to join Serbia , again ?
“ I am convinced , all this mess is well coordinated and at the background of this is the struggle of Kostunica to stay in power , ” a knowledgeable Kosovar Albanian contact in the Kosovo capital Pristina said , noting that the new Serbian government is not constituted yet .
“ Kosovo is always an excuse ( unfortunately ) .
They already strated shouting at each other , [ recently re-elected Serbian president Boris ]
Tadic ’s people against Kostuncia and vice - versa ”
“ The north wo n’t be divided for now , but maybe in the future , ” the Pristina contact adds .

A larva of swallowtail butterfly Papilio xuthus which resembles bird droppings ( left ) in the early stages of development and one that resembles its host leaves ( right ) just before it transforms into a butterfly is seen in this undated handout photo .
Japanese scientists have discovered that a hormone known as juvenile hormone is the secret behind these dramatic changes .
REUTERS / Handout / Ryo Futahashi
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A hormone is the secret behind the unusual ability of young swallowtail caterpillars to disguise themselves as bird droppings and then copies of the leaves they live on before becoming butterflies , Japanese researchers found .
Writing on Thursday in the journal Science , the researchers said a special hormone -- juvenile hormone -- keeps larvae of the butterfly Papilio xuthus , which is commonly found in Japan , in their black and white bird - excrement camouflage .
As they reach the last stage of caterpillar development , levels of this hormone drop , triggering a transformation into the green leaf phase .
“ We found that juvenile hormone works as a switch for the camouflage pattern .
That is a novel aspect of this hormone , ” Haruhiko Fujiwara of the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences in Japan , who worked on the study , said in an e-mail .
Juvenile hormones are known to regulate many aspects of insect development including molt -- when an insect sheds its outer shell -- and metamorphosis -- as when a caterpillar becomes a butterfly , he said .
What Fujiwara and colleagues discovered , however , was that juvenile hormone also appears to govern this camouflage process .
He said the hormone may regulate genes involved in color , pattern and surface formation .
As for the bird - poop disguise , Fujiwara said it likely keeps the larvae safe from hungry birds until they are more mobile , but they did not study this .
MSNBC analyst : Rove Obama attack close to ' outright racist ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday January 11 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann began a segment on the presidential primary campaign with a disclaimer about the irrelevance of endorsements , saying the last time one may have made a decisive difference was when William Jennings Bryan backed Woodrow Wilson in 1912 .
That said , he noted that Barack Obama has been picking up a large number of endorsements this week , the most high - profile coming from Sen .
John Kerry , who proclaimed , " The old guard sometimes has a hard time acknowledging an individual who breaks the mold .
... Barack Obama is n't just going to break the mold .
Together , we are going to shatter it into a million pieces and rebuild our nation . "
" No official endorsements for Senator Clinton today , " Olbermann stated , " but it sure appeared as if Karl Rove was back to backing the candidate he'd love to see beaten ... writing an op -ed in the now Murdoch - owned Murdoch Street Journal , in which he explains why Mrs. Clinton won in New Hampshire and otherwise eviscerates Senator Obama , saying of the Illinois Democrat 's performance at the debate Saturday , ' His trash talking was an unattractive carryover from his days playing pickup basketball at Harvard , and capped a mediocre night . ' "
Political analyst Richard Wolffe joined Olbermann to comment on the Kerry endorsement , which he called " very well timed ... because there is a question of foreign policy experience , of where the establishment of the party is likely to go . "
He further explained that the endorsements by Kerry and by a congressman who is extremely close to Nancy Pelosi are not really intended for voters , but should be taken as " important signals to the party that not only can Obama be taken seriously , but they should consider where they put their endorsements . "
Of the Rove editorial , Wolffe stated , " Talking to some of Obama 's aides , I think they detected a pretty ugly undertone in Rove 's op - ed there .
The ' trash - talking . '
The ' basketball . '
The ' lazy ' thing .
Is he suggesting that there 's some sort of color aspect to Barack Obama 's behavior that he 's getting at ?
It was uncomfortably close to the edge of being plain - out racist . "
" That 's Karl , " said Olbermann .
The racist slant of Rove 's op - ed has already been widely noted among bloggers , with one of the more vehement writing , " When you take into consideration the malevolent genius of Karl Rove - The god damned Johnny Appleseed of fear harvesting - and understand that the higher echelon of the Republican base is being spoon - fed a concoction that consists of a feminist - socialist lesbian wife of a shill president or a lazy , jive - talking , b- ball playing huckster boy politician from Chicago ...
Rove 's ability to triangulate issues and interweave them with subtle strereotypical imagery would be fun to read if it was fiction .
Unfortunately in real life , the fat master has stirred and is testing the waters to see if his style of politics still plays . "

The number of casks being pumped is minute , given an American beer market still dominated by big corporate brewers .
But throughout the country , growth in the beer market has been almost entirely in the craft brewing segment , and that has been especially true in New York .
While the American market for craft brews and specialty imports has risen 13 percent this year , Mr. Hodson said , in New York the rise in 2007 has been much higher , partly because the beer culture in New York has lagged behind that in the rest of the country and is now catching up .
It ’s the rare bar in New York today that does n’t offer alternatives to the insipid mass - market brews .
Craft breweries have brought to American consumers every conceivable European beer genre and more than a few that Europeans never imagined .
Now , with cask - conditioned ale , Americans have the opportunity to taste beers of unmatched subtlety and authenticity .

Because cask ales are naturally carbonated and best served at cellar temperature — about 55 degrees — they have often been described as warm and flat .
But as you get to know them , it can become hard to imagine drinking beer any other way .
The softness of the bubbles and the gently cool temperature permit nuances that would otherwise be undetectable .
Cask ale is made the same way as other good beers , until it is left to mature in tanks .
Mass - market beer is filtered and pasteurized for a stable shelf life .
Cask beer is treated differently .
It goes , naturally , into casks , or firkins , if you want the British word for a container of 9 imperial gallons ( around 11 U.S. gallons ) .
Firkins used to be wooden , but now are generally made of metal .
A small dose of sugar is added to produce a secondary fermentation , just as Champagne or certain other beers are refermented in bottles .
Brewers may also add more hops and a fining material , like isinglass , to help settle the yeast and clarify the beer .
JFS said admission to the school was a religious , not a racial matter
The JFS , a state comprehensive in London , has been told to change under - subscription criteria which could result in indirect discrimination .
But the adjudicator rejected a claim against the school 's main criterion , that a pupil must have a Jewish mother .
Complaints had been made by Brent Council and two parents .
The school , in north London , is ranked outstanding by Ofsted and says it is oversubscribed - with more applicants than it has places .
The chief adjudicator , Philip Hunter , said the case involved a " very difficult " issue that could only be decided finally by a court .
The central objection was that the school broke the Race Relations Act 1976 by giving priority for places to children recognised as being Jewish by the Office of the Chief Rabbi .
The chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregation of the Commonwealth ( OCR ) - the school 's religious authority - says that to be Jewish , one 's mother has to have been born Jewish or been through a recognised conversion , or one must be converted oneself .
Race
Dr Hunter said the school 's first criteria in its admissions policy was based on religious grounds , not those of race .
" It appears to me that the policy reflects an essentially religious view , i.e. the view that those who satisfy the requirements of Orthodox Judaic law for being Jewish should be the ones given priority for admission to the school , " he said .
So the policy did not contravene the prohibition on direct discrimination on racial grounds .
But Dr Hunter objected to criteria relating to who the school would admit if it did not have enough applicants who were Jewish under Orthodox Jewish law .
The school 's policy gives preference to children who have one Jewish parent or grandparent , ahead of those of other faiths or none .
It is greatly reassuring that the authority of the office of the chief rabbi to determine the Jewish status of our applicants has been confirmed
Jews ' Free School
He said : " I accept that there is no direct discrimination as the criteria are still based on religious grounds not racial grounds ( albeit the religion of the father or the grandparents ) .
" However , those criteria may conflict with the prohibition on indirect racial discrimination .
" The point to bear in mind here is that the criteria deal with the way in which two children - neither of whom are Jewish in the religious sense - would be dealt with in terms of admission .
" One child ( the child with a Jewish father or grandparent in the religious sense ) is given preference over the child who has no such parent or grandparent .
" That does appear to me to put persons who are not ethnically Jewish at a disadvantage as compared with those who are . "
The school said it was pleased that the central aspect of its admissions policy and its underlying principle had been upheld .
" It is greatly reassuring that the determination of the criteria for admission of Jewish children to JFS has been confirmed as being a religious , not a racial matter , and the authority of the office of the Chief Rabbi to determine the Jewish status of our applicants has been confirmed , " a spokesman said .

2008年3月末，NTT東西地域会社は，いよいよNGN（Next Generation Network）サービスを開始する。その東西NTTのNGNサービスと，IPv6インターネットが併用できないことをご存知だろうか。
もちろん東 西NTTは，NGNでも従来のフレッツと同等のプロバイダとの接続サービスを提供する。プロバイダのIPv6インターネットとも接続できるようになるはずだ。しかし実際にNGNとIPv6インターネットを併用しようとすると，1台のパソコンにNGN用とインターネット用のIPv6アドレスが割り当てられる「IPv6マルチプレフィックス」という現象が発生する。この結果，2つのアドレスの使い分けがうまくいかなくなり，正常に通信できなくなるのだ。
経路と送信元アドレスの選択ができない
1台のパソコンに2つのアドレスが割り当てられることで，どのような問題が発生するのだろうか。大きな問題は2つある。（1）経路選択問題と，（2）送信元アドレス選択問題だ。
（1）の経路選択問題は，NGNに送るべきパケットをインターネットに送ったり，インターネットに送るべきパケットをNGNに送ってしまう問題だ。NGNには，インターネットと同じ体系のグローバルIPアドレスが割り当てられている。また，NGNを介して通信する相手は，独自にIPv6アドレスを取得するASPだったり，別のアドレス・ブロックを使う他の通信事業者の配下のユーザーだったりする可能性がある。
このためパソコンやルーターは，あて先のIPアドレスだけを見ても，パケットをどちらに転送すればよいかは，正確には判断できない。NGN用とインターネット用のルーターが別になっている場合，パソコンが転送先のルーターを間違ってしまう可能性がある。また1台のルーターがNGNとインターネットの両方につながっている場合，ルーターが転送先を誤ってしまう可能性がある。このようにして転送先を間違えてしまうと，パケットは決して相手には届かない。NGNとインターネットはつながっていないからだ。
（2）の送信元アドレス選択問題は，パケットの送信元アドレスの選択を誤ってしまい，通信相手が返信しようとして送ったパケットが自分の元に届かなくなるという問題だ。IPv6では，送信元アドレスの候補が2つ以上あるとき，プレフィックス（接頭部分）が通信相手のアドレスのプレフィックスになるべく近いアドレスを，送信元アドレスとして選択する。このルールを「ロンゲスト・マッチ」という。このルールを適用すると，NGNに送るパケットの送信元アドレスにインターネットから割り当てられたアドレスを使ってしまう，あるいはインターネットに送るパケットの送信元アドレスにNGNから割り当てられたアドレスを使ってしまうことがあり得る。
根本的な解決策はまだ見えない
IPv4環境でも，複数のネットワークに接続するようなことはあった。例えばインターネットとフレッツ・ユーザー専用サービス「フレッツ・スクウェア」を併用する場合だ。しかし，IPv4環境では（1）片方がプライベート・アドレスを使うため，経路選択が難しくない，（2）ルーターがNATを使いアドレス変換するため，送信元アドレス選択を誤ることがない――ため問題は起こらない。
一方 ，IPv6環境では，マルチプレフィックス問題はNGNのサービス開始前から一部で発生していた。例えば，東西NTTがBフレッツ上で提供しているテレビ電話サービスとプロバイダのIPv6インターネットとを併用する場合だ。ただし，実際にテレビ電話とIPv6インターネットを併用しようとするユーザーは多くなかったため，注目を集めてこなかった。
しかし，NGNが多くのユーザーに受け入れられるようになると，事情は変わってくる。NGNを導入したがために，インターネットではIPv6を使えないというユーザーが相当数出てくる可能性がある。
このようなマルチプレフィックス問題の解決策として，例えば，NGNでは閉域網での利用を前提とした「ユニーク・ローカル・ユニキャスト・アドレス」（ULA）という種類のIPv6アドレスを使うといったことが議論されている。しかし，ULAは大規模ネットワークでの使用や，ネットワーク間の相互接続を前提としていないため，そのままではNGNでは使えないといった難点がある。
検討が進まないのは ，「 NGNがIPv6ネットワークでできており，しかも閉域網なのは日本特有の構成。このためIETFでは最近になって問題と認知され始めた」（インテック・ネットコア
IPv6研究開発グループの金山健一研究員）という事情もあるようだ。結果として東西NTTのNGNサービスは，IPv6マルチプレフィックス問題を先送りしたまま始まってしまうことになる。NGNとIPv6インターネットを併用したいユーザーは，当面，NGN用のLANとIPv6インターネット用のLANを分けたり，IPv6インターネット利用時にはNGNのIPv6接続を止めるといった自衛策をとる必要がある。
NGNとIPv6インターネットのマルチプレフィックス問題が，今後どのように収束するかは記者には見当がつかない。
いずれIETFや総務省の調査研究会で解決策が決まり，それに基づいて東西NTTがNGNを修正するのがありそうなシナリオだ。だが，いったん構築したネットワークを修正する作業は難易度が高い。一方，IPv6インターネットかNGNのどちらかが普及せず，現実的な問題にならないという可能性もある。また，既存プロバイダのIPv6インターネット接続サービスは壊滅状態になるだろうが，東西NTTがNGNでIPv6インターネット接続サービスを提供して，マルチプレフィックス環境を不要にするという，技術的にはすっきりした解決策も考えられる。
いずれにして もIPv6マルチプレフィックス問題は，政策や事業者間の利害も絡む複雑な問題として尾を引くことは間違いない。解決にはまだ時間がかかりそうだ。記者としては，解決策が施されない間にNGNとIPv6インターネットが普及し，ユーザーがNGNとIPv6インターネットのどちらかを選択しなければならないような状況に陥らないことを祈るばかりだ。
I have been watching a chart of Borrowed Bank Reserves for several weeks .
The action is unprecedented .
Borrowed Reserves of Depository Institutions
click on chart for sharper image .
The NFORBES Chart above is courtesy of St. Louis Fed .
Here 's an interesting excerpt from the book Investing Public Funds by Girard Miller about borrowed reserves .
" Another useful indicator of the Federal Reserve 's relative monetary policies can be found weekly in the Federal Reserve data .
A key statistic is the net free reserves or net borrowed reserves line item .
This statistic measures the degree to which depository institutions have found it necessary to obtain funds in the Fed Funds market and through the Fed discount window in order to obtain required reserves .
During periods of central bank credit - tightening operations , the depository sector might find it necessary to borrow funds to meet reserve requirements .
This practice results in net borrowed reserves , which shows as a negative number .
Conversely , if ample funds are available through the banking system to meet reserve requirements , banks can become net lenders of reserves through the Fed Funds markets "

The Federal Reserve 's latest loan auction through its Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) produced the lowest interest rate , lowest bid - to - cover ratio and fewest bidders yet .
The lower demand suggests an improved liquidity situation in financial markets .
Yesterday 's auction of 30 bln usd 28 - day loans came in at a 3.123 pct interest rate , a 1.25 bid - to - cover ratio and 52 bidders .
This was the fourth auction under the new TAF program designed to relieve pressure in the short - term , inter - bank funding market .
The Role Of The Monolines
If bond insurers are downgraded a lot , banks will need as much as $ 143 billion in fresh capital to absorb the impact , Barclays Capital estimated Friday .
Citigroup Inc. ( C ) , Merrill Lynch & Co. ( MER ) Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ) , and Wachovia Corp . ( WB ) are among U.S. banks most exposed to bond insurers , or " monolines " as they 're also known , Barclays Capital wrote to investors .
The world 's financial institutions will have to write down a further $ 300 bn ( £ 152bn ) of US sub - prime losses before the crisis is over , according to a study by consulting firm Oliver Wyman .
" While governments , central banks and regulators scramble to address the aftermath of the sub - prime fallout , several other crises are mounting . "
Tumbling property prices - especially in the UK and Spain - a weakening dollar , a possible collapse in commodity prices , and a fall in Chinese and Indian stocks will " disrupt " the global economy , the report claimed .
Large money center banks have virtually frozen their balance sheets , reluctant to lend even to good credit
Banks Raise ATM
Fees to $ 3.00
" They 're looking for ways to make up for the losses and nickel and diming appears to be the only way they can do it , " Consumer Affairs analyst Joseph Enoch said .
Today , the average ATM fee is $ 1.78 , while five years ago it cost a little more than a $ 1 to retrieve money from a bank with which you did n't have an account .
In some areas , JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America and Wachovia fees have hit $ 3 for non-customers .
Some banks now charge their own customers a fee for the convenience of using an ATM to the disdain of some .
Savings Deposit Rates
$ 3.00 ATM Fees Will Backfire
Some customers will stop using anything but their own bank 's ATMs .
Instead of getting $ 1.50 banks will get nothing .
Some customers will opt to max out the cash they take on each transaction to minimize the number of transaction fees .
Banks charging their own customers will find many switching banks out of resentment .

Sleep deprivation seems to start early .
A 2004 survey by the National Sleep Foundation found that on average , children in every age group from infancy through fifth grade failed to get even the low end of the recommended range of sleep .
The real agony emerges in adolescence .
As children go through puberty , two things happen to make getting enough sleep problematic : they need more sleep than prepubescent children , not less — 9 to 10 hours a night — and their body clocks shift to a later time to fall asleep and , consequently , a later awakening .
Amy R. Wolfson , a psychologist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester , Mass . , and Mary A. Carskadon , a sleep researcher at the Brown School of Medicine in Providence , R.I. , have found that few adolescents sleep the amount they need .
The average eighth grader sleeps less than eight hours , and more than a quarter of high school and college students are chronically sleep deprived , they reported .
In a report last February in the journal Pediatrics , researchers from the Columbia University School of Nursing estimated that “ 15 million American children are affected by inadequate sleep . ”
They based this on the findings of a national health survey in 2003 of 68,418 children ages 6 to 17 .
In the study , by Arlene Smaldone and colleagues , the percentage of children who failed to sleep enough rose with age and increased markedly among children 12 and older .
Sleep deprivation has been linked to poorer grades , moodiness and depression .
Though you may question which comes first , Avi Sadeh , a psychologist at Tel Aviv University , studied the effects of adding or subtracting one hour of sleep on 77 children in the fourth and sixth grades .
Those deprived of an hour ’s sleep performed less well on tests for reaction time , recall and responsiveness than the children who slept the extra hour .
Insufficient sleep in the teenage years has been associated with increased risks of disciplinary problems , sleepiness in class and poor concentration , not to mention traffic accidents .
With televisions and computers in their rooms , many teenagers cannot resist the temptation to stay up late , especially because their bodies do not begin to produce the sleep hormone melatonin until 1 a.m. , as opposed to 10 p.m. in most adults .
I do n’t mean to nitpick , but let ’s not just outright lie about this entire affair and then pretend it ’s going to go away .
After talking about her sniper - fire - ful trip to Bosnia for four months , now that Hillary got talking just making it all up she ’s claiming that she only said it once .
She said it four times and then her staff sent even more people out to claim it was true .
Here ’s what Hillary is claiming today :
“ You know I have written about this and described it in many different settings and I did misspeak the other day .
This has been a very long campaign .
Occasionally , I am a human being like everybody else .
The military took great care of us .
They were worried about taking a First Lady to a war zone and took some extra precautions and worried about all sorts of things .
I have written about it in my book and talked about it on many other occasions and last week , you know , for the first time in 12 or so years I misspoke . ”
Last week ?
That ’s simply a lie , and at this point Hillary knows it .
She said it four times over four months .
She sent out scores of aides to defend the comments – comments she said FOUR TIMES .
And now expects us to believe that she only said it once a week ago , so it was a slip of the tongue ( mind you , it was a minute long slip of the tongue ) ?
As Joe writes below , the fog of nonsense coming from Hillary and her people is getting rather absurd .
And just as incredible , the Clinton people are now saying they ’re not going to answer any more questions about this issue .
News flash :
Just because your latest talking point is to have the entire campaign lie about what really happened and now claim that it was only one time , does n’t change the fact that we have her on film saying it four different times .
The real revelation in recent footage of protests over the Beijing Olympics was not the image of a Reporters Without Borders demonstrator being dragged away by Greek security guards dressed like stewards on the Hindenburg .
It was that during his protest , at the Athens torch - lighting ceremony , the sole camera feed cut first to a long shot making it difficult to see what was happening , then cut away entirely -- to stock footage .
After a decent interval , coverage returned to the main event : a boom - camera shot of a stately ceremony featuring women in faux - classical gowns .
This is the kind of emergency editing that viewers of Syrian or Burmese TV are accustomed to seeing when the news takes a direction unfavorable to local dictators .
It says something about the so - called spirit of the Olympics that the first inclination of the people covering the event was to try to suppress unwanted information .
And it says even more about the contemporary media and political environment that this and similar efforts are failing , spectacularly .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has hinted that he might decline to attend the opening ceremonies .
President Bush , who is planning to attend , nevertheless has had strong words for President Hu Jintao about China ’s harsh suppression of Tibetan demonstrations .
The route of the Olympic torch has thus far been plagued by obstructions , protests and banners .
And the violence in Tibet has cast a possibly lasting pall over the Summer Games .
At times like these , it ’s customary to repeat bromides about how the grandeur of amateur competition should transcend parochial interests .
And it ’s true that legitimate concerns about human rights , democracy and the behavior of authoritarian thugs can lead to knee - jerk politicization of the event -- such as recent strident calls for Bush to shun the Games .

But this is shaping up to be the most exciting political Olympics since the end of the Cold War .
The speed with which Beijing has lost control of the Olympic script is not cause for cynicism but for celebration .
Strife , ferment and the painful progress toward liberal modernity by a freedom - challenged great power may not be what the International Olympic Committee prefers to show us , but it ’s a lot more interesting than another round of sports utopianism and pretty production values .

Some 150 students donned hoods and turned their backs in silent protest of former Attorney General John Ashcroft at Cornell University on Thursday .
Cornell law student and protest co-planner Michael Siegel told Truthdig the demonstrators were meant to represent “ the detainees who were arrested and imprisoned without due process under Ashcroft ’s leadership . ”
“ The coordinated action was a result of several meetings among student leaders and community activists .
Our goal was to present a powerful , critical response to Ashcroft ’s Patriot Act and other oppressive policies .
We wanted to engage as many people as possible in creative rebellion .
We looked at examples of prior demonstrations including the Columbia protest of the Minute Men , as well as protests of Alberto Gonzalez and other Bush administration officials .
We discussed the most likely attack on our work : i.e. , that we would ‘ suppress free speech ’ by protesting .
“ Ultimately , a coalition of labor organizers , liberals , hippies and radicals managed to reach consensus on this direct action .
We stretched the limits of our ‘ campus code ’ regarding dissent and presented an example of what unified action can achieve .
All of us are excited about the result :
We owned the room for 20 minutes .
After we stood up , Ashcroft stammered and said he did not know what to do .
Only after the campus Republicans shouted ‘ Keep going ! ’ did the former AG attempt to regain his flow .
We stood silently , disciplined and determined , forcing the crowd to consider the victims of Ashcroft ’s oppression . ”

The Warcraft Virtual Reality
Pod I have been mulling around the idea of making myself a home brewed virtual reality booth for some time now but never really made the time to do it .
It 's been on the back burner .
But lately , after somebody offered me a free trial subscription to warcraft this project came back to the forefront .
I have been playing Warcraft in the evenings and really enjoying it .
Well , I put two and two together and finally thought : " Maybe I could build the virtual reality chamber now and use it for playing Warcraft ! "
So that 's what I did .
The project took me two full days to complete and here is a little bit about it .
Inside the Warcraft Pod I have two computers set up inside .
the first computer is used to play Warcraft and the second computer , mounted on the wall to the left of the seat is my research computer .
I use this research computer to look up maps , quests and other information while I am playing .
The keyboard for this second computer hangs over the main computer .
Other things - The seat is a nice and comfortable bucket seat from a volkswagen fox and behind the seat is a mini refrigerator so I do n't have to leave the pod to get a drink or a snack .
I also mounted a telephone in the booth , you can see it on the left of the main computer .
I also mounted speakers in the corners and have a clipboard for taking notes .
About the mini-refrigerator :
It was an after - thought to the whole project so I had to squeeze it in the back and it is a bit awkward opening the door but it will have to stay .
If I redesign the pod I will place the fridge in a more convenient location .
The Size of the Warcraft Pod Here is a view of the Pod .
It is eight feet long and four feet tall .
You can see the two computers mounted on the outside .
I have these run into a router so they both have internet access .
This way I can play the game on one computer and look up resources , maps and information on the other without having to leave the game or alt - tab .
Learn More about the Warcraft Pod including more pictures and a bit about the assembly of it If you are not a warcraft player you are missing out on something special !

The US homeland security secretary , Michael Chertoff , has insisted the six Guantánamo Bay prisoners accused over the September 11 attacks will be fairly tried , despite concerns about a " show trial " .
Military prosecutors said yesterday they would seek the death penalty against the six , including the alleged mastermind of the plot , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and the alleged would - be 20th hijacker , Mohammed al - Qahtani , as well as funders of the plot and men alleged to be coordinators between the 19 hijackers and al - Qaida operatives .
The defence department , which is leading the prosecution through a much - criticised process of military commissions , issued 169 charges against the men , including conspiracy , murder in violation of the law of war , attacking civilians , destruction of property and terrorism .
Mohammed , the highest profile of the six , has confessed to being responsible " from A to Z " for 9/11 , according to the Pentagon .
Human rights campaigners expressed concern about the interrogation techniques used to obtain such confessions .
The director of the CIA , Michael Hayden , admitted for the first time last week that Mohammed had been waterboarded - subjected to simulated drowning , which is widely seen as torture .
Speaking to the Washington Post , Vincent Warren , the executive director of the Centre for Constitutional Rights , which has represented many of the Guantánamo detainees , said the cases were " essentially show trials " .
He said : " They are being used to justify six years of lawlessness and barbarity this government has been doing . "
But Chertoff told the BBC there would be " full due process and defence lawyers and all of the fundamental rights that would bring to justice those [ who ] were responsible for one of the worst war crimes in world history " .
Asked whether evidence extracted from waterboarding would be used , Chertoff said : " The judges will decide what 's reasonably admissible and what 's not admissible . "
The announcement of the charges brings to a head the simmering conflict over the legal treatment of the 275 detainees remaining at Guantánamo , and particularly the 15 " high - value " suspected terrorists held since September 2006 .
Lawyers working on behalf of detainees have long criticised the commissions process – in which even the judges are military personnel - as unfair , unduly secret and against the US constitutional right to habeas corpus .
According to the British lawyer Clive Stafford Smith , who works with Guantánamo detainees , only one of the six men charged yesterday has had access to a lawyer in recent months .
At least two more of the six had been put through " enhanced interrogation " techniques that include sleep deprivation and questioning for up to 20 hours at a time .
All these concerns will be amplified by the decision to press for capital punishment , which is certain to arouse European opposition on those grounds alone .
It also presents the Pentagon with logistical problems as there is only one lawyer qualified to prosecute a death penalty case within its military commissions team .
Stafford Smith said the move played into the terrorists ' hands .
" They want to be martyrs .
If we execute them , we fulfil their greatest wish .
This is a long process of them getting what they want and that makes us all less safe . "
The next stage in the process will be for the charges to be reviewed by a supervising judge , Susan Crawford .
She will have to decide whether to allow the prosecution to seek the death penalty .
The charges come at a sensitive time in the tussle over the military commissions .
The supreme court heard arguments about the legality of the system last December when opponents argued the removal of habeas corpus from detainees was unconstitutional .
The court , which is expected to give its ruling in a few weeks , struck down the military tribunals in 2006 .
But the Bush administration responded by passing legislation to legitimise the system .
Amnesty International also expressed concern about the fairness of the trials .
Rob Freer , its US researcher , said : " No US citizen would be tried under these military commissions , rendering them discriminatory , in violation of international law .
" The international community must challenge the US to drop these military commissions and conduct trials in front of independent and impartial courts , without resort to the death penalty . "
Some relatives of the September 11 victims have welcomed the charges and the possibility of death sentences .
Patricia Bingley , who lost her son Kevin Dennis in the attacks , said : " I believe if there is real evidence that these people had any connection , no matter how small , they should be found guilty .
I 'm not a bit bothered over how they are going to die . "
Diane Horning , who lost her son Matthew , said : " I know my son opposed the death penalty , so I oppose it .
It would n't be true to his spirit to condone that . "
Mike at Techdirt reports that the Australian government has officially declared their internet filtering program , which they started about a year ago as an attempt to protect kids from pornography , a complete failure .
Only 144,000 copies of the software were downloaded or ordered on CD - ROM with only about 29,000 actually being used .
On top of that , kids were able to hack them anyway .
This would n't be so bad if the Australian government had n't spent 85 million dollars on this program ( it is a central part of a larger initiative that cost , all in all , 189 million dollars ) ; quite a nice amount to throw away for something that anyone who has a clue would have declared a failure right from the beginning .
Let it be known , once and for all : if a smart , computer - savvy 16 year old wants porn , no technical barrier will be able to stop him .
This is a natural law , similar to the laws of gravity or thermodynamics .

DETROIT , Jan 15 ( Reuters ) - Natural fibres derived from hemp , coconut , bamboo or kenaf could be used in car interiors to get away from the “ plastic feeling ” of many cars on the road .
" What is going to be key for cars is the way the interior feels , smells , sounds and looks like , " said Philippe Aumont , the product planning vice president at French car parts group Faurecia EPED .
PA .
He said statistics in Europe showed the majority of people buy their cars without a test drive .
“ So the time they spend in the showroom is very important - the click of a button , the touch of the dashboard , the feel of the steering wheel , the sound of closing the glove compartment , ” he said on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show on Tuesday .
“ It is all about perceived quality . ”
Faurecia , majority controlled by Europe 's second - biggest volume carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP .
PA , has comfort enhancement of interiors as one of its business priorities , alongside safety and environmental issues .
Aumont said there was a trend towards ‘ premiumisation ’ of car interiors as more and more carmakers seek to chase the premium clients because that is a fast growing market segment .
In Europe , for instance , the overall car market was flat to lower while there was a 20 percent year on year growth in the premium segment which starts with such cars as the Audi A4 from Volkswagen VOWG .DE , the BMW BMWG .DE 3 series or the new Renault RENA .
PA Laguna and Citroen C5 .
At the other end of the market are the no-frills models such as the coming Tata TAMO .
BO Nano or the Logan of Renault 's Dacia .
In between , will be the run -of - the mill volume models that will use hand - me - downs of their more expensive stablemates .
Aumont said the advantage of the natural fibres was not only their feel but also they were ‘ greener ’ --
“ We are resorting to materials that have already used CO2 in their life , it does not add to CO2 emissions , ” he said .
“ Land needs primarily to be used to grow crops to feed humans and animals .
But what is not used from the crop -- like the core of a corn cob -- can be used for its fibre , ” he said .
Kenaf , for instance , can be used in dashboards , and bamboo fibres can strengthen seats .
Coconut is used in the ‘ shell ’ of the car interior and hemp in the lining of doors .
Aumont said U.S. carmakers were looking to European suppliers like Faurecia to deliver the premium interiors of their German rivals .
Faurecia , which is on the Audi A4 , Mini Clubman or BMW X6 , also worked with Cadillac on the CTS and does the instrument panel and seats of the 2008 North American Car of the Year Award winner - the Chevrolet Malibu .
Faurecia first half 2007 sales in North America were up by 40 percent compared with the previous year .
In security , the trend is towards gadgets that can sense when an accident might be happening and act to limit damage to the car occupants -- with products such as active head restraints that limit the distance between the headrest and the head at time of impact .
Another trend will be how to handle all those electronic gadgets from PDAs and Ipods to mobile phones .
" You get in your car with all these things in your pockets and you will have to store them somewhere and there should be some kind of docking system -- because it will still take a long time before we have wireless power supply , " Aumont said .

Jeremy Keith ’s “ Year Zero ” beautifully explains why the W3C needs our backs , not our bullets .
The W3C is maddeningly opaque and its lieutenants will sometimes march madly into the sea , but it is all that stands between us and the whirlwind .
Slow the W3C will always be .
Slow comes with the territory .
If you glimpse even a hint of the level of detail required to craft usable standards , you ’ll understand the slowness and maybe even be grateful for it — as you ’d be grateful for a surgeon who takes his time while operating on your pancreas .
But the secrecy ( which makes us read bad things into the slowness ) must and will change .
To my knowledge , the W3C has been working on its transparency problems for at least two years and making real change — just very slowly ( there ’s that word again ) and incrementally and hence not at all obviously .
Key decision makers within the W3C intend to do much more , but they need to get their colleagues on board , and consensus - building is a bitch .
A slow bitch .
If designers and developers are more aware of the problems than of the fact that the W3C is working to solve them , it ’s because the W3C is not great at outreach .
If they were great at outreach , we would n’t have needed a Web Standards Project to persuade browser makers to implement the specs and designers and developers to use them .
Designers sometimes compare the slow pace of standards with the fast pace of , say , Flash .
But it is like comparing the output of the United Nations to the laws passed by a small benevolent dictatorship .
When a company owns a technology , it can move fast .
When a hundred companies that mistrust each other need to agree to every detail of a technology that only exists insofar as their phones and browsers support it , surprise , surprise , the pace is quite slow .
The W3C is working on its speed issues , too .
It ’s been forced to work on them by outside groups and by the success of microformats .
But detailed interoperability of profound technologies no company owns is never going to happen half as fast as we ’d like .
You want instant gratification , buy an iPod .
You want standards that work , help .
Or at least stop shouting .

To describe the ongoing Blackwater scandal as a fiasco would be a dramatic understatement .
Not only do we have a situation in which private security contractors stand accused of killing Iraqi civilians without provocation , we also have deep divisions brewing between the Pentagon and the State Department , coupled by State stonewalling a congressional investigation .
A confrontation between the U.S. military and the State Department is unfolding over the involvement of Blackwater USA in the shooting deaths of Iraqi civilians in a Baghdad square Sept. 16 , bringing to the surface long - simmering tensions between the military and private security companies in Iraq , according to U.S. military and government officials . [...]
“ This is a nightmare , ” said a senior U.S. military official .
“ We had guys who saw the aftermath , and it was very bad .
This is going to hurt us badly .
It may be worse than Abu Ghraib , and it comes at a time when we ’re trying to have an impact for the long term . ”
At this point , the State Department seems to be treating Blackwater contractors as the agency ’s own private army , accountable to no one outside the department .
The Maliki government believes Blackwater is a criminal enterprise , the Iraqi people resent Blackwater ’s presence , the Pentagon believes Blackwater is lying about the Sept. 16 incident in Nisoor Square , and congressional Democrats have questions about what has transpired — which the State Department refuses to answer .
This is a debacle so severe and humiliating , only the Bush administration could pull it off .
David Kurtz offers this helpful timeline of events that sets the stage for where we are now .
Interview with EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner ' We Should n't Create Alarm '
The world financial markets are jittery and many banks and insurers have yet to release their figures for 2007 .
More huge losses as a result of the subprime crisis are likely .
EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told SPIEGEL ONLINE why he sees no reason for panic .
Every language ’s standard library has its weak spots .
In C , for example , the stdio functions do n’t have a consistent notion of where the FILE * belongs in the argument list .
For fwrite , it goes at the end ; for fseek , it ’s at the beginning .
This makes it harder to abstract away the details of the API .
Instead of remembering “ the FILE * always goes at the front ” , I have to memorise the order in which each specific function takes its arguments .
Of such niggles are programmer annoyance born .
Haskell is n’t immune to poor API design .
Partial function application is ubiquitous , as is the use of maps ( the equivalent of hash tables , dicts , or what have you in imperative languages ) .
Unfortunately , although the Data .
Map API is admirably thorough , it firmly resists partial application .
Yesterday , I wrote a quick program to find out , for a given GHC RPM , what versions of various libraries it ’s bundled with .
The easiest way to do this is by parsing the output of “ rpm - ql ghc682 “ , looking for lines like this ( library name and version in bold ) :
/usr/lib64/ghc-6.8.2/lib/Cabal-1.2.3.0
This information is easy to pull out using a regexp .
type PkgName = String type PkgVersion = String packageInfo :: FilePath -> Maybe ( PkgName , PkgVersion ) packageInfo path = do ( [ _ , name , version ] : _) <- path = ~~ " .*/ lib/([ ^/]+ ) -( [ 0 - 9 ] [ .0 - 9 ] * ) " return ( name , version )
If I slurp the entire output of rpm into a single string , I can build a map of name to version quite cleanly .
( I ’m importing the Data .
Map module under the name M here . )
buildMap :: String -> M.Map PkgName PkgVersion buildMap = foldl ' updateMap M.empty . map packageInfo .
lines
The problem is that updateMap is n’t as tidy as I ’d like , because Data .
Map ‘s functions are generally not friendly to partial application .
updateMap :: PkgMap -> Maybe PkgInfo ->
PkgMap updateMap map ( Just ( name , version ) ) = M.insert name version map updateMap map _ = map
Here , foldl ' wants the accumulator ( my map ) as its first argument , but M.insert for some reason puts the map argument at the end of its list .
As a result , I had to write the above bulky definition for updateMap to fix up the argument ordering .
Here ’s an alternative order of arguments for M.insert .
insertM :: ( Ord a ) => M.Map a b -> a -> b ->
M.
Map a b insertM map key value = M.insert key value map
As you can see , it just moves the map argument to the front .
If the API looked like this , my updateMap function would be considerably shorter .
I could get rid of the pattern matching and use maybe instead .
updateMap ' m = maybe m ( uncurry ( insertM m ) )
It ’s a happy accident that foldl ' wants its arguments in what I think of as the “ natural ” order for partial application .
Just so we do n’t conflate the two considerations , a comparable example that has nothing to do with folds is M.findWithDefault , which has the following type .
findWithDefault :: ( Ord k ) => a -> k -> Map k a -> a
This takes a default value as its first argument , which is returned if the key is n’t present in the map .
Viewed through the “ does it make sense for partial application ? ” lens , this is good : findWithDefault " foo " gives us a function that always returns " foo " if a lookup fails .
Weirdly , the second argument is the key to look up , not the map to perform the lookup in .
So findWithDefault " foo " " bar " gives me a function that will look for the key " bar " in a given map .
In practice , I ’ve found that this is almost never the order of arguments I want .
Just about always , I find myself wanting “ given this map , look up some key ” instead .
There is , to be sure , an element of judgment and experience in deciding on the order of arguments to a function .
However , unlike in C , where argument ordering is merely an annoyance , making an API harder to learn , in Haskell this decision has practical consequences : it directly affects how usable your API is .

It 's the age of insanity ,
What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem .
Ain't got no ambition , I 'm just disillusioned
I 'm a twentieth century man but I do n't want to be here .
My mama said she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Just give me some security ,
I 'm a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century .
You keep all your smart modern writers
Give me William Shakespeare
You keep all your smart modern painters
I 'll take Rembrandt , Titian , Da Vinci and Gainsborough ,
Girl we gotta get out of here
We gotta find a solution
I 'm a twentieth century man but I do n't want to die here .
I was born in a welfare state
Ruled by bureaucracy
Controlled by civil servants
And people dressed in grey
Got no privacy got no liberty
' cause the twentieth century people
Took it all away from me .
Do n't want to get myself shot down
By some trigger happy policeman ,
Gotta keep a hold on my sanity
I 'm a twentieth century man but I do n't want to die here .
My mama says she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Ain't got no security ,
I 'm a twentieth century man but I do n't want to be here .
This is the twentieth century
But too much aggravation
This is the edge of insanity
I 'm a twentieth century man but I do n't want to be here

Some of you already saw this story .
A man was fired for posting a Dilbert comic that suggested his management was a bunch of drunken lemurs .
http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071219/NEWS/712190360
Over the years , a number of people have approached me in public , or e-mailed me , to say they also got fired for posting Dilbert comics on walls .
I do n’t know how many of those stories , if any , are true .
If you intend to mock your boss with Dilbert comics , the trick is in knowing which comics to pick .
Apparently there is a fine line between posting a comic that criticizes a particular policy decision , versus a comic that calls your boss an inebriated prosimian .
( Thank you , Wikipedia . )
In order to get his unemployment benefits , the perpetrator had to convince a judge that he was merely stupid , not intentionally misbehaving .
He succeeded , but it ’s not the sort of victory he should feel good about , as in “ Yay !
The judge agrees I ’m an idiot !
It ’s going to be in the newspaper and all over the Internet ! ”
The moral of this story is that if you plan to circulate a Dilbert comic calling your boss a drunken lemur , the best way is to use your boss ’s unattended computer to e-mail it to the entire company .
Drum roll , please .
Maboud Ebrahimzadeh
Never heard of him ?
You saw him in action yesterday .
Here ’s the AP ’s account of his brilliant performance .
Mukasey protesters act out waterboarding
For once , the AP ’s headline is dead - on accurate .
On Monday , about 25 protesters describing themselves as anti-war activists and actors responded with a demonstration of waterboarding that brought a volunteer to retching coughs and tears in less than four minutes .
“ I wanted desperately to scream but I could n’t because as soon as I would – water , ” said Maboud Ebrahimzadeh , a 26 - year - old Iranian - American actor from Maryland .
“ Water would go through the mouth and through the nose . ”
Set up outside the Justice Department ’s headquarters , Ebrahimzadeh struggled against his supposed interrogators as they yelled questions and forced him to lie on his back , a cloth over his face , his legs elevated .
They poured two gallons of water over his face .
The process was supposed to resemble the process that CIA interrogators are believed to have used on terror detainees until a few years ago .
However , Ebrahimzadeh ’s interrogators put a plastic cage between his face and the cloth to make sure he did not inhale too much water and , potentially , drown or asphyxiate .
Hearing about it pales in comparison to seeing it , so here ’s the man himself in his starring role .
All that wriggling around , the look of fear , the emotional speech afterward .
It ’s all so …convincing .
He ’s a genius !
It ’s good to see that the star of Five Petals , Get Stuffed , and Fear Up is finally getting his day in the sun .

Police quoted by Italian media say Mayor Giovanni Piscitelli , 52 , was shot and wounded and his feet bound with wire .
Then his car was set alight .
Reports said Mr Piscitelli had recently acted against some municipal staff and the dispute had been featured on TV .
Police have not yet named any suspects in the case .
Mr Piscitelli's charred body was found next to his car - apparently after he had managed to open a door to escape the flames .
The car was in a mountainous area a few kilometres from Cervino .
The centre - left mayor was elected in 2004 .
POLL : MCCAIN SHOULD TAP CONSERVATIVE RUNNING MATE POLL : MCCAIN SHOULD TAP CONSERVATIVE RUNNING MATE WASHINGTON - Republican voters know what they want John McCain to look for in a running mate : a conservative .
In a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll this month , more than two - thirds of Republicans and Republican - leaning independents said it was important that McCain choose someone who is " considerably more conservative " than he is on the issues .
Although he has the Republican nomination in hand while the Democratic battle rages on , McCain continues to be viewed with suspicion by some of the conservatives who make up the core of the GOP .
In the survey , 33 % of Republicans said they would enthusiastically vote for McCain if he did n't choose someone more conservative as a running mate , although another 43 % said they still would support him " mainly as a vote against the Democrat . "
" In all honesty , I think the choice of vice president for the Democrats is less important than for the Republicans , " says Hunter Bacot , a political scientist at Elon University in North Carolina , which holds its primary on May 6 .
" He has to have someone who 's going to shore up his conservative credentials as well as someone people are comfortable with ( as president ) should something happen to him health - wise . "
Close to half of those polled , 44 % , said it was important that the 71 - year - old Arizona senator choose someone considerably younger .
The oldest voters expressed the most concern about McCain 's age : Two - thirds of those 65 and older called it important for him to have a younger running mate .
A former rival with whom McCain exchanged the toughest words has volunteered .
" I think any Republican leader in this country would be honored to be asked to be serving as the vice presidential nominee , myself included , " former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney said on Fox News Channel 's Hannity & Colmes this month .
" If the nominee of our party asked you to serve with him , anybody would be honored to receive that call , and to accept it , of course . "
By Susan Page , USA TODAY RESULTS : USA ROUNDUP RESULTS : USA ROUNDUP USA Worried Democrats wish for ' dream team ticket '
WASHINGTON 
What are the odds Democrats will field a " dream team ticket " with Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton combining forces ?
London bookmaker Ladbrokes is taking bets at 8 - 1 , but leading Democratic insiders are n't ready to put down their money — yet .
PA .
PRIMARY : Powerful Democrats on opposite sides MORE : Obama nixes ' dream ticket ' talk The conundrum :
The need for a coalition ticket that could mend the party 's divisions becomes more urgent as the primary battle stretches on and takes a harsher tone .
Yet as their fight gets fiercer , it becomes harder to imagine the two ever getting together .
" It ai n't a match made in heaven anymore , " says Donna Brazile , a Democratic strategist who ran Al Gore 's 2000 campaign , noting increasingly bitter statements made in recent weeks by each campaign 's staff and supporters toward the other .
Monday 's back - and - forth centered on charges of McCarthyism and " gutter politics . "
Growing alarm among some Democrats that the rancor could squander what had seemed like a near - certain win in November makes them yearn for a ticket with both Obama and Clinton , in either order .
A nomination contest that continues to the August convention could split the party in two just as the general election begins in earnest .
" Nastier things have been said in other primaries , " says Matt Bennett , a veteran of retired general Wesley Clark 's 2004 presidential bid and co-founder of a think tank called Third Way .
" The difference is there 's something that is truly at risk here — this incredible excitement that both candidates have generated .
My concern is the level of acrimony could rise to such a point that the people both candidates are bringing out could become disillusioned and stay home in the fall . "
Bennett and other Democratic analysts worry that voters under 30 , energized to turn out for Obama in record numbers in this year 's primaries , could tune out if he is n't nominated .
While African - American voters who now support Obama by nearly 9 - to - 1 are n't likely to support the Republican candidate , some might choose not to vote unless the Illinois senator leads the ticket .
And white women over 50 who are part of Clinton 's base — and among the nation 's most reliable voters — could become disenchanted with the Democratic Party if she does n't prevail .
" I 'm starting to worry , " Democratic pollster Mark Mellman , an adviser to John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election , writes in The Hill , a Capitol Hill newspaper .
" I believe Democrats are exquisitely positioned to win the White House in 2008 .
The only thing that could defeat us is us , and it feels like we just might . "
Party harmony already has taken a hit .
In a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll taken March 14 - 16 , 30 % of Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents called an Obama - Clinton ticket their " first choice , " and a similar number said that of a Clinton - Obama ticket .
However , one in four said an Obama - Clinton ticket was " not acceptable . "
Another one in four ruled out a Clinton - Obama ticket .
Voters were most resistant to the idea of having the candidate they support accept the No. 2 slot .
A third of Obama supporters rejected a Clinton - Obama ticket , and a third of Clinton supporters rejected an Obama - Clinton ticket .
" The fact is you 've got a very close race … and people on both sides are getting more dug in with their particular candidate , " says Leon Panetta , a former California congressman and White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton .
" That raises the potential that whoever gets the nomination , the other candidate will feel like he or she has been robbed . "
As resentments swell , the imperative for a joint ticket could overwhelm other factors that nominees customarily consider in choosing a running mate — including tapping someone with whom the nominee has good relations .
In 1980 , despite frosty feelings , Ronald Reagan put primary rival George H.W. Bush on the ticket in a pragmatic political move .
Normally , nominees have " the flexibility to decide who their running mate is going to be so they 're comfortable with that running mate , and that person meets their particular political and substantive needs , " Panetta says .
" But in this situation , if in fact the party is divided , if there 's a danger that important constituencies may break away — the only way to hold them together may be to have both of them on the same ticket . "
' An almost unstoppable force '
The topic already has caused friction between the two camps .
Two weeks ago , Bill Clinton suggested that his wife and Obama would be " an almost unstoppable force " if they joined together — presumably with Hillary Clinton in the lead spot .
" If you can unite the energy and the new people that he 's brought in and the people in these vast swaths of small - town and rural America that she 's carried overwhelmingly , if you had those two things together , she thinks it'd be hard to beat , " Bill Clinton said while campaigning in Mississippi .
Obama accused the Clinton campaign of " hoodwinking " voters by suggesting he was n't ready to be commander in chief while simultaneously floating the possibility of a joint ticket .
" That 's exactly the kind of doublespeak , double talk that Washington is very good at , " he said .
Obama noted that he , not Clinton , held the lead in pledged convention delegates .
" I want everybody to be absolutely clear : I 'm not running for vice president , " Obama said .
" I 'm running for president of the United States of America . "
Obama supporters were outraged by the suggestion he should take the No. 2 spot , says Joe Madison , who heard from them on his radio talk show .
His program is carried on Washington 's WOL - AM and syndicated on XM Satellite Radio .
" For her to suggest that Obama would be a good running mate is an insult because , one , she 's behind in the delegate count , and she can't offer what she does n't have , " Madison says .
" What you end up doing is undervaluing , underestimating and marginalizing Obama 's status as the front - runner . "
The idea of an Obama - Clinton ticket has its own hurdles — for one , whether the 60 - year - old New York senator would be willing to accept the secondary spot to a rival 14 years her junior .
For another , what complications might arise for a new president in having a former president as the vice president 's spouse .
" You have to wonder , " University of Pennsylvania political scientist Richard Johnston says .
Still , neither candidate has flatly rejected a joint ticket , even as Obama 's campaign questions Clinton 's honesty and the Clinton camp portrays Obama as unready .
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe and top Clinton strategist Mark Penn both refused to discuss the issue , calling it premature .
" We 'd have some inevitable questions , " Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told reporters after a Clinton rally in Scranton , Pa. , this month .
" ' Sen. Obama , you said Sen.
Clinton was n't trustworthy ; how can you make her vice president , one heartbeat away ? '
' Sen. Clinton , you said Sen .
Obama is not ready to meet the challenge of national security ; how can you put him one heartbeat away ? ' " Even so , Rendell , a Clinton supporter , said a joint ticket led by either one " would be great . "
History 's lesson :
They work Wounds left by primary battles are one reason that no presidential candidate in a generation has chosen his top primary opponent to join him on the ticket .
In 2000 , George W. Bush tapped Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney , who had retired from politics eight years earlier .
In 1992 , Bill Clinton chose Tennessee Sen . Al Gore , who had cited family considerations in sitting out the primaries that year .
There are precedents , though — and history demonstrates that a team of rivals often prevails .
In 1960 , Democrat John F. Kennedy selected the older , more experienced Texas Sen. Lyndon Johnson , who had hoped to claim the presidential nomination himself .
Johnson , then the Senate majority leader , accepted the No. 2 spot , but relations between him and the Kennedy camp were never easy .
Still , he delivered what JFK wanted , bolstering his strength among Southern conservatives generally and carrying Texas in particular .
In 1976 , after a Republican nomination battle that went all the way to the national convention in Kansas City , Mo. , President Ford and challenger Ronald Reagan did n't join forces .
Ford did n't ask , Reagan told associates he was n't interested — and Ford narrowly lost the election to Jimmy Carter .
Four years later , Reagan won the nomination and , after a flirtation with Ford , chose the elder Bush as his running mate .
Stuart Spencer , one of Reagan 's chief campaign strategists , recalls discussing the vice presidential pick during the five - hour flight to the National Convention in Detroit from Los Angeles .
" Reagan spent the first 20 minutes dumping on George Bush , " Spencer says .
" He was very unhappy with George Bush and some of the attacks made on him in the primaries — ' voodoo economics ' and that .
I listened to the entire thing .
He said , ' What do you think about it ? '
I said , ' I think you 're going to pick George Bush . ' " Reagan needed to reach out to moderate Republicans and reassure voters concerned about his lack of Washington experience .
Bush helped do both .
Too much change ?
For Democrats this time , " whichever one of them ends up as the nominee , they have to make an appeal to the other person 's voters , " says John Podesta , a veteran Democratic operative who was president Clinton 's chief of staff and now heads the Center for American Progress in Washington .
While there are several ways to do that , he says , " one direct line is to offer the vice presidency to the person who comes in second . "
At the moment , though , tensions between the two contenders continue to grow , and a down - to - the - wire nomination battle might not leave enough time for tempers to cool .
" There 's pride on the line , " Johnston says .
" After having split the vote 50 - 50 , it'd be difficult for each to concede to the other . "
A grinding month of campaigning leading up to the Pennsylvania primary on April 22 is likely to make things worse , he says .
" The situation is set up for maximum nastiness , ( and ) the worry is the next few weeks will dry up whatever goodwill there is . "
Some Democratic activists also are concerned that having both a woman and an African - American on the ticket could create unease among some voters accustomed to white men as president and vice president , making it harder to win the White House .
" An Obama - Clinton or Clinton - Obama ticket is too big a bite for the American voter to take at one time , " Madison says .
The traditional formula would call for either one to balance his or her ticket with a white man , perhaps one with a centrist mien and a swing - state address .
Spencer says strategists would need to " measure this issue with the public " — that is , take polls and hold focus groups — before settling on an Obama - Clinton or Clinton - Obama ticket .
" I can make the case it 's too big of a change for them to accept all of a sudden , " the Republican consultant says of the American electorate , while noting he 's seen generational shifts in response to Obama 's campaign this year that make the combination worth considering .
" It could be a powerhouse , " Spencer says .
Enlarge By Jessica Rinaldi , AP Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton talk after the Texas Democratic Party 's presidential candidates debate in Austin in February .
A recent poll of Democrats and independents who lean toward the party indicated that 45 % would find an Obama - Clinton ticket acceptable and 44 % would approve of the reverse .

Flybe was 172 passengers short with the deadline approaching Budget airline Flybe advertised for actors to fly between Norwich and Dublin to boost passenger numbers and avoid a £ 280,000 commercial penalty .
The airline took the step to avoid a penalty charge from Norwich Airport if it did not carry 15,000 passengers on the route by 31 March .
The airport criticised Flybe for pointlessly damaging the environment .
Flybe , which did not use actors in the end , blamed the airport , calling it " intransigent and greedy " .
Under the terms of the deal between the airline and the airport , the latter would impose a £ 280,000 penalty if Flybe did not carry 15,000 passengers on the Norwich to Dublin route during the 2007/2008 financial year .
' Downright greedy '
Flybe , which is based in Exeter , was 172 passengers short with the 31 March deadline approaching and the two sides could not reach a compromise .
The airline laid on extra flights , offered 200 free return tickets , placed an advertisement on an actors ' website for " extras " and warned staff to prepare to fly to Ireland .
Norwich Airport Managing Director Richard Jenner said : " It does n't seem to be in the spirit of the agreement .
You will be boarding an aircraft and flying to Dublin and then flying back into Norwich airport ... up to three flights during each day
Flybe advert for extras " But , more than anything , our concerns are about the unnecessary impact on the environment .
We try here to justify the impact we have on the environment . "
A Flybe spokesman said the company regretted the " unusual " move but the " ridiculous , intransigent and downright greedy attitude " of Norwich Airport had left it with no option .
The airline said it would " offset " additional carbon emissions and had not needed to use actors to fill seats .
An offer appeared on the Flybe website on 27 March advertising " free flights to Dublin this weekend ! " and offering 200 free return tickets .
Flybe also advertised on a website called StarNow which said " extras aged 16 + needed for paid work flying to Dublin " .
The advertisement said more than 100 extras were needed and would be paid more than £ 80 a day .
" You will be boarding an aircraft and flying to Dublin and then flying back into Norwich airport , " it read .
" There may be up to three flights during each day . "

What are these ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
You might not be in the market for a house .
But this is a good time to be shopping for what goes inside , with furniture at bargain prices - although only for the next few months .
" There are plenty of [ furniture ] deals to be had and consumers definitely hold the power right now , " said John Gabriel , Morningstar analyst who tracks big national furniture chains and suppliers such as Ethan Allen ( ETH ) , Pier 1 Imports ( PIR ) and Herman Miller .
Analysts say the collapse of the housing market amid an economic downturn chilled demand for new furniture and home furnishing items .
As demand fell , retailers were stuck with excess inventory going into 2008 .
Unable to sell their products , several furniture chains , including Wickes and Levitz Furniture , recently declared bankruptcy .
Other dealers , such as Thomasville , are shutting some locations .
Nevertheless , this tough situation for retailers has created a buying opportunity for bargain - hungry consumers , said Gabriel .
" With their sales volumes so low , furniture retailers have to get very aggressive on prices to stay in business , " he said .
Keith Koenig , co-founder and president of Florida - based furniture chain City Furniture , said his company has had a rough ride this past year .
Combined revenue for the company 's 21 South Florida stores fell 15 % in 2007 .
Koenig said all furniture sellers will " absolutely pull every trick out of the bag to garner revenue where they can . "
While the housing downturn had proved catastrophic for his industry , Koenig said it could provide some positive impact by sparking a " redecorating trend . "
" If more people are staying put , they might decide to reinvest in the upkeep of the home , " he said .
" That 's an important revenue source for us . "
He 's hoping that this year 's tax rebate checks will also spur spending on furniture in the coming weeks before prices start to normalize .
" I think prices have hit bottom and consumers will still get great deals over the next three months , " he said .
He estimated that merchants will offer discounts of between 5 % to 15 % on already reduced prices over the summer .
But , by year end , an $ 899 bedroom set is likely to cost $ 999 , Koenig said .
That 's because overseas suppliers , especially in China and India , are complaining that their manufacturing costs are climbing due to higher wages and commodity prices , as well as the weakness in the dollar .
More than 50 % of all furniture sold in the United States is imported from overseas , according to the trade publication Furniture Today .
" While we 're squeezing more of our suppliers on their prices to us , they are screaming that their costs are going up too , " Koenig said .
As these overseas manufacturers pass along the incremental production costs to U.S. retailers , retailers in turn will be forced to pass them along to consumers or else risk further profit erosion .
Tapan Singhvi , owner of India - based furniture manufacturer Kraft Creations , lists Costco ( COST , Fortune 500 ) among his bigger U.S. clients .
Not only have his U.S. customers cut their orders by 30 % this year but they also are negotiating prices for his products that are about 20 % lower than last year , Singhvi said .
Avinash Jain , owner of another India - based furniture maker Preeti International that supplies to U.S. - based furniture wholesellers , said the decline in the dollar has pushed up his costs .
As a result , both Singhvi and Jain said they are seeking out new clients in Europe to take advantage of the gains in the euro .
" We are in a real conundrum with the dollar , " Koenig said .
" Our import costs are going up while [ retail ] prices have dropped dramatically . "
" We 've had to tighten our belts and we 'll be very happy if we can stay even in 2008 , " he said .
What 's wrong with libertarianism
A pparently someone 's curse worked : we live in interesting times , and among other consequences , for no good reason we have a surplus of libertarians .
With this article I hope to help keep the demand low , or at least to explain to libertarian correspondents why they do n't impress me with comments like " You sure love letting people steal your money ! "
Good libertarians and the other kind
This article has been rewritten , for two reasons .
First , the original article had sidebars to address common objections .
From several people 's reactions , it seems that they never read these .
They 're now incorporated into the text .
Second , and more importantly , many people who call themselves libertarians did n't recognize themselves in the description .
There are libertarians and libertarians , and sometimes different camps despise each other -- or do n't seem to be aware of each other .
If you --
have never heard of ( or do n't think much of ) Rothbard , Rockwell , Rand , and von Mises
accept that the FDIC is a pretty good idea
want a leaner , more efficient government , but do n't dream of getting rid of it
... then this page is n't really addressed to you .
You 're probably more of what I 'd call a small - government conservative ; and if you voted against Bush , we can probably get along just fine .
On the other hand , you might want to stick around to see what your more fundamentalist colleagues are saying .
The Un-Communism
Libertarianism strikes me as if someone ( let 's call her " Ayn Rand " ) sat down to create the Un-Communism .
Thus :
Communism Libertarianism Property is theft Property is sacred Totalitarianism
Any government is bad Capitalists are baby - eating villains Capitalists are noble Nietzchean heroes Workers should rule Worker activism is evil
The poor are oppressed
The poor are pampered good - for - nothings
Does this sound exaggerated ?
Let 's listen to Murray Rothbard :
We contend here , however , that the model of government is akin , not to the business firm , but to the criminal organization , and indeed that the State is the organization of robbery systematized and writ large .
Or here 's Lew Rockwell on Rothbard ( emphasis mine ) :
He was also the architect of the body of thought known around the world as libertarianism .
This radically anti-state political philosophy unites free - market economics , a no-exceptions attachment to private property rights , a profound concern for human liberty , and a love of peace , with the conclusion that society should be completely free to develop absent any interference from the state , which can and should be eliminated .
Thomas DiLorenzo on worker activism : " [ L ] abor unions [ pursue ] policies which impede the very institutions of capitalism that are the cause of their own prosperity . "
Or Ludwig von Mises : " What is today euphemistically called the right to strike is in fact the right of striking workers , by recourse to violence , to prevent people who want to work from working . "
( Employer violence is apparently acceptable . )
The Libertarian Party platform explains that workers have no right to protest drug tests , and supports the return of child labor .
On Nietzsche , as one of my correspondents puts it , some libertarians love Nietzsche ; others have read him .
( Though I would respond that some people idolize executives ; others have worked for them . )
Nonetheless , I think the Nietzschean atmosphere of burning rejection of conventional morality , exaltation of the will to power , and scorn for womanish Christian compassion for the masses , is part of the roots of libertarianism .
It 's unmistakable in Ayn Rand .
The more important point , however , is that the capitalist is the über - villain for communists , and a glorious hero for libertarians ; that property is " theft " for the communists , and a " natural right " for libertarians .
These dovetail a little too closely for coincidence .
It 's natural enough , when a basic element of society is attacked as an evil , for its defenders to counter - attack by elevating it into a principle .
As we should have learned from the history of communism and fascism , however , contradiction is no guarantee of truth ; it can lead one into an opposite error instead .
And many who rejected communism nonetheless remained zealots .
People who leave one ideological extreme usually end up at the other , either quickly ( David Horowitz ) or slowly ( Mario Vargas Llosa ) .
If you 're the sort of person who likes absolutes , you want them even if all your other convictions change .
Who needs facts ?
The methodology is n't much different either : oppose the obvious evils of the world with a fairy tale .
The communist of 1910 could n't point to a single real - world instance of his utopia ; neither can the present - day libertarian .
Yet they 're unshakeable in their conviction that it can and must happen .
Academic libertarians love abstract , fact - free arguments -- often , justifications for why property is an absolute right .
As a random example , from one James Craig Green :
This concept of property originated in some of those primitive tribes when individuals claimed possessions for themselves as against the collective ownership of their groups .
Based on individual initiative , labor , and innovation , some were successful at establishing a separate , private ownership role for themselves . [...]
Examples of natural property in land and water resources have already been given , but deserve more detail .
An illustration of how this would be accomplished is a farm with irrigation ditches to grow crops in dry western states .
To appropriate unowned natural resources , a settler used his labor to clear the land and dug ditches to carry water from a river for irrigation .
Crops were planted , buildings were constructed , and the property thus created was protected by the owner from aggression or the later claims of others .
This process was a legitimate creation of property .
The first paragraph is pure fantasy , and is simply untrue as a portrait of " primitive tribes " , which are generally extremely collectivist by American standards .
The second sounds good precisely because it leaves out all the actual facts of American history : the settlers ' land was not " unowned " but stolen from the Indians by state conquest ( and much of it stolen from the Mexicans as well ) ; the lands were granted to the settlers by government ; the communities were linked to the national economy by railroads founded by government grant ; the crops were adapted to local conditions by land grant colleges .
Thanks to my essay on taxes , I routinely get mail featuring impassioned harangues which never once mention a real - world fact -- or which simply make up the statistics they want .
This sort of balls - out aggressivity probably wins points at parties , where no one is going to take down an almanac and check their figures ; but to me it 's a cardinal sin .
If someone has an answer for everything , advocates changes which have never been tried , and presents dishonest evidence , he 's a crackpot .
If a man has no doubts , it 's because his hypothesis is unfalsifiable .
Distaste for facts is n't merely a habit of a few Internet cranks ; it 's actually libertarian doctrine , the foundation of the ' Austrian school ' .
Here 's Ludwig von Mises in Epistemological Problems of Economics :
As there is no discernible regularity in the emergence and concatenation of ideas and judgments of value , and therefore also not in the succession and concatenation of human acts , the role that experience plays in the study of human action is radically different from that which it plays in the natural sciences .
Experience of human action is history .
Historical experience does not provide facts that could render in the construction of a theoretical science services that could be compared to those which laboratory experiments and observation render to physics .
Historical events are always the joint effect of the cooperation of various factors and chains of causation .
In matters of human action no experiments can be performed .
History needs to be interpreted by theoretical insight gained previously from other sources .
The ' other sources ' turn out to be armchair ruminations on how things must be .
It 's true enough that economics is not physics ; but that 's not warrant to turn our backs on the methods of science and return to scholastic speculation .
Economics should always move in the direction of science , experiment , and falsifiability .
If it were really true that it cannot , then no one , including the libertarians , would be entitled to strong belief in any economic program .
How to try new things
Some people are n't much bothered by libertarianism 's lack of real - world success .
After all , they argue , if no one tried anything new , nothing would ever change .
In fact , I 'm all for experimentation ; that 's how we learn .
Create a libertarian state .
But run it as a proper experiment .
Start small - scale .
Establish exactly how your claims will be tested : per capita income ?
median income ?
life expectancy ?
property value ?
surveys on happiness ?
Set up a control : e.g. begin with two communities as close as we can get them in size , initial wealth , resources , and culture , one following liberalism , one following libertarianism .
Abide by the results -- no changing the goalposts if the liberals happen to " win " .
I 'm even willing to look at partial tests .
If an ideology is really better than others at producing general prosperity , then following it partially should produce partially better results .
Jonathan Kwitny suggested comparing a partly socialist system ( e.g. Tanzania ) to a partly capitalist one ( e.g. Kenya ) .
( Kenya looked a lot better . )
If the tests are partial , of course , we 'll want more of them ; but human experience is pretty broad .
It 's the libertarians , not me , who stand in the way of such accountability .
If I point out examples of nations partially following libertarian views -- we 'll get to this below -- I 'm told that they do n't count : only Pure Real Libertarianism Of My Own Camp can be tested .
Again , all - or - nothing thinking generally goes with intellectual fraud .
If a system is untestable , it 's because its proponents fear testing .
By contrast , I 'm confident enough in liberal and scientific values that I 'm happy to see even partial adoption .
Even a little freedom is better than dictatorship .
Even a little science is better than ideology .
An untested political system unfortunately has great rhetorical appeal .
Since we can't see it in action , we can't point out its obvious faults , while the ideologue can be caustic about everything that has actually been tried , and which has inevitably fallen short of perfection .
Perhaps that 's why Dave Barry and Trey Parker are libertarians .
But I 'd rather vote for a politician who 's shown that his programs work in the real world than for a humorist , however amusing .
My friend Franklin
At this point some libertarian readers are pumping their hands in the air like a piston , anxious to explain that their ideal is n't Rothbard or von Mises or Hayek , but the Founding Fathers .
Nice try .
Everybody wants the Founders on their side ; but it was a different country back then -- 95 % agricultural , low density , highly homogenous , primitive in technology -- and modern libertarianism simply does n't apply .
( The OED 's citations of the word for the time are all theological . )
All American political movements have their roots in the 1700s -- indeed , in the winning side , since Loyalist opinion essentially disappeared .
We are all -- liberals , conservatives , libertarians -- against the Georgian monarchy and for the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
You can certainly find places where one Founder or another rants against government ; you can find other places where one Founder or another rants against rebellion , anarchy , and the opponents of federalism .
Sometimes the same Founder can be quoted on both sides .
They were a mixed bunch , and lived long enough lives to encounter different situations .
It cannot have escaped those who have attended with candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of the government , that the authors of them have very little considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining a necessary end .
-- James Madison
Stable ownership is the gift of social law , and is given late in the progress of society .
-- Thomas Jefferson
All the Property that is necessary to a man is his natural Right , which none may justly deprive him of , but all Property superfluous to such Purposes is the property of the Public who , by their Laws have created it and who may , by other Laws dispose of it .
-- Benjamin Franklin
The Constitution is above all a definition of a strengthened government , and the Federalist Papers are an extended argument for it .
The Founders negotiated a balance between a government that was arbitrary and coercive ( their experience as British colonial subjects ) and one that was powerless and divided ( the failed Articles of Confederation ) .
The Founders did n't anticipate the New Deal -- there was no need for them to -- but they were as quick to resort to the resources of the state as any modern liberal .
Ben Franklin , for instance , played the Pennsylvania legislature like a violin -- using it to fund a hospital he wanted to establish , for instance .
Obviously he had no qualms about using state power to do good social works .
It 's also worth pointing out that the Founders ' words were nobler than their deeds .
Most were quite comfortable with slave - owning , for instance .
No one worried about women 's consent to be governed .
Washington 's own administration made it a crime to criticize the government .
And as Robert Allen Rutland reminds us ,
For almost 150 years , in fact , the Bill of Rights was paid lip service in patriotic orations and ignored in the marketplace .
It was n't until after World War I that the Supreme Court began the process of giving real meaning to the Bill of Rights .
The process of giving life to our constitutional rights has largely been the work of liberals .
On the greatest fight of all , to treat blacks as human beings , libertarians supported the other side .
Why are they trouble ?
Crackpots are usually harmless ; how about the Libertarian Party ?
In itself , I 'm afraid , it 's nothing but a footnote .
It gets no more than 1 % of the vote -- a showing that 's been surpassed historically by the Anti-Masonic Party , the Greenbacks , the Prohibition Party , the Socialists , the Greens , and whatever John Anderson was .
If that was all it was , I would n't bother to devote pages and rants to it .
I 'm all for the expression of pure eccentricity in politics ; I like the Brits ' Monster Raving Looney Party even better .
Why are libertarian ideas important ?
Because of their influence on the Republican Party .
They form the ideological basis for the Reagan / Gingrich / Bush revolution .
The Republicans have taken the libertarian " Government is Bad " horse and ridden far with it :
Reagan 's " Government is the problem "
Phil Gramm 's contention that the country 's " economic crisis " and " moral crisis " were due to " the explosion of government "
Talk radio hosts ' advocacy of armed resistance to " jack - booted government thugs "
Dole 's 1996 campaign , advancing the notion that taxes were " Your Money " being taken from you
Gingrich 's Contract with America ( welfare cuts , tax cuts , limitations on corporations ' responsibility and on the government 's ability to regulate them )
Dick Armey 's comment that Medicare ( medical aid for the elderly ) is " a program I would have no part of in a free world "
Bush 's tax cuts , intended not only to reward the rich but to " starve the beast " , in Grover Norquist 's words : to create a permanent deficit as a dangerous ploy to reduce social spending
Jeb Bush 's hope that the Florida state government buildings would one day be empty
Intellectual support for attacks on the quality of working life in this county and for undoing the New Deal
Maybe this use of their ideas is appalling to ' Real Libertarians ' ... well , it 's an appalling world sometimes .
Is it fair to communism that everyone thinks its Leninist manifestation is the only possible one ?
Do you think I 'm happy to have national representatives like Dukakis , Gore , and Kerry ?
At least some libertarians have understood the connection .
Rothbard again , writing in 1994 :
The truth is that since we have been stuck with a two - party system , any electoral revolution against big government had to be expressed through a Republican victory .
So it is certainly true that Newt Gingrich and his faction , as well as Robert Dole , have ridden to power on the libertarian wave .
Can you smell the compromise here ?
Hold your nose and vote for the Repubs , boys .
But then do n't pretend to be uninvolved when the Republicans start making a mockery of limited government .
There 's a deeper lesson here , and it 's part of why I do n't buy libertarian portraits of the future utopia .
Movements out of power are always anti-authoritarian ; it 's no guarantee that they 'll stay that way .
Communists before 1917 promised the withering away of the state .
Fascists out of power sounded something like socialists .
The Republicans were big on term limits when they could be used to unseat Democrats ; they say nothing about them today .
If you do n't think it can happen to you , you 're not being honest about human nature and human history .
What about the social side ?
The Libertarian Party has a cute little test that purports to divide American politics into four quadrants .
There 's the economic dimension ( where libertarians ally with conservatives ) and the social dimension ( where libertarians ally with liberals ) .
I think the diagram is seriously misleading , because visually it gives equal importance to both dimensions .
And when the rubber hits the road , libertarians almost always go with the economic dimension .
The libertarian philosopher always starts with property rights .
Libertarianism arose in opposition to the New Deal , not to Prohibition .
The libertarian voter is chiefly exercised over taxes , regulation , and social programs ; the libertarian wing of the Republican party has , for forty years , gone along with the war on drugs , corporate welfare , establishment of dictatorships abroad , and an alliance with theocrats .
Christian libertarians like Ron Paul want God in the public schools and are happy to have the government forbid abortion and gay marriage .
I never saw the libertarians objecting to Bush Sr. mocking the protection of civil rights , or to Ken Starr 's government inquiry into politicians ' sex lives .
On the Cato Institute 's list of recent books , I count 1 of 19 dealing with an issue on which libertarians and liberals tend to agree , and that was on foreign policy ( specifically , the Iraq war ) .
If this is changing , as Bush 's never - ending " War on Terror " expands the powers of government , demonizes dissent , and enmeshes the country in military crusades and nation - building , as the Republicans push to remove the checks and balances that remain in our government system -- if libertarians come to realize that Republicans and not Democrats are the greater threat to liberty -- I 'd be delighted .
But for that , you know , you have to vote against Bush .
A belief in social liberties means little if you vote for a party that clearly intends to restrict them .
For the purposes of my critique , however , the social side of libertarianism is irrelevant .
A libertarian and I might actually agree to legalize drugs , let people marry whoever they like , and repeal the Patriot Act .
But this has nothing to do with whether robber baron capitalism is a good thing .
The libertarianism that has any effect in the world , then , has nothing to do with social liberty , and everything to do with removing all restrictions on business .
So what 's wrong with that ?
Let 's look at some cases that came within spitting distance of the libertarian ideal .
Some libertarians wo n't like these , because they are not Spotless Instances of the Free Utopia ; but as I 've said , nothing is proved by science fiction .
If complete economic freedom and absence of government is a cure - all , partial economic freedom and limited government should be a cure - some .
Pre-New Deal America
At the turn of the 20th century , business could do what it wanted -- and it did .
The result was robber barons , monopolistic gouging , management thugs attacking union organizers , filth in our food , a punishing business cycle , slavery and racial oppression , starvation among the elderly , gunboat diplomacy in support of business interests .
The New Deal itself was a response to crisis ( though by no means an unprecedented one ; it was n't much worse than the Gilded Age depressions ) .
A quarter of the population was out of work .
Five thousand banks failed , destroying the savings of 9 million families .
Steel plants were operating at 12 % capacity .
Banks foreclosed on a quarter of Mississippi 's land .
Wall Street was discredited by insider trading and collusion with banks at the expense of investors .
Farmers were breaking out into open revolt ; miners and jobless city workers were rioting .
Do n't think , by the way , that if governments do n't provide gunboats , no one else will .
Corporations will build their own military if necessary : the East Indies Company did ; Leopold did in the Congo ; management did when fighting with labor .
Post - communist Russia
Or take Russia in the decade after the fall of Communism , as advised by free - market absolutists like Jeffrey Sachs .
Russian GDP declined 50 % in five years .
The elite grabbed the assets they could and shuffled them out of Russia so fast that IMF loans could n't compensate .
In 1994 alone , 600 businessmen , journalists , and politicians were murdered by gangsters .
Russia lacked a working road system , a banking system , anti-monopoly regulation , effective law enforcement , or any sort of safety net for the elderly and the jobless .
Inflation reached 2250 % in 1992 .
Central government authority effectively disappeared in many regions .
By the way , Russia is the answer to those testosterone - poisoned folks who think that guns will prevent oppression .
The mafia will always outgun you .
Today 's Russia is moving back toward authoritarianism under Putin .
Again , this should dismay libertarians : apparently , given a little freedom , many people will demand less .
You 'd better be careful about setting up that utopia ; ten years further on it may be taken over by authoritarians .
Pinochet 's Chile
Or consider the darling of many an ' 80s conservative : Pinochet 's Chile , installed by Nixon , praised by Jeanne Kirkpatrick , George Bush , and Paul Johnson .
In twenty years , foreign debt quadrupled , natural resources were wasted , universal health care was abandoned ( leading to epidemics of typhoid fever and hepatitis ) , unions were outlawed , military spending rose ( for what ?
who the hell is going to attack Chile ? ) , social security was " privatized " ( with predictable results : ever - increasing government bailouts ) and the poverty rate doubled , from 20 % to 41 % .
Chile 's growth rate from 1974 to 1982 was 1.5 % ; the Latin American average was 4.3 % .
Pinochet was a dicator , of course , which makes some libertarians feel that they have nothing to learn here .
Somehow Chile 's experience ( say ) privatizing social security can tell us nothing about privatizing social security here , because Pinochet was a dictator .
Presumably if you set up a business in Chile , the laws of supply and demand and perhaps those of gravity would n't apply , because Pinochet was a dictator .
When it 's convenient , libertarians even trumpet their association with Chile 's " free market " policies ; self - gov.org ( originators of that cute quiz ) includes a page celebrating Milton Friedman , self - proclaimed libertarian , who helped form and advise the group of University of Chicago professors and graduates who implemented Pinochet 's policies .
The Cato Institute even named a prize for " Advancing Liberty " after this benefactor of the Chilean dictatorship .
Destination : Banana Republic
The newest testing ground for laissez - faire is present - day America , from Ronald Reagan on .
Remove the New Deal , and the pre-New Deal evils clamor to return .
Reagan removed the right to strike ; companies now fire strikers , outsource high - wage jobs and replace them with dead - end near - minimum - wage service jobs .
Middle - class wages are stagnating -- or plummeting , if you consider that working hours are rising .
Companies are rushing to reestablish child labor in the Third World .
Where the gains go
Under liberalism , productivity increases benefited all classes -- poverty rates declined from over 30 % to under 10 % in the thirty years after World War II , while the economy more than quadrupled in size .
In the current libertarian climate , productivity gains only go to the already well - off .
Here 's the percentage of US national income received by certain percentiles of the population , as reported by the IRS :
1986 1999 Top 1 % 11.30 19.51 Top 5 % 24.11 34.04 Top 10 % 35.12 44.89 Top 25 % 59.04 66.46 Top 50 % 83.34 86.75 Bottom 99 % 88.70 80.49 Bottom 95 % 75.89 65.96 Bottom 90 % 64.88 55.11 Bottom 75 % 40.96 33.54 Bottom 50 % 16.66 13.25
This should put some perspective on libertarian whining about high taxes and how we 're destroying incentives for the oppressed businessman .
The wealthiest 1 % of the population doubled their share of the pie in just 15 years .
In 1973 , CEOs earned 45 times the pay of an average employee ( about twice the multipler in Japan ) ; today it 's 500 times .
Thirty years ago , managers accepted that they operated as much for their workers , consumers , and neighbors as for themselves .
Some economists ( notably Michael Jensen and William Meckling ) decided that the only stakeholders that mattered were the stock owners -- and that management would be more accountable if they were given massive amounts of stock .
Not surprisingly , CEOs managed to get the stock without the accountability -- they 're obscenely well paid whether the company does well or it tanks -- and the obsession with stock price led to mass layoffs , short - term thinking , and the financial dishonesty at WorldCom , Enron , Adelphia , HealthSouth , and elsewhere .
Welcoming your new overlords
The nature of our economic system has changed in the last quarter - century , and people have n't understood it yet .
People over 30 or so grew up in an environment where the rich got more , but everyone prospered .
When productivity went up , the rich got richer -- we 're not goddamn communists , after all -- but everybody 's income increased .
If you were part of the World War II generation , the reality was that you had access to subsidized education and housing , you lived better every year , and you were almost unimaginably better off than your parents .
We were a middle - class nation , perhaps the first nation in history where the majority of the people were comfortable .
This infuriated the communists ( this was n't supposed to happen ) .
The primeval libertarians who cranky about it as well , but the rich had little reason to complain -- they were better off than ever before , too .
Conservatives -- nurtured by libertarian ideas -- have managed to change all that .
When productivity rises , the rich now keep the gains ; the middle class barely stays where it is ; the poor get poorer .
We have a ways to go before we become a Third World country , but the model is clear .
The goal is an impoverished majority , and a super - rich minority with no effective limitations on its power or earnings .
We 'll exchange the prosperity of 1950s America for that of 1980s Brazil .
Single - villain ideologies
Despite the intelligence of many of its supporters , libertarianism is an instance of the simplest ( and therefore silliest ) type of politics : the single - villain ideology .
Everything is blamed on the government .
( One libertarian , for instance , reading my list of the evils of laissez - faire above , ignored everything but " gunboats " .
It 's like Gary Larson 's cartoon of " What dogs understand " , with the dog's name replaced with " government " . )
The advantage of single - villain ideologies is obvious : in any given situation you never have to think hard to find out the culprit .
The disadvantages , however , are worse : you can't see your primary target clearly -- hatred is a pair of dark glasses -- and you can't see the problems with anything else .
It 's a habit of mind that renders libertarianism unfalsifiable , and thus irrelevant to the world .
Everything gets blamed on one institution ; and because we have no real - world example where that agency is absent , the claims can't be tested .
Not being a libertarian does n't mean loving the state ; it means accepting complexity .
The real world is a monstrously complicated place ; there 's not just one thing wrong with it , nor just one thing that can be changed to fix it .
Things like prosperity and freedom do n't have one cause ; they 're a balancing act .
Here 's an alternative theory for you : original sin .
People will mess things up , whether by stupidity or by active malice .
There is no magical class of people ( e.g. " government " ) who can be removed to produce utopia .
Any institution is liable to failure , or active criminality .
Put anyone in power -- whether it 's communists or engineers or businessmen -- and they will abuse it .
Does this mean things are hopeless ?
Of course not ; it just means that we have to let all institutions balance each other .
Government , opposition parties , business , the media , unions , churches , universities , non-government organizations , all watch over each other .
Power is distributed as widely as possible to prevent any one institution from monopolizing and abusing it .
It 's not always a pretty solution , and it can be frustratingly slow and inefficient , but it works better than any alternative I know of .
The problem with markets
Markets are very good at some things , like deciding what to produce and distributing it .
But unrestricted markets do n't produce general prosperity , and lawless business can and will abuse its power .
Examples can be multiplied ad nauseam : read some history -- or the newspaper .
Since natural resources are accounted as free gains and pollution is n't counted against the bottom line , business on its own will grab resources and pollute till an environment is destroyed .
The food business , on its own , will put filth in our food and lie about what it 's made of .
The few industries which are exceptions to food and drug laws ( e.g. providers of alcohol and supplements ) fight hard to stay that way .
The food industry resists even providing information to consumers .
Business will lock minorities out of jobs and refuse to serve them , or serve them only in degrading ways .
Business will create unsafe goods , endanger workers , profiteer in times of crisis , use violence to prevent unionization -- and spend millions on politicians who will remove the people 's right to limit these abuses .
Thanks to the libertarian business climate , companies are happily moving jobs abroad , lowering wages , worsening working conditions .
The same libertarian climate encourages narcissists to pay themselves handsomely while ruling incompetently , and leads to false accounting , insider trading , and corruption .
Businesses create monopolies and cartels when they can manage it ; and the first thing monopolies do is raise prices .
Businesses can create bureaucracies as impenetrable and money - wasting as any government .
( The worst I 've ever had to deal with are health insurers .
And no , it 's not " government regulation " that makes them that way ; insurers have an interest in making the claims process as difficult as possible . )
State - controlled media are vile ; but business - controlled media are hardly better , especially given the consolidation of major media .
Democracy needs a diversity of voices , and we 're moving instead toward domination of the airwaves by a few conglomerates .
The poor are ill - served even for basic services : they pay more for food ; they pay through the nose for rotten apartments ; they can't get loans even if they can get bank accounts ; if they can get a job it 's ill paid , with no health benefits .
Poor areas are also highly polluted ( in ways that cause massive health problems ) , while lacking such services as movie theaters .
Libertarian responses to such lists are beyond amazing .
" Businesses would be stupid to do those things . "
Then they 're stupid , because they do them .
Private racial discrimination , for instance , lasted a hundred years ; and it was n't ended by businessmen changing their minds , but by blacks and liberals organizing .
The Libertarian Party platform actually hopes to legally re-enable private discrimination .

" The market will correct those problems . "
In a few cases it will -- if you wait long enough .
But very often it 's simply impossible : e.g. , the monopolist has made sure no alternatives exist .
( One of the railroad tycoons , for instance , was careful to buy up steamship lines . )
And though it was sometimes possible to break a monopoly by starting a well - bankrolled competing business , that was no consolation to ( say ) an oil producer who saw Rockefeller consolidating all the refineries .
He could hardly start up his own refinery , and he'd be bankrupt before anyone succeeded in doing so . )
Slavery is another example : though some hoped that the market would eventually make it unprofitable , it sure was taking its time , and neither the slave nor the abolitionist had any non-governmental leverage over the slaveowners .
( Libertarians usually claim to oppose slavery ... but that 's awfully easy to say on this side of Civil War and the civil rights movement .
The slaveowners thought they were defending their sacred rights to property and self - government . )

" We believe in laws too . "
And they do , rather touchingly ; they just do n't believe in enforcing them .
Enforcement of the laws passed by democratic legislatures is called " men with guns " or " initiating force " in libertarian ideology .
And without enforcement , laws are just pretty words .
You can see this today in Latin America , which often has very progressive laws .
The business and landowning elite just ignores them .

" So what do you want , state - run movie theaters ? "
The single - villain ideology is so strong that the only response some people can make to a market failure is to invent a statist response and criticize that .
Sometimes the best solution to these problems is to use the market -- once it gets a good liberal kick in the pants to go find one .
And those are the better responses .
Often enough the only response is explain how nothing bad can happen in the libertarian utopia .
But libertarian dogma can't be buttressed by libertarian doctrine -- that 's begging the question .
Or it 's simply denied that these things are problems .
One correspondent suggested that the poor should n't " complain " about not getting loans -- " I would n't make a loan if I did n't think I 'd get paid back . "
This is not only hard - hearted but ignorant .
Who says the poor are bad credit risks ?
It often takes prodding from community organizations , but banks can serve low - income areas well -- both making money and fostering home ownership .
Institutions like the Grameen Bank have found that micro-loans work very well , and are profitable , in the poorest countries on Earth , such as Bangladesh .
A balanced society
A proven solution to most of these ills is liberalism .
For fifty years liberals governed this country , generating unprecedented prosperity , and making this the first solidly middle - class nation .
If you want prosperity for the many -- and why should the many support any other goal ?-- you need a balance between government and business .
For this you need several things :
The rule of law .
That means regulations , effective police , and fair courts .
As Stephen Holmes said , " There is no rule of law until the Mafia needs lawyers . "
Neal Stephenson makes the same point in Zodiac : in a liberal society , you can shame companies into obeying the law , because companies do n't like bad P.R .
You do n't have that leverage with mafias .
: in a liberal society , you can shame companies into obeying the law , because companies do n't like bad P.R .
You do n't have that leverage with mafias .
Consumer trust .
That means that abuse and fraud are prosecuted , and you do n't have to get things done by paying bribes ( a big reason most poor countries stay poor ) .
Responsive government and business .
That means democracy , stockholder and union rights , and a free press .
Personally , I think we 'll eventually realize that monarchy does n't work for business , either .

Competition .
Monopolies charge higher rates , stifle innovation , abuse dependent companies , and provide lousy service .
( The robber barons of the 1800s were explicitly after monopolies , and they wanted them in order to raise profits . )
A wide - based business pyramid -- not just a few multinationals on top .
Smaller companies are usually the engine of innovation and city development , and the biggest producers of new jobs .
No barriers to social rising or business innovation ( e.g. racism , monopolies , " licensing " whose only purpose is to protect existing business , unavailable loans or courts , an out - of - reach education system , bribes , mafias ) .
Government costs money
Perhaps the most communicable libertarian meme -- and one of the most mischievous -- is the attempt to paint taxation as theft .
First , it 's dishonest .
Most libertarians theoretically accept government for defense and law enforcement .
( There are some absolutists who do n't even believe in national defense ; I guess they want to have a libertarian utopia for awhile , then hand it over to foreign invaders . )
Now , national defense and law enforcement cost money : about 22 % of the 2002 budget -- 33 % of the non-social - security budget .
You can't swallow that and maintain that all taxes are bad .
At least the cost of those functions is not " your money " ; it 's a legitimate charge for necessary services .
Americans enjoy the fruits of public scientific research , a well - educated job force , highways and airports , clean food , honest labelling , Social Security , unemployment insurance , trustworthy banks , national parks .
Libertarianism has encouraged the peculiarly American delusion that these things come for free .
It makes a philosophy out of biting the hand that feeds you .
Second , it leads directly to George Bush 's financial irresponsibility .
Would a libertarian urge his family or his software company or his gun club to spend twice what it takes in ?
When libertarians maintain that irresponsibility among the poor is such a bad thing , why is it OK in the government ?
It 's no excuse to claim that libertarians did n't want the government to increase spending , as Bush has done .
As you judge others , so shall you be judged .
Libertarians want to judge liberalism not by its goals ( e.g. helping poor children ) but by its alleged effects ( e.g. teen pregnancy ) .
The easiest things in the world for a politician to do are to lower taxes and raise spending .
By attacking the very concept of taxation , libertarians help politicians -- and the public -- to indulge their worst impulses .
Finally , it hides dependence on the government .
The economic powerhouse of the US is still the Midwest , the Northeast , and California -- largely liberal Democratic areas .
As Dean Lacy has pointed out , over the last decade , the blue states of 2004 paid $ 1.4 trillion more in federal taxes than they received , while red states received $ 800 billion more than they paid .
Red state morality is n't just to be irresponsible with the money they pay as taxes ; it 's to be irresponsible with other people 's money .
It 's protesting the concept of getting an allowance by stealing the other kids ' money .
Unacceptable morality
Ultimately , my objection to libertarianism is moral .
Arguing across moral gulfs is usually ineffective ; but we should at least be clear about what our moral differences are .
First , the worship of the already successful and the disdain for the powerless is essentially the morality of a thug .
Money and property should not be privileged above everything else -- love , humanity , justice .
( And let 's not forget that lurid fascination with firepower -- seen in ESR , Ron Paul , Heinlein and Van Vogt , Advocates for Self - Government 's president Sharon Harris , the Cato Institute , Lew Rockwell 's site , and the Mises Institute . )
I wish I could convince libertarians that the extremely wealthy do n't need them as their unpaid advocates .
Power and wealth do n't need a cheering section ; they are -- by definition -- not an oppressed class which needs our help .
Power and wealth can take care of themselves .
It 's the poor and the defenseless who need aid and advocates .
The libertarians reminds me of G.K. Chesterton 's description of people who are so eager to attack a hated ideology that they will destroy their own furniture to make sticks to beat it with .
James Craig Green again :
Typical excuses are " the common good " , " public morality " , " traditional family values " , " human rights " , " environmental protection " , " national security " , and " equality " .
Each appeals to the confused hysteria of a segment of the population .
Each allows property to be denied its rightful owner .
Each denies the concept of self - ownership .
Here 's a very different moral point of view : Jimmy Carter describing why he builds houses with Habitat for Humanity :
From my rural boyhood , when I often spent the night with black neighbors who lived in unheated and dilapidated shacks , to my years in the White House when I saw the plight of the homeless and those trapped in poverty housing worldwide , I have known that shelter matters .
And I know , as a Christian , that I have a responsibility to serve where I can , that as I treat " the least of these " , I treat my Creator .
Is this " confused hysteria " ?
No , it 's common human decency .
It 's sad when people have to twist themselves into knots to malign the human desire ( and the Biblical command ) to help one 's neighbor .
Second , it 's the philosophy of a snotty teen , someone who 's read too much Heinlein , absorbed the sordid notion that an intellectual elite should rule the subhuman masses , and convinced himself that reading a few bad novels qualifies him as a member of the elite .
Third , and perhaps most common , it 's the worldview of a provincial narcissist .
As I 've observed in my overview of the 20th century , liberalism won its battles so thoroughly that people have forgotten why those battles were fought .
It 's hard to read libertarians without concluding that they 've never been out of the country -- perhaps never out of the suburbs .
They do n't know what Latin American rule by the elite looks like ; they do n't know any way of running an industrial economy but that of the US ; they do n't know what an actually oppressive government looks like ; they 've never experienced a depression ; they 've never lived in a slum or experienced racial discrimination .
At the same time , they have a very American sense of entitlement : a gut feeling that they 've earned the prosperity they were born into , that they owe the community nothing , that they deserve to have whatever they want , that no one should stand in their way .
In short , they 're spoiled , and they 've evolved a philosophy that they should be spoiled .
I do n't want to leave out the possibility of honest confusion .
Some people may be attracted by parts of the libertarian program without buying into its underlying morality .
The bottom line
" The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much ; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little . "
-- Franklin D. Roosevelt
I have my own articles of faith .
I think a political philosophy should
benefit the entire population , not an elite of whatever flavor
offer a positive vision , not just hatred for another philosophy
rest on the best science and history can teach us , rather than science fiction
be modified in the light of what works and what does n't
produce greater freedom and prosperity the closer a nation comes to it .
On all these counts , libertarianism simply does n't stack up .
Once people are able to be rational about politics , I expect them to toss it out as a practical failure and a moral mess .
a lie in the form of doublespeak , which is constructed to disguise or distort its actual meaning , often resulting in a communication bypass

Well , here 's your chance to be frustrated !
Actually , I 'm kinda kidding .

I was in a state of shock but also quite calm
Amanda Morgan
Amanda Morgan , from Neath , gave birth to her 5 lb 6 oz ( 2.43kg ) daughter Caitlin after leaving the surgery .
She was told she was having the " classic signs of early menopause " , but her condition had been misdiagnosed .
The Royal College of Midwives said cases like hers were very rare , but fast labours were often uncomplicated .
The legal secretary , who already had two sons aged 13 and 10 from a previous relationship , described how she gave birth to Caitlin at home 11 months ago .
It was a complete shock to me , " she said .
" I 'd had no morning sickness or tiredness and had absolutely no bump at all .
" I 'm 40 and had decided not to have any more children .
I thought my baby - making days were long gone .
" I had only put on about a pound in weight but just thought I 'd been snacking too much in the run-up to Christmas . "
She gave birth within minutes of breaking the news to her partner Chris Grinter , 42 , of the menopause diagnosis after she had seen her doctor .
' Overjoyed '
" My mum died from cancer so I worried there might be something seriously wrong .
" But I was very reassured when my doctor said I was experiencing the classic signs of the menopause .
She then booked blood tests at hospital to check my hormone levels . "
She returned home after the appointment and complained of feeling " exhausted " .
She had gone to the bathroom when she felt a " crippling pain " .
Amanda Morgan , Chris Grinter and their expanded family
" There was no time to even shout out to Chris - it was that quick .
" A strange calm took over and with one push Caitlin was out .
She barely cried , just wriggled .
" I grabbed a towel and wrapped her in it .
I was in a state of shock but also quite calm . "
She said her partner 's " face went white " when he saw the baby .
" He was just gobsmacked - I do n't think he could take it all in and I can't blame him . "
Mr Grinter dialled 999 and paramedics arrived to cut the cord as she lay in the bathroom .
They were taken to Singleton Hospital , Swansea , and she was told she was six months into her pregnancy when Caitlin was born .
The baby was in a ventilator and allowed home after five weeks .
The family are ready to celebrate her first birthday on 19 February .
" Caitlin is Chris 's first baby so he 's particularly thrilled .
We had discussed having a baby - but decided against it because of my age .
" Even now I look back on photos just a few weeks before I had her and cannot believe I was pregnant .
" But Caitlin is the most adorable baby and we are all overjoyed to have her .
She is also the easiest baby - a bit like my pregnancy . "
Sue Jacobs of the Royal College of Midwives said : " This is only the third time I 've come across one like this in my 25 years as a midwife .
" But women do occasionally experience what seem like periods in pregnancy .
" In such cases it 's because the bleeding is caused by the placenta and just happens to coincide with period dates .
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Communist Cuba has authorized the unrestricted sale of computers and DVD and video players in the first sign that its new president , Raul Castro , is moving to improve Cubans ’ access to consumer goods .
An internal government memo seen by Reuters on Thursday said the appliances long desired by Cubans can go on sale immediately , although air conditioners will not be available until next year and toasters until 2010 due to limited power supplies .
Only foreigners and companies can buy computers in Cuba at present , while DVD players were seized at the airport until last year , when customs rules were eased .
Now Cubans will be able to buy them freely , paying for them in hard currency CUCs , or convertible pesos , worth 24 times more than the Cuban pesos state wages are paid in .
“ Based on the improved availability of electricity , the government at the highest level has approved the sale of some equipment which was prohibited , ” the memo said .
It also listed television sets , which were already on sale , electric pressure cookers and rice cookers , electric bicycles , car alarms and microwave ovens .
Raul Castro , 76 , has led Cuba since July 2006 when his older brother Fidel Castro provisionally handed over power after intestinal surgery from which he has not fully recovered .
The younger Castro was formally named president on February 24 , becoming Cuba ’s first new leader in almost half a century , and he promised to ease some of the restrictions on daily life .
“ The country ’s priority will be to meet the basic needs of the population , both material and spiritual , ” he said as he replaced Fidel Castro , a staunch critic of capitalist consumer society .

Last year , under Raul Castro ’s provisional government , customs regulations were eased to allow Cubans to bring in some electronic equipment and car parts .
AIR CONDITIONERS AND TOASTERS
The new memo circulated within the state - run retail system said Cubans will have access to a second group of products in 2009 , including air conditioners , which are much in demand to help endure the hot summer days in the tropical country .
If Cuba ’s electricity supplies permit , additional appliances to be sold freely in 2010 include toasters and electric ovens , the memo said .
Cubans were delighted with the prospect of being able to buy items such as microwave ovens and air conditioners that were previously only available as stolen goods on the black market .
Shop attendants in central Havana had not heard about the measure but said there was great demand for the items .
“ That ’s great .
I hope this is the necessary start along a new path , ” said second - hand clothes vendor Maritza Hernandez , eager to see further reforms to Cuba ’s command economy .
The sale of many electric appliances was banned in the 1990s when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived Cuba of billions of dollars in subsidies and oil supplies , resulting in an energy crunch and daily blackouts of as long as 18 hours .
Cuba put an end to power cuts in 2006 by importing hundreds of electricity generators run on fuel supplied by Venezuela , its main foreign ally .
Raul Castro has encouraged debate of Cuba ’s economic woes and has received a torrent of complaints focusing mainly on poor wages and limited access to consumer goods that are priced in hard currency .
In December , he said Cuba had too many restrictions and last month , formally assuming leadership , he vowed “ in the next few weeks we shall start removing the most simple of them . ”
Many Cubans expect the state to soon allow them to buy cellular telephones .
While they will now be able to buy computers , access to the Internet remains controlled by the government .
" Is the American era over ? "
That was the big question that launched a lengthy analysis by veteran international affairs reporter James Kitfield in the influential National Journal last May .
Significantly , the article  which featured interviews with an all - star cast of former top U.S. policymakers  was titled " The Decline Begins . "
Nine months later , the notion that Washington has entered a " New American Century "  a phrase used by the nationalist and neoconservative unilateralists who championed the Iraq war  in which the U.S. can do whatever it wants , where it wants , and when it wants , without consulting anyone else , seems largely to have gone the way of the dodo bird .
" We are in a multipolar world , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates told a Washington Post columnist recently in what has to be considered the ultimate heresy to pro-war hawks led by the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney and Gates ’ predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld .
Indeed , last month ’s image of President George W. Bush imploring King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to boost the battered U.S. economy helped bring home the notion that the commander in chief ’s word no longer serves as an imperial command .
" It ’s affected our families .
Paying more for gasoline hurts some of the American families , " Bush told reporters just before his meeting with the king .
After the meeting Saudi Arabia ’s oil minister made clear that Riyadh would increase production only " when the market justifies it " and not before .
Almost as pathetic in their own way were the recent exhortations by Gates  the steward of a military establishment that spends more money each year than the combined defense budgets of all of the world ’s other nations  for Washington ’s NATO allies to contribute 7,000 more troops to help U.S. forces pacify Afghanistan six years after Rumsfeld and his neoconservative advisers contemptuously spurned their offers of help .
That the response Gates received was not much more favorable than that delivered by Saudi Arabia ’s oil minister to Bush ’s entreaties spoke volumes not only about the way that his administration has both misunderstood and mishandled its " global war on terror , " but , more ominously , about the weakness and fragility of the alliance which Washington led to victory against the Soviet Union in the Cold War .
The last time that policy circles buzzed about Washington ’s " decline " came during the waning years of the Cold War , when Yale Professor Paul Kennedy published The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers .
The study argued that the U.S. was falling into a familiar historical pattern where the combination of huge military budgets and ever larger deficits led inevitably to the kind of " imperial overstretch " that transformed once - mighty empires into shadows of their former selves .
Kennedy ’s theory , however , did not anticipate the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union , an earth - shaking event that , combined with Washington ’s decisive victory in the first Gulf War , left the U.S. as the world ’s undisputed " hyperpower . "
This status was celebrated by neoconservatives like Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer who , at the time , coined the phrase , " The Unipolar Moment . "
The status was also reflected in the Pentagon ’s draft 1992 Defense Planning Guidance ( DPG ) , which , in turn , became the inspiration for the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) in 1997 and Bush ’s first National Security Strategy ( NSS ) released six months before the Iraq invasion .
At the time , Kennedy himself suggested that Washington may have somehow escaped the laws of history , noting that the sheer size of the U.S. economy , and its technological prowess and military dominance , were unprecedented .
" I ’ve gone back in history and never seen anything like it , " he exclaimed at one seminar .
" People are now coming out of the closet on the word ’ empire , ’ " exulted Krauthammer .
" The fact is no country has been as dominant culturally , economically , technologically , and militarily in the history of the world since the Roman Empire . "
What a difference five years and an invasion and bungled occupation of Iraq make !
References to the Roman Empire at this point are more likely to refer to its decline than to its power  an observation confirmed even by Donald Kagan , a dean of neoconservatism and Kennedy ’s colleague at Yale , whose sons , Robert and Frederick , have been champions of the Bush Doctrine and the Iraq War .
" I ’ve argued that not since the Roman Empire has anyone had such extraordinary power as the United States after the Cold War , " Kagan told Kitfield .
" But all of the elements of our strength are now being challenged , and it ’s perfectly possible that we are seeing a relative decline in U.S. power that will prove lasting . "
Indeed , that possibility has been transformed into a probability , if not a certainty , by a growing number of policy analysts who see major structural shifts in the distribution of global power  both " hard " and " soft "  none of which are likely to lead to the maintenance , let alone the enhancement , of Washington ’s post - Cold War dominance .
Not only have both Iraq and Afghanistan shown the world the limits of U.S. military power , but they are also exacting an increasingly fearsome toll on Washington ’s ability to wage war .
Despite gains in the security situation in Iraq over the past year , top Pentagon brass and independent experts are warning that the current pace of deployments is creating a " hollow force " both in terms of personnel and equipment .
In an echo of Kennedy 20 years ago , " overstretched " is the adjective most frequently associated with the U.S. military .
Just as Kennedy had warned against the deadly long - term impact on empires of budgetary deficits , the Bush years have seen an explosion not just of government debt  currently more than $ 9 trillion  but also of trade and balance - of - payments deficits .
Much of this is due to the high price of oil and gas imports  which a growing number of experts now believe has become a permanent fixture of the international economy .
The results of the evolving global economy include a much - weakened dollar and increased reliance by both the U.S. government and U.S. business on foreign creditors .
Among these creditors are state - controlled agencies ( or sovereign wealth funds ) some of which  notably those of China , Russia , and oil - exporting Gulf states  are not enthralled , to say the least , with Krauthammer ’s unipolar vision .
If , for commercial or political reasons , any of these creditors decided to dump their hundreds of billions of dollars of dollar - denominated assets  or in the case of key energy exporters , for example , to price their commodities in a currency other than the dollar  the economic impact would be " grave , " according to Charles Freeman , retired U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia .
Freeman ’s point was echoed for the first time last week in the U.S. intelligence community ’s annual review of the major global threats facing the nation .
The possibility that some combination of those creditors , whose own commercial ties have been growing at an accelerating rate , could decide to act in concert in order to constrain Washington ’s freedom of action  in Central Asia or Iran , for example  is the emerging nightmare of U.S. policymakers .
Some analysts , including the director of the Geopolitics of Energy Initiative of the New America Foundation ( NAF ) , Flynt Leverett , profess to see the emergence of a potential counterweight to U.S. power  one , significantly , that does not depend on the cooperation of Washington ’s Western allies .
" A ‘ community ’ of largely non-democratic manufacturing powers and energy exporters is already laying the groundwork for real strategic collaboration , aimed at limiting America ’s ability to carry out [ its ] hegemonic agendas , " Leverett , who served in the National Security Council under Bill Clinton and Bush , wrote recently in the National Interest journal published by the Nixon Center .
As a result , the degree to which Washington can slow its decline and preserve its primacy will depend increasingly on its willingness to suppress its unilateralist reflexes and " to take account of the perceptions and interests of others in its foreign - policy decision - making , " according to Leverett .

What if swallowing a pill with a camera could detect the earliest signs of cancer ?
The tiny camera is designed to take high - quality , color pictures in confined spaces .
Such a device could find warning signs of esophageal cancer , the fastest growing cancer in the United States .
A fundamentally new design has created a smaller endoscope that is more comfortable for the patient and cheaper to use than current technology .
Its first use on a human , scanning for early signs of esophageal cancer , will be reported in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering .
" Our technology is completely different from what 's available now .
This could be the foundation for the future of endoscopy , " said lead author Eric Seibel , a University of Washington research associate professor of mechanical engineering .
In the past 30 years diagnoses of esophageal cancer have more than tripled .
The esophagus is the section of digestive tract that moves food from the throat down to the stomach .
Esophageal cancer often follows a condition called Barrett 's esophagus , a noticeable change in the esophageal lining .
Patients with Barrett 's esophagus can be healed , avoiding the deadly esophageal cancer .
But because internal scans are expensive most people do n't find out they have the condition until it 's progressed to cancer , and by that stage the survival rate is less than 15 percent .
" These are needless deaths , " Seibel said .
" Any screen that detected whether you had a treatable condition before it had turned into cancer would save lives . "
An endoscope is a flexible camera that travels into the body 's cavities to directly investigate the digestive tract , colon or throat .
Most of today 's endoscopes capture the image using a traditional approach where each part of the camera captures a different section of the image .
These tools are long , flexible cords about 9 mm wide , about the width of a human fingernail .
Because the cord is so wide patients must be sedated during the scan .
advertisement
The scanning endoscope developed at the UW is fundamentally different .
It consists of just a single optical fiber for illumination and six fibers for collecting light , all encased in a pill .
Seibel acted as the human volunteer in the first test of the UW device .
He reports that it felt like swallowing a regular pill , and the tether , which is 1.4 mm wide , did not bother him .
Once swallowed , an electric current flowing through the UW endoscope causes the fiber to bounce back and forth so that its lone electronic eye sees the whole scene , one pixel at a time .
At the same time the fiber spins and its tip projects red , green and blue laser light .
The image processing then combines all this information to create a two - dimensional color picture .
In the tested model the fiber swings 5,000 times per second , creating 15 color pictures per second .
The resolution is better than 100 microns , or more than 500 lines per inch .
Although conventional endoscopes produce images at higher resolution , the tethered - capsule endoscope is designed specifically for low - cost screening .
Using the scanning device is cheap because it's so small it does n't require anesthesia and sedation , which increase the cost of the traditional procedure .
" The procedure is so easy I could imagine it being done in a shopping mall , " Seibel said .
advertisement
A wireless scope manufactured by a different group , originally designed to pass through the body and detect intestinal cancer , is now being marketed for esophageal cancer screening .
The competing technology comes in a pill about the width of an adult fingernail and twice as long .
By contrast , the UW 's scanning fiber endoscope 's dimensions are about half as big and the device fits inside a standard pill capsule .
The pill could be even smaller , Seibel said , but the researchers chose a size that would be easy to handle and swallow .
Another disadvantage of wireless capsules is they only allow a single fly - by view .
" You have no control over the other pill once it 's swallowed .
It just flutters down , " Seibel said .
But since the UW scope is tethered , the doctor can move it up and down along the region of interest .
Only a small percentage of people who get Barrett 's esophagus , about 5 percent to 10 percent , develop cancer .
So any screening method must have a low price to be cost - effective .
" The next big challenge is to make this cheaply , " Seibel said .
The researchers are negotiating a contract to commercialize the technology .
In the future they hope to not only take pictures , but also deliver treatments through the device , and to apply it to other diseases .
The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute and Pentax Corp .
Early funding was provided by the Whitaker Foundation and the Washington Technology Center .
Co-authors at the UW are Drs. Michael Kimmey and Jason Dominitz in gastroenterology at the UW Medical Center ; Richard Johnston , C. David Melville and Cameron Lee in mechanical engineering ; Steve Seitz in computer science and engineering ; and Robert Carroll , now in electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California , Berkeley .
Ah , the perils having an automatically updated news feed and stock price graph on your company 's home page :

The trouble is that they are one of the largest of what 's known as sub - prime mortgage lenders and the downturn in the housing market has hit them hard .
Very hard .
Might that new shade be ... red ?
I was tempted to buy some of their stock earlier today for some of the same reasons that I considered buying airline stocks not long after 9/11 .
But it looks like trading has been suspended .
We 'll have to see if the company sticks around , I guess .
Heh .

Sept. 11 families worry that Gitmo trials will be ' tainted ' Michael Roston and David Edwards

The families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks want justice for the killers of their loved ones .
But according to a report broadcast Tuesday on CNN , they want that justice to come at the end of a fair trial , and they worry the detainees in Guantanamo Bay will not get one .
" The evidence so far against these people will be tainted , " said widow Lori Van Auken .
" You put people to death based on tainted evidence ... because of the torture . "
The father - in - law of another victim , Bruce Decell , was less concerned with the prospect of the death penalty being requested by military prosecutors .
But he also wants the trials of the detainees to be fair .
CNN 's Allan Chernoff argues based on the interviews in his report that an untainted trial is at the forefront of the concerns of 9/11 families .
" It 's been 6 1 / 2 years since the nation 's most horrific terror attack , " he concludes .
" In that time , some of those whose lives were shattered by the murder of a loved one have reflected on the events to the point that their insistence on due process matches their desire for revenge .
CNN has a related story here .

This ought to be cause for celebration : New York state is closing some low - and medium - security prisons because it does n't have enough felons :
On Jan. 11 , the Spitzer administration announced plans to close Camp Gabriels , two other corrections camps and a medium - security prison , all of which have been operating below capacity since 1996 because of a decline in the number of nonviolent felons , the state ’s corrections commissioner , Brian Fischer , said .
Closing those prisons , Mr. Fischer said , would save the state millions of dollars , free up money for the treatment of sex offenders and mentally ill inmates , and finance programs like anger management and vocational training , meant to prepare prisoners for their release .
But New York has used prisons as a kind of rural subsidy ( as has Texas ) , which has left some little towns hooked on prison jobs and prison labor .
For example , " Camp " Gabriels , one of the prisons slated to close , employs 136 people in sparsely populated Franklin .
Predictably :
[ s ] mall businesses have staked their survival on the prison workers who patronize their stores .
Local governments and charities , meanwhile , have come to depend on inmate work crews to clear snow from fire hydrants , maintain parks and hiking trails , mow the lawns at cemeteries and unload trucks at food pantries .
. . .
“ All those services , when you put that into dollars , there ’s no way we’d be able to hire people to perform them , ” said Mary Ellen Keith , supervisor of the town of Franklin , which relies on the crews to cut overgrown brush from the sides of 67 miles of local roads , among other tasks .
The locals , prison workers and unions are organizing a campaign to save the prisons .
It 's only a matter of time before they figure out that the solution is to increase the demand for what they 're selling .
Mete out stiffer sentences for recreational drug users , for example .
Jail parking ticket scofflaws .
Or just criminalize can -kicking .
Think you drank a lot last night ?
In the olden days , you 'd have a shot of whiskey at lunch , finish out your day at the office , come home and have a martini or two , then drive to a cocktail party , down a couple of highballs with a bourbon chaser , and get behind the wheel to race erratically home to your eager , negligee - clad wife .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 March 26
Explanation :
An intriguing and beautiful nebula , NGC 3576 drifts through the Sagittarius arm of our spiral Milky Way Galaxy .
Within the region , episodes of star formation are thought to contribute to the complex and suggestive shapes .
Powerful winds from the nebula 's embedded , young , massive stars shape the looping filaments .
The dramatic false - color image also highlights the contributions of hydrogen , sulfur , and oxygen , energized by intense ultraviolet radiation , to the nebular glow .
But the glow also silhouettes dense clouds of dust and gas .
For example , the two condensing dark clouds near the top of the picture offer potential sites for the formation of new stars .
NGC 3576 itself is about 100 light - years across and 9,000 light - years away in the southern constellation of Carina , not far on the sky from the famous Eta Carinae Nebula .
Near the left edge of the picture is NGC 3603 , a much larger but more distant star forming region .
proposed new tag : IMG
IMG
Required argument is SRC = " url " .
This names a bitmap or pixmap file for the browser to attempt to pull
over the network and interpret as an image , to be embedded in the text
at the point of the tag 's occurrence .
An example is :
< IMG SRC=" file://foobar.com/foo/bar/blargh.xbm " >
( There is no closing tag ; this is just a standalone tag . )
This tag can be embedded in an anchor like anything else ; when that
happens , it becomes an icon that 's sensitive to activation just like a
regular text anchor .
Browsers should be afforded flexibility as to which image formats they
support .
Xbm and Xpm are good ones to support , for example .
If a
browser cannot interpret a given format , it can do whatever it wants
instead ( X Mosaic will pop up a default bitmap as a placeholder ) .
This is required functionality for X Mosaic ; we have this working , and
we 'll at least be using it internally .
I 'm certainly open to
suggestions as to how this should be handled within HTML ; if you have
a better idea than what I 'm presenting now , please let me know .
I
know this is hazy wrt image format , but I do n't see an alternative
than to just say ``let the browser do what it can ' ' and wait for the
perfect solution to come along ( MIME , someday , maybe ) .
Let me know what you think .........
Cheers ,

After watching the GOP debate from Boca Raton , Florida the other night [ January 24 , 2008 ] something hit me like a ton of bricks :
If Hillary becomes the Democratic nominee she will have to support the GOP nominee for President 's BIG LIE that no one could have known at the time they voted to authorize Bush to go to war against Iraq in October 2002 , that Saddam did n't have WMDs and by implication posed an imminent threat .
Since she has already stated she believed Saddam had these weapons because all of the " supposed " intelligence supported this claim despite inspectors on the ground in Iraq not finding any of these weapons , how can she back away from this totally absurd position now ?
How can she hold Bush and the GOP responsible for lying us into an illegal war of choice when she continued to support and defend this illegal war and the rationale for it as late as February 2005 even though everyone by this time already knew Saddam did n't have any WMDs and that the UN never sanctioned this invasion until AFTER it was already a fait accompli ?
What we have learned recently from two nonprofit journalism organizations is that Bush and other top officials in his administration lied 935 times regarding terrorism and the threat of Saddam and Iraq after 9/11 that were part of an orchestrated campaign to mislead us into war .
But what we also know is this :
The intelligence on Iraq was never a slam dunk in October 2002 that Saddam had WMDs let alone that he posed an imminent threat to use these weapons against the U.S. or was actively seeking and / or developing nuclear weapons .
From a report in the Wall Street Journal , " U - Turn on Iran Reflects Iraq Rivalries " , January 14 , 2008 , A8 , we learn that Thomas Fingar , a veteran State Department official and now a senior official at DNI , told top State Department officials including Colin Powell in 2002 , that his analysts had concluded , after a vigorous and thorough group examination of various assumptions , that Saddam did n't have an active nuclear weapon 's program .
In particular , his group disputed the White House claims about Iraq purchasing aluminum tubes to make weapons grade uranium .
We also learn that Mr. Fingar 's analysis infuriated the Bush Administration because it went against their plans for a war in Iraq .
Yet Mr. Fingar 's conclusions were not what Colin Powell told the UN when he argued that Saddam was actively seeking nuclear weapons .
Ask yourself these questions :
Do you personally know anyone who was concerned about Saddam attacking the United States BEFORE 9/11 ?
Or thought it was a good idea to invade Iraq to overthrow Saddam ?
I do n't !
It was only AFTER 9/11 when BushCo started beating drums for war against Iraq and deliberately and falsely linking Saddam to 9/11 that the issue of Saddam and Iraq being a threat to our security resonated beyond the Beltway .
See , this is what I have a very hard time understanding .
If everyone knew or should have known Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11 , why were sleazy hucksters like Bush and Cheney allowed to fearmonger enough Americans into believing and Congress into backing their lies ?
The Dems even held a slim majority in the Senate too .
If someone had been willing to stand up to Bush when he was equating Saddam with 9/11 , it would have undercut much of the rationale for voting for the October 2002 Use of Force Resolution .
Americans would have risen up in force against an illegal and immoral act of aggression like this instead of viewing it as revenge on Iraq for 9/11 .
Politicians can hide all they want behind some " discredited intelligence " on Iraq but in reality that cherry - picked intelligence was NEVER a valid reason to engage in an illegal and preemptive war against any sovereign country let alone for Democrats like Clinton to give someone as unscrupulous as Bush total freedom to take us to war on his own volition and on his own timetable .
Everyone should take the time to read the Use of Force Authorization that was voted on that allowed Bush to go to war against the Iraqi people .
There is absolutely no mention of Bush ONLY being able to use force as a last resort and / or ONLY AFTER the weapons inspectors were allowed to complete their job .
Many of the WHEREAS clauses in this document also contain known falsehoods or misleading statements about Saddam that were being spread by BushCo that should have alerted everyone in Congress that Bush was ONLY using this Resolution to take us into a war .
So my questions to Hillary are these :
As a trained lawyer , why did n't you insist that language be included in this Resolution so that Bush could only use force as a last resort before you agreed to vote for it ?
As a trained lawyer why did n't you understand the importance of putting everything in writing instead of taking people like Bush 's word for anything ?
As someone now selling herself as ready to lead on Day One , why did n't you support the Levin Amendment to this Resolution , which would have at least required Bush to come back to Congress and to get UN approval BEFORE Bush set about destroying Iraq ?
Even Senator Chafee , a Republican , was wiser than you were because not only did he vote against the Use of Force Authorization but he also correctly determined the Levin amendment was needed to prevent Bush from going to war as a first resort and without sufficient international support .
What scares me the most about Hillary if she becomes President is that no one except future historians will ever be able to examine how we were misled into war in Iraq and for certain , no one in the Bush Administration will be held accountable for the crimes that led us into one of the worst foreign policy disasters in our history .
These items will be swept aside just as quickly as Bush 41's and Ronald Reagan 's roles in Iran contra were swept aside by Bill Clinton .
Instead of prison , these criminals will be free to move into cushy jobs with other organizations or businesses , make millions on the lecture circuit , and / or or show up in the media like Oliver North and G. Gordon Liddy , where they can rehab their damaged reputations and make lots of money doing it .
Hillary with the aid of supportive Democrats will sell this deliberate cover -up of BushCo crimes as " the country ready to move on ... " or " we should leave this for future historians ..... "
But we cannot ever hope to set our country on a better and more sane course so we do n't repeat these same mistakes again and again if we allow these crimes to be washed over or sanitized with no one paying a price for having committed them .
And if an independent investigation shows that no crimes were in fact committed , the country will heal and move on feeling much better knowing the truth versus always wondering about it .
If Hillary becomes the nominee , you will not hear one word about holding people accountable for not only the war but also serious crimes against the Constitution .
If Hillary becomes the Democratic nominee , the Democratic ticket will be forced to support the false position of Bush and the GOP as to how we got into the Iraq War .
What we need instead is a nominee who never believed these lies at the time or at least does n't believe them now .
The Problem With Sex in Buddhism - - by Kusala Bhikshu
( From a talk given at a High School in Los Angeles . )
Photo - Bob Heide
It seems these days in Los Angeles , it 's OK to do or be anything you want sexually ...
And if you 're lucky enough to find your true sexual identity , you will be happy and fulfilled the rest of your life .
Well , in this world of * Samsara it just does n't work that way .
The Buddha more than anything else was a man , who went from childhood to manhood , got married , and at the age of 29 had his first child .
He went through all the stages men go through sexually , but at the age of 35 ended his sexual desire forever in * Nirvana .
The big question today is ...
Does the desire for sex always lead to suffering ?
The answer is , Yes !
But the reason may surprise you .
The Buddha in everything he said about sex implies ...
The activity of sex will never ultimately satisfy the desire for sex .
Now this is a real bummer if you think about it .
You can have sex a 1000 times , and want it a 1001 .
You can be 90 years old ...
Blind and cripple ...
Still want to have sex , and not be physically able to .
You will never get rid of your sexual desire by having sex .
In fact , it seems the more sex you have , the more sex you want .
I think sex is a lot like hunger ...
And to be honest with you , I 'm so tired of being hungry .
I have been hungry every day of my life .
I 'm hungry in the morning , in the afternoon , in the evening .
Think of all the time and money I could save if I gave up eating !
So what if tomorrow , I get up real early and eat as much as I desire , and anything I want .
Whatever looks good , I 'm going to eat it and keep eating it , until I am so full and satisfied , I will never want to eat again .
Well , if I were to do that what would happen ?
I would wake up the next morning and still be hungry and sex works the very same way !
You might be saying to yourself , " Well Kusala is a monk , and monks do n't have sex , so maybe if I choose celibacy I wo n't have to suffer . "
I wish life were so easy !
The people who choose a celibate lifestyle ( ' desire ' not to have ) suffer in a different way from people that choose to have sex ( ' desire ' to have ) .
But all people ( monks too ) suffer when it comes to sex , if they have desire .
The only way to have sex and not suffer , is to have no desire to have sex .
It sounds like a ' Zen Koan ' does n't it ?
To end our suffering we need to end our desire , our craving , our thirst .
When a Buddhist does end his / her desire in Nirvana , would there be any reason to have sex simply for pleasure ???
The problem with sex according to Buddhism ...
Is not the activity of sex , but the desire for sex .
The sexual desire of a human being will never be ultimately satisfied through sexual activity .
____________
* Samsára : ' round of rebirth ' , lit. perpetual wandering ' , is a name by which is designated the stages of life ever restlessly heaving up and down , the symbol of this continuous process of ever again and again being born , growing old , suffering and dying .
* Nibbána , ( Sanskrit Nirvána ) : lit. ' extinction ' ( nir + Ö va , to cease blowing , to become extinguished ) ; according to the commentaries , ' freedom from desire ' ( nir+ vana ) .
Nibbána constitutes the highest and ultimate goal of all Buddhist aspirations .
God of War creator David Jaffe is making some waves over on his blog this week by suggesting that the videogame industry get together and decide on one hardware platform , rather than put competing boxes on the market and split up consumers and software publishers .
Jaffe makes some passionate arguments about why it would be good for consumers and the industry .
But it 's not going to happen .
And to try to force it would be foolish for any companies that tried .
That said , on the matter of the " one standardized hardware , " Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft all agree with David Jaffe .
They all believe in , and are dedicating all of their business acumen to the goal of , having one single videogame console on the market .
Thing is , they all want it to be their console .
I would bet anything that Nintendo , for example , is totally into the idea of the standard hardware platform .
I 'm sure it would take Jaffe up on his offer first thing tomorrow morning .
Sony and Microsoft would simply discontinue their consoles , then start making games for the Wii .
Not going to happen , you say ?
Of course not .
But why would they accept anything less ?
They 're making money off the hardware .
Publishers pay them royalties to put their games on their consoles .
And Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft , as software makers , are able to sell more of their games because they have the direct line to consumers , having sold them the hardware in the first place .
Jaffe says that the hardware companies should put this all aside and make some decisions for the good of " the business . "
In fact , he has a great colorful metaphor : " I think the leaders of the biggest groups should come together from time to time – like the big Mafia families do in the movies – and make some decisions together for the overall health of the business . "
I love this image , but there 's one problem .
There is no single entity known as " the game industry . "
It 's merely a term used to describe a whole collection of game companies that interact , whether cooperatively or competitively .
But every one of those businesses is engaged in these partnerships only to the extent that it benefits their own bottom line .
The extent to which Microsoft will help software makers is defined by how it will benefit Microsoft .
They have no need to help Nintendo or Sony .
They 're trying to put them out of business .
Jaffe points out , as many who have advanced this argument often do , that we do n't have such a market - segmenting competition for other media , say , movies .
Entirely true , right ?
There 's only one format for film .
Oh wait , I mean there are like a hundred of them .
" But Chris , " you might say to me if we were on a first - name basis , " most of those formats were competing with each other around the turn of the century . "
And that is exactly my point .
One hundred years from now , people reading whatever the future 's version of Wikipedia is will look back at a similar list of competing video game formats , all clustered around the turn of the 21st century .
And they will marvel at how positively quaint we were .
We fool ourselves when we look at our multi-billion - dollar industry .
It 's a huge industry built around an immature medium .
I mean " immature " both in terms of the fact that so many videogames are still so crude in their presentation , but also in terms of technology .
Contemporary videogame technology is the equivalent of the kinetoscope .
We have so , so far to go , and game hardware is evolving in leaps and bounds .
I 'm not saying a single hardware standard could n't evolve just like consoles do now .
What I 'm saying is that until it gets to the point where diminishing returns mean that new technology does n't make a perceptible difference for the player , there are always going to be new consoles that pack more advanced technology – " standard hardware " be damned .
It all goes back to the point that there is no " videogame industry . "
Let 's say that Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft all decided to go in together on a console .
Does that mean that it would be the only console on the market ?
Of course not .
Some other opportunistic company would come in a year later with a new , more powerful console , and pull the rug out from underneath this gang of game hardware Mafiosi .
As I said above :
It would be foolish for any hardware maker to sign on to this " standard " if they could capture more market share by going it alone and making better hardware .
Not to mention the fact that typically companies take a loss on hardware to make up for it with game sales and royalties – the ol ' " razor - and - blades " model .
As soon as you have a hardware standard and the sale of hardware is no longer necessarily tied to the sale of games , the price of the hardware has to go up .
That 's exactly what happened with 3DO .
Jaffe says the 3DO failed because " was way too expensive and could not compete with the new game hardware coming out that was selling at much cheaper prices . "
He 's exactly right .
And why was it expensive ?
Because the hardware makers who licensed the tech had to price the box very high so they could make money off of it
As far as Panasonic knew , the only 3DO - related transaction they were going to make was the sale of that console .
There was nothing else waiting for them .
So they needed to make a non-trivial profit .
And why was Sony able to come in and compete more heavily with a cheaper box ?
Because they were the only hardware maker , and could afford to take a loss on the system because they were operating under the traditional model .
Jaffe , for his part , says in a NeoGAF thread that followed his post that he 's okay with the resultant hardware standard being less powerful because he 's only interested in casual games , and that the success of the Wii and DS shows that casual gamers are a more powerful market force than gamers who want bleeding - edge graphics .
Perhaps , but it 's not just graphic power that we have to worry about .
In a world with one hardware standard that has to be voted on by Mafia committee and please every software maker , we would n't have gotten the DS .
Or the Wii .
As soon as any company gets itself into the mentality that videogames have done the vast majority of their evolving and that now it 's just a matter of smoothing out the rough edges , it is going to get blindsided .
Practically every industry pundit called the DS a gimmick , and now I do n't think any serious person believes for a second that the next generation of portables wo n't all have touch screens .
Yes , eventually Nintendo will get fat and happy and complacent , and some company will come up with some new piece of brilliance and pull the rug out from under them .
And there 's so much of that that 's going to happen over the next few decades .
This is n't crazy science - fiction talk .
Five years ago , nobody thought that we'd be controlling a game system just by pointing at the TV .
Five years from now it 'll be something else .
Jaffe says that having a hardware standard would be better for consumers for three reasons : " Massive content choice , " " better quality products , " and " more competition on the software side . "
And it 's true :
If game publishers only had to develop for one platform , they 'd turn out better products and the playing field would be open to more companies .
This reminds me of why I like David Jaffe so much .
As director of God of War , he pushed hard against the edges of videogames , spending years on this one project that ended up being an absolute breakthrough .
Our future - Wikipedia readers from a hundred years in the future , I firmly believe , will see * God of War *as a major step forward in the evolution of the medium .
That 's why I think Jaffe is looking at this situation through the lens of someone who is quite gifted at innovating via software design .
* God of War * did n't need a special controller to push the envelope .
And Jaffe is right when he suggests that , all things being equal , more game designers would have the chance to do what he did if they did n't have to make a game across multiple platforms , or split up resources among all the different hardware formats .
And all things being equal , he 's right .
It 's a nice thing to think about .
Like world peace , or what it would be like to have my very own pony .
It 's nice to have dreams .
But to suggest that Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft should actually , today , get together and try to hammer out one single console is about as realistic as saying that if I moved my bed to the other side of my studio apartment , I could get a stable in here .
Nice and workable are two very different things .
As I intimated above , I do think that one day we will in fact have some kind of de facto gaming hardware standard .
It 'll be at the point where consumers no longer notice a real difference with more advanced technology .
More to the point , it 'll be when game designers can do anything they want , and are only limited by the boundaries of their imagination .
When controllers can't get any more accurate because we have total control over whatever we want , instantly .
Then , content will become king , and console wars wo n't matter .
But that 's a long ways off , and for now , the only one - console solution that game hardware makers would ever entertain is for both of its competitors to drop out .

About ...
Yes , I 'm concerned about the environment , global warming , and about the profligate and spiralling energy consumption of the developed - and developing world .
I 'm also irritated by many of the headline - grabbing campaigns which , though well - meaning , appear to be more about gaining environmental ' brownie points ' than actually making any real difference .
Space - heating and transport use far more energy than lighting , so why the demonisation of the humble incandescent lightbulb ?
Introduction
Fluorescent lamps distort colours making a room appear grey , flat , lifeless , and even " clinical " .
Wood and skin colours often take on an unhealty greenish tinge , and make food look most unappetising .
As a colour - scientist and amateur photographer , my eyes are offended by the colour - characteristics of fluorescent light .
As a physicist my intellect is offended by disproportionality of the notion of calling for a ban on a form of lighting which accounts for less than 1 % of the total national CO 2 generation while largely ignoring car-use and the over - heating of homes and business premises where vastly greater savings could be made .
generation while largely ignoring car-use and the over - heating of homes and business premises where vastly greater savings could be made .
I 'm quite happy to aim for a low - energy lifestyle , but please , stop the nannying and leave the details of how I achieve that up to me !
Savings from the use of CFLs are small or comparable to other household activities ...
In a typical British household , replacing standard bulbs with CFLs would save not much more than 2 % of the total household direct CO 2 emissions ( from electricity + gas+car use )
emissions ( from electricity + gas + car use ) Daily , this amount of CO 2 is roughly equivalent to that emitted by : driving a car 1 or 2 miles half a drying programme in a tumble dryer refining primary aluminium to manufacture two aluminium drinks cans a typical TV / satellite box / DVD player installation being left in standby rather than switched off at wall when not in use
is roughly equivalent to that emitted by :
At typical UK mileage you 'd save ten times more CO 2 by swapping a gas - guzzling 4x4 for a smaller family car .
more CO by swapping a gas - guzzling 4x4 for a smaller family car .
Many households could probably also save ten times as much CO 2 , relatively painlessly , by being more frugal with their heating , reducing the thermostat temperature , and using the timeswitch to turn off ( or manually turn right down ) the heating during the hours when the house is unoccupied , or overnight .
2
British cars are usually reckoned to have a typical annual mileage of 10000 miles .
3300 kWh electricity 1800 kg CO 2 assorted uses 20500 kWh gas 3900 kg CO 2 primarily used for heating , some cooking 10000 car miles 2900 kg CO 2 Total : 8600 kg CO 2

0.54kgCO 2 per kWh electricity , 0.19kgCO 2 per kWh natural gas , 2.3kgCO 2 per litre of petrol ( gasoline ) http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/envrp/gas/envrpgas-annexes.pdf
Replacing three 60W conventional bulbs with 15 W compact fluorescent equivalents burning for 5 hours per day saves 246kWh of electricity per year , around 140 kg of CO 2 ( a mere 1.6 % of 8600 kg total ) .
CFLs are not perfect replacements for traditional incandescent bulbs ...
Aesthetics :
2
The poor colour - rendering is very bad for everyone that notices it , but will be disasterous for photographers and artists .
Most CFLs cannot be dimmed
There 's no CFL equivalent to the miniature halogen spotlights producing a narrow beam of light , popular in kitchens or above tables .
Because the source is " extended " , CFLs cannot reproduce the " sparkle " of the light from a clear - glass ( as opposed to " pearl " or frosted ) conventional bulb .
Practicalities
Owing to their extra complexity they are more likely to have reliability issues when subject to repeated temperature changes in such locations too .
For little - used lights in cupboards , the energy saving is utterly negligible .
Fluorescent lamps always emit a certain amount of radiofrequency interference ( RFI ) which may cause hums , buzzes , or whines in radio receivers and audio equipment .
If this is a problem then conventional bulbs need to be used in the vicinity of the affected equipment .
A " ban " on conventional lightbulbs is disproportionate , and any law to enforce it would be disproportionate too .
There are all sorts of miniature and specialist conventional bulbs , for ornamental lights , for ovens and sewing machines .
Torch bulbs .
Old , even antique , slide and cine - projectors .
Where are you going to draw the line ?
How do you propose to enforce the law ?
What will be the penalty for violating it ?
And will it be proportionate , considering that , for example , cars are responsible for vastly more CO 2 than domestic lightbulbs ?
Given that the " wasted " energy from lightbulbs is merely heat , yet dedicated electric heating appliances are widely used , and many new homes are being built with solely electric heating throughout , a law banning lightbulbs would be daft .
How dare the government propose meddling with the lights in peoples own homes , while in the meantime building new roads and airport runways !
In Britain we already pay tax ( VAT ) on fuels ; since electricity is around 3 ~4 × the price of gas , comparing gas with electricity the tax is already roughly in proportion to the CO 2 emissions .
Lighting basics
Incandescent bulbs
The only ' problem ' with incandescent lamps is their poor efficiency ; a very high proportion ( perhaps 95 % * ) of the power put into them is turned into heat , rather than useful light .
Standard ( 40W/60 W/100W ) mains lightbulbs have efficiencies around 15 lm / W , while quartz - halogen bulbs may be around 24 lm / W .
Fluorescent lamps
The best modern narrow - diameter ( T5 ) fluorescent tubes claim an electricity - to - light conversion efficiency of around 100 lm / W , while compact fluorescents are typically only half as efficient ( 40-60 lm / W ) .
A CFL lamp of the same nominal light output as an incandescent typically consumes one quarter the electrical power and therefore runs much cooler .
Lamp efficiency
The real energy issue : heating and transport
Contrary to popular perception , it actually takes less , and often much less , energy to heat up a house which has been left to go cold [ e.g. during the day , or overnight ] than it would have done to keep it warm all along .
The rate of heat loss ( energy loss ) from a premises due to conduction through the walls and windows etc is proportional to the difference between the inside and outside temperature .
Far better to be tucked up under a thick duvet at 5 am than have the central heating working hard to keep the whole house at 21 Celcius while the outdoor temperature is at its coldest !

Rejoice , The Hummer Is Dead /
It might be the end of the world 's most phallically sad SUV .
But has the damage been done ?
The late Rev. Jerry Falwell ?
He was exactly like a Hummer H2 .
Oh yes he was .
Bloated , arrogant , offensive to millions and deeply wrong in a thousand ways and yet blindly worshipped by a shockingly large and happily uninformed throng of devout minions for no other reason than he was , well , bloated , arrogant and wrong .
Is that too harsh ?
Lacking in prudent subtlety ?
I 'm completely OK with that .
See , it is time for much rejoicing .
It is time for an upraising of hands and a hallelujah and a praise be to the heavens despite how , of course , the heavens do n't really exist .
No , not for the death of Falwell , for that would be pointless and in poor taste and besides , the ever - acerbic Christopher Hitchens did it much better over at Slate .
And as I pointed out last week , Falwell 's own collection of ( in ) famous quotes do a far better job of revealing the man 's true nature and worth to humanity than any sort of carefully articulated , cheerful celebration of his demise ever could .
No , this minor offering of joy is for the imminent and forthcoming death of the Hummer H2 itself .
Oh my yes .
See , sales of this particular model -- perhaps the most idiotic consumer vehicle ever produced in your lifetime -- are down .
Way down , a full 27 percent from last year alone , which was already way down 22 percent from the year prior , with sales continuing to plummet as fast as gas prices are rising and Bush 's war is raging and Americans are generally snapping awake to the fact that dumping well over 100 bucks to fill the tank of this monster abomination every other day might not be the best way to waste their kid 's college fund .
Hence , it 's heavily rumored that GM will soon kill the model entirely , which is already being supplanted by a slew of smaller , less disgusting H2 offspring like the H3 and the H3 pickup and the H3 whatever - the - hell - else - they - can - think - of to milk this horrible idea until it 's deader than Dick Cheney 's black soul at a pagan tree festival .
Is this not good news ?
Is this not a sign that times , at long last , might be changing for the better , even just a little ?
Wait , do n't answer just yet .
First , a flashback .
Do you remember the time , that dark and skanky period of bleakness way back in , say , 2003 , when gas was ( relatively ) cheap and Bush 's war was still being spun as some sort of righteous , WMD - justified love - in and the dour , global - warming - is - a- liberal - hoax Republicans controlled the sour American universe ?
It was a time when GM dealers could n't sell the giant hunk of laughable penis compensation known as the Hummer H2 -- which was nominated that very year for North American Truck of the Year -- fast enough .
GM even went so far as to build ridiculous , theme park - like Hummer dealerships and to contract with special plants in Indiana to crank out America 's ugliest , most dangerous , least environmentally friendly monster truck , and celebs and rappers and pro athletes and supermodels and senators and glitz wannabes of every ilk everywhere could n't waste 50 grand on the horribly built , lunkish hunk of karmic contempt fast enough .
Oh what a time it was .
Fast forward to right now .
The Republican party is grumbling on the sidelines , kicked to the curb by their own impressive corruption and warmongering and excessive kowtowing to the extreme religious right .
America feels slightly more wary , awake , a tad more environmentally aware , slightly more in touch with something resembling its soul .
And the H2 -- essentially the emblem of all that is / was wrong with Bush 's America -- the bloat , the recklessness , the false machismo and unchecked waste and bigger - is - better senselessness -- might very well end production entirely .
Something , at long last , seem to be changing for the better .
Or is it ?
See , there 's this snag ( is n't there always ? ) :
Because despite the H2's apparent demise , despite $ 4 gallons of gas , despite a huge increase in sales of hybrids and the move toward alternative energy and despite all the talk of the " greening " of America , sales of giant SUVs seem to be surging once again , just this year , after many months of slumping sales .
What the hell is going on ?
Is it because , like Dick Cheney , like Karl Rove , like Jerry Falwell , like reality TV , the dumb - as - lead Hummer H2 has had its nasty , permanent effect ?
Has the giant SUV now become so mainstream , so deeply tattooed into the pasty , overweight flesh of American culture that it does n't even really matter that the H2 is on its way out , essentially turning into a sad , silly cultural footnote ?
Do you already know the answer ?
Perhaps it is simply the way of the culture , the evolution of a very bad idea , made slightly more palatable through slick , careful marketing .
Today , manufacturers are simply redesigning and rebranding their luxobarges as crossover vehicles , offering slightly improved handling and slightly improved fuel economy and not at all improved emissions and slightly less chance of flaming rollover death at the slightest need for emergency handling at any speed over about 20 mph , and hence many Americans somehow think that buying the newer , sleeker three - ton Chevy Suburban with 23 cup holders instead of the 2005 model with only 14 must be , you know , a healthy improvement .
Or perhaps it 's a remnant of the careless Boomer worldview , that all - American , use - it - before - it 's - gone attitude that spins on an axis of a truly horrible irony :
The more we learn of our desperate environmental straits , the more we learn of dwindling oil reserves and the more we learn that our shiny happy United States might not be the responsible , beneficent global superpower we once dreamed it was , the more we say " screw it " and grab onto the last gasp of pleasurable excess and vice no matter the future repercussions , telling ourselves we might as well enjoy that stupid , chromed - out three - ton GMC Yukon Denali before the oil runs out and the terrorists eat my babies and the damn liberals change the laws and make us all drive Smart cars to the Tofu Hut in order to turn us all gay .
Sound familiar ?
But no matter how you slice it , the ongoing SUV phenom is , in its way , one of our most fascinating cultural studies , a neat -- if rather depressing -- measure of American attitudes .
The truth is , the comically irresponsible H2 represented and encapsulated its brutal -- though mercifully brief -- time period in Bush 's America perfectly .
And now perhaps we are simply moving on to the next phase , slightly improved , a tad more aware , but somehow remaining completely unfazed by $ 120 tanks of gas and ongoing pollution and the rather obvious idea that , despite the slick marketing hype , nothing significant has really changed at all .
Bottom line :
You can hope for the big shifts .
You can hope for some sort of grand awakening , some sort of removal of the tumor and a relief from the pain of excess waste and abuse and happy ignorance .
But , of course , what you get instead is , well , a nice drive to the megamall in a shiny 2008 Escalade for a couple of aspirin and some compact fluorescent lightbulbs and a copy of " An Inconvenient Truth " on DVD .
Ain't that America .

Japanese researchers created pluripotent cells
The breakthrough promises a plentiful new source of cells for use in research into new treatments for many diseases .
Crucially , it could mean that such research is no longer dependent on using cells from human embryos , which has proved highly controversial .
The US and Japanese studies feature in the journals Science and Cell .
The induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do - its going to completely change the field
Professor James Thomson
University of Wisconsin- Madison
Q&A : Creating stem cells ' An exciting advance '
Until now only cells taken from embryos were thought to have an unlimited capacity to become any of the 220 types of cell in the human body - a so - called pluripotent state .
But campaigners have objected to their use on the grounds that it is unethical to destroy embryos in the name of science .
In the US only limited use of embryonic stem cells is allowed by scientists receiving public funding .
The Japanese team used a chemical cocktail containing just four gene - controlling proteins to transform adult human fibroblasts - skin cells that are easy to obtain and grow in culture - into a pluripotent state .
For once we have better science coinciding with better ethics
Josephine Quintavalle
Comment on Reproductive Ethics
The cells created were similar , but not identical , to embryonic stem cells , and the researchers used them to produce brain and heart tissue .
After 12 days in the laboratory clumps of cells grown to mimic heart muscle tissue started beating .
The US team , from the University of Wisconsin - Madison , achieved the same effect by using a slightly different combination of chemicals .
They have created eight new stem cell lines for potential use in research .
Cloning superceded
Using skin cells should mean that treatments could be personalised for individual patients , minimising the risk of rejection .
Although it is early days for this technique it may well prove to be every bit as significant as the first derivation of human embryonic stem cells nine years ago
Dr Lyle Armstrong
University of Newcastle Upon Tyne
Not only does the new technique remove the need to create embryos in the lab , it is also more simple , and more precisely controlled than current cloning technology .
Professor Ian Wilmut , of the University of Edinburgh , who led the team which created Dolly the sheep in 1996 , has said it represents a significant advance .
However , the researchers have warned more work is needed to refine the process , and ensure its safety .
At present both techniques rely on viruses to introduce new material into the cells , which carries a potential risk of contamination .
Researcher Professor James Thomson said : " The induced cells do all the things embryonic stem cells do .
" It 's going to completely change the field . "
Dr Shinya Yamanaka , of Kyoto University , a member of the Japanese research team , said : " These cells should be extremely useful in understanding disease mechanisms and screening effective and safe drugs . "
Positive reaction
Professor Azim Surani , of the University of Cambridge , said the research should allow scientists to create a large range of human stem cell types , which could prove invaluable in studying disease .
He said : " It is relatively easy to grow an entire plant from a small cutting , something that seems inconceivable in humans .
" Yet this study brings us tantalisingly close to using skin cells to grow many different types of human tissues .
Dr Lyle Armstrong , of the International Centre For Life at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne , called the studies a " major development " .
He said : " Although it is early days for this technique it may well prove to be every bit as significant as the first derivation of human embryonic stem cells nine years ago . "
Professor Robin Lovell - Badge , of the Medical Research Council 's National Institute For Medical Research , said the work was exciting , but work was required to end the reliance on viruses , and to tease out why two different techniques produced similar results .
Josephine Quintavalle , of Comment on Reproductive Ethics , said : " News that embryonic stem cells can be created successfully from human cells without cloning , without using human embryos or human eggs , or without getting involved in the creation of animal - human embryos , is most warmly welcomed .
" We congratulate these world - class scientists who have had the courage to state their change of tack so cogently .
" For once we have better science coinciding with better ethics . "
Man fights with his mind .
His hands and his weapons are simply extensions of his will , and one of the fallacies of our era is the notion that equipment is the equivalent of force .
Every once in a while I go down to my basement library and re-read a book by gun expert Jeff Cooper now deceased ) just to keep myself in a self - defense mindset .
This week I pulled from the shelf one of Cooper 's best works , To Ride , Shoot Straight , And Speak The Truth .
My favorite chapter in the book is one entitled , " The Combat Mind - Set " in which Cooper discusses a person 's mental reaction to aggression .
Cooper starts out the chapter stating : Cooper notes that of all of the graduates of his training program who have found themselves in mortal confrontations , " not one has said that his life was saved by his dexterity nor by his marksmanship , but rather by his ' mind - set .
'" Some useful bits of information that Cooper provides is that one must train himself into a state of mind in which the sudden awareness of peril does not surprise him .
" His response should be not " Oh my God , I 'm in a fight ! " but rather , " I thought this might happen and I know what to do about it .
" I often think how few people in our society would really know what to do if they were confronted with a mortal confrontation .
Sadly , our mindset is now more like The New Feminized Majority in which soft power and discussions are slowly taking the place of the Combat Mind - set .
Is this a good thing ?
I do n't know , maybe yes , maybe no , depending on the circumstances .
I can't help but feel that both are important ; yet each year , it seems that the values that Jeff Cooper talked about in his work are less and less relevant in our culture -- those values of honor , duty and bravery .
Those traits , I hope , will never go out of style -- for our very freedom and life may depend on them .
Update : Grim has more thoughts on the combat mind - set .

Science & Exploration Europe launches its first resupply ship to the ISS
09/03/2008 2223 views 2 likes
ESA PR 15-2008 .
Jules Verne , the first of ESA ’s Automated Transfer Vehicles ( ATVs ) , a new series of autonomous spaceships designed to resupply and reboost the International Space Station ( ISS ) , was successfully launched into low Earth orbit by an Ariane 5 vehicle this morning .
During the coming weeks , it will manoeuvre in order to rendezvous and eventually dock with the ISS to deliver cargo , propellant , water and oxygen to the orbital outpost .
Lift - off occurred at 05:03 CET ( 01:03 local ) from the Guiana Space Centre , Europe ’s spaceport in Kourou , French Guiana .
This flight required a new version of Europe ’s workhorse launcher , the Ariane 5ES , specially adapted to the task of lofting the nearly 20 - tonne vehicle – more than twice as heavy as the previous largest Ariane 5 payload – to a low circular orbit inclined at 51.6 degrees relative to the Equator and equipped with an upper stage with re-ignition capabilities .
The unusual launch trajectory required the deployment of two new telemetry tracking stations , one on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean and one on the Azores Islands .
The Ariane 5 upper stage performed an initial 8 - minute burn over the Atlantic and entered a 45 - minute coast phase , flying over Europe and Asia before reigniting for a 40 - second circularisation burn over Australia .
Separation of Jules Verne ATV occurred at 06:09 CET ( 02:09 local ) and was monitored by a ground station located in New Zealand .
The most complex European spacecraft ever ESA astronaut Jean - François Clervoy talks us through solar array deployment Jules Verne ATV is now circling the Earth in the same orbital plane as the ISS but at an altitude of only 260 km , compared to 345 km for the Station .
The vehicle is under constant monitoring by the dedicated ATV Control Centre in Toulouse , France .
Located within the premises of the French Space Agency CNES , the ATV Control Centre will ensure flight control throughout the mission in coordination with the ISS mission control centres in Moscow and Houston .
After having demonstrated safety manoeuvres in free flight , the ATV will perform orbital ‘ phasing ’ manoeuvres in order to rendezvous with the ISS for a first docking slot scheduled for 3 April after the departure of NASA ’s Space Shuttle Endeavour .
Named after the famous French 19th century visionary and author , the Jules Verne ATV is the largest and most sophisticated spacecraft ever developed in Europe , combining the functions of an autonomous free - flying platform , a manoeuvrable space vehicle and a space station module .
About 10 m high with a diameter of 4.5 m , it weighed 19,357 kg at launch .
It incorporates a 45 - m3 pressurised module , derived from the Columbus pressure shell , and a Russian - built docking system , similar to those used on Soyuz manned ferries and on the Progress re-supply ship .
About three times larger than its Russian counterpart , it can also deliver about three times more cargo .
The ATV is also the very first spacecraft in the world designed to conduct automated docking in full compliance with the very tight safety constraints imposed by human spaceflight operations .
It features high accuracy navigation systems and a flight software far more complex than that used on Ariane 5 .
Another ESA contribution to ISS co-ownership Jules Verne ATV was prepared for launch in Kourou , French Guiana Decided by ESA in 1995 in order to pay for its contribution to the operational costs of the ISS , the ATV has been under development since 1998 by an industrial team led by Astrium Space Transportation and comprising more than 30 contractors from 10 European countries .
On this first ATV mission , Jules Verne will deliver 4.6 tonnes of payload to the ISS , including 1 150 kg of dry cargo , 856 kg of propellant for the Russian Zvezda module , 270 kg of drinking water and 21 kg of oxygen .
On future ATV missions , the payload capacity will be increased to 7.4 tonnes .
About half of the payload onboard Jules Verne ATV is re-boost propellant , which will be used by its own propulsion system for periodic manoeuvres to increase the altitude of the ISS in order to compensate its natural decay caused by atmospheric drag .
Upon leaving , after four months spent docked to the ISS , Jules Verne ATV will carry away waste from the Station .
It will then be de-orbited over the Southern Pacific Ocean and burn up in the atmosphere in a fully controlled manner .
Only the beginning Jules Verne ATV will deliver 4.6 tonnes of payload to the ISS Beyond Jules Verne , ESA has already contracted industry to produce four more ATVs to be flown through to 2015 .
With both ESA ’s ATV and Russia ’s Progress , the ISS will be able to rely on two independent servicing systems to ensure its operations after the retirement of the US space shuttle in 2010 .
The Japanese HTV ( H - II Transfer Vehicle ) will also soon join the scene .
This will be vital to ensure the system 's overall robustness and reliability .
“ Last month , with the docking of Columbus , Europe got its own flat in the ISS building , with the launch of the first ATV , we now have our own delivery truck ” said Daniel Sacotte , ESA ’s Director for Human Spaceflight , Microgravity and Exploration .
“ We have become co-owners of the ISS , now we are about to become fully - fledged partners in running it .
With the ATV we will be servicing the ISS by delivering cargo and providing orbital reboost . ”
Jean - Jacques Dordain , ESA Director General
“ The launch of Jules Verne by Ariane 5 ES marks an important step on the way to ESA becoming an indispensable ISS partner with the ATV , the heaviest and most complex spacecraft ever built by ESA ” said Jean - Jacques Dordain , ESA ’s Director General .
“ This is the result of close cooperation between Member States , European industry , Arianespace , CNES , ESA staff and international partners .
But the next steps of Jules Verne ’s mission are as important when it comes to attaining the objective of automatic rendezvous and docking with the ISS , controlled from the ATV Control Centre in Toulouse .
In meeting that objective , we will have made great strides in consolidating the role of ESA in the future international exploration of the solar system . ”

Their names keep coming up over and over again in courtrooms and corridors of power across the country -- those groups whose interests always seem to run counter to those of technology companies and consumers .
They come in many forms : associations , think tanks , money - raising organizations , PACs , and even other tech - oriented industries like telecommunications .
The tech issues that they 're concerned with are what you might expect : digital rights management and fair use , patent law , broadband speed and reach , wireless spectrum and network neutrality .
I talked to a good number of tech and media policy insiders in Washington , D.C. -- mostly off the record -- to find out who these groups are , how they operate , and who pays their bills .
We 'll start with the biggest offenders first and work our way down .
1. The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA )
Issue : Copyright and Fair Use
The Internet economy should be a boon for digital media companies and for those of us that like to buy our music and video online .
It 's also a very powerful way to connect with people of like mind with a view toward learning about new things to watch and listen to .
Unfortunately , the content owners in the record and movie industries have mainly seen the Web as a platform for piracy , and have mainly failed to adapt their businesses to the realities of online , as one lonely industry executive recently admitted .
The record and film industries are represented in legal and policy matters by two major organizations -- the RIAA and the MPAA -- with some key individual companies like Warner Music Group and Disney acting on their own behalf in certain cases .
The RIAA and MPAA have exercised considerable political and economic influence to push a legal and policy environment in which the content owners keep tight control of the way their content is distributed and used .
" I think it 's fair to say that their approach is that any innovation that they have n't signed off on is bad , " says Fred von Lohmann , senior intellectual property attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Lots of Lawsuits
Companies distributing music or video in ways the studios or labels do n't approve of have quickly found themselves on the wrong end of a lawsuit .
There are many examples .
Perhaps most famously , the RIAA sued Napster in 1999 , charging the file sharing service with " contributory " copyright infringement .
After losing several major court decisions , Napster ( as we knew it ) folded in 2002 .
At around the same time the RIAA sued and shut down Michael Robertson 's ( MP3.com ) BeamIt service , which helped users to upload and store music from their CD collections in an online locker .
Earlier this year Warner Music Group filed an infringement lawsuit against the social networking site imeem , which allowed its members to post songs on their profile pages that could be streamed by other users .
San Francisco - based imeem was forced to settle out of court and now can stream only songs from labels with which it has contract agreements .
All other songs run for 20 seconds and then stop .
On the video side , some major copyright infringement lawsuits against YouTube ( sued by Viacom ) and MySpace ( sued by Universal ) are still in progress .
If these suits end badly , they could further restrict our access to online video and even endanger the video operations of YouTube and MySpace .
Video copyright lawsuits are also in progress against the DivX Stage 6 and Veoh online services .
A Chilling Effect
The suits are a real threat to the next generation of bi-directional , participatory Web services that are the promise of Web 2.0 .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's von Lohmann believes this year 's suits against imeem and others are just " the tip of the Web 2.0 litigation iceberg . "
Von Lohmann also thinks the suits may hurt legitimate companies while leaving the real content pirates untouched .
" I think it 's fair to say that copyright threats from entertainment industries are exerting a serious chilling effect on several companies that are trying to do the right thing , while having little impact on offshore companies that are more adventurous , " von Lohmann says .
" In other words , the innovation that should be fueling our economy is now fueling someone else 's . "
Leverage in Washington
The RIAA and MPAA have worked very hard in Washington to apply the aggressive posture they use in the courts to the policy - making arena .
Their attorneys and lobbyists are constantly meeting with members of Congress and presenting their side of issues of concern ( mainly copyright - related ) in front of regulatory bodies like the Federal Communications ( FCC ) .
And , most would agree , they 've been fairly effective at getting their way .
" Their combined muscle in lobbying and inter- corporate pressure is pretty substantial , " says von Lohmann says .
Both organizations have their own staffs of lobbyists in Washington , but both also contract with numerous outside lobbying firms .
In 2006 alone , the RIAA reported lobbying expenses of $ 1.5 million , while the MPAA reported $ 1.8 million .
The RIAA retained the services of 13 outside lobbying firms in 2006 to help make its case to lawmakers , while the MPAA used 17 outside lobbying firms .
The content owners also donate to candidates for federal office as a way of furthering their long - term agendas .
For example , Time Warner gave $ 17 million to various candidates for federal office between 1989 and 2005 , says the Center for Responsive Politics .
The Walt Disney Company donated almost $ 9.5 million during that period .
Whether or not the RIAA 's and MPAA 's tactics have really helped the entertainment industry is debatable .
Their legal and lobbying tactics have put real limitations on the way that we consumers are allowed to use the digital content we purchase , causing many of us to wonder if we truly own the digital content we buy .
The digital rights management ( DRM ) software that the content owners wrap around our music and video files often prevents us from playing media on all of our devices , copying it , or owning it forever .
This has stirred up a lot of resentment , even as file sharing continues to be rampant around the globe .
Democrats set pro forma sessions to avoid ' special session ' on FISA
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s ( D - Nev. ) mistrust of President Bush is really well known and runs deep .
Fearing a recess appointment by Bush during the Christmas - New Year ’s break , the Nevada Democrat refused to adjourn the chamber during the whole period , scheduling very , very brief pro forma sessions every couple of days to avoid any such appointments .
Now , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) has joined with her Senate colleague , scheduling two pro forma sessions for the House this week so that Bush cannot call Congress back into special session to take up the now - expired Protect America Act , an enhanced surveillance bill that lapsed over the weekend , or the Senate - passed amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Bush and the Republican congressional leaders have been pounding the Democrats , claiming they have endangered the country by allowing the law to lapse .
Democrats counter that Republicans , joined by some conservative Democrats , blocked a three - week extension of the act , so they are at fault .
The House and Senate also disagree on the hugely controversial issue of retroactive legal immunity for telecommunications companies involved in the Bush administration ’s warrantless surveillance program .
The Senate has approved retroactive immunity , while the House has not .
Talks are continuing this week , even as Congress is out .
Pelosi , fearing that Bush would try to capitalize on the House ’s absence to call Congress back into a special session , scheduled two pro forma sessions on Tuesday and Thursday .
The Senate will do the same at the same time .
Since neither chamber goes out for more than three days , Bush cannot take the dramatic step of calling the Congress back for the first special session since Harry Truman did it in 1948 .
And for all you progressives out there , the non-Republican senator you most love to hate – Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) – will be presiding over one of the pro forma sessions this week .
So , you better keep an eye on him
As technology was introduced , people are searching for an ever better technology , which would make their lives better .
That is what you call innovation and it is not a bad thing .
More than ever , people are getting advance because inventors are making gadgets to make our lives easier .
In time went by , we were introduce to mobile phones , which makes talking even a lot easier and enjoyable .
Some people know that this would be common and they have created mobile phones .
As time went by , they manage to build their own company and these are the companies that are pioneers of the mobile phone industries .
The App
One of them is Samsung and has been one of the most popular choices among people from almost all parts of the world .
WhatsApp is an Android app , which is free to download .
With the help of the App , business are able to communicate with their clients .
It secures the messages you shared with the other guy on the phone so that you would be safe from whomever want to do you harm on your phone .
Popularity Going Down
Recently , the popularity of WhatsApp for Samsung has gone down based on Google Trends .
It might not be dropping very fast , but nevertheless , this shows that the popularity of Samsung has gone down significantly .
This proves that nothing is forever popular in the mobile industry .
However , it seems that these users came from owners of older Samsun devices in which , Android are n’t supported .
Another possibility is that these users are on Tizen .
Why is this happening
Samsung has been popular for some decades as it is among the first in the industry of mobile phones .
However , as time passes by , more and more company like Nokia , Verison Wireless , and many more want to cash in the craze .
These companies want to make more money , which means that they would need to have something that the other companies ca n’t offer on their mobile devices .
This has been the trend as time passes by and those that ca n’t compete will be left out in the dark .
Sadly Samsung is one of the many casualties in the phones ’ war .
Mukasey : No Prosecution for Waterboarders
The attorney general says the interrogators were acting on DOJ 's legal guidance .
Feb. 7 , 2008  -- Attorney General Michael Mukasey told a congressional panel Thursday that CIA interrogators who waterboarded detainees would not be subject to prosecution because they were acting on legal guidance from the Justice Department .
Asked by House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , whether he would start a criminal investigation into the agency 's use of the controversial interrogation technique , which simulates drowning , Mukasey answered , " No , I am not , for this reason :
Whatever was done as part of a CIA program at the time that it was done was the subject of a Department of Justice opinion through the Office of Legal Counsel and was found to be permissible under the law as it existed then . "
Lawmakers broached the subject with Mukasey just days after CIA Director Gen. Michael Hayden admitted to Congress that the CIA had used the technique in the past .
" The CIA has not used waterboarding for almost five years .
We used it against these three high - value detainees because of the circumstances of the time , " Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday .
" Very critical to those circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were imminent , " Hayden said .
Hayden explained his rationale for that revelation , telling the House Intelligence Committee Thursday that it was a " very difficult decision " to divulge the information , but that the " the question of waterboarding had become so much of the public discourse about the activities of the American intelligence community and that the public debate -- and we exist in a political context and are not immune to this broader political discussion -- is quite appropriate . "
Hayden added that it was the agency 's " strong belief that the political discussion that was going on was misshaped and misformed . "
Hayden reiterated his stance that waterboarding was conducted under legal circumstances , but he did note that the technique is no longer included in the CIA 's current program and that agency lawyers are not certain of its lawfulness .
Mukasey had also confirmed to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that the CIA no longer used waterboarding in its interrogations .
Referencing Hayden 's admission that his agency had used the technique in the past , Mukasey said , " For me to use the occasion of the disclosure that that technique was once part of the CIA program -- an authorized part of the CIA program , would be for me to tell anybody who relied , justifiably , on a Justice Department opinion that not only may they no longer rely on that Justice Department opinion , but that they will now be subject to criminal investigation for having done so , " Mukasey said Thursday .
" That would put in question not only that opinion but also any other opinion from the Justice Department , " Mukasey continued , adding that continuity in the department is key so criminal investigations do n't crop up when " the tenure of the person who wrote the position changes or , indeed , the political winds change . "
Rep. Bill Delahunt , D - Mass. , tried to engage Mukasey , questioning how the interrogators could not be subject to investigation since they might have violated torture statutes and conventions .
" I find that position a new legal doctrine , if you will .
The law is the law , " Delahunt said .
Mukasey also dismissed additional calls for the appointment of special counsel to the inquiry into the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes .
In December , Hayden disclosed that the tapes , which were recorded in 2002 , were destroyed three years later in 2005 , a move that has been criticized by lawmakers who 've said they were n't allowed proper oversight on the issue .
" I can't get into confidential discussions and executive matters .
I can say that we looked initially to the U.S. attorney 's office in the district where the CIA is located , " Mukasey said , referring to the Eastern District of Virginia .
" That U.S. attorney 's office , by mutual agreement , recused itself , and we appointed John Durham to be the acting United States attorney for the purpose of … this case and to investigate this case . "
Durham is the first assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Connecticut .
" The fact that one office recused itself does not in any way disqualify the department from conducting the investigation and to say that because this is a case that has gotten a great deal of attention necessarily means that we have to go outside the department and appoint a special prosecutor and so forth sends the wrong message in two respects , " Mukasey continued .

Nokia´s " Remade " recycled phone ( left ) and N96 " multi- media computer " phone ( right ) .
Among its many new devices at this week 's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , the Finnish company Nokia is demonstrating two cell phones that are intriguing in very different ways .
The " Remade " is built almost entirely from recycled materials , while the N96 is Nokia 's high - end " multimedia computer " phone .
The attraction of the Remade lies in its future potential .
Although the phone is n't functional , Nokia hopes that similar concepts could be implemented in future devices .
The clamshell phone 's casing is made entirely from recycled aluminum cans , and its chassis is made from the plastic of recycled drink bottles .
The rubber keys come from old car tires .
The screen and circuit board also minimize environmental impact by using manufacturing techniques such as printed electronics .
The display graphics are also specially selected to save energy .
While the " Remade " concept itself is n't planned for production , all the components are plausible and could be applied to a real phone .
Nokia hopes that the knowledge gathered while designing and building the phone will play a role in future Nokia handsets .
On the other hand , the N96 is the hot phone of today .
The successor to the N95 , the N96 contains 16GB of on - board memory , which is enough to hold about 40 hours of video or 12,000 songs .
If that ´s not enough space , the phone also has a slot for an 8 GB microSD memory card .
The device also has GPS , a 5 - megapixel camera , a DVB - H television tuner for watching live TV , and even a little kick - stand so the phone can be propped up when viewing the 2.8 - inch display .
The N96 will be available in September for around US$ 800 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States urged the Serbian government to help protect the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade , a State Department spokesman said on Thursday after protesters in Serbia ’s capital attacked the embassy to protest Kosovo ’s independence .
“ We are in contact with the Serbian government to ensure that they devote the appropriate assets to fulfill their international obligations to help protect diplomatic facilities , in this case our embassy , ” State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters .
“ They ( Serbia ) have been up until this point very good in providing police assets to ensure that the embassy facility was protected .
We want to strongly urge them and we are in contact with them to make sure that they devote the assets to deal with this situation , ” McCormack told reporters .
In Belgrade , smoke billowed from the American Embassy after scores of protesters broke into the building cheered on by crowds outside .
Some 200 riot police arrived about half an hour later , beating and arresting some of the rioters and driving the rest away .
McCormack said the State Department had an open line to the embassy , but said he had few details of what was happening .
“ Last reports I had were that they were in the consular building , ” he said of the protesters .
He said he believed the attack came after business hours , when the ambassador and staff were not there .
His understanding was that the only people in the embassy at the time of the attack were security people and Marine guards .
Responding to a question , McCormack said he had no indication that Serbian police had been reluctant to protect the embassy .
“ You know , I have no indication that that is , in fact , the case .
...
Once this incident has been resolved , I ’m sure we ’ll have a chance to go back and look at the forensics and see exactly what happened .
But what ’s important now is that the government act , get the forces there necessary to deal with the situation , ” he said .
With primaries on Tuesday in Maryland , Virginia , and the District of Columbia , Clinton advisers were pessimistic about her chances , though some held out hope for a surprise performance in Virginia .
And as polls show Mr. Obama gaining strength in Wisconsin and his native state , Hawaii , which vote next Tuesday , advisers , donors and superdelegates said they were resigned to a possible Obama sweep of the rest of February ’s contests .
Some donors also expressed concern about a widening money imbalance between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton : Obama fund - raisers say he is taking in roughly $ 1 million a day , while Clinton fund - raisers say she is taking in about half of that , mostly online .
Mrs. Clinton ’s aides say that the campaign was virtually broke as of the Feb.
5 primaries , but that finances have stabilized .
Mr. Obama ’s financial edge allowed him to begin running television advertisements in Ohio and Texas on Monday , while the Clinton campaign plans to begin advertising on Tuesday .
Clinton advisers say that she will have advertisements running statewide in both Ohio and Texas , and that she will have advertisements in English and Spanish in Texas .
“ I think that clearly things have not been going as great as they were with her victories on Super Tuesday , and we ca n’t wait to get to March 4 , ” said Alan Patricof , one of Mrs. Clinton ’s national finance chairmen .
Mrs. Clinton will have “ a major ad buy ” through the next week in Wisconsin , a senior adviser said Monday , and spend a few days campaigning there .
But this adviser and others said the bulk of her time would be devoted to campaigning in Ohio , Texas and a bit in Rhode Island .
In a sign of Texas ’s importance , she plans to fly there Tuesday , even though Wisconsin votes next week .
While Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers and allies emphasize that she has the time and the financial resources to regroup , they say she will have to take more significant steps to shore up her candidacy beyond the staff shakeup she engineered on Sunday , when she replaced her campaign manager and longtime aide , Patti Solis Doyle , with another veteran adviser , Maggie Williams .

Be Green , Go To Kokua The ‘ BCO Morning Show wants to know how you are working to save the planet , and if you ’re picked we ’ll send you to see Jack Johnson at Red Rocks and you could be going to see him play at the Kokua Festival in Hawaii !
Send us a description of what you ’re doing to be green … have you taken recycling to the next level ?
Do you make your own biodiesel ?
Does your roof have more solar panels than a space station ?
Let us know !
If Bret interviews you on the air about how you ’ve changed your life to better the environment , we ’ll be sending you to Red Rocks to see Jack Johnson .
Then , this Friday we will be selecting one green ‘ BCO Listener and sending them to Hawaii to see Jack Johnson at the Kokua Festival !
( Site )
Um , excuse me ?
You ca n’t really be sending the winner of a green contest to Hawaii , can you ?
I ’ll be the first to admit that there ’s a lot more to being green than a low - carbon emission lifestyle .
Recycling is n’t all about saving energy out of smelting iron , it ’s also about water quality and landfills and mining .
Biodiesel can be about more than turning food into fuel – it can also be about turning food wastes that would otherwise be dumped in sewage treatment facilities or landfills into fuel .
And solar panels , while fundamentally about energy , are also about reducing mountain - top mining and helping asthmatic people breath clean air .
But aircraft are huge polluters , with transoceanic flights ( arguably ) being the worst offenders of the lot .
Planes emit nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds that turn into asthma- causing ground - level ozone .
Some of nitrogen oxides , especially nitrous oxide , are powerful greenhouse gases in their own right , and the total carbon emissions of aircraft are estimated to be about 5 % of the global total .
To put the carbon emission problem into perspective , flying to Honolulu , Hawaii from Denver , Colorado will produce 5,238 lbs of carbon dioxide for two people , round trip ( using TerraPass ’ flight estimation calculator ) .
For comparison , that ’s roughly a month and a half of heating for my home , or over six months of driving my non-hybrid , manual transmission Honda Civic .
And this is just the flight – how much does Jack Johnson ’s concert in Hawaii cost in terms of energy , carbon emissions , non-recycled paper and plastic cups , etc . ?
All of this means that , depending on how “ green ” the contest winner actually is , the best thing he or she could to in order to be green is turn down the trip to Hawaii .

This story was updated on Tuesday 1st April 2008 to correct inaccuracies about DaisyDukes .
It works on memory dumps or live memory .
At the moment , it is not memory dumper .
Building off recent research that showed how to extract encryption keys from a computer 's memory , a penetration testing company has unveiled a prototype of a tool that sniffs out passwords , documents , and other sensitive data in a matter of minutes .
DaisyDukes is a series of scripts that operate on memory dumps that have already been taken or on live memory and can work alongside a USB - based memory dumper .
A researcher can plug it into an unattended machine that is turned on but has been locked and reboot the machine off a compact operating system contained on the drive .
Depending on the user 's needs , the device can capture the entire contents of a computer 's memory , or use DaisyDukes to sniff out and store only certain types of data - say a password to access the company network or a user 's private encryption key .
It turns out both Windows and Linux retain " boatloads and boatloads " of passwords in memory , said Sherri Davidoff , a security analyst with IntelGuardians , the penetration - testing firm that developed the prototype tool .
It 's already been able to isolate passwords for Thunderbird , AOL Instant Messenger , GPG , SSH , Outlook , Putty and TrueCrypt , among others , and with additional research they believe they can find many more .
" The idea here is let 's see if we can hit an office building , get in and out in 25 minutes or less and walk out with some interesting passwords , " said Tom Liston , an IntelGuardians security consultant who along with Davidoff co-presented the tool at the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver .
DaisyDukes builds off research released last month showing that keys used to encrypt data on hard drives could be extracted by booting the target computer over a network or USB drive and then reading the computer 's random access memory ( RAM ) .
The researchers , from the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Princeton University and Wind River , discovered that the data can remain in memory sticks for minutes after a machine has been turned off .
The IntelGuardians researchers took things from there and discovered that encryption keys used in Windows Vista 's BitLocker , Mac OS X's FileVault , and other disk encryption systems were n't the only potentially sensitive information that could be extracted .
They found that passwords for certain applications are each surrounded by a distinct pattern or signature .
They then designed DaisyDukes , which can search for known signatures and extract the password in a quick and stealthy fashion .
That makes it perfect for penetration testers , who get paid to test a company 's security by actively trying to breach its physical and network defenses .
They have identified the password signatures for a dozen or so applications , and they 're calling on other security pros to contribute to the project by adding their own list of signatures .
Those contributions will appear in updates to the DaisyDukes tool .
In addition , they plan to add features that allow DaisyDukes to pinpoint Word documents , chat logs , and other sensitive files .
For now , DaisyDukes remains very much a beta program , so it 's not yet suitable for production .
Eventually , its creators expect it to become a full - blown memory sniffer that can either dump memory and analyze the dumps , or simply boot off a USB thumb drive and search memory without dumping the entire contents .
But it already shows great promise .
For one , the creators plan to make it highly compact , so the boot sequence wo n't overwrite old data stored in the computer 's RAM .
For another , it will be highly flexible , making it possible to sniff the password for a single application or grab the entire contents in memory .
And that could prove a game - changing development for penetration testers , who regularly walk into a customer 's premises and look for opportunities to walk out with a laptop or server .
Customers have grown accustomed to being unconcerned about such breaches when the purloined machines have disk encryption or are locked .
" Obviously , the paper on cold boot research has totally changed that landscape , " Davidoff said . ®
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian president - elect Dmitry Medvedev maintained pressure on NATO on Tuesday not to grant membership to Ukraine and Georgia , saying a week before an alliance summit that it would undermine European security .
Russia 's president - elect Dmitry Medvedev speaks during an interview with the Financial Times in the Kremlin in Moscow March 25 , 2008 .

NATO leaders meeting in Bucharest from April 2 - 4 are expected to consider requests by the two former Soviet republics ’ pro-Western leaders to put their countries on the path to membership .
“ We are not happy about the situation around Georgia and Ukraine , ” Medvedev told the Financial Times in an interview .
“ We consider that it is extremely troublesome for the existing structure of European security .
...
No state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . ”
Ukraine and Georgia are lobbying NATO to grant them a Membership Action Plan ( MAP ) , which is seen as the first step towards joining the alliance .
Washington has said it backs their bid , but some NATO members in Europe are cool on the idea .
Russian President Vladimir Putin , who opposes their accession bids , has accepted an invitation to go to the summit , which President George W. Bush will attend .
If he goes , Putin will be the first Russian president to attend a NATO summit for six years .
But Russian political analysts say he may cancel the trip if it appears NATO members will use the summit to award MAP status to Georgia or Ukraine .
In Brussels , a spokesman for NATO said the alliance was aware of Russia ’s concerns about expansion .
“ We are open as an alliance to discussing them in an open manner , ” said spokesman James Appathurai .
“ NATO ’s position is quite clear : democratic states in Europe have the right to aspire to , and work towards , NATO membership .
It is their choice , not NATO ’s , ” he said .
“ NATO ’s door is open to them and these two democracies have indicated their desire to move closer to NATO . ”
Bush is due to visit Ukraine before the summit and met Georgia ’s president for talks in Washington last week .
He said after those talks that he backed closer ties between Georgia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation .
QUESTION OF DEMOCRACY
Speaking in his first interview since he won a March 2 presidential election , Medvedev questioned why Ukraine was seeking NATO membership when a large part of the population , mostly in the Russian - speaking east , opposed the idea .
“ It is a thing that is hard to explain when the overwhelming majority of citizens of one of the states , like Ukraine for example , is categorically against joining NATO but the government of that state conducts a different policy , ” he said .
“ It is precisely this that is a question of real democracy .
At the minimum , in situations like this it is the done thing to hold a referendum , ” said Medvedev , who will be sworn in to take over from Putin , his mentor , on May 7 .
Russia was powerless during the 1990s to prevent NATO expanding to include a number of eastern European states which during Soviet rule had been in Moscow ’s sphere of influence .
Now , its confidence restored by an economic boom and Putin ’s assertive foreign policy , it is determined to prevent the alliance moving even closer to its borders by taking in Ukraine and Georgia .
Russian officials say their entry to NATO could lead to the United States stationing elements of its nuclear arsenal on Ukrainian or Georgian soil , threatening Russia ’s security and upsetting the delicate strategic balance .
44 % of Non-Partisan Cross - Over Ballots Went Uncounted in March ' 04 , 42 % Uncounted in June ' 06 , Before Same Ballot Design Used Again for the February 2008 Super Tuesday Primary
As LA Times Gets Religion on Election Integrity Issues , But Does n't Bother Apologizing For Their Failures to do so up to Now ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/16/2008 , 5:00 pm PT
Given the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters , and maybe even hundreds of thousands of voters , from Super Tuesday 's Los Angeles County Democratic Primary election , which the county 's current acting Registrar incorrectly claims to be " impossible " to count accurately , we believe it 's time to place some blame squarely where it belongs for the entire mess .
A Los Angeles Times editorial this week , where , it seems , the paper may have finally found religion on the issue of Election Integrity , serves up a great starting point ...
And to think we made fun of Florida .
As of today , we take back the jeers about hanging chads and the unkind comments about inept voters befuddled by butterfly ballots .
Somehow it does n't seem as funny when it happens at home --- voting irregularities in Los Angeles County will disqualify the ballots of thousands of people who went to the polls on Super Tuesday .
In 2000 , Florida voters flubbed their choices for president because they were confronted with a ballot whose design was new to them .
But that 's not the case here .
L.A. County officials have long used a ballot whose design was known to consistently disenfranchise unaffiliated voters .
They simply did nothing about it .
...
Election officials are calling this a glitch , but the outcome was entirely foreseeable .
In fact , it has happened before .
In the March 2004 election , 44 % of crossover ballots were unusable , and in June 2006 , it was 42 % .
With numbers this high , the county registrar should have investigated this matter long before now .
So it happened before .
44 % of Non-Partisan cross-over ballots went uncounted in March ' 04 and 42 % in June ' 06 .
And yet , the county went into '08 's primary with no plans to change a thing .
The woman who dreamt up the ridiculous scheme , former Los Angeles County Registrar and Diebold cover girl Conny McCormack , quit just over a month before the election , and knew about the problem from years past , but did nothing about it .
Or , she did n't know about , and was thus criminally negligent in her job as chief voting official for the nation 's most populous county ...
We 'll have more on the latest Los Angeles County " Double Bubble " mess over the weekend , but for the moment , speaking of " criminally negligent " , we 're glad to see that the LA Times has finally begun to come to terms with these sorts of issues --- at least if their editorial is any indication --- as sad as it is that they had to wait until it " happen[ed ] at home . "
As they write , " Election officials are calling this a glitch , but the outcome was entirely foreseeable . "
Indeed it was forseeable .
Yet , the Times , arguably the state 's paper of record , has done next to nothing to cover these issues for years , as The BRAD BLOG has pointed out over many of them .
( Yes , we live in LA County , and the Times is our local hometown paper . )
Even after last week 's Super Tuesday --- and even as it appeared that hundreds of thousands might be disenfranchised by McCormack 's idiotic Non-Partisan cross -over voting scheme --- the Times played down the problems in an article headlined " Few election glitches , except for independents . "
The sub - header of their editorial this week is : " Super Tuesday presented a unique choice .
Too bad that a flawed ballot disenfranchised thousands in L.A . "
To which we'd add : " Too bad the LA Times did n't give a damn about such issues until now . "
We 've come to expect irresponsible public officials like McCormack , and her inept compatriot in Sacramento , the thankfully - former Sec. of State Bruce McPherson , to get away with whatever they can .
On the other hand , we also expect our fourth - estate , the mainstream media , to keep them honest and hold their feet to the fire on such issues .
Instead , the LA Times has served as little more than a mouth - piece and surrogate for those public officials over the years , even going so far as to endorse the irresponsible McPherson when he was challenged by the thankfully - new Sec. of State Debra Bowen back in 2006 .
That election came long after the problems with California 's voting systems were quite well known , and even long after McPherson had re-certified the Diebold voting system despite it 's failure to comply with federal voting systems guidelines , and thus , it 's failure to comply with California state law .
Again , we 'll have more details on the latest " Double Bubble " trouble soon .
But the above should be noted along the way in hopes that someone holds somebody accountable for this mess that McCormack 's current replacement , acting Registrar Dean Logan , seems hell - bent on making even worse that it needs to be by telling LA County 's Board of Supervisors that it would be " impossible " to determine the intent of the voters on all of those uncounted ballots .
Logan is out - and - out wrong .
As The BRAD BLOG pointed out late this week , it would not be impossible to determine the accurate voter intent of nearly every single one of those currently uncounted ballots .
Of course , that would take Logan actually bothering to count those ballots , which sort of seems like his job .

In science , being a " theory " is not a step below a " law . "
The " Theory of Relativity " by Albert Einstein is not waiting for its day in court when it graduates to " fact . "
Evolution is the central organizing principle of modern biology .
Just ask the National Academy of Sciences — the group that the United States Congress empowers to uphold science in America .
They issued a report last week titled Science , Evolution and Creationism ( Wired Science covered it here ) .
Their conclusion ?
" Nonscientific approaches do not belong in science classrooms . "
Huckabee took Republican center stage after the Iowa caucuses , but his clever sidesteps of scientific questions are a warning sign .
" Do you believe in evolution ? "
The short answer ?
No , he does n’t .
People are charmed by him , asking why anyone should care since " [ I ’m ] not planning on writing the curriculum for an eighth - grade science book , " and " if anybody wants to believe they ’re the descendants of a primate , they ’re welcome to do it . "
But the real problem is , he will be signing scientific research budgets into law , appointing judges that will be deciding evolution vs. creationism education cases at the state level , and setting a moral precedent that it is O.K. to dis science .
YouTube has a video of Bill Maher asking Huckabee about the evolution debate question .
It goes a little further than the debate and shows how the mainstream - sounding " I just ca n’t believe creation is an accident " line reveals more disturbing underpinnings under scrutiny .
Huckabee ’s main defense is " Why should it matter ?
It ’s not a question appropriate to a presidential debate " to which Maher says ( 1:38 into the clip ) :
" If someone believes that the earth is 6,000 years old and every scientist in the world is saying that it is billions of years old , why should n’t I take that into account when I am assessing the rationality of someone I am going to put into the highest office in the land ? "
Good point Bill .
Huckabee , we are actually not asking you if there is a creator behind the cosmos .
We are clear that you think there is .
We are asking if you would weigh rational scientific evidence that has been peer reviewed and is reproducible in your most critical decisions about medical research , terrorist weapons threats , the environment , and education .
My concern is that your answer to Bill Maher , " We just do n’t know [ the age of the earth ] " is an indication that you do n’t include science on your reference shelf .
If you did , you would know that we do know the age of the earth .
It ’s 4.5 billion years old .
Given Huckabee ’s lead position coming out of the Iowa Caucus , it is an important time to take a closer look .

The casino experience Matt 43 comments Latest by Andrey Kovalenko
From a design / experience perspective , casinos are fascinating places :
1 ) There are no windows .
Gamblers have no idea whether it ’s light or dark or sunny or rainy outside .
2 ) There are no clocks .
Dealers are forbidden from wearing watches .
Time becomes meaningless .
3 ) There ’s intentionally poor navigation .
They are built like mazes meaning it ’s usually tough to find a way out .
4 ) There ’s a constant barrage of noises .
Slot machines spin , games ding and dong , coins hit metal , there ’s the pitter patter of the people running the games , etc .
Many of these sounds , like the ringing of the slots , is there to give you a false sense of hope ( “ If all of those bells are ringing , somebody must be winning ! ” ) .
5 ) Loose slot machines — ones that pay out more often — are placed near highly trafficked areas ( e.g. the aisles , change booth , restaurants , etc. ) so more people witness winners .
6 ) There ’s constant research on all aspects of the sensory experience : scents , colors , interior design , and the angles of lights ( e.g. light that hits people ’s foreheads is a no - no because it apparently drains gamblers of energy ) .
7 ) The attire ( or lack thereof ) of everyone who works there contributes to the atmosphere ( e.g. dealers in uniforms , pit bosses in suits , servers in skimpy outfits , etc . )
8 ) Free booze is delivered to gamblers without them having to get up .
9 ) It ’s not a passive experience .
Gamblers are made to feel like they influence the process .
And when a gambler feels they can affect the outcome — by throwing the die , choosing a roulette number , or deciding when to split at blackjack — a feeling of control develops that keeps them gambling longer .
10 ) There ’s a constant rhythm .
Everything happens at regular intervals .
Dice are rolled .
Cards are dealt .
Wheels are spun .
Bets are placed .
And then it happens again .
( Interesting note : Casinos have slowly phased out deck shuffling by installing automatic shufflers .
Gamblers used to get a break while dealers reshuffled .
Now it ’s a constant flow of cards which increases the number of hands per hour — and that means more money for the house . )
11 ) There are players cards which get frequent gamblers free nights , food , and room upgrades .
12 ) There ’s a palpable energy in the room .
Money ’s on the line .
It ’s a big night out .
People are paying attention .
Everyone ’s engaged .
13 ) Some say casinos are pumped full of oxygen so gamblers feel more awake and energetic .
( Others say this is just a myth that , if true , would result in a tremendous fire hazard . )
14 ) The funnel pours one way .
There are thousands of places to hand over money to the casino .
Every craps table , blackjack table , roulette wheel , and slot machine will take your cash .
Yet there ’s only one place to get paid out in bills : the cashier window .
And to get there , you ’ve got to pass all those other places that want to take your money .
The result : a completely immersive and compelling customer experience .
It ’s no wonder some people do n’t know when to stop .
Bilal Hussein was part of an AP team which won the Pulitzer prize
The Pentagon says additional evidence has come to light proving Bilal Hussein is a " terrorist media operative " who infiltrated the news agency .
The case will be passed to Iraqi judges who will decide if he should be tried .
AP says its own investigation has found no evidence that he was anything but an Iraqi journalist working in a war zone .
The agency 's lawyers say they have been denied access to Mr Hussein and the evidence against him , making it impossible to build a defence .
There 's a new leadership in the defence department , but the same callous disregard from justice
Tom Curley
AP President
AP 's president and chief executive officer Tom Curley told the BBC he believed the US military simply wished to keep Mr Hussein in jail as long as possible .
He said the US did not want news coming out of Anbar province , which he called an " information black hole " .
" There 's a new leadership in the defence department , but the same callous disregard from justice , " Mr Curley told the BBC .
Mr Hussein was part of an AP photo team that won a Pulitzer prize in 2005 .
US officials say he had previously aroused suspicion because he was often at the scene of insurgent attacks as they occurred .
' Not convincing '
AP says Mr Hussein , who is now 36 , was taken into custody in April 2006 after sheltering strangers in his home following an explosion near his home in Falluja .
US marines later arrived and used his flat as an observation post , where they detained him and his guests as suspected insurgents and confiscated his laptop computer and telephone .
Whenever we ask to see what 's so convincing we get back something that is n't convincing at all
Dave Tomlin
AP lawyer
US - led forces in Iraq possess " convincing and irrefutable evidence that Bilal Hussein is a threat to security and stability as a link to insurgent activity " , Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said on Monday .
The US military had previously said Mr Hussein was detained for possessing materials for making roadside bombs , insurgent propaganda and a surveillance photo of a US military installation .
He did not disclose what the new evidence is .
Mr Hussein could face the death penalty if convicted of aiding insurgents .
AP says in the past 19 months various allegations have been floated unofficially against Mr Hussein by the US military , but then withdrawn with little explanation .
The US military said some of Hussein 's work aroused suspicion
" Whenever we ask to see what 's so convincing we get back something that is n't convincing at all , " said AP 's lawyer Dave Tomlin .
In particular , it says there is no evidence that any of Mr Hussein 's images were co-ordinated with insurgents or showed the moment of an attack .
Mr Curley says Mr Hussein was not interrogated after his first month of detention until a few weeks ago - so he says it is hard to work out what new information may have emerged on the basis of which charges could be laid .
He says the American military is working under time constraints as the law obliges it to release Mr Hussein by December 12 unless legal proceedings begin .
Calls for his release have been backed by press freedom groups such as the Committee to Protect Journalists .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
" Oh , the humanity . "
When these three words were uttered by aghast radio journalist Herbert Morrison -- as the LZ129 Hindenburg airship crashed and burst into flames in New Jersey in 1937 -- it was seen as the end of airships .
The other remaining Zeppelin - class dirigible , the Graf Zeppelin II , was destroyed by the Nazi administration who felt the materials could be put to better use with more conventional aircraft .
The Aeroscraft ML866 is a prototype for future cargo vehicles that could have a payload of up to 60 tonnes more photos »
But , 70 years on , could the Hindenburg - style airship be experiencing a renaissance ?
There are two types of craft that are commonly called " airships . "
The first is basically a balloon filled with a lighter - than - air gas , with an attached pod for the pilot and passengers , and tilting propellers to aid with descent and maneuvering .
These are known as ' blimps ' and are commonly used for promotional activities , for filming sporting events and by law enforcement agencies for surveillance .
But their limited payload make them unsuitable for other purposes .
The other type of airship is the dirigible .
Like a blimp , a dirigible airship is filled with lighter - than - air gas but it has an internal skeleton .
This greater rigidity allows dirigible airships to carry larger payloads than blimps .
See pictures of airships through the ages . »
While the Hindenburg crash dented public confidence in the dirigible airship concept , the principal cause of the disaster was n't bad design but propaganda .
The Germans were desperate to show off their technical achievement .
But the United States , the world 's primary supplier of the inert gas helium ( which was used to inflate and lift the airships ) , had imposed a military embargo on the gas .
So the Hindenburg was filled with the massively explosive gas , hydrogen .
And it exploded .
Massively .
In recent years the concept of the dirigible airship has been reevaluated because of the environmental need to find lower - carbon methods of freight transportation ; and the military and humanitarian need to deliver supplies to remote locations not served by airports .
One failed attempt to resuscitate the airship content came from the German company Cargolifter AG in the mid 1990s .
It planned a large airship , the CL160 , to be used as a transporter for large and heavy loads .
A giant hangar , one of the world 's largest structures , was built in Brand , near Berlin in Germany , for storage and manufacture of these giant craft .
But Cargolifter became insolvent in 2002 .
The hangar was sold for a fraction of its construction cost and now houses an indoor water park .
In 2005 the Aeros corporation of Montebello , CA . resurrected the airship concept .
Responding to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) 's " Walrus " program the company was given a $ 3.2 million grant to develop : " a very large airlift vehicle concept designed to control lift in all stages of air or ground operations including the ability to off - load payload without taking on - board ballast other than surrounding air . "
What distinguishes a " Walrus " craft from a Hindenberg - style airship is that it would not be lighter than air .
Rather it would generate lift from a combination of aerodynamics , propellors and gas buoyancy .
This would allow for a quicker descent without the expulsion of lift gas , for instance .
DARPA terminated the Walrus program but Aeros is continuing to develop the technology with a view to creating an enormous civil airship utilizing a glass - fiber and carbon - fibre semi-monocoque envelope structure .
The planned Aeroscraft ML866 could be the next generation of corporate transportation .
With more than 465 square meters ( 5000 square feet ) of interior floor space , the ML866 's interior could house a floating boardroom or an opulent flying home .
Because it would be flying at a lower altitude than a passenger jet ( 6,000 to 12,000 feet , as opposed to 25,000 to 35,000 feet ) the cabin would not be pressurized .
The technological legacy of the Walrus program is the COSH ( control of structural heaviness ) system .
By compressing and decompressing stored helium , the aircraft can become lighter for take - off and heavier for landing .
If Aeros secure funding to develop the ML866 , it would be offered with a choice of turboprop engines ( for either greater speed or heavier payload ) .
But could large airships supplement the role of large passenger aircraft ?
Flight International 's technical reporter Rob Coppinger is skeptical :
" Whether it is cargo , corporate or mass transpiration I think the issues with airships are ; can [ airships ] carry enough people / cargo between two popular destinations and do it fast enough to carry a sufficient volume of cargo / people to generate enough revenue to pay for the development , certification and running costs ?
" I think if it were easy to financially justify , they would exist already . "
Coppinger concedes , however , that airships could have potential military applications .
Aeros plans to begin testing a non-rigid airship , the Aeros 40D , in 2008 to demonstrate the helium compression and decompression system .
Production of a prototype Aeroscraft ML866 has begun , with a test flight planned for 2010 .

Despite the incredible diversity of Saturn 's icy moons , theirs is a story of great interaction .
Some of them are pock - marked , some seemingly dirty , others pristine , one spongy , one two - faced , some still spewing with activity and some seeming to be captured from the far reaches of the solar system .
Yet many of them have a common thread -- black " stuff " coating their surfaces .
" We are beginning to unravel the mysteries of these different and strange moons , " said Rosaly Lopes , Cassini scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
She coordinated a special section of 14 papers about Saturn 's icy moons that appears in the February issue of the journal Icarus .
Taken together , the papers bring an idea that Cassini scientist Bonnie Buratti calls " the ecology of the Saturn system " to the forefront .
" Ecology is about your entire environment - not just one body , but how they all interact , " said Buratti .
" The Saturn system is really interesting , and if you look at the surfaces of the moons , they seem to be altered in ways that are n't intrinsic to them .
There seems to be some transport in this system . "
Though the details of that transport are not yet clear , mounting evidence suggests that some mechanism has spread the mysterious dark material found on several of the moons from one to another ; the material may even have a common cometary origin .
Along those lines , several of the new papers focus on similarities between the dark material found on different moons - on Hyperion and Iapetus , for example , or between Phoebe and Iapetus .
Roger Clark of the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver goes further , saying , " We see the same spectral signature on all the moons that have coatings of dark material . "
Clark is lead author of one of the new papers , which focuses on Saturn 's moon Dione .
His team found the dark material there to be extremely fine - grained , making up only a very thin layer on the moon 's trailing side .
Its distribution and composition , as measured by the Cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer , indicate that the dark material is not native to Dione .
And scientists see many of the same signatures there that appear on the moons Phoebe , Iapetus , Hyperion and Epimetheus , and also in Saturn 's F-ring .
As for where this material comes from and what the dark material is , Clark said , " It 's a mystery , which makes it intriguing .
We 're still trying to find the exact match . "
The visual and infrared spectrometer detected unique absorption bands in the dark material within the Saturn system , which scientists have not seen anywhere else in the solar system .
" The data keep getting better and better , " he said .
" We 're ruling things out and figuring out pieces . "
So far , the team has identified bound water and , possibly , ammonia in the dark material .
Ongoing geologic activity is another component of Saturn 's ecology as some of the moons continue to feed the planet 's rings , which in turn affect many of the moons .
Clark 's team reports tentative evidence to support the hypothesis presented earlier this year that Dione is still geologically active .
In one series of observations , the infrared spectrometer detected a cloud of methane and water ice encircling Dione in its orbit within the outer portions of Saturn 's E-ring .
Of course the big story is the icy plumes spewing from the warm , south polar region of Enceladus .
These plumes are believed to be feeding the E-ring .
A paper led by Frank Postberg of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg , Germany , says there are traces of organic compounds or silicate materials within the water ice - dominated E-ring , close to Enceladus .
This implies that the moon 's rocky core and liquid water are dynamically interacting .
The finding could bolster a theory that Dennis Matson and Julie Castillo of JPL put forth this year , which said that a warm , organic brew might lie just below Enceladus ' surface .
Cassini's next close study of an icy moon is the highly - anticipated flyby of Enceladus scheduled for March 12 .
During that flyby , Cassini will pass by the active moon at a distance of only 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) at its point of closest approach , and at a distance of around 200 kilometers ( 120 miles ) when it passes through the plumes .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
JPL , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Cassini - Huygens mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
Heidi Adkisson notes that features sell products , but the people buying those products often do n't use the very features they bought the product for in the first place .
A few years ago I did an extensive in - home study observing use of a particular computer hardware peripheral .
Most people had high - end models with many features .
But in my observation of use , only one " power user " went beyond using anything but the core , basic features .
These people had paid a premium for features they did n't use .
However , when describing their purchase experience , it was clear they aspired to using these features and sincerely intended to .
But , once the product was out of the box , the paradox of the active user took over .
They never invested even the smallest amount of time to go beyond the basics ( even though the extra features could have saved them time ) .
In my experience it 's people 's aspiration for the experience that drives purchasing decisions .
Ultimately , their aspirations may be different than the reality .
It 's interesting that Heidi used the hedge phrase " may be different " when her own study data showed that users ' aspirations and reality were almost always different .
Maybe she aspires to live in a world where aspirations and reality are n't so wildly divergent .
I do n't blame her .
It 'd be nice .
That disparity is why it 's so important to observe how users actually behave versus the way they tell you they behave .
People who do this professionally are called " economists " .
Observation is a powerful skill , and so is learning to disregard what people tell you in favor of judging them by their actions .
No actions are more carefully considered than those that result in money flowing out of your pocket .
That 's why you owe it to yourself to read books like Freakonomics , and maybe even The Economist magazine .
It 's also why the Freakonomics blog should be a part of your regular reading routine if it is n't already .
People lie not because they 're all evil liars ( although a few inevitably will be ) , but because they 're usually lying to themselves in some way .
Some lies are useful .
Small social " white " lies grease the skids of social reality .
Penetrating this veil of lies and intentions is one of the central themes of the excellent television show House , M.D. :
The show plays up subtle connections between the House character and Sherlock Holmes , which is appropriate , because it 's very much a detective show at heart .
The character Gregory House , as played by the brilliant Hugh Laurie , is fond of stating " Everybody lies . "
Parsing through all the irrational human behavior , and the inevitable lies – white or otherwise – makes for a gripping detective story indeed when lives are at stake .
Heidi referenced the Paradox of the Active User ( pdf ) , which has been around as a concept since 1987 .
I highly recommend reading the original paper , but if you do n't have time , Jakob Nielsen summarizes :
Users never read manuals but start using the software immediately .
They are motivated to get started and to get their immediate task done : they do n't care about the system as such and do n't want to spend time up front on getting established , set up , or going through learning packages .
The " paradox of the active user " is a paradox because users would save time in the long term by learning more about the system .
But that 's not how people behave in the real world , so we cannot allow engineers to build products for an idealized rational user when real humans are irrational .
We must design for the way users actually behave .
There are a bunch of ways to restate the paradox of the active user .
Cooper calls it perpetual intermediacy .
I think the easiest way to explain it is this : every user lies .
Instead of asking users if they love your software – of course they love your software , it'd be rude to tell the people responsible just how mind - numbingly awful it really is – do what Gregory House does .
Observe whether or not they use the software , and how they use it .
Rely on that behavioral data to design your software , and not the lies of your users , however well intentioned they may be .
Gordon Brown is preparing for a battle with the European Union over biofuels after one of the government 's leading scientists warned they could exacerbate climate change rather than combat it .
In an outspoken attack on a policy which comes into force next week , Professor Bob Watson , the chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , said it would be wrong to introduce compulsory quotas for the use of biofuels in petrol and diesel before their effects had been properly assessed .
" If one started to use biofuels ... and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease , that would obviously be insane , " Watson said .
" It would certainly be a perverse outcome . "
Under the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation , all petrol and diesel must contain 2.5 % of biofuels from April 1 .
This is designed to ensure that Britain complies with a 2003 EU directive that 5.75 % of petrol and diesel come from renewable sources by 2010 .
But scientists have increasingly questioned the sustainability of biofuels , warning that by increasing deforestation the energy source may be contributing to global warming .
Watson 's warning was echoed last night by Professor Sir David King , who recently retired as the government 's chief scientific adviser .
He said biofuel quotas should be put on hold until the results were known of a review which has been commissioned by ministers .
" What is absolutely desperately needed within government are people of integrity who will state what the science advice is under whatever political pressure or circumstances , " he said .
The EU plans to raise the compulsory biofuel quota to 10 % by 2020 , but Brown is understood to be ready to challenge this plan .
A senior government source said last night : " There is a growing feeling that we need to get all the facts .
Some biofuels are OK but there are serious questions about others .
More work needs to be done . "
Sources say the government has no choice but to implement the guidelines next month because Britain is obliged under EU law to comply with the 2010 target .
But the report on biofuels , to come from the head of the Renewable Fuels Agency , Professor Ed Gallagher , may be used to challenge the more ambitious target for 2020 , which is not set in law .
John Beddington , the government 's current chief scientific adviser , has already expressed scepticism about biofuels .
At a speech in Westminster this month he said demand for biofuels from the US had delivered a " major shock " to world agriculture , which was raising food prices globally .
" There are real problems with the unsustainability of biofuels , " he said , adding that cutting down rainforest to grow the crops was " profoundly stupid " .
Britain will move cautiously in its battle with Brussels because José Manuel Barroso , the European commission president , is championing the 10 % target for 2020 .
Barroso this month dismissed as " exaggerated " claims that biofuels can lead to increases in food prices and greenhouse gas emissions due to deforestation .
But other members of the commission and other countries , including Germany , sympathise with Britain .
Brown was due to release a report touching on issues including biofuels , when he met Barroso in Brussels last month .
But the prime minister decided that the time was " not right or ripe " .
The prime minister made clear that Britain is wary of the target when he said last November : " I take extremely seriously concerns about the impact of biofuels on deforestation , precious habitats and on food security , and the UK is working to ensure a European sustainability standard is introduced as soon as possible , and we will not support an increase in biofuels over current target levels until an effective standard is in place . "
Lots of people are asking me questions about what made me cry at Microsoft a few weeks ago .
If I told you “ a telescope ” you ’d make fun of me , right ?
Tell me I ’m lame and that I do n’t deserve to be a geek and that I should run away and join the circus , right ?
Well , that ’s what I saw .
Or , more accurately , the WorldWide Telescope .
UPDATE : the official site is now up .
Like I said , sounds lame .
How could that possibly be the most fabulous thing I ’ve seen Microsoft do in years ?
And that ’s not just me talking .
My friends who ’ve seen it say that I actually underhyped it .
That ’s the first time anyone has said I underhyped something when I was trying to be so over - the - top with hype .
Like I said , it is n’t the product that ’s impressive .
You ’ve gotta see this thing to really understand .
My video will be up on Monday .
But , I ’ll try to give you an idea of what made me so impressed .
Think of Google Maps or Microsoft ’s Live Maps .
How dragging a map around lets you see the world in a new way .
Zoom in .
Zoom out .
You have the whole world in a window on your screen .
Now , think of the sky .
When Brian Cox , physicist at CERN , spoke at LIFT last year he told us to hold our hands out , put our thumb up and realize there are hundreds of thousands of stars in just that small patch of sky .
Now you ’ve probably looked at imagery from the Hubble Telescope .
So you know there are entire galaxies out there .
But what are you missing ?
Context .
In other words , you have no idea where in the sky those things you see in Sky and Telescope magazine are .
You ’re missing context .
So , back to the World Wide Telescope .
You drag around the sky .
There ’s Mars .
There ’s the big dipper .
There ’s Betelguese .
Etc.
It ’s just like the star party you probably attended in college .
But it has one difference between any telescope you ’ve ever looked at .
You can zoom .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Zoom .
We picked a point of light inside the big dipper .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Holy shit , it ’s two galaxies colliding .
It looked like a star .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Now the magic happened .
Curtis Wong said : “ let ’s switch to a different telescope and see what these two galaxies colliding are spitting out . ”
He clicked a button and we saw a completely different view of the same colliding galaxies .
This time we were n’t looking at visible light , but at something else .
I think it might have been infrared , or maybe a look at other kinds of radiation being kicked out .
He had about 10 of the world ’s telescopes to look at .
I forget all the names , but that detail is in the video coming on Monday .
Zoom out .
Zoom out .
Zoom out .
Zoom out .
Pan over to Mars .
What a glorious view .
You ’ve never seen Mars like that through your $ 2,000 Celestron Telescope .
Oh , you have one of those nice Celestron telescopes with the motorized base ?
Click a button and your telescope points to what you ’re looking at in this piece of software .
And there ’s a ton more , the demo just goes on and on and on .
Some other things .
1 . It ’s dedicated to Jim Gray , the Microsoft Researcher who sailed out of San Francisco Bay about a year ago never to be heard from again .
He started this project with a paper back in 2002 .
2 . It runs only on Windows .
It ’s coded in C#/.NET , you ’ll meet the developer in our video and you ’ll hear more about that then .
3 . It ’s free , but only in a private alpha right now .
I ’m not sure when it ’ll be released to the public .
I bet that we ’ll find that out at Microsoft ’s Tech Fest next week ( TechCrunch and other bloggers are going to that , so Im sure we ’ll hear lots more details on the other cool stuff Microsoft Research is doing ) .
4 . There are terabytes of data , all seamlessly integrated for the first time here .
5 . There are narrations and tours .
I believe you can even add your own , so you can leave a little tour for your kids to see the sky in a new way .
6. Mike Arrington and Dan Farber figured it out first .
So , why cry over a telescope ?
Because I just saw the world I live in , er , excuse me , the universe I live in in a new way that I never had imagined before .
I cried because I imagined all the kids , like my sons , who will be inspired by what they see .
It took me back to the days when John Kennedy wanted us to go to the moon .
Hint : there ’s a lot more out there to explore .
I cried because I realized just how much work , money , and all that went into making these images .
I never had access to them before .
Certainly not in this way so I could compare them by clicking a button .
As a taxpayer who ’s helped pay for some of these telescopes it ’s the first time I ’ve seen the results of my and your , investments in our scientific research .
It ’s human to look out at the sky and wonder what ’s going on out there .
This takes us a LOT further into our understanding of just what is .
And , , yes , that ’s worth crying some inspirational tears .
Thank you to Microsoft Research for inspiring me in a way that Microsoft has n’t inspired me in years .
And , also , sorry to the teams that I caused some PR troubles for .
I hope you ’ll forgive me for getting a little excited .
I could n’t contain myself .
It is n’t everyday that you get to see such an inspiring piece of software .
The High Court in Singapore has ordered an ISP to hand over the personal details of its customers who used BitTorrent to share Japanese anime titles , overturning a previous decision .
The decision will likely pave the way to taking legal action against hundreds more BitTorrent users .
Odex Pt. Ltd is a Singapore - based company that distributes anime in South East Asia .
Founded in 1998 it started distributing anime in 2000 , offering titles such as Bleach , Fullmetal Alchemist and Mobile Suit Gundam .
Last year we reported that the company had started to pursue those it accused of sharing its copyright works , sending out many ‘ pay up $ 3500 or else ’ letters – a response , says the company , to a drop in sales of more than 60 % in the previous 2 years .
Odex used a tracking system to collect IP address of alleged sharers and then in court cases , successfully forced the ISPs StarHub and Singnet to give up the identities of their customers involved in the sweep .
Next up , they tried to force another ISP , PacNet to give up the same .
However , PacNet refused , so Odex went to court to try to force them to comply .
To the dismay of Odex , the court decided that Odex had ‘ no right of civil action ’ against those it accused of infringing its copyrights , as Odex is only a sub- licensee of the anime titles it distributes , not the copyright holder .
In a very short - lived victory for file - sharers on Tuesday , the High Court dismissed attempts to force PacNet to give up its customers details to Odex .
The judge , Justice Woo Bih Li , decided that as Odex had no right in this case to take copyright action , it could not be allowed to see the personal details of PacNet ’s customers either .
However , in 2007 , Odex added the names of the real six Japanese copyright holders to its case ( GDH , Kadokawa Pictures , Showgate , Sunrise , TV Tokyo MediaNet and Yomiuri Telecasting ) which , it turns out , was a smart move .
Although Justice Woo Bih Li denied
Odex a chance to see the records , the real copyright holders are in a position to sue – so he granted them full access to the records instead .
A spokesperson for PacNet said : “ Pacnet is glad that the court has ruled in favour of us and has dismissed Odex ’s appeal with costs .
We will abide by [ the ] ruling and provide these copyright owners with the details of about 500 IP addresses . ”
By some estimates , Odex could ’ve made as much as $ 9 m if everyone they accused paid up so they are understandably pleased at the result of the case .
A spokesman said : “ This ruling in favor of the Japanese copyright owners is a significant boost for us and our principals , as we have always acted for and on behalf of the copyright owners .
We are very pleased that Pacnet will now be required to hand over information on the infringing accounts to our copyright owners . ”
It ’s likely that this decision will encourage Odex to continue with their tactics against file - sharers , tactics which have already resulted in death threats for its boss , Stephen Sing and his family , after being dubbed ‘ the most hated man in Singapore ’s anime community ’ .
Maintaining the momentum of this weekend 's four wins in Washington State , Nebraska , Louisiana , and Maine , Sen. Barack Obama visited the University of Maryland a day before the " Potomac primary " to stir up young supporters and take on both his rivals —
Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
As the audience of about 17,000 at the University of Maryland echoed , the senator from Illinois was " fired up " and " ready to go , " telling supporters that Clinton 's claim that they should vote for her because she is tough and able to fight off Republicans was n't unique to her .
" Well , let me tell you something : I 'm skinny , but I 'm tough , too .
I 'm looking forward to mixing it up with John McCain , " Obama said the day before voters in Virginia , Maryland , and Washington , D.C. , would have a chance to vote in the presidential primary .
But first , Obama has Clinton to contend with .
The two Democrats continue to be neck and neck in the delegate race nationally .
Obama has gotten help in the Potomac region by having Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine and Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty on his side .
Clinton has had support from Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley .
While Obama is ahead in the polls in the Potomac primary and expected to handily win the popular vote in all three jurisdictions , the trifecta of campaigning Clintons has been out and about in the region , too , even while the Clinton campaign is more heavily focusing on the delegate - rich primaries in Texas and Ohio on March 4 .
Chelsea Clinton visited the University of Maryland Sunday to chat with 250 students in the Stamp Student Union , while her mother spoke to more than 1,000 supporters down the road at Bowie State University .
Former President Bill Clinton asked the forgiveness of the congregation of one of Washington 's largest black churches Sunday for racially tinged comments he made in South Carolina concerning Obama .
On Monday , Senator Clinton toured the General Motors Baltimore Allison Transmission plant and then headed to the University of Virginia .
But Obama 's popularity among young people showed when he drew in Monday 's massive crowd in Maryland .
The Comcast Center , where the Maryland Terrapins basketball team plays , was filled almost to the brim with people of all ages hoping to get a peek at the senator .
Maryland students waited in the bitter cold in a line that was easily several miles long , some staying up all night in anticipation of the visit .
High schoolers poured out of the College Park metro station and stuffed themselves into the University of Maryland 's red buses to reach the event .
Students held " Barack My World " and " Party Like Barack Star " signs , among others , and treated Obama , well , like a rock star .
He addressed the concerns of some that he is a " hope- monger . "
" There are some folks who say , ' He has n't been in Washington long enough ... we have to season and stew him a little longer — boil all the hope out of him , ' " Obama said .
" I notice this argument has n't worked with the American people because they understand that the last thing we need is to have the same old cast of characters doing the same old thing . "
Obama talked about getting every American on board and even spoke of Republicans who support him , a new breed of political enthusiasts called " Obama - cans . "
" Hey Barack — I'm a Republican , " shouted a middle - aged bearded man from the audience , donning a camouflage cowboy hat .
Point noted .
The first new Linux kernel of 2008 is now out , showcasing improvements that run the gambit of bug fixes to new performance and feature enhancements .
One addition found in the new 2.6.24 Linux kernel is the new ability for write - throttling code .
" This prevents one heavily - used block device from starving the other devices .
so it 's great for throughput enhancement , " Joel Berman , director of marketing at Red Hat , told InternetNews.com .
Berman also said the new kernel 's inclusion of what are known as kernel markers would prove very useful for developers .
Kernel markers are used for deep tuning and debugging .
" This gets us closer to Dtrace , and makes SystemTap easier to use , " Berman said .
Dtrace is the Sun Solaris technology that uses dynamic probes to monitor system performance .
SystemTap is a similar approach for Linux .
The Linux 2.6.24 kernel also improves kernel utilization by way of new group scheduling technology .
Berman explained that new approach fairly allocates groups ' CPU usage .
For example , if there are four active groups , each group gets 25 percent of the CPU .
If one group is made up of 10 users , another group has 100 and the other two have one each , the 100 in one group share their 25 percent of the machine .
Berman also noted that i386 and x86 - 64 sources for the kernel have been merged into one pool .
That effort will help in quality assurance and removing duplication in patching .
Linux 2.6.24 also makes improvements for embedded developers .
Jim Ready , CTO of MontaVista Linux , told InternetNews.com that that the inclusion of high - resolution and tickless timers for processors such as ARM MIPS should bode well .
Both features are key components of a real - time Linux kernel .
" This is important for consumer and mobile devices that cannot run on Intel architecture , " Ready said .
While the 2.6.24 Linux kernel has some specific areas of interest for Red Hat and MontaVista , a number of other other interested parties also made contributions .
According to the Linux Foundation 's Linux Weather Forecast , more than 10,000 individual changesets were included during the 2.6.24 development cycle .
Those changesets resulted in almost 300,000 lines of code being added to the kernel .
While Linus Torvalds is officially responsible for releasing the 2.6.24 kernel , the Linux Foundation Forecast noted that the new version 's contributions came from 950 developers representing over 130 companies .
ROME ( Reuters ) -
An Italian man was jailed for more than two years for putting pornographic pictures of his ex-girlfriend on the Internet and sending them out in more than 15,000 emails .
The 32 - year - old man had created a Web site that appeared to show his ex-girlfriend offering sexual favours and erotic games , with her phone number also on display .
The man , who also sent threatening text messages to the woman and her parents , was accused of aggravated defamation , threatening and violence .
In its ruling , the Milan court said the man had publicised photos and data that should have remained private , and done so without his ex-girlfriend ’s consent .
The court sentenced him to 2 years and 4 months in jail .
Harman releases Feb. '03 letter warning CIA not to destroy tapes The Associated Press

Print This Email This Lawmaker 's Letter Warned Destroying Tapes Would ' Reflect Badly ' on the CIA
The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee warned in a 2003 letter that destroying videotapes of terrorist interrogations would put the CIA under a cloud of suspicion , according to a newly declassified copy of the letter .
" Even if the videotape does not constitute an official record that must be preserved under the law , the videotape would be the best proof that the written record is accurate , if such record is called into question in the future , " Rep. Jane Harman , D - Calif. , wrote in a Feb. 10 , 2003 letter to then - CIA general counsel Scott Muller .
" The fact of destruction would reflect badly on the agency . "
Harman 's office released the declassified letter on Thursday , a day after the Justice Department announced it had opened a criminal investigation into the destruction of the tapes .
The letter notes that a copy also went to then - CIA Director George Tenet .
Last month , the CIA acknowledged destroying videos showing the harsh interrogation of two top al - Qaida suspects  Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
CIA Director Michael Hayden said the videos , which were made in 2002 , were destroyed in 2005 out of fear the tapes would leak and reveal the identities of interrogators .
Hayden said the sessions were videotaped to provide an added layer of legal protection for officers using tough interrogation methods authorized by President Bush to help break down recalcitrant prisoners .
Harman 's letter , sent when memories of the 2001 terrorist attacks were still fresh , acknowledges that the CIA was faced with balancing security and liberty while protecting the country from another attack .
But in a reference to the harsh interrogations , she asked Muller " whether the most senior levels of the White House have determined that these practices are consistent with the principles and policies of the United States .
Have enhanced techniques been authorized and approved by the president ? "
In his response to Harman 's letter , Muller did not address her concerns about destroying the tapes .
Instead , he reassured her that the interrogation techniques used were legal .
And he added : " I think it would be fair to assume that policy as well as legal matters have been addressed within the Executive Branch . "
The CIA declassified Harman 's 2003 letter so that she could speak publicly about her concerns then and now .
At the time , Harman was the senior Democrat on the intelligence panel .
Harman was one of several officials who recommended against destroying the tapes .
One official familiar with the investigation said Alberto Gonzales , who served as White House counsel and then attorney general , advised against destroying the videotapes .
Another administration attorney , John Bellinger , then a lawyer at the National Security Council , has told colleagues that administration lawyers who discussed the matter in 2003 came to a consensus that the tapes should not be destroyed , said a senior official familiar with Bellinger 's account of the 2003 White House discussion .
" The recommendation in 2003 from the White House was that the tapes should not be destroyed , " the official said .
President Bush has said his " first recollection " of being told about the tapes and their destruction was when Hayden briefed him about it last month .
House Intelligence committee Chairman Sylvestre Reyes , D - Texas , has scheduled a hearing for Jan. 16 , at which he plans to question Jose Rodriguez , the former head of the CIA 's National Clandestine Service who ordered the tapes destroyed , and acting CIA general counsel John Rizzo .
On Wednesday , Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed John Durham , a veteran federal prosecutor in Connecticut , to oversee a full criminal investigation that could further challenge the Bush administration 's handling of terrorism suspects .
Durham , a 25 - year veteran of the Justice Department , has a reputation as one of the nation 's most relentless prosecutors .
He was appointed to investigate the FBI 's use of mob informants in Boston , a probe that sent former FBI agent John Connolly to prison .
Prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia , which includes the CIA 's headquarters in Langley , Va. , had removed themselves from the case .
CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson , who worked with the Justice Department on the preliminary inquiry , also removed himself .
" The Justice Department went out and got somebody with complete independence and integrity , " said former Connecticut U.S. Attorney Stanley Twardy , who worked with Durham .
" No politics whatsoever .
It 's going to be completely by the book and he 's going to let the chips fall where they may . "
Durham gained national prominence following the 1989 murder of Mafia underboss William Grasso , which led to one of the biggest mob takedowns in U.S history .
He then turned to Connecticut street gangs , winning dozens of convictions and putting some gang leaders in jail for life .
Former Attorney General Janet Reno hand - picked Durham to lead the investigation into the FBI 's use of mob informants in Boston .
Durham , a Republican , has shown no tolerance for corruption in either party .
He supervised the corruption investigation that sent former Republican Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland and several members of his administration to prison .

Mr. Scott Muller
General Counsel
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington , DC 20505
Dear Mr. Muller :
Last weeks briefing brought home to me the difficult challenges faced by the Central Intelligence Agency in the current threat environment .
I realize we are at a time when the balance between security and liberty must be constantly evaluated and recalibrated in order to protect our nation and its people from catastrophic terrorist attack and I thus appreciate the obvious effort that you and your Office have made to address the tough questions .
At the briefing you assured us that the [ redacted ] approved by the Attorney General have been subject to an extensive review by lawyers at the Central Intelligence Agency , the Department of Justice and the National Security Council and found to be within the law .
It is also the case , however , that what was described raises profound policy questions and I am concerned about whether these have been as rigorously examined as the legal questions .
I would like to know what kind of policy review took place and what questions were examined .
In particular , I would like to know whether the most senior levels of the White House have determined that these practices are consistent with the principles and policies of the United States .
Have enhanced techniques been authorized and approved by the President ?
You discussed the fact that there is videotape of Abu Zubaydah following his capture that will be destroyed after the Inspector General finishes his inquiry .
I would urge the Agency to reconsider that plan .
Even if the videotape does not constitute an official record that must be preserved under the law , the videotape would be the best proof that the written record is accurate , if such record is called into question in the future .
The fact of destruction would reflect badly on the Agency .
I look forward to your response .
Sincerely ,
JANE HARMAN
Text of CIA General Counsel Mullers Response to Representative Harman :
28 February 2003
The Honorable Jane Harman
Ranking Democratic Member
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
House of Representatives
Washington , DC 20515
Dear Ms. Harman :
Thank you for your letter of 10 February following up on the briefing we gave you and Congressman Goss on 5 February concerning the Central Intelligence Agencys limited use of the handful of specially approved interrogation techniques we described .
As we informed both you and the leadership of the Intelligence Committees last September , a number of Executive Branch lawyers including lawyers from the Department of Justice participated in the determination that , in the appropriate circumstances , use of these techniques is fully consistent with US law .
While I do not think it appropriate for me to comment on issues that are a matter of policy , much less the nature and extent of Executive Branch policy deliberations , I think it would be fair to assume that policy as well as legal matters have been addressed within the Executive Branch .
I enjoyed meeting you , albeit briefly , and I look forward to seeing you again .
Sincerely ,
Scott W. Muller
Against all odds , an evolutionary scientist has been elected President of the United States .
It 's Inauguration Day , and the President - Elect is being adminstered the oath of office .
" Say after me ' I do solemnly swear ( or you can say affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . ' "
" I 'm sorry .
I can swear to do things to the best of my ability , that 's really a tautology , but I can't swear or affirm I 'll do anything faithfully .
I 'm determined .
If it 's determined that I 'm not going to be faithtful , there 's nothing I can do about it . "
" Well , what would word would work for you in place of swear or affirm ?
Can you promise ? "
" No , I can't promise .
That 's just it , I 'm determined so there 's no point in me promising anything .
It either will be , or it wo n't . "
" How about , ' Having been selected over the competition , I am probably the person most likely to fittingly execute the office of President of the United States ? ' "
" I like that !
If I can go ahead on that basis , the next four years should be a breeze . "
Would you want your daughter to marry an evolutionary scientist ?
Your daughter has announced she intends to marry an evolutionary scientist !
You wonder , how is your daughter to take her young man 's statement that he loves her ?
How seriously should she take his promise to love , honor , and cherish ?
Can she trust the word of someone who does n't think he has free will ?
Should she stick up for her opinion in argument with someone who believes his opinions to be determined ?
OK , let 's put our foot down .
The young man must come meet us and account for himself .
" You want to marry my daughter ? "
" Yes , I do .
I love her . "
" Will you stay faithful to her ? "
" Who 's to know .

Dear friends :
The bad news ( alas ! ) first , and the very good news last : I will highlight the hope and stress where our power is .
And contrary to popular belief , there really is lots of it !
But it will take * everybody ' s* help to make it work .
Pleasee pitch in !
If you , dear reader , have any further thoughts to add about what we can do , please by all means post as comments , below !
Thanks !

With anti-war sentiment being so wide - spread in the greater American public , I would have thought that McCain had very little , if any , chance of winning the Primaries .
Did n’t you think the same thing ?
I am sure you did .
Yet look at what has happened .
Given his pro-war position , how did McCain end up in the lead in the Republican circles ?
C’mon , do n’t tell me that most Republicans are pro-war , even if some ignorant ones among them are for it .
Please let ’s not exaggerate the negatives in our own minds , and please let ’s do give people the credit which they deserve .
How can it be that ….. Kucinich consistently earned as much as 39 - 77 % of the Democratic votes in independent polls , yet the mainstream polls reported that he was in the bottom 2 % rank ?
In fact , according to straw polls , Kucinich was ahead of Obama and Clinton in many cases , ran neck - and - neck with them at other times , plus won state - wide Democratic endorsements in several states .
Even ABC and MSN ’s polls reported him as the “ winner ” of the debates .
By en large , when not running neck - and - neck , Kucinich was actually well ahead of the other Democratic Candidates ….. Hmmmm .
The discrepancy between the independent poll figures and the mainstream polls , in Kucinich ’s case , are miles wider than the contested New Hampshire election figures .
Think about it :
This does n’t make any sense .
http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_kucinich_080109_check_out_how_many_p.htm
Then of course Ron Paul and Obama signs are to be seen everywhere , at least in California .
How about in your area of the country ?
And while Ron Paul broke fundraising records in the last few months , with large crowds attending his meetings , he still is reported as being at the bottom of the pile .
Why ?
Because , he does n’t kiss up to the corporations or to those attempting to convert the USA to a dictatorship .
Because he is outspoken , truthful and principled .
And concerned about civil liberties .
Ditto as regards Edwards .
He stood against the purchasing of public policy , and guess what happened ?
Out he went .
Okay , this happens on occasion .
But when the patterns are obviously clear --- in this case , standing for civil liberties and against corporate hijacking of an entire nation ---- and when those very clear patterns seem to qualify for being ousted from Debates and the Candidacy itself ---- then we have to suspect that a deliberate plan is in the works .
Enter two apparently chosen Democratic Candidates , Obama and Clinton , both of whom may likely be discredited by the “ other side ” .
Clinton has too much baggage , and the witchhunt for the Clintons continues .
That is obvious :
Why else would they publicly dub Bill Clinton as a temperamental “ case ” and ask pointed questions of Hillary about it ?
Then of course , Obama lacks experience .
Given the recession , national debt , Great Depression Probably Revisited , war , terrorism , global warming , civil liberties overturned , etc….surely the “ other side ” will tell us that he is not up to the task .
Whether they are right or wrong is only a matter of conjecture :
Only time would tell .
After all , he would have advisors working hand - and - glove with him .
And the trustworthy Kucinich has told us that Obama is a sincere man , who as such would be inclined to listen to his good advisors .
But they will never tell us that .
Drumroll ….game over !
As the pro-war , pro-corporation Candidate of power - supporting inclinations , McCain is hoisted up to the throne .
The only way they could “ legitimately ” get McCain in there would be by manipulating public opinion .
Because as public sentiment goes , so go the polls .
Or at least , that is what the polls claim .
And as the polls go , so go the votes .
Or , at least , that is what the Registrar of Voters will claim .

N’DJAMENA ( Reuters ) - Six French aid workers were sentenced to eight years of hard labour each after a court in Chad found them guilty on Wednesday of trying to kidnap 103 children from the African country .

France , while calling the verdict a “ sovereign decision ” , said it would ask Chad to implement a 1976 bilateral judicial accord which would allow the convicted six to be transferred home to serve jail sentences in their own country .
The court in the capital N’Djamena handed down the sentence on the fourth day of the trial of the six members of the French humanitarian group Zoe ’s Ark .
They were arrested in October for trying to fly the 103 children , aged one to 10 , to Europe .
The court also ordered the accused to pay compensatory damages of 40 million CFA francs ( 44,000 pounds ) for each of the 103 children involved in the case , totalling 4.12 billion CFA francs ( $ 9 million ) in all .
After the sentence was read by the court president , the four men and two women were escorted from the courtroom among a jostling mob of journalists , their faces serious .
Defence lawyers and relatives of the six reacted with dismay to the sentence and called on France ’s government to work for a solution with Chad that would enable them to be returned home .
Chad ’s government had faced heavy popular pressure to punish the Zoe ’s Ark members with an exemplary sentence .
But there has been widespread expectation of a diplomatic deal between Paris and N’Djamena to send them back to France , either through the judicial accord or a pardon granted by Chadian President Idriss Deby .
None of these options were immediately mentioned by the court in delivering the sentence .
French Foreign ministry spokeswoman Pascale Andreani said in Paris : “ France , after obtaining the agreement of the members of Zoe ’s Ark and examining the implementation of the judicial cooperation accord between France and Chad , in particular article 29 , will ask the Chadian authorities for the transfer of the prisoners to France ” .
One of the six ’s defence lawyers , Gilbert Collard , criticised the sentence , saying there was no justice in Chad .
“ I hope the French government will move to quickly bring home our compatriots , who have been caught in a trap , ” he told reporters .
RESCUING “ DARFUR ORPHANS ”
Janine Lelouch , mother of Emilie Lelouch , one of the six convicted , told French television she also hoped the group could come home quickly , “ because they ca n’t stand it much longer . ”
“ It ’s bad , it ’s very bad .
They have n’t done anything wrong , they ’re not criminals .
I do n’t understand ...
It ’s a masquerade ...
I ’m very worried about the future of my daughter , ” she said .
Since the trial opened on Friday , the six had persistently rejected the abduction and fraud charges against them .
They testified they believed the children were orphans from Sudan ’s war - torn Darfur region whom they intended to give to European families for fostering .
They said international law justified the humanitarian operation .
“ Our intention was to fetch orphans from Darfur , ” Zoe ’s Ark ’s leader , Eric Breteau , told the court .
Defence lawyers had accused the Chadian court of rushing through the trial under political pressure from Paris .

France is an ally of Deby and has a military contingent stationed in the landlocked former French colony .
French troops have been supporting Deby ’s forces against eastern rebels and will provide the bulk of a European Union peacekeeping force due to be deployed in east Chad in January .
Chad ’s government has said the six did not have permission to take the children out of the country .
Prosecutors said the group duped parents in eastern Chad into handing over their children with promises of schooling .
The French have blamed their local intermediaries for misleading them over the identity of the children , who Chadian and U.N. officials said were mostly not orphans and came from villages in Chad on its eastern border with Darfur .

Another uglyness I saw , which is n't restricted to Framewave unfortunately , is assembly language routines that have been translated to intrinsics .
The result is a nasty C++ routine that has variables like " pedx " and " pesi , " but has instruction names translated so that what used to be an understandable " paddw " is now " _mm_add_epi16 . "
I know this was a hack job for portability , but the result sure is unreadable .
It looks like there are indeed a number of well - optimized SSE2 routines in the Framewave library , but after seeing things like the above a few times I was left scratching my head a bit ....
One thing that I wanted to look at was their 8x8 2D - IDCT source .
The 8x8 2D inverse discrete cosine transform ( IDCT ) is popular and used in a number of video compression formats .
There are a million ways to implement it quickly , and although everyone 's seen Intel 's AP - 922 SSE2 algorithm for it by now , I had n't seen one by AMD before .
So I grab the source and dig around in the JPEG module , and I see this :
AMD just open sourced the AMD Performance Library as Framewave , which at least from my perspective seems like a good thing .
Not that I 'm going to attempt to use it , but I perused the source out of curiosity , and it looks like there are some useful goodies in there .

Well - their library seems seriously to lack optimization for static operations .
Their resizers are unable to maintain their coefficients , so no possibility of re-use .
A much bigger WTF is that their resizers split the image without overlap , so you will get no incorrect interpolation , where the library .
You might also enjoy to know that they call 4 mallocs per thread per resize .
16 bit resizes converts to and from float in the inner loop .
Wow . ;) Maintaining this beast seems horrible .
The 8 bit unsigned _cubic_ resizer alone is 1488 lines of code - yes 1488 .
It seems they just gave up on lanczos and just implemented it in plain C++. Colorspace conversions have no interpolation , whatsoever .
No interlaced 4:2:0 RGB - nice - you have to separate fields - but considering their lack of interpolation that should n't be much of a concern .
These are the only ones I 've looked at - and honestly - I would only use it for prototyping , since it 's easy to use and ( presumably ) well tested .

is fwMalloc==malloc ?
Are they using a custom preallocated memory pool to ensure locality or something ?
Nick S - 21 02 08 - 06:23
It would 've been nice to actually explain what 's the problem with calling malloc and what would have been a better implementation .
Calvin K - 21 02 08 - 07:11
Until we see what fwmalloc ( ) actually does there is no valid point in bashing it .
If it 's using some sort of fast pool - allocator I do n't see anything wrong with it .
Bojan - 21 02 08 - 07:55
The little I digged it seems that this is as follows : void * STDCALL fwMalloc ( int length ) {return AlignedMalloc ( length ) ; }where AlignedMalloc is platform - specific : on windows it is return _aligned_malloc ( length , 32 ) ; on OS - X void * memptr = malloc ( length ) ; return memptr ; on Linux void * memptr ; posix_memalign ( & memptr , 32 , length ) ; return memptr ;and on Solaris void * memptr = memalign ( 32 , length ) ; return memptr ; So it seems that they all call memory - allocators that return an aligned piece of memory .
Seems to be quite wasteful indeed to call it in a otherwise tight routine but I do not known anyway nearly enough to say how else you can get aligned memory .
Jarkko Miettinen - 21 02 08 - 09:42
how else you can get aligned memory = > allocate an oversized buffer and use only the aligned middle of it .
Tobias Rieper - 21 02 08 - 10:03
Tobias : Presumably , that 's exactly what the system calls do , too .
Jake McArthur ( link ) - 21 02 08 - 10:24
I 've seen stuff like that pulled only in research code so far .
Anything you 're going to use often that needs temporary buffers should allocate it once , in advance , or at least be gracious enough to let you specify the temp buffer manually to avoid crap like that .
Stefan - 21 02 08 - 11:18
malloc ( ) is really expensive , for many reasons .
It 's an external routine , it may have to lock , and it has to deal with requests for variable memory sizes .
In a case like this , where you have a fixed - size allocation with local scope , you can handle the allocation privately much , much faster than any sort of general purpose allocator .
I suppose it 's not obvious to people who have n't written this kind of routine before , but for a relatively small buffer like this it's much faster to just allocate it on the stack as a local variable .
There are a number of advantages , including : allocation failure case is tightly controlled ( generally impossible ) , requires minimal code , the memory is likely already in L1 cache , you can control alignment against other buffers to reduce cache line address aliasing , and you do n't need an extra register to point to it .
C++ compilers generally provide a way to enforce alignment on local variables , such as __declspec ( align ( n ) ) in VC ++ , and in C# you can use stackalloc ( ) in an unsafe routine .
You can make the allocation call hurt less by implementing a fast allocator , but there 's no way you 'll beat stack allocation , even with a super - fast thread - local implementation or even a compacting garbage collector .
The function call alone is significant in a routine as critical as an IDCT , which commonly executes in less than 2,000 clocks .
Phaeron - 21 02 08 - 22:53
I just took a look at the cubic and Lanczos resamplers that Klaus mentioned , and they 're worse than he lets on -- in fact , they 're implemented as direct 2D resamplers .
For the cubic , this results in 16 multiplies / 16 adds per pixel , versus 8 m7a for a row / column implementation .
Memory bandwidth issues _might_ even that out .
I have a hard time believing that might be faster for the Lanczos case , though , which uses a 6x6 kernel and where the difference is nearly 5:1 in ALU ops ( 64m64a vs. 12m11a ) .
Quality looks like it might be an issue as well .
They 're using pmullw to do the weighting , which means they had to use only 6 bits of fractional precision for the weights .
( I do n't remember what Avisynth uses , but VirtualDub uses 14 bits since it uses pmaddwd . )
That 's somewhat marginal for a 1D implementation , and really sketchy for a 2D kernel ... and they 're also converting the weights to fixed - point using truncation instead of rounding .
They do at least renormalize the weights _after_ conversion to integer , which is a common mistake otherwise .
The data flow is also a bit complex for the 8 bpp case .
Rather than using slightly larger pre-aligned kernels , they use a scalar loop to copy the pixels into a temporary buffer and then load that into SSE2 registers .
That 's a bunch of load / store traffic and a series of store forwarding stalls .
They seem to be doing this in order to compute 8 pixels in parallel and not have to do a horizontal add , but I wonder if this is actually faster than using pmaddwd and then a four - way , 32 - bit horizontal add .
I 'd like to point out that it was n't my intention to rip on the Framewave library in general , just on the particular IDCT routine .
It does look like a number of routines in the library are underoptimized , however .
I think one goal of the library is to be API compatible with the Intel Performance Primitives ( IPP ) library , though , so we should give leeway where the original Intel API lacks flexibility .
Does anyone know how well Intel IPP fares in comparison ?
Phaeron - 22 02 08 - 00:37
For the record , Avisynth also uses 14 bits coefficients .
I rewrote the vertical resizer to a dynamic SSSE3 , which uses pmulhrsw , so the accumulator faction is only 6 bits .
It has fallback to MMX if there is more than 4 taps .
Klaus Post - 22 02 08 - 15:41

Dwight D. Eisenhower initiated ARPA , the team of researches that built ARPANET , the earliest U.S. Internet .
Ed Clark / Time Life Pictures / Getty Images
Mention the history of the Internet to a group of people , and chances are someone will make a snarky comment about Al Gore claiming to have invented it .
Gore actually said that he " took the initiative in creating the Internet " [ source : CNN ] .
He promoted the Internet 's development both as a senator and as vice president of the United States .
So how did the Internet really get started ?
Believe it or not , it all began with a satellite .
It was 1957 when the then Soviet Union launched Sputnik , the first man-made satellite .
Americans were shocked by the news .
The Cold War was at its peak , and the United States and the Soviet Union considered each other enemies .
If the Soviet Union could launch a satellite into space , it was possible it could launch a missile at North America .

President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) in 1958 as a direct response to Sputnik 's launch .
ARPA 's purpose was to give the United States a technological edge over other countries .
One important part of ARPA 's mission was computer science .
In the 1950s , computers were enormous devices that filled entire rooms .
They had a fraction of the power and processing ability you can find in a modern PC .
Many computers could only read magnetic tape or punch cards , and there was no way to network computers together .
ARPA aimed to change that .
It enlisted the help of the company Bolt , Beranek and Newman ( BBN ) to create a computer network .
The network had to connect four computers running on four different operating systems .
They called the network ARPANET.­
Without ARPANET , the Internet would n't look or behave the way it does today -- it might not even exist .
Although other groups were working on ways to network computers , ARPANET established the protocols used on the Internet today .
Moreover , without ARPANET , it may have taken many more years before anyone tried to find ways to join regional networks together into a larger system .
In the next section , we 'll look at how ARPANET joined with other networks to create the Internet .

The X - Wing fighter at Plaster Blaster 6 this weekend got all the glory .
But the model rocket with the biggest heart / size ratio goes to the underdog of a space bomber based on the Y - Wing fighter .
Ion cannons ?
Check .
More torpedoes than the X - Wing ?
Check .
Fewer parts to tear off on liftoff ?
Check ... not that it lived to see a second flight , but at least it finish in a better form and had a longer voyage .
This reel has a bit of friendly yet competitive smacktalk about the X - Wing , the liftoff , and even a bit of in - flight camera salvaged from the fake black box the team rigged up .
Let 's face it together , Star Wars nerds — as much as it gives us a giant collective nerd - boner to imagine real , flying Star Wars vehicles , buzzing the air traffic controllers at JFK Intl ' airport , these things were designed by Lucas 's film masters , not aerospace engineers .
Video and reporting by James Lee and Jesús Diaz .
Interview :
- Why the Y - Wing ?
Since the local rocketry club had decided to do the giant X - wing for the 30th anniversary of the original release of Star Wars , my building team decided on the Y - wing .
Personally , I like the shape of the Y - wing better .
It 's more interesting to me .
I like all of the exposed " junk " all over it .

- How did you power it ?
What kind of engine ?
The rocket was propelled by a motor composed of APCP , ammonium perchlorate composite propellant .
It 's the same fuel that is loaded into the SRB 's on the space shuttle .
Most people have experience with the small Estes black powder motors , with each letter designation doubling the power of the motor .
Estes motors run from A - E . This motor was a L !
Roughly 400 pounds of thrust !

- Did it had any kind of autodestruct control ( in case it was
headed to the crowd ) ?
- Was the parachute RC controlled ?
- What did it have inside ?
Apart from the cameras , any
instrumentation ?
We had two electronics packages installed in the Y - wing .
Our primary package to deploy the parachutes was an altimeter that sensed barometric pressure .
When the altimeter stopped sensing a pressure drop ( when the rocket stopped going up ) it was to record the altitude and deploy the parachutes .
Our backup in case the altimeter failed or in case the rocket started to go off course was a radio controlled " chicken switch " that allowed us to manually deploy the parachutes .
The RC backup seems to have been the source of our premature parachute deployment .
I was the one with my finger on the button , so to speak .
I had my thumb on the safety guard to avoid accidentally pushing the button , so I 'm pretty sure it was n't pushed , but the ejection charge went off about halfway through the motor burn .
- What are you planning for next year ?
We 've been tossing around several ideas for next year .
There have been comments ranging from doing themes of Star Trek , Battlestar Galactica , Babylon 5 to Star Blazers .
We have n't settled on anything yet .
We have to take a look at what theme has a variety of ships that can be built safely as well as kept under a reasonable budget .
( This year the G4 network sponsored our motor and Polecat Aerospace helped us out with some donated parts . )

A man in Prince George , British Columbia , thought he had the perfect way to propose to his high school sweetheart .
Instead of popping the question on a moonlit Caribbean beach this week , though , Aaron Tkachuk , 24 , wound up popping the question to Jennifer Rubadeau , also 24 , at an airport security screening station .
A screener at the Prince George airport , Adam Buhler , insisted on having a closer look at the contents of a small box in the toe of a sock .
Inside the box was a white gold , diamond and ruby ring .
Tkachuk decided to propose on the spot , and other travelers and security personnel cheered as Rubadeau said yes .

TEENAGERS use just 20 words for a third of everything they say , research reveals .
Among the words they spout most are " yeah , no " and " like " , which could come straight out of the mouth of dysfunctional adolescent Vicky Pollard from TV's Little Britain .
Researchers discovered teens use only 12,682 words in everyday speech compared with 21,391 uttered by 25 - 34 year - olds .
Gadgets like MP3 players and games consoles were blamed for eroding their grasp of vocabulary to an all time low .
Experts fear the condition , dubbed Technology Isolation Syndrome , will cause problems at work for inarticulate adolescents who grunt to communicate rather than speak properly .
Head of linguistics at Lancaster University , professor Tony McEnery , who led the study for Tesco , said : " Employers are already complaining that first jobbers are lacking basic verbal communication skills and it seems things could be set to get worse .
" Kids need to get talking and develop vocabulary . "

Bush does n't recollect being told of CIA tapes Nick Juliano
Published : Friday December 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Despite the fact that at least two Democratic lawmakers knew about CIA tapes being destroyed , President Bush is claiming that he has " no recollection " of ever being briefed on the matter .
At Friday 's White House briefing , Press Secretary Dana Perino was asked by a reporter , " On these CIA videotapes , did either the president or vice president or Condoleezza Rice , when she was national security adviser , or Steve Hadley see them before they were destroyed ? "
" I spoke to the president -- and so I will have to defer on the others , but I spoke to the president this morning about this , " Perino said .
" He has no recollection of being made aware of the tapes or their destruction before yesterday .
He was briefed by General Hayden yesterday morning .
And as to the others , I 'll have to -- you know , I 'll refer you to the Vice President 's Office , and I 'll see if I can get the others . "
Video of Perino 's press conference can be seen at this link .
If true , Perino 's assertion would mean Bush was unaware of the CIA 's actions even while top Congressional officials were briefed on the agency 's actions .
The top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees both have said they long knew about the tapes -- which reportedly show CIA interrogators " waterboarding " suspected al Qaeda detainees .
One says she cautioned the CIA about the tapes nearly five years before Bush 's spokesman claims the president knew anything about them .
Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) was the ranking intelligence committee in the House , and she now says she sent a classified letter to the CIA in early 2003 urging the agency not to destroy the tapes , as they previously informed members of Congress they would .
" Given the nature of the classification , I was not free to mention this subject publicly until Director Hayden disclosed it yesterday , " Harman said .
" To my knowledge , the Intelligence Committee was never informed that any videotapes had been destroyed .
Surely I was not . "
Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , who now chairs the Senate intel committee , says he learned the tapes were destroyed in November 2006 -- more than a year before Bush knew what was going on in his intelligence community -- but was unable to press the issue because of the information was classified .
 Im really sick of this 
OK , I m angry about it ,  Rockefeller said .
 It s a manipulation of the Congress  the use of two people of the Senate , two people out of the House , because nobody else can be told , including our committee .
We cant even talk to anybody , and they say ,  Oh , they were briefed . 
CSS has fundamentally changed web design , it has provided designers with a set of properties that can be tweaked to make various techniques to make your pages just look right .
Today we are presenting a round - up of 101 CSS techniques designers use all the time .
Definitely worth taking a very close look at !
This is just the first series , the second part will be coming soon , stay tuned and Enjoy !
CSS Sprites
CSS sprites save HTTP requests by using CSS positioning to selectively display composite background images .
To maximize accessibility and usability , CSS sprites are best used for icons or decorative effects .
CSS Rounded Corners
Rounded corners is one of the most popular and frequently requested CSS techniques .
There lots of ways to create rounded corners with CSS , but they always require lots of complex HTML and CSS .
Here are easy ways to achieve this effect .
Image Replacements Technique
Thierry Image Placement : Image Placement vs. Image Replacement ( FIR )
This technique is mostly for headlines by using CSS to replace normal HTML text , with a background image in order to achieve a particular look .
Several different image replacement methods have been proposed , each with their pros and cons .
when you need image replacement you can check the Gilder / Levin Method as described by Dave Shea or , if the replaced text is linked and CSS support for IE / Mac is required , the Gilder Levin Ryznar Jacoubsen IR method .
Sliding Doors
Sliding Doors of CSS introduced a new technique for creating visually stunning interface elements with simple , text - based , semantic markup .
Beautifully crafted , truly flexible interface components which expand and contract with the size of the text can be created if we use two separate background images .
Sliding Doors " Box– Rounded Corners for All–
The goal of this technique was to create rounded - corner boxes with visual flare and the absolute minimal amount of semantically correct markup .
While making sure they could resize while keeping their backgrounds intact .
Image Text Wrap Technique
How many times do you have an image floated left in a block of content , but want to keep that content from wrapping around your image ?
This technique allows you to wrap around image text flow control to emulate magazine style page layouts .
Equal Height Technique
One of the somewhat frustrating properties of CSS is the fact that elements only stretch vertically as far as they need to .
So how can we make all columns appear to be the same height ?
Several techniques was introduced to solve this issue .
Faux Columns–
The simple secret is to use a vertically tiled background image to create the illusion of colored columns .
Equal Height Columns – revisited – A method to make all columns appear to be the same height but without the need for faux column style background images .
Equal height boxes with CSS–
The trick is to use the CSS properties display : table , display : table - row and display : table - cell to make containers ( in this case div elements ) behave like table cells .
The basic XHTML structure looks like this : < div class = " equal " > < div class= " row " > < div class= " one " ></div > < div class = " two " ></div > < div class = " three " ></div > </div > </div>
Here is the CSS used to make this structure behave like a table :
.equal {
display : table ;
}
.row {
display : table - row ;
}
.row div {
display : table - cell ;
}
Turning A List Into A Navigation bar
Why use a list ?
Because a navigation bar , or menu , is a list of links .
The most semantic way of marking up a list of links is to use a list element .
Using a list also has the benefit of providing structure even if CSS is disabled .
Making Headlines With CSS
Headers in Web pages –marked up with h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , or h6 elements –help the reader determine the purpose of sections in content .
If your header is visually stimulating , the odds are better that the section will capture your reader ’s eye .

CSS Shadows Techniques
A technique to build flexible CSS drop shadows that can be applied to arbitrary block elements that can expand as the content of the block changes shape .
CSS Transparency
One of the trickiest things to control , in a CSS - driven design , is the transparency of the interaction between foreground and background content .
Below is a list of the best examples of the differing transparency approaches possible with CSS .
Partial Opacity –
Placing text over an image can sometimes make it difficult to read , but with Stu Nicholls ’s methods the background for the text is made ‘ opaque ’ using various methods of opacity ( including css3 ) and the black text is then quite readable .

And here we go again .
One Clinton aide yesterday derided Mr Obama ’s victories in " boutique " caucus states rather than the hardscrabble terrain of the rustbelt , saying : " Obama has won the small caucus states with the latte - sipping crowd .
They do n’t need a president , they need a feeling . "
Really , why do n't Clinton and McCain get a room already ?
They 're all using the same arguments .
Even if those arguments are so darn stupid .
The rust belt is ( from west to east ) the states bordering the great lakes : Wisconsin , Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York .
Of those states that have had a real contest , Obama won two ( WI and IL ) , Clinton won two ( OH , NY ) , IN and PA is pending , and MI is still trying to figure out how to have a real contest .
Not exactly dominant
And what the heck is up with the " latte - sipping " crap ?
Here 's the map , Obama states in Blue , Clinton states in Red ( because she and her campaign have fallen in love with right - wing McCain frames ) .
( And yes , I 'm giving Clinton Texas and Nevada for winning the popular vote in those states , even though she ultimately lost them in delegates ) :
I see latte - drinking states on Clinton 's camp -- California and New York !
What an idiotic way to insult a bunch of states .
And " boutique " states ?
Cute .
Again with the " only big states matter " b.s .
That 's why Obama is the far stronger national candidate .
He respects the entire country , not just a select few " pre-approved " and " sanctioned " Clinton states .
An assertion proven by the last SUSA poll , which proved not just a clearer path to the White House for Obama , but showed that he runs tighter even in states he loses .
That matters at the presidential level , forcing Republicans to spend meager resources defending supposedly safe territory .
And it matters at the state level , making it easier for federal and state candidates to overcome the disadvantages at the top of the ticket .
So looking at states with Senate races this fall , in Idaho , for example , it 's the difference between overcoming a 13 - point Obama deficit and a 36 - point Clinton deficit .
In Colorado , it 's the difference between overcoming a 6 - point Clinton loss , and riding a 9 - point Obama victory .
In Alaska , it 's the difference between overcoming a 5 - point Obama loss , and a 22 - point Clinton loss .
In Nebraska , it 's the difference between a 3 - point Obama loss , and a 27 - point Clinton loss .
In New Hampshire , it 's the difference between an 8 - point Clinton loss and 2 - point Obama victory .
In Oregon it 's the difference between a 5 - point Clinton loss , and a 8 - point Obama victory .
In Texas it 's the difference between a seven - point Clinton loss , and a 1 - point Obama loss .
In Wyoming , where we have a hot House at - large race , it 's the difference between a 33 - point Clinton loss and a 19 - point Obama loss , and same thing in Montana , it 's the difference between a 20 - point Clinton loss and an 8 - point Obama loss .
We have more at stake this fall than the presidency , and we have a candidate that is running nationwide and showing proper deference and respect for our great United States of America , and we have another that has given the middle finger to much of the country .
That 's why I 've become an enthusiastic Obama supporter after being detached for most of this race .
Because I 'm looking to the candidate who is building a national party , not the one that continues to disrespect most of it .
p.s. For fun , here 's the projected results of the rest of the primary contests per the CW , assuming new contests in Florida and Michigan :
Michigan and Indiana are the two tossups of the bunch .
NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - A mob torched a Kenyan church on Tuesday , killing about 30 villagers cowering inside , as the death toll from ethnic riots triggered by President Mwai Kibaki ’s disputed re-election approached 250 .
Fire engulfed a church near Eldoret town where hundreds of Kibaki ’s Kikuyu tribe had taken refuge in fear of their lives .
Witnesses said charred bodies , including women and children , were strewn about the smoldering ruins .
“ This is the first time in history that any group has attacked a church .
We never expected the savagery to go so far , ” police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said .
Kibaki was sworn in on Sunday after official election results showed he narrowly beat opposition leader Raila Odinga .
Both sides have accused the other of massive vote - rigging during the December 27 election .
The dispute ignited long - simmering tribal rivalries in one of Africa ’s most stable democracies and strongest economies .
World powers called for calm and urged the political opponents to “ exercise restraint ” and talk to each other .
Police and a senior security official said the blaze at the Kenya Assemblies of God Pentecostal church in western Kenya was deliberately started by a gang of youths .
Television pictures shot from a helicopter showed plumes of white smoke pouring from burning homesteads in the area .
Young men , some toting bows and arrows , manned roadblocks .
Residents and a security source said the victims had sought safety at the small church , about 8 km ( 5 miles ) from Eldoret .
“ Some youths came to the church , ” said a local reporter from the scene .
“ They fought with the boys who were guarding it , but they were overpowered and the youths set fire to the church . ”
Local media said 20 people suffered life - threatening burns .
The attack revived traumatic memories in east Africa of the slaughter in churches of tens of thousands of victims of Rwanda ’s 1994 genocide , and the mass suicide of hundreds of Ugandan cult members in a church fire in 2000 .
Police said more than 70,000 people had been displaced nationwide and about 170 killed .
Reuters reporters around Kenya estimated the death toll at around 250 .
Leading local newspaper , the Daily Nation , feared the country was on “ the verge of a complete meltdown ” .
Fuel prices rose sharply in Uganda , South Sudan , Rwanda and Burundi , all of which get petrol , diesel and other products from Kenyan ports .
THOUSANDS FLEE
Police were out in force in the capital on New Year ’s Day and Nairobi ’s streets were initially quieter , before violence erupted in the slums again as dusk fell .
Ghana ’s President John Kufor , the chairman of the African Union ( AU ) , is due in Kenya on Wednesday to meet Kibaki and “ discuss the current crisis ” , an AU spokesman said .

Washington had first congratulated Kibaki , then switched to expressing “ concerns about irregularities ” .
Former colonial power Britain , the European Union and others pointedly avoided congratulating Kibaki .
Instead , they expressed concern , urged reconciliation and a probe into suspected voting irregularities .
“ The 2007 general elections have fallen short of key international and regional standards for democratic elections , ” the EU observer mission said in its formal assessment .
Western diplomats shuttled between both sides , trying to start mediation .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called Kibaki and his opposition rival Raila Odinga .
“ The government thinks they can wait this out , but we ’re not convinced , ” one diplomat in Nairobi told Reuters .

The Eldoret area where the church massacre took place is multi-ethnic but traditionally dominated by the Kalenjin tribe .
It suffered ethnic violence in 1992 and 1997 when hundreds of mainly Kikuyus were killed and thousands more displaced .
A senior security official in Rift Valley said that as many as 15,000 people were now sheltering from the violence in churches and police stations in Eldoret .
He blamed the opposition for incitement .
“ We have lived together for years , we ’ve intermarried , we have children , but now they ’ve asked them to turn against them , ” the security official said .
“ We do n’t do this in Kenya .
It is what happens in Yugoslavia and Sudan . ”
An Irish Catholic priest in Eldoret , Father Paul Brennan , told Reuters vigilante gangs were roaming the streets .
“ Houses are being burned .
It is too dangerous to go outside and count the dead , ” he said .
“ The churches are full .
There are four to five thousand in the main cathedral . ”
Most deaths have come from police firing at protesters , witnesses say , prompting accusations from rights groups and the opposition that Kibaki had made Kenya a “ police state ” .

It began in the days before the belly and the beer that made it , when I was a high school wrestler .
My prize for making weight was two hours to ingest as much as I could before getting my ass kicked .
I found Cheese n Stuff , which stood out not just because it was old and weathered in new , prefab Phoenix but because it had all these weird foods -- pickled things , things in aluminum tubes , headcheese .
A father and son -- Stan Zawatski , middle - aged , and Emil , his father -- were behind the counter .
This was my creation : a hoagie roll , split wide and topped with Boars Head turkey , Muenster , and lettuce , dressed with ribbons of tomato and hot peppers , deli mustard for zing , avocado for lubrication .
I ate it at the gym before my match .
Then again before my next .
I went the week after that , twice .
Then I quit wrestling , and on good weeks had it every other day .
I ate it before the first concert I drove to with friends , and on graduation day .
After a few months , I didnt have to order anymore .
Just enter and smile , a nod between priest and supplicant .
Or call first , get Stans daughter on the phone -- Tell your dad Tylers coming in , okay ?

The pickles slay me .
The other components of the McRib -- sauce , meat , onions , bun -- are straight outta barbecue antiquity .
But the pickles are an unexpected wacko touch .
Is that how they do it in . . . what , Kansas City ?
Because I grew up an active citizen of fast - food nation , this is what my palate has been calibrated to want : the overdetermined tang of the sauce , meat that tastes slightly of the mixing vat , the grace note of those pickles .
I look forward to its occasional rerelease , because however artificial , it tastes like the real thing to me .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A spacecraft whizzed past Saturn ’s moon Enceladus on Wednesday and through a huge geyser spurting from its south pole , collected samples of ice and gas shooting about 500 miles into space .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Scientists involved in the joint U.S. - European mission are hoping observations and samples collected by the Cassini spacecraft will enable them to better understand one of the most dramatic geological features of the entire solar system .
Geysers reminiscent of the famed Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park in the United States -- only on a massive scale -- are shooting continuously off Enceladus at about 900 miles per hour ( 1,450 kph ) .
It is one of about 60 moons of Saturn .
Some scientists think the source of the geysers may be heated liquid water -- perhaps even an ocean -- under the frozen surface of Enceladus ( pronounced en- SELL - ah - dus ) .
The geysers may also be the source of the particles in one of Saturn ’s rings .
Amanda Hendrix , a scientist involved in the mission from NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , said Cassini was passing as close as 30 miles above the surface , although not that close around the geysers .
Hendrix said Cassini was about 120 miles above the moon ’s surface as it flew through the edge of a plume erupting from the south pole .
Hendrix said its findings were not immediately available , but preliminary results could be made public on Thursday .
“ We will measure ice particles and vapor , and different kinds of gases -- water vapor for sure , and we ’ll see what other kinds of gases are present , ” Hendrix said .
Cassini ’s instruments will try to determine the density , size , composition and speed of the gas and particles shooting off the surface .
In addition to ice , the plumes seem to contain carbon dioxide , methane and ammonia in small amounts .
The possibility of heated water has some scientists wondering whether Enceladus might harbor conditions that could support life , even if only microbial organisms .
Liquid water is thought to be a necessary ingredient for life .
“ If there is hot , liquid water under the surface , then that does bring in the question of whether life could exist there , ” Hendrix said .
“ Since we ’re sensing the composition of the plume , really what we ’re sensing is the composition of the sub - surface region -- because the gas and the particles are coming from underneath the surface , ” Hendrix added .
Enceladus , with a diameter of 310 miles , is one of the solar system ’s brightest objects .
Encased in ice , it reflects almost 100 percent of the sunlight that strikes it .
It is one of Saturn ’s innermost moons .
The U.S. space agency does not believe that flying through the plume posed much threat to the spacecraft because the particles are so small .
Cassini often passes through regions made up of dust - size particles in its ongoing mission around Saturn .
Cassini in 2005 revealed for the first time that geysers were erupting off Enceladus .
The spacecraft is due to fly by Enceladus three more times in 2008 .

IGE is one of the largest virtual currency and service providers for MMORPGs .
Until 2006 , the secondary market had been dominated by IGE - ever since they acquired MySuperSales back in January 2004 .
According to their website , the company is located in Hong Kong , but previous office locations include Spain , Switzerland , US , and China , making IGE a true global player .
Recently , IGE have been losing ground according to Alexa 's web traffic history over the past 3 years .
Their main website , IGE.com , is ranked at 41,823 on Alexa and 35,795 on Compete .
While there was a loss of customers , the website is still popular compared to other big sellers such as Swagvault and Thsale whose rankings in Alexa are 40,330 and 47,853 respecitively .
IGE are also falling out of favor with their customers .
Bizrate 's customer satisfaction score is down to 6.9 with many customers having filed complaints on Complaintsboard.com
What 's the story behind the spectacular rise and fall of this post - dotcom adventure ?
We tried to shed some light on the company and find out what happened .
The company was founded by Brock Pierce and Alan Debonneville .
Brock , a child celebrity , moved to Spain after his previous company , Digital Entertainment Network flopped .
He became an avid EverQuest player and met Alan in the Twelve Prophets guild on the Vallon Zek server .
Both recognized the potential of the secondary market with people looking for ways to obtain virtual swords other than having to spend hours earning them .
The idea gave birth to IGE ( Internet Gaming Entertainment ) and their first trading website called Eqnetgaming .com in 2001 Incorporated in Spain , the company was funded using Brock 's own savings .
In 2003 , the company expanded and incorporated more offices in the founders ' places of residence .
An office for Alan in Switzerland and IGE Inc. in the US were added to the office in Marbella , Spain .
The company maintained their offices around the world for a while , until later that year they moved to their new headquarters in Kowloon , Hong Kong
At the time Jonathan Yantis ' MySuperSales had been dominating the RMT market for some time .
Although IGE 's sales figures never surpassed those of MySuperSales , competition between the two companies started to heat up as IGE gained more and more market share .
Both IGE.IGE and MySuperSales were looking for ways to reach more customers .
Within weeks , every single major community web board was approached and offered purchase or partnership deals .
Competition for community sites peaked with the Interealms deal , when the owner backed out of a signed and payed deal with Yantis to go with an offer from IGE instead .
Apart from being busy with acquisitions , IGE hired the Themis Group to implement worldwide customer marketing campaigns possibly involving their game media network , Warcry .
It was also rumored that building up relationships with game developers was part of the deal .
The agreement lasted only 60 days before it was terminated as Themis began to fear for their reputation .
Suddenly it was announced that IGE had purchased MySuperSales .
On January 22 , 2004 , IGE became the juggernaut of the secondary market .
The deal was said to involve cash and equity but the value was undisclosed .
Jonathan Yantis became the biggest shareholder in IGE and took up a management role in IGE .
The merger created a monopoly in the market .
The company was led by Brock Pierce ( CEO ) , Jonathan Yantis ( COO ) , Alan Debonneville ( President ) and Randy Maslow ( General Counsel ) .
Rumors about IGE trying to improve relationships with game publishers spread as the company hired high profile management executives from Vivendi Universal Games , Yahoo ! and The Firm .
The most notable recruit was Stephen Salyer , former President of Business Development at Ubisoft and Vice President at EA .
It almost worked out : IGE was very close to license in - game exchange platforms with at least 5 MMOG titles .
Pre -hype Second Life was one of them .
However , nothing major came out of this as some game developers got cold feet while Linden Labs decided to create their own exchange market .
IGE 's effort to reach gamers by acquiring more community sites continued in 2004 .
RPG Holdings , LLC . was created to cover IGE 's identity from the public so that bought out websites would not be directly associated with IGE as easily .
A popular Lineage 2 community , L2orphus.com , was bought .
A small media network for MMORPGs , Ogaming , was the next target .
Ogaming is a hub of many subsites for different game communities .
Although the owner , Okratas , labeled IGE as an " undesirable " company , Ogaming was sold .
Okratas explained that he sold the site because he was frustrated with the lack of support from game publishing companies .
Thottbot , the most popular database of user submitted game information for World of Warcraft at the time , agreed to acquisition in secrecy .
However , rumors began to circulate on websites like Allakhazam , CorpNews , Grimwell , and Slashdot and the deal was soon out in the open .
Users were concerned about the Cosmos plugin from Thottbot collecting data and feeding it straight to the gold farmers .
People started to investigate on IGE and its affiliates , and after Thottbot was exposed , soon other sites like Guild - Hall.net , Warcraftcentral.com , Rpgexpert.com , Shadowknight.org and Mmorpg.net followed .
RPG
Holdings became known as proxy of IGE and the owner of a large collection of MMO - fansites .
The next infamous acquisition of IGE in the form of RPG Holdings was Allakhazam .
Allakhazam claims the deal happened in February , 2006 instead of the speculated date of November 2005 .
The owner was holding out strongly against RMT and IGE before he succumbed to the offer .
The justification was that Allakhazam sold not to IGE , but to RPG Holdings , which owned several other businesses ( including IGE .
Announcing the Zam.com Network in May 2006 , Allakhazam became part of a new network of game content websites - together with Thottbot , OGaming , MMOInterface and L2 Orphus .
IGE 's influence was played down with it being labeled just another subsidiary of RPG Holdings .
Affinity Media came to the public 's attention when it took over several businesses such as the Zam Network , IGE and other overseas operations : Itemmania , the second largest auction house in Korea was acquired in August 2006 , as well as GamesTV , a cable TV channel dedicated to games in China .
The company purchased another popular World of Warcraft database , Wowhead , in June 2007 and added it to the Zam Network .
The announcement claimed that IGE was sold off to a private investor before the acquistion of Wowhead and therefore had no associations with Affinity and the Zam Network .
According to Affinity , any connection to IGE would hurt the company 's image so it was decided to sell IGE back to Jonathan Yantis .
However , rumors and evidence has surfaced that in fact IGE is not a sold - off subsidiary , but actually the real owner of Affinity .
Despite all the exposition and media attention IGE received through these high profile acquisitions , trouble started mounting within the company , especially at the back - end operation site in China .
Gold suppliers had been left unpaid for their services .
The company began losing its credibility and supply chain .
Things got out of hand , there was even a rumor that an upset gold farmer stormed into IGE 's Shanghai office with a gun , holding an employee hostage .
This was later dismissed by IGE .
In China , rumors spread that IGE was going bankrupt , that major shareholders were planning to run away and that investors ' money was being transferred out of reach to a Swiss bank account .
Eventually , the website IGE.com.cn went offline IGE 's downfall received a lot of attention , especially in China .
Many people including reporters bloggers and analysts attempted to explain what factors drove IGE to their financial crisis .
Nobody was able to present any hard evidence , but the following issues are likely to have contributed to the company 's downfall :
IGE 's revival
ige.com.cn was last seen online on May 19 , 2007 before the operation resumed on another website .
1337.com.cn took over all activities including buying gold from suppliers .
The move was the result of an intervention by former shareholders of IGE .
According to the press release at the IGE.com.cn website , Atlas Technology Group was established by former shareholders who were not satisfied with the direction in which the company was moving under Affinity management .
Atlas acquired IGE on April 5 , 2007 .
This announcement confirms the comment made on Allakhazam that Jonathan Yantis bought back IGE .
Furthermore , the announcement stated that Atlas would not be responsible for Affinity 's obligations before the acquisition .
This was an especially noteworthy fact since Affinity had a long queue of 8,095 suppliers waiting for their payment .
It meant Affinity would be held responsible for paying out IGE 's debt .
IGE Today
Today , IGE has a new cover .
It is now owned by the Atlas Technology Group .
Properties of IGE include the IGE trademark that has been transferred from IGE Inc. , Hong Kong to Atlas .
Websites such as IGE.com , eqnetgaming.com , mmoshop.com are now registered to Atlas Technology Group .
The company was incorporated in Vanuatu .
As a virtual business friendly and tax free environment , Vanuatu is a perfect destination for businesses like IGE .
They no longer have any obligation to report their income or pay any taxes .
Furthermore , the company receives protections from Vanuatu 's electronic transaction , e-business , and interactive gaming legislation .
According to a recent job posting , the company has around 400 employees working in subsidiaries located in the Philippines , Hong Kong and Shanghai .
Senior Vice President Raoul Blautzik used to be an operation manager in Hong Kong .
IGE has transformed itself once more and aims to redevelop the company to reclaim the industry leader position .

( Fortune ) --
At a breakfast in New York last week , Jim Press , vice chairman and president of Chrysler LLC made the startling announcement that every single new Chrysler , Dodge , and Jeep is being engineered so that it can be adapted for a gas- electric hybrid powertrain .
That 's a huge change for technologically challenged Chrysler , which currently markets only two gas - electric hybrid vehicles - both of them equipped with technology developed by General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) .
In fact , Press 's statement is the most sweeping endorsement of hybrid vehicles by any manufacturer - Toyota included - and it represents a huge reversal in attitude toward hybrids .
Scorned as uneconomical curiosities only a few years ago , they are now solidly in the mainstream .
Whereas 13 hybrid models were for sale in 2007 , there are , by one count , expected to be more than 60 available by 2011 .
GM announced this week that it will offer at least 16 hybrid models by 2012 .
Aside from escalating gas prices and concerns about global warming , the changing attitudes toward hybrids is being driven by rapid developments in the batteries used to power them .
Not long ago , batteries seemed trapped in the 19th century , a mature technology that was n't progressing very quickly .
But both established battery makers and ambitious startups are pushing battery development at once unimaginable speeds .
Replacing nickel - metal hydride batteries , the kind that are used in the Toyota Prius , are lithium - ion batteries , first designed for such applications as laptop computers and cell phones .
Lithium -ion batteries provide twice the power , energy density , and cycle life of nickel metal - hydride , but less than half the weight and size , and half the cost .
Last week Mercedes Benz claimed a major breakthrough , announcing it will use lithium - ion batteries in its upcoming S - class hybrid , according to Automotive News .
Due to go on sale in Europe in mid-2009 and the United States shortly thereafter , the vehicle , known as the S400 Bluetec Hybrid , is said to produce nearly 300 horsepower along with fuel economy of nearly 30 miles per gallon .
Mercedes ' announcement is the first of a production model hybrid by powered by lithium - ion .
Mercedes ' partner in the development of the batteries is Johnson Controls ( JCI , Fortune 500 ) - Saft , and the batteries will be made in France and then assembled into modules .
Not to be outdone , GM said it will use lithium - ion batteries , developed by Hitachi , in its next generation of hybrids , due to reach the market in 2012 .
That 's in addition to the lithium - ion batteries being developed by two other suppliers , including A123 systems , for its Chevrolet Volt plug - in hybrid .
Other automakers are in the hunt .
Nissan has set up a joint venture with NEC , and Toyota is working with Matsushita .
Another arrival to the lithium - ion party is Ener1 , based in Fort Lauderdale , which claims to make the safest lithium - ion battery in the world because of its simple thermal management system .
It also may be the only one manufactured in the United States .
Ener1 was one of more than a dozen companies screened by GM for its
Volt plug - in electric car but did n't make the cut .
Since then , it has signed a $ 70 million contract to provide batteries to Think Electric , a producer of all - electric cars based in Norway .
You may recall that Think Electric was owned for a brief time by Ford Motor Co ( F , Fortune 500 ) .
during the Jacques Nasser era .
Now it is independent again , and has plans to market a tiny , two - seat electric car this year .
Instead of resembling a golf cart , the new version looks like the kind of minicar that wealthy grandparents buy for their grandchildren .
Think believes that it can sell 10,000 of these vehicles over the next two years .
Those efforts got a boost today with the announcement that General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) is investing in both Think and A123 systems ( yes , the one that 's working with GM , too ) to develop batteries for electric cars .
Think is thinking bigger :
At the Geneva auto show it showed off a larger electric vehicle - one that seats five people and is closer to the size of a sport utility vehicle .
Ener1 says that it and A123 systems will split the initial orders for the small Think electric car .
Somehow , an electric sport utility vehicle seems like a step backward in the fight against global warming .
But it 's another sign that high - performance batteries are about to enter the mainstream .
Visitors to TorrentSpy are now being greeted with a brief message announcing the BitTorrent tracker 's closure effective March 24 .
The shutdown comes in the wake of a December 2007 court decision that went against TorrentSpy , in which a federal judge awarded the MPAA a default judgment after finding that the site 's admins systematically destroyed evidence .
" We have decided on our own , not due to any court order or agreement , to bring the TorrentSpy.com search engine to an end and thus we permanently closed down worldwide on March 24 , 2008 , " reads the announcement at the site .
The TorrentSpy team calls the legal climate for copyright and privacy " simply too hostile , " saying that the court 's demands left it unable to adequately protect its users ' privacy .
In a statement , the MPAA took issue with TorrentSpy 's take on its decision to close up shop .
" TorrentSpy 's characterization of the site ’s closure as a voluntary decision conveniently ignores the fact that after two years of intense litigation by the major Hollywood studios , a federal court found TorrentSpy liable for copyright infringement , " said John Malcolm , director of worldwide anti-piracy operations for the MPAA .
Malcolm called the closure a " clear victory " for Big Content , noting that the site 's operators are on the hook for millions of dollars .
TorrentSpy 's farewell message to its users
The MPAA sued TorrentSpy and a handful of other BitTorrent portals in February 2006 as part of its ongoing crackdown against illicit P2P traffic .
TorrentSpy fought back tooth and nail , filing a countersuit against the MPAA in May 2006 for conspiracy and invasion of privacy .
In the meantime , the site 's admins were frantically trying to cover their tracks , destroying documents and other incriminating evidence , according to court filings .
As the case inched forward , Judge Florence - Marie Cooper ordered TorrentSpy to begin logging the IP addresses of users .
Her reasoning was that since the IP addresses were temporarily present in the server 's RAM , they could be logged and handed over to the MPAA .
After the ruling TorrentSpy began filtering copyrighted content , later blocking searches from US IP addresses .
Shutting TorrentSpy down and potentially getting a nine - figure judgment against the site 's operators ( good luck collecting ) is a small victory for the MPAA , but the group knows that there 's still a long fight ahead .
" Look , this is an uphill battle , " Malcolm told Ars in an interview earlier this week .
" Content providers can't afford to sit by and do nothing .
We 've seen some successes , but there is lots of work ahead of us . "
Indeed there is .
Although its admins are under indictment , The Pirate Bay continues to thumb its nose at Big Content , with Peter Sunde telling Ars that Swedish law is on The Pirate Bay 's side .
Earlier this week , a lawsuit against an Icelandic torrent site was dismissed , and many other torrent sites continue to operate with impunity outside of the US , beyond of the reach of the MPAA 's attempts to knock them off the ' Net ... so far .
Turning ISPs into copyright cops looks to be the MPAA 's best bet , but the group faces a long , uphill battle to make that a reality .
It would require ISPs to filter , and , in all likelihood , turn of the ' Net connections of recidivists as is planned in France .
ISPs are less than enthusiastic about the prospect , with AT&T the only major ISP to say that it plans to begin filtering traffic .
Others , like Verizon , are publicly dismissive of the idea .
Olbermann : Bush attacks on MoveOn and Democrats are ' pissy , juvenile ' Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday September 20 , 2007
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann had a searing " Special Comment " for President Bush and his press conference denunciations yesterday of MoveOn.org and Democrats who refused to condemn the liberal group 's recent ad criticizing Gen. David Petraeus .
The president was , according to Olbermann , " behaving a little more than usual like we'd all interrupted him while he was watching his favorite cartoons on the DVR . "
After criticizing Bush for sidestepping substantive issues at the press conference in " condescending and infuriating fashion , " Olbermann zeroed in on the final moments of the Q&A , which he called " a big , wow political finish that indicates , certainly that if it was not already , the annual Republican witch - hunting season is underway . "
" Most importantly , making that the last question ? "
Olbermann asked about a question from reporter Bill Sammon , who asked what the president thought of the MoveOn ads .
" A plant , so that there was no chance at a follow - up and so nobody could point out ... that you were the one who inappropriately injected Gen .
Petraeus into the political dialogue of this nation in the first place . "
" Deliberately , pre-meditatively and virtually without precedent , " he continued , " you shanghaied a military man as your personal spokesman and now you 're complaining about the outcome -- and then running away from the microphone . "
Olbermann also played tape of a television ad from the Republican National Committee - - originally aired 19 days before the 2006 mid-term elections -- which featured a quote from terrorist Ayman al - Zawahiri claiming he had acquired " suitcase bombs . "
The ad concluded with an image of an explosion , followed by the text , " These are the stakes .
Vote on November 7 . "
" That one was OK , Mr. Bush ? " Olbermann asked .
" Terrorizing your own people in hopes of getting them to vote for your own party has never brought as much as a public comment from you . "
" But a shot at Gen. Petraeus ... that merits this pissy , juvenile blast at the Democrats on national television ? "
" Your hypocrisy is so vast , sir , " the host accused Bush , " that if you could somehow use it to fill the ranks in Iraq , you could realize your dream and keep us fighting there until the year 3000 . "

An internal memo from Canada ’s Foreign Affairs and Internal Trade ministry , obtained by World Net News under the Access to Information Act , documents the agenda at the most recent secret summit meeting of the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) in Montebello , Quebec , held on August 20 - 21 , 2007 .
The central activity of the meeting was to figure out a way to get the American people to swallow the idea of the collaboration leading to the North American Union , and to squelch the growing criticism surrounding it .
Present at the meeting were U.S. President George Bush , Mexico ’s President Felipe Calderon , and Canada ’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
The SPP consists of 20 working groups plus the attending cabinet officers from each country and the heads of state .
Also present were members of the North American Competitiveness Council ( NACC ) , the only participants invited to meet behind closed doors with the SPP bureaucrats .
The NACC is a largely secretive advisory council to the SPP consisting of representatives from 30 North American corporations selected by the Chambers of Commerce in the three nations .
The NACC issued no press releases disclosing specific recommendations made to them by the SPP trilateral working groups tasked with “ integrating ” and “ harmonizing ” administrative rules and regulations into a unified North American format .
However , the memo documents that the NACC was urged to launch a public relations campaign to counter growing criticism of the trilateral cooperative that is seen by many as a major step toward the North American Union , see ( http://www.naturalnews.com/022707.html) .
“ Leaders had a successful meeting with the members of the NACC , which had been launched at the leader ’s meeting in Cancun in March 2006 , to counsel governments on how they might enhance North American competitiveness , ” the memo begins .
As discussion continues , the members of the NACC were urged to “ assist in confronting and refuting critics of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ” .
According to paragraph four of the memo , the public relations theme continued during the meeting .
“ In closing , all leaders expressed a desire for the NACC to play a role in articulating publicly the benefits of greater collaboration in North America . ”
Further on , according to the memo , “ Leaders discussed some of the difficulties of the SPP , including the lack of popular support and the failure of the public to understand the competitive challenges confronting North America . ”
The memo continues , “ Governments are faced with addressing the rapidly evolving competitive environment without fueling protectionism , when industry sectors face radical transformation . ”
The memo documents a comment by the U.S. President .
“ In terms of building public support , President Bush suggested engaging the support of those who had benefited from NAFTA and from North American Integration ( including small business owners ) to tell their stories and humanize the impressive results . ”
Regarding import safety , the document says , “ President Bush underlined the importance of tackling the issue more broadly and showing that governments are ahead of this issue in order to prevent a trade protectionist backlash , especially against China . ”
The memo again reinforces the public relations theme , emphasizing , “ NACC members should have a role in communicating the merits of North American collaboration , including by engaging their employees and unions . ”
Meanwhile , a policy of secret , closed - door meetings where the press and the public is not invited to participate or observe the process continues to characterize meetings of the SPP and trilateral working groups .
A meeting of the SPP that was virtually unreported in the U.S. and Canada on February 27 - 28 , 2008 in Los Cabos , Mexico , was disclosed in the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada .
According to the newspaper , the Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez visited Mexico City prior to the Los Cabos meeting “ to renegotiate NAFTA ” by offering the information to Mexico that undisclosed U.S. corporations and the U.S. government are planning to place as much as $ 141 billion in new investments in Mexico under the Mexico National Infrastructure Project 2007 - 2012 .
In a press release published February 21 on the U.S. Trade and Development Agency website , the agenda for the February 26 - 28 meeting in Mexico City was presented .
At this meeting Secretary Gutierrez planned to announce United States Trade and Development Agency ( USTDA ) grants totaling more than $ 1.7 million made “ to promote the development of transportation , energy and environmental projects under Mexico ’s National Infrastructure Program ” .
Another press release on the USTDA website documents the launching by President Calderon of Mexico ’s National Infrastructure Program in July , 2008 .
Its goal is to create $ 141 billion dollars worth of new infrastructure investment opportunities for U.S. firms by 2012 .
An announcement posted on the homepage of the Department of Commerce ’s SPP website on Feb. 28 confirmed that Gutierrez and Department of Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff traveled to Los Cabos to meet with ministers from Mexico and Canada in preparation for the fourth SPP annual summit meeting to be held in New Orleans on April 21 - 22 .
This SPP press release also confirmed the presence of the NACC at the Los Cabos closed - door meeting .
Other important points disclosed in a Foreign Affairs and Internal Trade document obtained under the Access to Information request include :
* The concern that the Harper government intended to downplay the SPP summits as part of a strategy to defuse the intense criticism the effort has received from Canada ’s political left .
* Prime Minister Harper ’s description of the SPP as a worthwhile project driving many low - profile , but important initiatives .
* And Harper ’s recommendation that each government appoint a single lead minister with overall responsibility for managing the trilateral bureaucrats involved in the 20 SPP working groups , and the “ prosperity minister ” in each country being tasked with this responsibility .
Prior to the release of this document , the three governments had not clearly explained the tasks or areas of responsibilities of each of the three ministers assigned , to the SPP in the U.S. Canada and Mexico .
As it now appears , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , the foreign minister representative in the U.S. , and her counterparts in Mexico and Canada represent the top state - level officials of the three countries .
This designation clearly places the SPP at the top foreign policy diplomatic level in each country .
Commerce Secretary Gutierrez and his counterparts will be considered “ SPP Prosperity Ministers ” , with Secretary Chertoff and his counterparts considered “ SPP Security Ministers ” .
Overall management of the SPP would fall under the “ Prosperity Ministers ' ” sphere .
The document also discloses President Bush ’s continuing determination to have only a virtual fence , not the placement of a physical barrier , along the U.S. border with Mexico .
“ President Bush outlined his vision of the border , with a strong emphasis on the use of technology ” .
According to a previous World New News report , an amendment by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson , R - Texas , gutted the Secure Fence Act of 2006 , by leaving the building of a 700 mile double layer fence along the border with Mexico up to the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security and Chertoff .

LAS VEGAS  Nevada ’s state teachers union and six Las Vegas area residents filed a lawsuit late Friday that could make it harder for many members of the state ’s huge hotel workers union to vote in the hotly contested Jan. 19 Democratic caucus in Nevada .
The 13 - page lawsuit in federal district court here comes two days after the 60,000 - member Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Nevada endorsed Senator Barack Obama , a blow to Mrs. Clinton .
Mr. Obama addressed the Culinary Union at their hall earlier Friday .
The lawsuit argues that the Nevada Democratic Party ’s decision , decided late last year , to create at - large precincts inside nine Las Vegas resorts on caucus day violates the state ’s election laws and creates a system in which voters at the at - large precincts can elect more delegates than voters at other precincts .
The lawsuit employs a complex mathematical formula to show that voters at the other 1,754 precincts would have less influence with their votes .
The at - large precincts are being established because thousands of hotel workers cannot leave work to participate in the midday caucuses in their home precincts .
The Nevada State Education Association has said it would not endorse any Democrat , but some of its top officials have endorsed Mrs. Clinton .
The association ’s deputy executive director , Debbie Cahill , for instance , was a founding member of Senator Clinton ’s Nevada Women ’s Leadership Council .

The brief disruption occurred as Liu Qi , president of the Beijing Organizing Committee , was addressing thousands of spectators and dignitaries at the site of the ancient Olympic Games .
It was broadcast live by Greek television , but China state television cut away to a prerecorded scene .
The Athens chapter of the rights group Reporters Without Borders said three of its members had staged the protest .

My own skin frequently blushes and swells .
I have dermatographia , a condition in which one ’s immune system exhibits hypersensitivity , via skin , that releases excessive amounts of histamine , causing capillaries to dilate and welts to appear ( lasting about thirty minutes ) when the skin ’s surface is lightly scratched .

MARSHALLTOWN , Iowa – In John Edwards ’ America , no issue matters so much as the fight between you and the system .
Speaking this weekend to a crowd of roughly 150 mostly elderly Iowans in the Charles City ( pop. 7,812 ) town library , Edwards tied every one of the Democrats ’ bread and butter issues to a singular idea — ” This system is corrupt .
And it ’s rigged .
And it ’s rigged against you . ”
“ There are huge issues facing America , ” the former senator said , standing in front of a massive American flag and a smaller Iowa state flag .
“ We have a dysfunctional health care system , desperately needs reform .
We have huge issues with social security .
The prescription drug law under Medicare .
We ’ve got issues with protecting our planet from global warming .
Extraordinary economic inequality . ”
Here he pauses , then speaks slowly , his southern drawl becoming more pronounced with each syllable .
“ But whatever the positions of the candidates on these issues , I want to make it very clear where I stand .
I do n’t think we can change these things unless we do something to change this system . ”
In packaging his stump speech this way , Edwards passes on the opportunity to feed his audiences the red meat that conventional wisdom and the polls suggest they want .
He does n’t discuss Iraq for longer than a few sentences .
He hits the Bush administration for its warmongering on Iran , but only as an addendum .
He does n’t even describe the details of his universal health insurance plan .
Instead , standing in jeans and a blue sport coat , he asks attendees why they think America does n’t already have such a plan .
“ Drug companies , insurance companies , and their lobbyists in Washington DC , ” he says .
“ It ’s that simple .
Really . ”
Every other ill is tied to the system as well .
The prescription drug law , Blackwater , crippling student loans , social security , the pathetic rebuilding of New Orleans — ” nothing will happen until we change this corrupt system . ”
The system is n’t George Bush ’s doing , so a change - the - party solution wo n’t suffice .
At each stop , Edwards repeats , “ Do you really believe that if we replace a crowd of corporate Republicans with a crowd of corporate Democrats that anything meaningful is going to change ? ”
And by corporate Democrat , he means only one of his rivals .
In his second appearance of the day at the town civic center in Waverly ( pop. 8,968 ; flag count : one giant and two large American flags ) , Edwards offered this , “ The presidential candidate who has raised the most money from Washington lobbyists is not a Republican .
It ’s a Democrat .
The candidate who has raised the most money from the health industry — insurance companies and drug companies — is not a Republican .
It is a Democrat … .
And the candidate who has raised the most money from the defense industry , is not a Republican .
It is a Democrat .
And all those descriptions fit the same candidate .
They ’re all Senator Clinton . ”
That ’s the dominant angle of attack Edwards uses on the Democratic frontrunner , who ’s recent stumbles perhaps emboldens him to continue on the offensive .
It is n’t the attack du jour — that Clinton equivocates and speaks out of both sides of her mouth , the latest example coming in last week ’s debate when she voiced approval for a plan for driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants , only to pivot moments later when she said she does n’t support such a plan .
Though his campaign released a video attacking Clinton for what it called “ The Politics of Parsing , ” Edwards uttered only one sentence on the incident in his three events Saturday —
” You ca n’t answer a yes or no question , yes and no . ”
Instead , the attack is that Clinton is complicit in a “ rotten ” system .
The charge is a legitimate one .
According to opensecrets.org only $ 20 of the more than $ 30 million Edwards has raised has come from Political Action Committees ( PACs ) , and lobbyists , as an industry , are n’t in the top 20 industries donating to his campaign .
On the other hand , Clinton has received roughly $ 750,000 from PACs and more than $ 500,000 from lobbyists .
But the charge is also an inevitable one .
There is so little that distinguishes the leading Democratic candidates on the issues that attacks on political maneuvering are the only attacks possible .
All three , Edwards , Clinton , and Barack Obama , support universal health care , comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship , rebuilding America ’s reputation overseas , and ending the war in Iraq .
The struggle to convince voters that , when all candidates more or less present the same platform , they ought not go with the one with the most experience , requires a campaign that bemoans politics as usual and chides those who perpetuate it .
This rhetoric also makes it feel like Edwards is playing doubles with Obama .
The senator from Illinois is famously running a campaign that indicts the system in Washington .
Though Obama decries partisanship far more frequently than Edwards , he has said repeatedly that Americans feel politics is an “ insiders ’ game . ”
He wants to “ challenge the status quo and get results . ”
It is a different message than Edwards ’ on the margins , but is substantially similar .
On his Saturday stops , the third at the University of Northern Iowa , Edwards spoke charitably of Obama , echoing his message of hope .
“ You have the ability to help create change , ” he tells his audiences .
Edwards poses the “ great moral test of our generation ” this way : “ Will we get the power in this democracy out of the hands of the few , and the rich , and the powerful , and will we put it back your hands ? ”
Yes , he says .
“ We can do it . ”

Haile Gebrselassie has pulled out of the
Olympic marathon because of the threat posed to
his health by air pollution , raising concerns that
other top runners may also quit the Beijing race .
The Ethiopian marathon world record holder — an
asthmatic — said the 26 - mile race was too much of
a risk , although he will still run in the 10,000 metres .
His dramatic withdrawal is a huge embarrassment
for the Chinese authorities and they will now be worried
that other athletes — including women 's world
record holder Paula Radcliffe , who also suffers
from the respiratory disease — will follow suit .
Radcliffe , who last week withdrew from the London
marathon due to injury , has said she may have
to change medication to prevent an asthma attack
during the Beijing race in August .
Gebrselassie said : " The pollution in China is a
threat to my health and it would be difficult for me
to run 42 km in my current condition .
" But I am not pulling out of the Olympic event
in Beijing altogether .
I plan to participate in the
10,000 - metre event . "
Saying that pollution " would be a hazard to athletes ,
seriously affecting their performances " , Gebrselassie called on China to deal
with the problem .
Last year , tennis champion Justine
Henin said she would not be defending
her title because as an asthmatic she
considered conditions too dangerous .
Smog fear : Gebrselassie seen here winning in Berling , will not be racing in Beijing
The International Olympic
Committee have reacted to concerns
over athletes ' health by warning
Games organisers that events in
outdoor endurance sports such as the
marathon and cycling distance
races may have to be postponed .
Medical experts from the IOC
will continue to monitor air
quality and weather reports
and reserve the right to delay
these events by several hours , but the
IOC are now satisfied that events will
not have to be moved to another day .
Beijing authorities have invested
large sums in anti-pollution measures ,
including moving factories out of the city
centre and taking a third of the city 's three
million cars off the road .
However , pollution levels in Beijing were
measured at 12 times the levels
recommended by the World Health
Organisation last December .
Such is the concern about pollution
that the British Olympic Association
have had special face masks —
thought to be opposed by the IOC —
developed for athletes .
However
the BOA have yet to decide
whether they will back the
masks being used in training or
competition in Beijing .
A BOA spokeswoman said : " We have
a strategy in place that looks at the
environmental problem in Beijing
and we are confident that if the
situation becomes too bad for
athletes then the IOC will take
measures to deal with that . "
Does this really come as a surprise ?
“ There ’s been some overreaction to the new technology , especially when it comes to the danger that strangers represent , ” said Janis Wolak , a sociologist at the Crimes against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire in Durham .
“ Actually , Internet - related sex crimes are a pretty small proportion of sex crimes that adolescents suffer , ” Wolak added , based on three nationwide surveys conducted by the center .
[…]
In an article titled “ Online ‘ Predators ’ and Their Victims , ” which appears Tuesday in American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association , Wolak and co-researchers examined several fears that they concluded are myths :
Guthrie argued that parliamentary approval would mean intelligence had to be shared with MPs ; that the other side could not be taken by surprise ( " do you want to warn the enemy you are going to do it ? " ) , and that commanders should have " a choice about when to attack and when not to attack " .
Tebbit maintained that " no prime minister would be able to deploy forces without being able to command a parliamentary majority .
In that sense , the executive is already accountable to parliament " .
Once the prime minister has his majority , in other words , MPs become redundant .
Let me dwell for a moment on what Guthrie said , for he appears to advocate that we retain the right to commit war crimes .
States in dispute with each other , the UN charter says , must first seek to solve their differences by " peaceful means " ( article 33 ) .
If these fail , they should refer the matter to the security council ( article 37 ) , which decides what measures should be taken ( article 39 ) .
Taking the enemy by surprise is a useful tactic in battle , and encounters can be won only if commanders are able to make decisions quickly .
But either Guthrie does not understand the difference between a battle and a war - which is unlikely in view of his 44 years of service - or he does not understand the most basic point in international law .
Launching a surprise war is forbidden by the charter .
It has become fashionable to scoff at these rules and to dismiss those who support them as pedants and prigs , but they are all that stand between us and the greatest crimes in history .
The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg ruled that " to initiate a war of aggression ... is not only an international crime ; it is the supreme international crime " .
The tribunal 's charter placed " planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression " at the top of the list of war crimes .
If Britain 's most prominent retired general does not understand this , it can only be because he has never been forced to understand it .
In September 2002 , he argued in the Lords that " the time is approaching when we may have to join the US in operations against Iraq ...
Strike soon , and the threat will be less and easier to handle .
If the UN route fails , I support the second option . "
No one in the chamber warned him that he was proposing the supreme international crime .
In another Lords debate , Guthrie argued that it was " unthinkable for British servicemen and women to be sent to the International Criminal Court " , regardless of what they might have done .
He demanded a guarantee from the government that this would not be allowed to happen , and proposed that the British forces should be allowed to opt out of the European convention on human rights .
The grey heads murmured their agreement .
Perhaps it is unfair to single out the noble and gallant lord .
The British establishment 's exceptionalism is almost universal .
According to the government , both the Commons public administration committee and the Lords constitution committee recognise that decision - making should " provide sufficient flexibility for deployments which need to be made without prior parliamentary approval for reasons of urgency or necessary operational secrecy " .
You cannot keep an operation secret from parliament unless you are also keeping it secret from the UN .
Tebbit appears to have a general aversion to disclosure .
In 2003 , the Guardian obtained letters showing he had prevented the fraud squad at the MoD from investigating allegations of corruption against the arms manufacturer BAE , that he tipped off the BAE chairman about the contents of a confidential letter the Serious Fraud Office had sent him , and that he failed to tell his minister about the SFO 's warnings .
In October 2003 , under cross-examination during the Hutton inquiry into the death of the government scientist David Kelly , he revealed the decision to name Kelly was made in a " meeting chaired by the prime minister " .
That could have been the end of Tony Blair , but a week later Tebbit sent Lord Hutton a written retraction of his evidence .
No one bothered to tell parliament or the press ; the retraction was made public only when the Hutton report was published , three months later .
Blair knew all along , and the secret gave him a crushing advantage .
The discussion also reveals that Guthrie and Tebbit appear to have learned nothing from the disaster in Iraq .
They are not alone .
Just before he stepped down last year , Blair wrote an article for the Economist headlined " What I 've Learned " .
He had discovered , he claimed , that his critics were both wrong and dangerous and that his decisions , based on " freedom , democracy , responsibility to others , but also justice and fairness " , were difficult but invariably right .
He called his article " a very short synopsis of what I have learned " .
I could think of an even shorter one .
We have yet to hear one word of regret or remorse from any of the main architects - Blair , Brown , Straw , Hoon , Campbell and their principal advisers - of Britain 's participation in the supreme international crime .
The press and parliament appear to have heeded Blair 's plea that we all " move on " from Iraq .
The British establishment has a unique capacity to move on , and then to repeat its mistakes .
What other former empire knows so little of its own atrocities ?
When people call our unwritten constitution a " gentleman 's agreement " , they reveal more than they intend .
It allows the unelected gentlemen who advise the prime minister to act without reference to the proles .
Britain went to war in Iraq because the public and parliament were not allowed to know when the decision was made , what the intelligence reports said , and what the attorney general wrote about the its legality .
Had the truth not been suppressed , Britain could never have attacked Iraq .
Real constitutional reform requires much more than the timid proposals in the green paper on the governance of Britain , which are likely to appear in a bill in a few weeks ' time .
Yes , parliament should be allowed to vote on whether to go to war , yes the royal prerogative should be rolled back .
But the prime minister , his diplomats , civil servants and generals would still decide which wars parliament needs to know about , which crimes could be secretly committed in our name .
Real constitutional reform means not only handing power to parliament but also confronting the power of the hard , unaccountable people who act as if it is their birthright .

Sometimes nature 's palette is richer than that of any artist , as these beautiful and surreal images show .
These delicate fronds and whorls are not decorative etchings , nor have they
anything to do with vegetation , despite their biological appearance .
Scroll down for more ...
In fact they are nothing more than frozen water — ice crystals which formed
on Mail reader Stuart Dent 's cars on two frosty nights earlier this month outside his home in Oxfordshire .
The beautiful patterns , called " fern frost " , reflect myriad water molecules
arranged in six - sided patterns , a deep symmetry governed by the geometry of
the molecule itself .
Scroll down for more ...
But the human eye sees fronds and bracken , a nest of vipers or a bowl of
wriggling eels — endlessly repeating strings of tiny ice spicules .
" It was late at night and I thought I could see something on the roof of my Rover , so I went over to investigate and saw these unbelievable patterns , " Mr Dent says .
Scroll down for more ...
" There was no frost on the grass , or the paving stones .
It did n't even feel that cold .
Then the same thing happened the following weekend — I could n't believe it . "
Because metal is such a good conductor of heat , the car bodywork would have
been the first surface to drop below freezing as temperatures fell .
Scroll down for more ...
Like a windowpane , the paintwork encourages the growth of long ice crystals ,
each interlocking with the last , with the overall pattern being dictated by tiny
scratches , dust and other imperfections on the surface .
Beautiful though it is , this is nature at her most ephemeral — artwork that
disappears shortly after the first rays of sun strike in the morning .
A Redundant Acronym Phrase ( RAP ) is a phrase containing an acronym plus a word or phrase such that , when the acronym is expanded , the phrase would contain a redundancy .
This is best illustrated by an example : ATM machine .
ATM is an acronym for automated teller machine .
Thus , ATM machine really means Automated Teller Machine machine .
Similarly , RAP phrase means Redundant Acronym Phrase phrase .
The term RAP phrase was coined in 1985 and first appeared on the Internet in 1995 as a category in the IRC game Chaos .
This phenomenon was later described using other terms , such as RAS syndrome ( Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome ) , coined in 2001 , or PNS syndrome ( PIN Number Syndrome syndrome ) .

Facebook finally let its users turn off Beacon last week , but the legal fun is just beginning , according to one expert .
James Grimmelmann who writes
The Laboratorium blog , suggests that Blockbuster 's participation in Beacon could have violated the Video Privacy Protection Act .
The law states :
A video tape service provider who knowingly discloses , to any person , personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider shall be liable . . .
The problem is that Blockbuster.com , which was one of Beacon 's 12 landmark partners , disclosed the video preferences of some of its users in Facebook 's news feeds .
Grimmelmann thinks the companies stemmed their liability by implementing an opt - out policy last week , but still advises Facebook and Blockbuster to " prepare for lawsuits . "

Aspartame and Rumsfeld 's Disease - A Politically - Induced Biochemical Disaster Of Global Proportions
Donald Rumsfeld was known throughout the world as the zealous U.S. Secretary of Defense who is waging a global " war on terror " in search of " terrorists " and " weapons of mass destruction . "
Most people , however , are not aware that Rumsfeld himself unleashed a chemical weapon of mass destruction upon the world in 1981 - and it is still out there destroying people all over the world .
That " W.M. D. " is aspartame and it has been scientifically and anecdotally linked to millions of chronic illnesses and deaths .
The evidence shows that , with full knowledge of aspartame ’s neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity , Rumsfeld , as the CEO of G.D. Searle , Co. , " called in his markers " to achieve U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval for the artificial sweetener aspartame , better known by its trade name " NutraSweet . "
Consumer advocate attorney Jim Turner , who was instrumental in the 1969 banning of cyclamate in the U.S. for its link to various forms of cancer , met with representatives of aspartame approval petitioner Searle in 1974 .
The main topic of discussion was neuroscientist Dr. John Olney ’s 1971 study which showed that aspartic acid caused lesions in the brains of infant mice .
According to Turner , arguably the world ’s foremost authority on aspartame ’s dubious legal history , Rumsfeld was apparently hired by Searle for one specific purpose :
To obtain FDA approval for aspartame .
Betty Martini is the director of Mission Possible , a worldwide consumer advocacy organization formed in 1992 as a voice for those demanding that the FDA reverse its approval of aspartame and order its removal from foods , beverages and medical preparations .
Martini is even more bold in her charges against Rumsfeld .
Martini believes the Washington insider , former three - term U.S. Rep. From Illinois ( 1962 -1968 ) , secretary of defense ( 1975 - 1977 ) and executive assistant to President Gerald Ford , was hired by Searle because , " He was willing to get a deadly chemical poison , aspartame , approved for human consumption "
Background
In December , 1965 Searle chemist James Schlatter discovered aspartame while working on an ulcer drug .
The substance , comprised of 50 percent synthetic phenylalanine , 40 percent synthetic aspartic acid and 10 percent methanol , was about 200 times sweeter than sugar by weight and had no calories .
By spring , 1967 , Searle began conducting safety trials in preparation for petitioning the FDA for product approval .
Soon after the trials began , lab animals ( monkeys and mice ) began experiencing adverse effects ranging from brain lesions and tumors to seizures and death .
Yet Searle petitioned the FDA for aspartame approval in February , 1973 .
According to Turner , Searle provided the FDA with over 100 studies claiming they proved aspartame was " safe . "
Independent analyses of these studies , however , proves conclusively that aspartame is actually a dangerous , neurotoxic , carcinogenic and highly - addictive drug .
Trusting Searle ’s promise that aspartame was safe , the FDA approved the limited use of aspartame in dry goods on July 26 , 1974 .
Turner and Dr. Olney formally objected to the approval .
Their petition triggered an FDA investigation of Searle ’s lab practices which proved that Searle had provided the FDA with inaccurate conclusions resulting from manipulated data derived from poorly - designed studies .
The FDA reversed its decision to approve aspartame in dry goods .
On January 10 , 1977 , the FDA formally requested that the U.S. Department of Justice convene a federal grand jury to determine if Searle should be criminally indicted for " concealing material facts and making false statements " with regard to its petition for aspartame approval .
Among the many charges FDA investigators made about Searle ’s shoddy lab practices was how rats that developed tumors would undergo surgical removal of the tumors and then be placed back into the study as if nothing had happened to them .
The grand jury investigation was led by U.S. Attorney Samuel Skinner .
In July 1 , 1977 , while the investigation was being conducted , Skinner left the Justice Department and took a job with Sidley & Austin - the law firm representing Searle .
The statute of limitations eventually ran out and the grand jury disbanded without reaching any conclusions regarding Searle and its lab practices .
Amid this controversy , Rumsfeld was hired as Searle CEO on March 8 , 1977 and immediately began cleaning house .
Rumsfeld , who had no previous business executive experience before becoming CEO of Searle , reorganized several departments in the company and fired many of its high - level managers , replacing them with other politically - connected Washington , D.C. , insiders .
Though the controversies deepened and the evidence proving the poisonous nature of his company ’s product continued to accumulate , Rumsfeld and his team continued to push for FDA approval of aspartame .
A team of FDA investigators headed by Jerome Bressler attempted to block Rumsfeld , et. al , by publishing what has become known as the " Bressler Report " on August 1 , 1977 .
The report cited several instances where Searle intentionally misled the FDA in its petition for marketplace approval of aspartame .
The FDA then formed a public board of inquiry ( PBOI ) in 1979 to rule on the myriad safety issues surrounding aspartame .
By this time , FDA investigators and independent scientists had exhaustively reviewed the Searle studies and additional studies had been conducted .
There was no doubt , based upon objective analyses of evidence that had accumulated for over a decade , that aspartame was deathly poisonous to lab animals and caused a statistically significant number of them to develop tumors .

An official warned the comments may incur public anger if released
The papers include transcripts of talks between Mao and the then US National Security Adviser , Henry Kissinger .
The talks covered a range of issues , including the Soviet threat and Taiwan .
But during the talks , the Chinese leader made a surprising offer to send what he described as an excess of 10 million Chinese women to the US .
The discussions between Mao and Mr Kissinger in February 1973 took place at a villa in Beijing .
The Chinese leader smoked cigars and the two men talked and joked into the early hours of the morning .
Apology to interpreter
The papers show that Mao's comments about Chinese women were a recurring theme .
He lamented the dismal state of trade between the two countries but remarked that China had an excess of women .
He suggested sending tens of thousands to the US , but later in the conversation increased his offer to 10 million .
The remark provoked laughter and was clearly meant as a joke , but Mao went on to complain that Chinese women were giving birth to too many children .
If they were sent to the US he said , they would flood the country with disaster .
When discussing the possibility of a Soviet invasion of China , Mao complained that too many Chinese women did n't know how to fight .
A Chinese official warned that his comments would incur public anger if they were released .
Mao later apologised to a female interpreter and he and Mr Kissinger agreed to remove his comments about women from the records .
The Malkin effect on full display in Rhode Island .
It 's not enough to hate illegal immigrants anymore -- you must despise anyone who dares speak Spanish in public too .
A Ross Perot loving --- anti-Hispanic bigot got grumpy because two Latino customers did n't know exactly what equipment they wanted --- thought it was a hassle to help them --- heard them speak Spanish --- then demanded proof of citizenship for one of them before he would sell the items .
He even threatened to call ICE and arrest them himself .
And both people are US citizens .
Of course there is outrage in the community .

Richardson :.... Neil , I 've been very interested in illegal immigration for three years .
Back in 1992 I came off my couch , Ross Perot brought me off my couch and I 've been active in the reform party --- Terry 's organization " Rhode Islanders for illegal enforcement , " and the enforcement being the important part .
So when I see a customer quite often comes into my store , sometimes they do n't speak good English , ahhh - -- in this case we 'll go to the facts .
That one spoke English and one did not speak English .
I got their parts , it was quite a job getting their parts because they were n't sure what they wanted .
I guess it was the fellow that did n't speak English , seemed to be the mechanic part of it and the other fellow must have been the homeowner , I do n't know what he was ...
Cavuto :
At what point did you just say I want to see your Social Security card ?
Richardson : OK , so we finished the situation , I was writing it up and I casually said , " I 'd like to see this gentleman 's Social Security card .
And that got the English speaking person all up tight and the other fellow ...
How dare they speak Spanish in his store and how dare they get " up tight " because of a little racism .
" I do n't know what he was . "
Maybe he was a human being ?
The Providence Journal :
All José Genao planned to do at the heating equipment supply store was buy a spare part for his boiler .
While the owner began searching for the part , Genao and his friend began speaking to each other in Spanish .

It was the biggest , baddest , meanest froggy ever to have hopped on Earth .
Scientists on Monday announced the discovery in northwestern Madagascar of a bulky amphibian dubbed the " devil frog " that lived 65 million to 70 million years ago and was so nasty it may have eaten newborn dinosaurs .
This brute was larger than any frog living today and may be the biggest frog ever to have existed , according to paleontologist David Krause of Stony Brook University in Stony Brook , New York , one of the scientists who found the remains .
Its name , Beelzebufo ampinga , came from Beelzebub , the Greek for devil , and bufo -- Latin for toad .
Ampinga means " shield , " named for an armor - like part of its anatomy .
Mark Dixie denies murdering Miss Bowman
Mark Dixie , 37 , denies killing the 18 - year - old in Croydon , south London , during a sex attack , in September 2005 .
He claims he found her in the driveway of her home after she was attacked .
Her body was found in a pool of blood after being stabbed seven times .
DNA found on her body matched samples taken from Mr Dixie .
' Unattractive defence '
The court heard he moved to Australia in 1998 , where his DNA was found on a Thai student who was the victim of a brutal attack .
He has never been charged in connection with the offence and denies any involvement .
Sally Anne Bowman was stabbed seven times
Commenting on the charge of murdering Miss Bowman , Anthony Glass QC , defending , said : " It is , you may think , a very unattractive defence .
" He did not know she was dead until intercourse was concluded .
" Even though you may think his conduct is disgusting , he allowed his lust to get the better of him . "
A ban on the publication of images and photographs of Dixie was lifted by the judge at the end of the prosecution case .
“ The message today is clear : organized crime still exists in the city and the state of New York , ” Mr. Cuomo said .
“ We like to think that it ’s a vestige of the past .
It ’s not .
It is as unrelenting as weeds that continue to sprout in the cracks of society .
“ The second message , which is equally clear , ” he added , “ is that we will not rest until organized crime is a distant memory in New York . ”
The arrests by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and investigators from several other agencies were coordinated with a sweep that netted 23 accused organized crime figures in Palermo , Sicily .
Those charges are not directly linked to the New York arrests , but Italian officials who were in New York at the news conference said they were part of a new American - Italian strategy aimed at severing the close cooperative relationship between the Gambino family and the Sicilian mob .

In addition to Mr. D’Amico , Mr. Cefalu and Mr. Corozzo , the 80 - count federal indictment charges three Gambino captains and three acting captains , who serve among the family ’s midlevel managers , along with 16 dozen soldiers , officials said .
A large number of family associates are also being charged .
The construction extortion aspects of the investigation , which began more than three years ago , focused on the trucking industry , which hauls away dirt excavated from major construction projects in and around the city , said Gordon S. Heddell , inspector general of the United States Labor Department .
Several union officials were also charged in a scheme to steal union benefits .
Mr. Heddell , whose office investigates labor racketeering , said his agents were instrumental in starting the investigation .
“ This investigation exposed the alleged grip that the Gambino organized crime family has had over one of the largest construction markets in the United States , from small private projects to large scale public works contracts , ” he said .
“ This involved the trucks that move construction material and debris throughout the entire New York City region  the cement that is poured to build house foundations out in Staten Island , the general contractors who are responsible for building condominiums over in New Jersey and even a proposed Nascar raceway . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton , fresh off crucial wins in Tuesday 's primaries , has been playing the experience card heavily , particularly in regard to her role in foreign policy .
Clinton said it's her 35 years of experience that make her the best candidate to take on presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain in November .
After losing primaries in Ohio and Texas , Sen. Barack Obama argued the media has not held Clinton 's feet to the fire on foreign policy .
" Was she negotiating treaties or agreements , or was she handling crises during this period of time ?
My sense is the answer is no , " Obama said Wednesday .
So how do Clinton 's claims stack up ?
In some cases , CNN found a lack of clarity on her real involvement in foreign policy affairs .
But in other cases , her claims do seem to check out fairly well .
Northern Ireland
" I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland , " Clinton said on CNN's American Morning on Wednesday .
Watch more of Clinton 's comments on the race »
A Washington Post blogger accused Clinton in January of exaggerating her involvement in Northern Ireland .
But former Democratic Senate majority leader George Mitchell , who was a U.S. special envoy to Northern Ireland , told CNN that while Clinton was not directly involved in negotiations , she did play a helpful role in bringing in women 's groups that made a difference .
Mitchell is a Democratic superdelegate and has not publicly endorsed Clinton or Obama .
Rep. Peter King , a Republican from New York , was also involved in the process .
He recalls one late - night meeting with former President Bill Clinton , Sen. Clinton and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams .
" There was a discussion of how the IRA would decommission its weapons .
And I know that Sen. Clinton was part of that meeting , " King said .
Kosovo
" I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo , " she said on CNN's American Morning .
In May of 1999 , she was in Macedonia visiting refugee camps near the Kosovo border and meeting with Macedonia 's president and prime minister .
Sources with knowledge of her visit say she discussed the refugees ' plight with those leaders .
It 's not clear how much she helped since CNN reported at the time that Macedonia reopened its border to Kosovar refugees before Clinton 's visit .
China
" I 've been standing up against , you know , the Chinese government over women 's rights and standing up for human rights in many different places , " she said on CNN 's American Morning .
During a 1995 visit to Beijing , at a time when her husband 's administration was trying to press China on human rights , Sen. Clinton made a speech condemning abuses .
" No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution , arrest , abuse or torture , " she said .
But a former National Security Council official in the Clinton administration says Clinton did n't attend NSC meetings .
So while her experience is extensive , she rarely carried an official portfolio .

JB : When did you first become interested in computing , what was your first computer and what was the first program you wrote ?
BS : I learned programming in my second year of university .
I was signed up to do " mathematics with computers science " from the start , but I do n't really remember why .
I suspect that I ( erroneously ) thought that computing was some sort of applied math .
My fist computer was the departmental GIER computer .
It was almost exclusively programmed in Algol - 60 .
My first semi-real program plotted lines ( on paper ! ) between points on the edge of a superellipse to create pleasant graphical designs .
That was in 1970 .
JB : When you created C++ , was the object oriented programming ( OOP ) paradigm ( or programming style ) obviously going to gain a lot of popularity in the future , or was it a research project to find out if OOP would catch on ?
BS : Neither !
My firm impression ( at the time ) was that all sensible people " knew " that OOP did n't work in the real world :
It was too slow ( by more than an order of magnitude ) , far too difficult for programmers to use , did n't apply to real - world problems , and could n't interact with all the rest of the code needed in a system .
Actually , I 'm probably being too optimistic here : " sensible people " had never heard of OOP and did n't want to hear about it .
I designed and implemented C++ because I had some problems for which it was the right solution : I needed C - style access to hardware and Simula - style program organization .
It turned out that many of my colleagues had similar needs .
Actually , then it was not even obvious that C would succeed .
At the time , C was gaining a following , but many people still considered serious systems programming in anything but assembler adventurous and there were several languages that — like C— provided a way of writing portable systems programs .
One of those others might have become dominant instead of C .
JB : Before C++ , did you " just have to create C++ " because of the inadequacy of other languages , for example ?
In essence , why did you create C++?
BS : Yes , I created C++ in response to a real need :
The languages at the time did n't support abstraction for hard systems programming tasks in the way I needed it .
I was trying to separate the functions of the Unix kernel so that they could run on different processors of a multi- processor or a cluster .
JB : Personally , do you think OOP is the best programming paradigm for large scale software systems , as opposed to literate programming , functional programming , procedural programming , etc . ?
Why ?
BS : No programming paradigm is best for everything .
What you have is a problem and a solution to it ; then , you try to map that solution into code for execution .
You do that with resource constraints and concerns for maintainability .
Sometimes , that mapping is best done with OOP , sometimes with generic programming , sometimes with functional programming , etc .
OOP is appropriate where you can organize some key concepts into a hierarchy and manipulate the resulting classes through common base classes .
Please note that I equate OO with the traditional use of encapsulation , inheritance , and ( run time ) polymorphism .
You can choose alternative definitions , but this one is well - founded in history .
I do n't think that literate programming is a paradigm like the others you mention .
It is more of a development method like test - driven development .
This series of “ How to Draw Caricatures ” tutorials are a just a small taste of a larger and much more in - depth book I wrote called The Mad Art of Caricature !
The book is 175 full - color pages , lavishly illustrated and contains greatly expanded explanations of the concepts presented in these tutorials , as well and a great deal of additional material on caricaturing other facial features , posture , hands , expression and more , techniques on drawing from live models , doing caricature for freelance illustration and for MAD Magazine .
This is a must have book for anyone interested in caricature , cartooning or humorous illustration .
You can order it online here .
Part One : Basic Theory and the Five Shapes
This is the first of a series of articles I will post here on The MAD Blog about my theories , methods and processes concerning how to draw caricatures .
A lot of this information is part of what I teach my theme park artists , so it is derived partly from the approach of doing live , quick - draw caricatures .
However all of that can be applied to more studio orientated caricature work and I have also added points and concepts directly from the less time - constrained world of caricature illustration .
Therefore this is not instruction for just the live caricaturist but for any artist interested in caricature for any purpose .
These kinds of things always start out with a definition , but “ caricature ” is a hard thing to pigeonhole into a single sentence .
How can you , when the word encompasses the elegant , minimalist lines of Al Hirschfeld to the lavish , value and color soaked paintings of Sebastian Kruger to the graphic , geometrical collages of David Cowles and everything in between ?
Despite the wild differences in style and technique , “ caricature ” is the tag that is placed on any of these works of art without hesitation .
Obviously there is a connection beyond a common technique , school or format .
So , what are the universal elements all caricatures have that identify them as caricatures ?
I would say there are three essential elements that transcend style and medium and must be present in a caricature :
Likeness -
If you ca n’t tell who it is supposed to be , then it is not successful .
All good caricatures incorporate a good likeness of their subjects .
If you ca n’t tell who it is supposed to be , then it is not successful .
All good caricatures incorporate a good likeness of their subjects .
Exaggeration -
Without some form of exaggeration , or a departure from the exact representation of the subject ’s features , all you have is a portrait .
The level of exaggeration can vary wildly , but there must be some departure .
A straight portrait is not a caricature .
Without some form of exaggeration , or a departure from the exact representation of the subject ’s features , all you have is a portrait .
The level of exaggeration can vary wildly , but there must be some departure .
A straight portrait is not a caricature .
Statement - I believe a caricature must editorialize in some way .
The artist must be trying to say something about the subject .
It might be something to do with the situation the subject is drawn in , it may just be a play on their personality through expression or body language , it might be a simple as making visual fun of some aspect of their persona or image .
Exaggeration itself can accomplish this in some cases .
The best caricatures say something more about the subject than that they have a big nose .
By my ‘ definition ’ , a successful caricature therefore looks like the subject , is exaggerated to varying degrees and also has something to say about the subject … some sort of editorial comment .
In “ live ” caricature at a theme park , that third item is often turned way down or ignored completely , but in the case of caricatures for illustration , it ’s an important part .
Teaching Someone to See
I ’ve been working with young caricaturists at theme parks for over two decades now , and I ’ve learned one very important lesson … it ’s impossible to teach someone to draw caricatures .
I can teach them to DRAW … that is n’t so hard .
Learning how a face looks and works by learning anatomy , how expression changes the features , how the angle the face is at changes the perception of features , how hair grows and falls about the head … those are things that can be taught .
Drawing caricatures , on the other hand , is a lot more about seeing what makes the person in front of you unique and personal interpretation than it is about making good , confident marks on the paper .
I can explain to someone exactly how to draw a circle , but if I place a circle before them and ask them to draw it and they draw a square … well , that is all about seeing and not drawing .
The ability to see , and after that the ability to exaggerate what you see for humorous effect in a caricature … that has to be developed .
For most that means a lot of drawing and a lot of looking .
Have you ever been walking along at the mall or where ever and along comes somebody with some crazy , incredibly distinct face that maybe sports a gigantic nose or a Cro-Magnon brow or some other obviously out - of - the - ordinary features ?
Caricaturists have a term for that kind of face … it ’s called a “ field day ” .
Think about it for a second … why is that face so ripe for caricature compared to the next guy’s ?
Are the features really that different ?
If you took a ruler and measured the size of Mr. Shnozzes ’s nose compared to Mr. Normal , the difference would be minimal .
So why is he so easy ?
Because you are SEEING a difference based on perception , and that is giving you your springboard for a caricature .
One observation of what makes this person different from “ normal ” , and you are off and running .
The obvious features are easy observations … it ’s Johnny and Susie Normal or , worse yet , Johnny and Susie Supermodel that are the challenge .
That is where developing an ability to “ see ” becomes important .
There is no face that defies caricature , you just sometimes have to dig a little deeper to find the keys to unlock the more difficult puzzle .
In caricature , the old adage of “ practice makes perfect ” has never been truer .
The ability to see does n’t spring up overnight , and I often tell eager young caricaturists they have about 500 or so bad caricatures in them they have to draw out first before they start noticing the subtle things that hide inside the “ ordinary ” face .
Although I say it ’s “ impossible ” to teach someone to draw caricatures , it ’s not impossible to help them develop their ability to draw them .
There are many ways and techniques to help an artist develop their ability to see what is in front of them , recognize what makes what they see unique and then amplify that uniqueness to create a successful caricature .
There are general concepts that apply to the overall approach of a caricature as well as specific tricks and tips for individual features and important , main elements that I will be sharing over the multiple parts of this series of articles .
The Five Shapes
The human face is perceived by many as an incredible complex object .
There are about 52 muscles in the face , depending on your source and it ’s categorization .
Age , sex , race , expression ( the face is capable of about 5,000 expressions ) weight and environment can all play a role in the look and perception of a given face .
Sounds pretty complex .
Not really .
Every building , no matter how complex , starts out with a foundation and framework .
Look at this simple drawing :
Show that drawing to any human being in the world and ask them what it is .
Barring a language barrier , they will tell you it ’s “ a face ” .
No other information needed .
In it ’s most simple form , the human face is made up of only five simple shapes :
Place these shapes in their proper relationship , and you have a human face .
It really is that simple .
Drawing the shapes accurately , so they recognizably represent the subject ’s features , is the basis for a good likeness .
Beyond that is nothing but details … things like dimples , wrinkles , eyelashes , cheekbones , etc .
They are the decor to your building … the millwork , furniture and drapery that makes the place unique and filled with life .
Without the strong foundation , however , it can all come tumbling down .
What does that have to do with caricature ?
Everything .
I mentioned a single word in the last paragraph that really is the secret to caricature as a whole no matter what technique or approach you intend to practice :
RELATIONSHIPS
It ’s the manipulation of the RELATIONSHIP of these five simple shapes that create the foundation for your caricature .
In fact , I ’d argue that 90 % of the entire caricature resides in how you relate these five simple shapes to one another .
It is the foundation upon which the rest of your building is built , where the real power of exaggeration is realized .
Make it good and almost all the heavy lifting is done , the rest merely referring to details .
What do I mean by “ relationships ” ?
I mean the distances between the five shapes , their size relative to one another , and the angles they are at in relationship to the center axis of the face .
Distance .
Size .
Angle .
In traditional portraiture , the head is divided into “ classic proportions ” ( we ’ll get into that more next time ) , meaning the relationship of the features are within a certain , accepted range of distance to one another , size and angle relative to the face and head shape .
You achieve your likeness in a classic portrait , in it ’s most basic form , by correctly drawing the shapes and then the details of each feature according to the model in front of you while staying within the framework of the “ classic ” proportions .
Of course each face varies minutely here and there , but still you do not stray far from the classic formula .
In a caricature , like a portrait , the likeness is also achieved by drawing the features as they really look … but you change the relationship of the features based on your perceptions of the face .
The relationships you change are as I listed before : distance , size and angle .
Look at these VERY simple drawings that demonstrate how you can change the relationships of the five shapes and create very different caricatures :
No detail , and all the shapes are basically the same with the exception of the head shape ( again , more on that later … MUCH more ) but all are distinctly different and when the details are added will make for highly varied caricatures .
The difference is the relationships between the features , and how they have been exaggerated and changed .
Caricature is not about choosing one feature and making it bigger , it ’s about all the features together and how they relate to one another .
Here are some quick studies of the 5 shapes beneath a few caricature sketches :
The relationships differ in distance , size and angle from one another .
The bigger the differences are from “ classic ” proportions , the more exaggerated the caricature .
It ’s much easier to see the differences when the details are removed and only the 5 shapes are left .
It ’s also much easier to create those differences at this simple , fundamental level .
It ’s easy to get caught up in details when the important information rests beneath the rendering .
How does one determine the “ correct ” changes to make to a given person ’s feature relationships to make a good caricature of them ?
Well , that ’s the trick , is n’t it ?
That is were that pesky “ seeing ” comes in .
In his book “ How to Draw Caricatures “ , Lenn Redman uses a concept called “ The Inbetweener ” as a basis for almost every observation .
It is basically the classic portraiture relationships used as a point of reference for making observations .
Every caricature begins with the observations the artist makes about the subject , and how their particular face is perceived by them .
MAD legend Mort Drucker has been quoted as saying that there is no “ one correct way ” to caricature a subject .
Any given subject can have several difference interpretations with respect to the exaggeration of the relationship of their features … and each may be as successful as the other .
That ’s one of the unique things about caricature as an art form .
Portraiture is basically absolute …
Your drawing either looks like the person with the correct features , proportions and relationships , or it does not .
Caricature is subjective to a point .
The artists goal is to draw how they perceive the face , and exaggerate that perception .
The result may be different than how others perceive that face , but if the three elements we described in our definition are present it ’s still a successful caricature .
Hirschfeld used to say he once drew Jimmy Durante without a nose at all , yet it was still recognizable as Durante .
That ’s not to say that any observation is appropriate … after all you ca n’t give someone with a small , button nose a gigantic potato schnozz and call it “ exaggeration ” .
That ’s not exaggeration , it ’s DISTORTION .
You can , however , choose NOT to exaggerate the nose ’s smallness but rather find something else to exaggerate .
That is the caricaturist ’s task , to find what it is about the subject ’s face that makes it unique and alter those relationships to exaggerate that uniqueness .
Next time
We will delve more deeply into the relationships of features , what to look for and some rules to follow when changing those relationships that will make the rest of the face fall into place .

Boy shoots himself in the face ...
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Eating the Mediterranean way could help you live longer , according to the first study to look at how the dietary pattern relates to mortality in a US population .
Men whose diets were closest to the Mediterranean ideal were 21 percent less likely to die over five years than men whose diets were least Mediterranean - like .
Similar results were seen in women .
“ These results provide strong evidence for a beneficial effect of higher conformity with the Mediterranean dietary pattern on risk of death from all causes , including deaths due to cardiovascular disease and cancer , in a US population , ” Dr. Panagiota N. Mitrou of the University of Cambridge in the UK and colleagues conclude .
A number of studies have linked the Mediterranean diet , which is rich in fish , fruits and vegetables and nuts and low in dairy foods and red meat , to health benefits , the researchers note in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
They looked at diet and mortality in 380,296 men and women , 50 to 71 years old , who were participating in the National Institutes of Health - AARP Diet and Health Study .
For both men and women , the researchers found , the risk of death from any cause over the five - year follow - up period was lower for those with the most Mediterranean - like diets .
Deaths from cancer or cardiovascular disease were also significantly lower in this group .
The benefit was especially strong in smokers who were not overweight , who nearly halved their risk of death if they closely followed the Mediterranean diet pattern .
Smokers may have had the most to gain from the antioxidant and blood fat - lowering effects of Mediterranean - style eating , Mitrou and colleagues suggest .

The Case for Free Trade by Milton and Rose Friedman
It is often said that bad economic policy reflects disagreement among the experts ; that if all economists gave the same advice , economic policy would be good .
Economists often do disagree , but that has not been true with respect to international trade .
Ever since Adam Smith there has been virtual unanimity among economists , whatever their ideological position on other issues , that international free trade is in the best interests of trading countries and of the world .
Yet tariffs have been the rule .
The only major exceptions are nearly a century of free trade in Great Britain after the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 , thirty years of free trade in Japan after the Meiji Restoration , and free trade in Hong Kong under British rule .
The United States had tariffs throughout the nineteenth century , and they were raised still higher in the twentieth century , especially by the Smoot - Hawley tariff bill of 1930 , which some scholars regard as partly responsible for the severity of the subsequent depression .
Tariffs have since been reduced by repeated international agreements , but they remain high , probably higher than in the nineteenth century , though the vast changes in the kinds of items entering international trade make a precise comparison impossible .
Today , as always , there is much support for tariffs –euphemistically labeled “ protection , ” a good label for a bad cause .
Producers of steel and steelworkers ' unions press for restrictions on steel imports from Japan .
Producers of TV sets and their workers lobby for “ voluntary agreements ” to limit imports of TV sets or components from Japan , Taiwan , or Hong Kong .
Producers of textiles , shoes , cattle , sugar–they and myriad others complain about “ unfair ” competition from abroad and demand that government do something to “ protect ” them .
Of course , no group makes its claims on the basis of naked self - interest .
Every group speaks of the “ general interest , ” of the need to preserve jobs or to promote national security .
The need to strengthen the dollar vis -à - vis the deutsche mark or the yen has more recently joined the traditional rationalizations for restrictions on imports .
One voice that is hardly ever raised is the consumer ’s .
That voice is drowned out in the cacophony of the “ interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers ” and their employees .
The result is a serious distortion of the issue .
For example , the supporters of tariffs treat it as self evident that the creation of jobs is a desirable end , in and of itself , regardless of what the persons employed do .
That is clearly wrong .
If all we want are jobs , we can create any number–for example , have people dig holes and then fill them up again or perform other useless tasks .
Work is sometimes its own reward .
Mostly , however , it is the price we pay to get the things we want .
Our real objective is not just jobs but productive jobs–jobs that will mean more goods and services to consume .
Another fallacy seldom contradicted is that exports are good , imports bad .
The truth is very different .
We cannot eat , wear , or enjoy the goods we send abroad .
We eat bananas from Central America , wear Italian shoes , drive German automobiles , and enjoy programs we see on our Japanese TV sets .
Our gain from foreign trade is what we import .
Exports are the price we pay to get imports .
As Adam Smith saw so clearly , the citizens of a nation benefit from getting as large a volume of imports as possible in return for its exports or , equivalently , from exporting as little as possible to pay for its imports .
The misleading terminology we use reflects these erroneous ideas .
“ Protection ” really means exploiting the consumer .
A “ favorable balance of trade ” really means exporting more than we import , sending abroad goods of greater total value than the goods we get from abroad .
In your private household , you would surely prefer to pay less for more rather than the other way around , yet that would be termed an “ unfavorable balance of payments ” in foreign trade .
The argument in favor of tariffs that has the greatest emotional appeal to the public at large is the alleged need to protect the high standard of living of American workers from the “ unfair ” competition of workers in Japan or Korea or Hong Kong who are willing to work for a much lower wage .
What is wrong with this argument ?
Do n’t we want to protect the high standard of living of our people ?
The fallacy in this argument is the loose use of the terms “ high ” wage and “ low ” wage .
What do high and low wages mean ?
American workers are paid in dollars ; Japanese workers are paid in yen .
How do we compare wages in dollars with wages in yen ?
How many yen equal a dollar ?
What determines the exchange rate ?
Consider an extreme case .
Suppose that , to begin with , 360 yen equal a dollar .
At this exchange rate , the actual rate of exchange for many years , suppose that the Japanese can produce and sell everything for fewer dollars than we can in the United States–TV sets , automobiles , steel , and even soybeans , wheat , milk , and ice cream .
If we had free international trade , we would try to buy all our goods from Japan .
This would seem to be the extreme horror story of the kind depicted by the defenders of tariffs –we would be flooded with Japanese goods and could sell them nothing .
Before throwing up your hands in horror , carry the analysis one step further .
How would we pay the Japanese ?
We would offer them dollar bills .
What would they do with the dollar bills ?
We have assumed that at 360 yen to the dollar everything is cheaper in Japan , so there is nothing in the U.S. market that they would want to buy .
If the Japanese exporters were willing to burn or bury the dollar bills , that would be wonderful for us .
We would get all kinds of goods for green pieces of paper that we can produce in great abundance and very cheaply .
We would have the most marvelous export industry conceivable .
Of course , the Japanese would not in fact sell us useful goods in order to get useless pieces of paper to bury or burn .
Like us , they want to get something real in return for their work .
If all goods were cheaper in Japan than in the United States at 360 yen to the dollar , the exporters would try to get rid of their dollars , would try to sell them for 360 yen to the dollar in order to buy the cheaper Japanese goods .
But who would be willing to buy the dollars ?
What is true for the Japanese exporter is true for everyone in Japan .
No one will be willing to give 360 yen in exchange for one dollar if 360 yen will buy more of everything in Japan than one dollar will buy in the United States .
The exporters , on discovering that no one will buy their dollars at 360 yen , will offer to take fewer yen for a dollar .
The price of the dollar in terms of the yen will go down –to 300 yen for a dollar or 250 yen or 200 yen .
Put the other way around , it will take more and more dollars to buy a given number of Japanese yen .
Japanese goods are priced in yen , so their price in dollars will go up .
Conversely , U.S. goods are priced in dollars , so the more dollars the Japanese get for a given number of yen , the cheaper U.S. goods become to the Japanese in terms of yen .
The price of the dollar in terms of yen would fall , until , on the average , the dollar value of goods that the Japanese buy from the United States roughly equaled the dollar value of goods that the United States buys from Japan .
At that price everybody who wanted to buy yen for dollars would find someone who was willing to sell him yen for dollars .
The actual situation is , of course , more complicated than this hypothetical example .
Many nations , and not merely the United States and Japan , are engaged in trade , and the trade often takes roundabout directions .
The Japanese may spend some of the dollars they earn in Brazil , the Brazilians in turn may spend those dollars in Germany , the Germans in the United States , and so on in endless complexity .
However , the principle is the same .
People , in whatever country , want dollars primarily to buy useful items , not to hoard , and there can be no balance of payments problem so long as the price of the dollar in terms of the yen or the deutsche mark or the franc is determined in a free market by voluntary transactions .
Why then all the furor about the “ weakness ” of the dollar ?
Why the repeated foreign exchange crises ?
The proximate reason is because foreign exchange rates have not been determined in a free market .
Government central banks have intervened on a grand scale in order to influence the price of their currencies .
In the process they have lost vast sums of their citizens ' money ( for the United States , close to two billion dollars from 1973 to early 1979 ) .
Even more important , they have prevented this important set of prices from performing its proper function .
They have not been able to prevent the basic underlying economic forces from ultimately having their effect on exchange rates but have been able to maintain artificial exchange rates for substantial intervals .
The effect has been to prevent gradual adjustment to the underlying forces .
Small disturbances have accumulated into large ones , and ultimately there has been a major foreign exchange “ crisis . ”
In all the voluminous literature of the past several centuries on free trade and protectionism , only three arguments have ever been advanced in favor of tariffs that even in principle may have some validity .
First is the national security argument –the argument that a thriving domestic steel industry , for example , is needed for defense .
Although that argument is more often a rationalization for particular tariffs than a valid reason for them , it can not be denied that on occasion it might justify the maintenance of otherwise uneconomical productive facilities .
To go beyond this statement of possibility and establish in a specific case that a tariff or other trade restriction is justified in order to promote national security , it would be necessary to compare the cost of achieving the specific security objective in alternative ways and establish at least a prima facie case that a tariff is the least costly way .
Such cost comparisons are seldom made in practice .
We could say to the rest of the world :
We can not force you to be free .
But we believe in freedom and we intend to practice it .
The second is the “ infant industry ” argument advanced , for example , by Alexander Hamilton in his Report on Manufactures .
There is , it is said , a potential industry that , if once established and assisted during its growing pains , could compete on equal terms in the world market .
A temporary tariff is said to be justified in order to shelter the potential industry in its infancy and enable it to grow to maturity , when it can stand on its own feet .
Even if the industry could compete successfully once established , that does not of itself justify an initial tariff .
It is worthwhile for consumers to subsidize the industry initially –which is what they in effect do by levying a tariff–only if they will subsequently get back at least that subsidy in some other way , through prices lower than the world price or through some other advantages of having the industry .
But in that case is a subsidy needed ?
Will it then not pay the original entrants into the industry to suffer initial losses in the expectation of being able to recoup them later ?
After all , most firms experience losses in their early years , when they are getting established .
That is true if they enter a new industry or if they enter an existing one .
Perhaps there may be some special reason why the original entrants cannot recoup their initial losses even though it may be worthwhile for the community at large to make the initial investment .
But surely the presumption is the other way .
The infant industry argument is a smoke screen .
The so - called infants never grow up .
Once imposed , tariffs are seldom eliminated .
Moreover , the argument is seldom used on behalf of true unborn infants that might conceivably be born and survive if given temporary protection ; they have no spokesmen .
It is used to justify tariffs for rather aged infants that can mount political pressure .
The third argument for tariffs that cannot be dismissed out of hand is the “ beggar - thy - neighbor ” argument .
A country that is a major producer of a product , or that can join with a small number of other producers that together control a major share of production , may be able to take advantage of its monopoly position by raising the price of the product ( the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel is the obvious example ) .
Instead of raising the price directly , the country can do so indirectly by imposing an export tax on the product–an export tariff .
The benefit to itself will be less than the cost to others , but from the national point of view , there can be a gain .
Similarly , a country that is the primary purchaser of a product–in economic jargon , has monopsony power–may be able to benefit by driving a hard bargain with the sellers and imposing an unduly low price on them .
One way to do so is to impose a tariff on the import of the product .
The net return to the seller is the price less the tariff , which is why this can be equivalent to buying at a lower price .
In effect , the tariff is paid by the foreigners ( we can think of no actual example ) .
In practice this nationalistic approach is highly likely to promote retaliation by other countries .
In addition , as for the infant industry argument , the actual political pressures tend to produce tariff structures that do not in fact take advantage of any monopoly or monopsony positions .
A fourth argument , one that was made by Alexander Hamilton and continues to be repeated down to the present , is that free trade would be fine if all other countries practiced free trade but that , so long as they do not , the United States can not afford to .
This argument has no validity whatsoever , either in principle or in practice .
Other countries that impose restrictions on international trade do hurt us .
But they also hurt themselves .
Aside from the three cases just considered , if we impose restrictions in turn , we simply add to the harm to ourselves and also harm them as well .
Competition in masochism and sadism is hardly a prescription for sensible international economic policy !
Far from leading to a reduction in restrictions by other countries , this kind of retaliatory action simply leads to further restrictions .
We are a great nation , the leader of the world .
It ill behooves us to require Hong Kong and Taiwan to impose export quotas on textiles to “ protect ” our textile industry at the expense of U.S. consumers and of Chinese workers in Hong Kong and Taiwan .
We speak glowingly of the virtues of free trade , while we use our political and economic power to induce Japan to restrict exports of steel and TV sets .
We should move unilaterally to free trade , not instantaneously but over a period of , say , five years , at a pace announced in advance .
Few measures that we could take would do more to promote the cause of freedom at home and abroad than complete free trade .
Instead of making grants to foreign governments in the name of economic aid–thereby promoting socialism–while at the same time imposing restrictions on the products they produce–thereby hindering free enterprise–we could assume a consistent and principled stance .
We could say to the rest of the world :
We believe in freedom and intend to practice it .
We can not force you to be free .
But we can offer full cooperation on equal terms to all .
Our market is open to you without tariffs or other restrictions .
Sell here what you can and wish to .
Buy whatever you can and wish to .
In that way cooperation among individuals can be worldwide and free .
