( CNN ) --
For most , the flu is a winter inconvenience -- stuffy nose , fever , body aches and a few days of bed rest .
But what seems fairly routine also can become life - threatening .
Martin McGowan died at the age of 15 after falling ill with the flu in February 2005 .
The majority of flu deaths strike the elderly and people with pre-existing health problems .
But flu also affects kids with no known medical problems and can send them into critical condition , or even death .
This flu season started slowly , and doctors anticipate the peak will occur this month or April .
Dr. Len Horovitz , a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York , has been giving booster shots to patients who were vaccinated early in the season , September or October .
" There 's a decline in antibody levels , so we try to give a booster , " Horovitz said .
" I 've been talking to immunologists [ about ] getting a booster -- there 's no downside to it . "
Although doctors advise that nearly everyone should get a flu shot , skepticism about the severity of the illness and questions about shot 's effectiveness persist .
The Journal of the American Medical Association released three studies about the flu Monday .
One reports that some flu viruses circulating during the 2007 - 2008 season were resistant to Tamiflu , an antiviral flu medicine .
But those who had the strains resistant to Tamiflu did not get sicker than other patients .

During the 2007 - 08 flu season , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 86 pedatric deaths from flu - related complications .
The virus causes inflammation throughout the body and disturbs the functions of the body , including breathing .
Deaths from the flu are " most likely respiratory - related , " said Doug Hardy , an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Texas - Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas .
" Flu can cause heart inflammation , lung inflammation . "
Co-infections also play a role .
Four years ago , Martin McGowan , 15 , came home after trying out for his high school baseball team and slumped in front of the television .
His mother , Diane McGowan thought it was unusual for her athletic teenage son .
" He just was n't his active self , " she said .
" He usually reminded us of Tigger , bouncing all over the place . "
He went to bed that night complaining of flu - like symptoms .
" He had a temperature , " said McGowan of Nazareth , Pennsylvania .
" It was 102 .
I knew the drill , give them ibuprofen or Motrin , give them something for the pain , and call the doctor the next day and see how it goes .
That 's the normal case . "
That night , Martin vomited a couple of times , complained of pains in his legs and his lips were turning white .
They rushed to the emergency room .
The doctors said he had the flu .
" Even at that point , I did n't understand how sick my child was in the emergency room , " McGowan said .
" Influenza does n't come across like that . "
The day before , Martin had gone running , which had irritated his leg muscles .
The condition in his leg had developed into compartment syndrome , which limits blood circulation and causes leg pains .
Doctors said he needed surgery as soon as possible .
While he was wheeled into the operating room , Martin turned to say : " Mom , do n't cry .
It 's going to be OK . "
Martin died in the operating room .
" To hear that , it 's heart - wrenching , " his mother said .
" The autopsy confirms it 's influenza , it rips your heart out . "
" He was a very healthy , active 15 - year - old .
He had n't been feeling well for one day .
It hit him hard .
It hit him like a lightning bolt .
Within 15 hours , he was gone , " she said .
Cases like Martin's have baffled scientists , who usually see between 50 and 150 pediatric flu deaths a year in the United States .
Typically half of the flu deaths occur in children who have degenerative heart or lung disease or immune risk factors , but the other half are seemingly healthy .
" There is n't a good understanding of why that happens , " said Dr. John Treanor , professor of medicine and of microbiology and immunology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine .
" There 's speculation that these children , for genetic reasons , had unusual immune response to the flu , resulting in deaths . "
A person infected with the flu has weakened lungs and immune system , and could contract bacterial pneumonia or methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA .
Of the nine pediatric deaths reported this season , bacterial co-infections were confirmed in six .
Four of them also had staphylococcus infections .
" That seems to be where a lot of people end up dying , " Hardy said .
" It 's a combined killer with flu and bacterial pneumonia .
More of the people who do die have co-infections .
You do n't have to be a weakened person without medical problems to die from the flu . "
Diane McGowan joined a group , Families Fighting Flu and started campaigning for the CDC to extend its flu vaccine guidelines , which had previously recommended annual shots for children between the 6 month and 5 years .
Beginning with this flu season , the agency extended recommendations to 18 - year - olds .
" It 's very sad to know that just a simple flu vaccination could 've helped him ( Martin ) , " McGowan said .
The CDC estimates that more than 200,000 people are hospitalized and about 36,000 people die every year from flu complications .
Despite warnings , many do n't get the flu vaccine because of the perception that it is n't effective .
" It 's a good vaccine , but there 's a problem with the flu vaccine , " Hardy said .
" You 're predicting what 's going to happen , before it happens .
It 's a betting game . "
The viral strain changes every year , so health officials try to predict which strains will be circulating next season .
When McGowan meets a skeptic about flu vaccines , she recounts Martin 's story .
" I want to have parents understand it 's not normal for children to die from the flu .
I want them to get them protected , give them a fighting chance .
The strain is always changing , " she said .
" Unfortunately , it 's a hard lesson to learn .
We do n't want them to learn it the way we had to learn it . "

Indeed .
It 's an undefined behavior .
C and C++ do not specify when the post - increment occurs within the statement , only that it is guaranteed to occur by the end token ( i.e. , ;) -- whether immediately before ( or after ) use , at the beginning ( or end ) of the statement , or at some point in between is not specified .
For this reason , referencing a variable more than once in a statement where the post - increment operator is used results in undefined behavior .
The same code may produce different results on different compilers , different architectures , or even the same compiler with different optimization settings .
So ,
0 , 0
0 , 0
could also have been a result .
Although , for the original poster , to elaborate on the specific behavior of the initial post
1 , 0
0 , 1
some more , suppose we have m = 0 ; printf ( " ( m++ , m , m++ ) : %d , %d , %d
" , m++ , m , m + + ) ;
( m++ , m , m ++ ) gave me 1 , 2 , 0 ( with gcc version 4.0.1 Apple Inc. build 5488 ) , which illustrates going on with that initial post .
The post - increment operators are evaluated first and from right to left , so the " m++ " in the third parameter is done first ( returning 0 and incremeting m to 1 ) .
The " m++ " in the first parameter is done next , since it 's the next post - increment operator to do ( evaluating from right to left ) .
The first parameter returns 1 and increments m to 2 .
This concludes the evaluation of the post - increment operators in the statement .
Now , proceeding from right to left , the rest is done .
So , finally , the " m " in the second parameter is evaluated as 2 ( 0 incremented to 1 , which was then incremented to 2 ) .

Since the recent events in Guinea - Bissau which led to the Deaths of both the Country 's President and the head of the Army , West Africa has been on the Radar of Most Activists .
Now there is another Country in the Region which will soon be facing International Scrutiny for its Internal Politics .
Over the Last few weeks the Online Media that covers Gambian Issues have been rife with Articles regarding Events in that Small Western African Country .
First of all there is a crackdown going on inside the Country .
Who are the people that are considered to be threats to the Gambian Nation ?
Are they Independent Journalists who report on these incidents as they take place ?
Hardly .
Are they Members of the Political Opposition ?
Not at First however .
The leader of One Party was arrested after going to Investigate these reports for himself .
But who are the targets of this new effort ?
Believe it or not they are Witch Doctors .
For the sake of discussion the term Practioners of Traditional Medicine will be used to described them .
A Recent Press Release by an Opposition Party stated that " the average Gambian believes that Witches and Witchcraft do exist . "
This happens to be an interesting label one can place on a Person .
This label can also be transferred to that Individual 's Family as well .
This issue is the root cause of the current rift between President Jammeh and the Head of the Gambian Army General Lang Tombong Tamba .
The Stepfather of the Army Chief was reportedly seized by the Witchhunters .
Once can ask is there any room for Optimism within the Gambia ?
This Week Amnesty International released a report Indicating that roughly 1,000 people have been detained during this crackdown .
They have been forced to drink concoctions that have led to serious Kidney Problems .
At least two people are known to have perished after drinking these dangerous cocktails .
People who have been taken into custody reported that the " Witch Doctors " were accompanied by Police , Members of the Army and National Intelligence Agency Members .
In Some Cases the " Green Boys " the Personal Protection Force for President Jammeh were escorting the " Witch Doctors " as well .
What could the end results be of this crackdown ?
Could there be a border clash or outright hostilities with Senegal ?
Some of those currently in flight from this Government Action have fled into the Casamance Region of Senegal .
On March 17th some members of the Gambian Military were detained by Senegalese Security Forces as they were chasing reported Witch Doctors across the border .
Currently there are reports that villagers have approached the United Nations seeking redress in this matter .
Another result is that the Political Opposition could form a United Front to capture the Presidency .
This appears to be a viable option as several Political Parties have condemned the Arrest of the head of the National Alliance for Democracy and Development .
There is a Wild Card in this situation .
In recent weeks a New Group has been formed in the United States .
This Group the National Movement for the Restoration of Democracy in the Gambia ( NMRD-G ) was founded by a Gambian Journalist In Exile .
It seeks to restore , nurture and form the Institution of Democracy in Gambia .
In the Short Term the Group plans to purchase Air Time to broadcast Information into the Gambia from Dakar .
The Long Term Goal is to set up and run a Radio and Television Station to broadcast into the Gambia .
The Group also seeks the assistance of the United States in this matter .
This region is once again becoming unstable .
The Narcotics Trade is using several Countries as a transit point to ship Narcotics from South America to Europe .
Recently there has been a series of Coups in the region as well to further highlight the General Instability of Several Governments in the region .
The Actions by the Gambian Security Forces will just add more fuel to the fire in an impoverished region .
That alone should be reason enough for concern .
But Will it ?

We have given out the last of the 10 free WOG downloads .
Thank you to the bloggers who helped us make the point ... there ARE Linux users who will support their developers .
I am not at liberty to divulge the numbers but if you people knew the impact you made by supporting the 2DBoys , you would swallow your teeth .

It 's been one of the loudest excuses I 've heard for people not wanting to use Linux .
" Linux wo n't play my games . "
Well first , that 's not near as true as it was a short year ago .
Second - if it is so , it 's because the people that write the games do n't think you are a market force worth investing in .
That , it seems , is changing as well .
Blogger Gedece brought this to my attention a while back and without his input , I would have not known about it .
Linux Community ... Prepare to get Goo'ed .
Kyle Gabler and Ron Carmel are Indie Game Developers .
They 've both spent some time " in the trenches " with companies such as EA ... they made fairly good money and had steady work , but something ate at them ... something uncomfortable and
nagging .
It was n't the fairy dust and wind chime world they wanted to work in .
Reality can suck ... why make your living in it ?
Most of us have to .
They do n't ... they write games .
And now they 've written a game and ported it to Linux .
This masterpiece has opened to rave reviews ... and reviews by those who count .
82 percent of the people who play this game are likely to have stolen it .
A twenty dollar game and they steal it .
That 's a shame .
The World of Goo is a joyful , giggleful , and beautiful way to completely waste hours of your life .
I know .
I 'm not a gamer .
I lack the dexterity to even tie my shoes correctly , thank Heaven for Velcro straps on my tennies .
So when Kyle sent me a fully - licensed copy of TWOG to test , I was n't exactly thrumming my fingers on the desk waiting for the download to complete .
It was more out of needing to know what I was talking about than anything else that made me navigate to the " games " menu and click the entry .
It 's a good thing I have a bit of discipline or I 'd still be playing the game .
The Question .
It nagged me throughout the gameplay .
Why ?
Although a wildly successful game sales - wise , this 20 dollar bobble is still stolen without shame .
Kyle and Ron refuse to chain their work with DRM or Regions .
Why would you port this masterpiece to Linux ?
We are undoubtably the biggest Jack Benny - level cheapskates on the planet .
Again , the question .
Why Linux ?
Kyle Explains :
" We knew from the beginning that we wanted to make our game available to everyone , regardless of platform .
We 've also always had a secret desire to see the open ideas behind Linux take over .
We met the guy who did our Linux port because he was a fan who created an open wiki for translating our game into a bunch of other languages .
We were surprised - the language contributions from our community were of much higher quality than the translations we received from a paid translation service .
They were so good , and fast , in fact , that we decided to use the community 's translations for our European Wii release .
They even helped us beta test each of the languages . "
Yes , it is available for the Wii ... and Mac and ...
Linux .
With a smattering of Python and coding skills , I knew this undertaking was n't easy .
The genius behind the Linux Port is Maks Verver .
He is the one responsible for the frame by frame marriage to the original Windows game .
He has done some stunning work , and we did n't make it easy for him as will be discussed .
I asked Kyle about the technical problems involved in getting this done for us and I let him run with it .
Some of his remarks strike home with us Linux Zealots but you have to remember , this is a guy who shoots straight ... you can not ask a question and then pout when the answers are n't what you want to hear .
Linux challenges ( technical )
" There were a few small technical hurdles , but Maks is either a genius , or the port was not much trouble at all !
One technical hurdle was with Pulse Audio , which apparently comes standard on major distros like Ubuntu .
It introduces quite a bit of audio lag .
This would be fine for most applications , but it 's not good for games , where the goal is to build an extremely responsive system that feels snappy .
We were able to work with it , and get the game feeling right , but it took a bit of effort .
I realize I 'll get shot for saying this , but in Windows , it just worked right away ! "
" Also , and I 've mentioned this before - Linux is created by too many smart opinionated people !
There are a lot of very good ideas , but it can become difficult for developers to support all the different distro formats , bundles , audio / video systems .
For linux to REALLY take over , it has to be easy for developers to make stuff , and easy for users to get stuff .
It 's one of those things where too many options can be suffocating , and ultimately hurt the cause . "
Linux challenges ( non-technical )
" Our blog stats tell us that only about 5 % or less of our visitors are using a form of Linux , so we were n't sure if there would be much interest from the Linux community or not .
Do Linux users play a lot of games ?
Maybe it 's just a chicken and egg problem where Linux users would play more games if more people made their games available for Linux ?
Our decision to make World of Goo available for Linux users was mostly out of principle - because games SHOULD be available for Linux !
We just released it a few hours ago , so I suppose we 'll find out soon if our decision made any business sense ! "
***** This is an edit 72 hours after the fact .
While I 've been asked not to crow about numbers and specifics , let it be known that the " Linux Community " shattered one - day sales records for 2dBoy sales of World of Goo .
You shattered it by 40 % - h
Hurt the cause indeed .
But there is something else that " hurts the cause " more than that .
Not supporting someone who has labored on your behalf .
We have always said that " We support those who support us . "
Well , it 's time for us to do just that .
This game is gonna run you 20 bucks and will bring you or someone you purchase for , hours of joyful , giggleful entertainment .
You can see an earlier and much more insightful interview with these two here .
OK folks ... we are almost to Christian Einfeldt 's Digital Tipping Point .
Others are recognizing we are here and we have money to spend ... we are all not skinflints that would rather go without than spend a few bucks on ourselves .
Kyle and Ron have donated 10 games for us to give out .
Blog about this great game or tell folks about it in your forums and send us a link ... we will send the first ten that do so a license .
We now get the chance to do what we say we are going to do .
It 's been coming for a long time ... now it 's here .
The " big boys " wo n't give us games ... the little guys will .
It 's time to say thank you .
And just so you know ... I just did .
You can do the same here .
I 'm putting this on the next HeliOS Project Computer we put out .
All - Righty
Then

We 'll begin this first Sunday of Spring 2009 with a couple jokes from last night 's Gridiron Club dinner in Washington -- an annual event where members of the news media and the nation 's political leaders gather to " singe , " but not " burn " each other with hopefully funny speeches and skits .
According to the Associated Press :
Vice President Joe Biden poked fun at Barack Obama 's do - no - wrong reputation .
...
Obama , the first president in decades not to attend the Gridiron Club dinner during his first year in office , could n't make it because he 's busy preparing for Easter , Biden said .
" He thinks it 's about him , " Biden said of the holiday .
Obama spent the weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains with his family .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , the evening 's Republican speaker , had another explanation for the media and politicians assembled at a downtown Washington ballroom for the festivities .
" He 's just not that into you , " Schwarzenegger said , referring to the book and movie with that title .
As for stories making headlines today , they include :
-- The New York Times -- Administration will push for increased oversight of executive pay : " The Obama administration will call for increased oversight of executive pay at all banks , Wall Street firms and possibly other companies as part of a sweeping plan to overhaul financial regulation , government officials said .
The outlines of the plan are expected to be unveiled this week in preparation for President Obama 's first foreign summit meeting in early April .
Officials said the proposal would seek a broad new role for the Federal Reserve to oversee large companies , including major hedge funds , whose problems could pose risks to the entire financial system . "
-- CBS News ' 60 Minutes --
Geithner 's job is safe , Obama says :
In an interview due to be broadcast tonight at 7 p.m. ET , President Obama " tells 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft that New York 's Wall Street executives need to get out of town to appreciate the public 's anger towards them and that embattled Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 's job is safe .
The president even joked that were Geithner to tender his resignation , he would say , ' Sorry , Buddy , you 've still got the job . ' "

-- The Washington Post --
Details coming on plan to buy $ 1 trillion in " soured loans and toxic assets " : " The Treasury Department will unveil the next step in its financial rescue efforts tomorrow , announcing that it intends to create a government body , called the Public Investment Corp. , to finance the purchase of as much as $ 1 trillion in soured loans and toxic assets from ailing banks , according to sources .
The plan calls for the new entity to combine its resources with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , the Federal Reserve and private investors to buy those loans and other assets . "
In this part of the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats newsletter we build Inline :: Rakudo , a perl 5 module that allows us to embed perl 6 code in our existing Perl 5 script .
For example if you happen to build an IDE for Perl in Perl 5 then it might be very useful to be able to run Perl 6 code within your process .
This entry was first sent out as part of the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats .

Welcome back to the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats Last year I proposed a project to integrate Parrot into Padre , the Perl IDE I have been playing with for some time .
I asked TPF for a grant and my proposal was accepted .
Then , just a few days ago I bailed out from the grant as I felt I am not up to the task .
( Ending the Padre and Parrot integration grant ) Yesterday night as I returned from the Telux / OSDC / Israel.pm meeting from Tel Aviv University - where I talked about Perl 6 - I saw Jonathan Worthington on the #perl6 channel on IRC and with his help I managed to put together an initial version of embedding Rakudo into Perl 5 . ( OK , he told me what to write and I typed in ) .
So let me show you how this works .
Embedding Perl 6 in Perl 5 Preparations
We need to prepare the environment a bit for this to work .
I had to do the following : After building Parrot and Rakudo I set the RAKUDO_DIR environment variable to point to the directory where Rakudo was checked out .
I also set the PARROT_DIR environment variable to point to the directory where Parrot was checked out ( in the currently standard setup that would be $ RAKUDO_DIR / parrot ) .
Then I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to $ PARROT_DIR / blib / lib /
This is what I have now in .
bashrc export RAKUDO_DIR=$HOME/work / rakudo export PARROT_DIR=$RAKUDO_DIR / parrot export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PARROT_DIR/blib/lib/
Furthermore I had to make sure the current working directory is $ PARROT_DIR when I run the scripts .
The scripts can reside anywhere .
If I stand in another directory besides the PARROT_DIR I get the following error : " load_bytecode " could n't find file ' PCT.pbc ' current instr. : '' pc 743 ( src/classes /Object.pir:20 ) called from Sub ' myperl6 ' pc 3 ( EVAL_1:3 )
All this I did on Ubuntu / GNU / Linux but I guess it would work on MS Windows as well .
Building Parrot :: Embed I also had to build the Parrot : : Embed module which is in the ext / subdirectory of Parrot .
The following is the process : cd $ PARROT_DIR / ext / Parrot - Embed / perl Build .
PL perl Build perl Build test Hello World
The following Perl 5 script uses PIR - one of the languages of Parrot to load the Rakudo byte - code #!/usr / bin/ perl use strict ; use warnings ; die " need PARROT_DIR " if not $ ENV {PARROT_DIR} ; unshift @INC , ( " $ENV{PARROT_DIR}/ext / Parrot - Embed/ blib/lib " , " $ENV{PARROT_DIR}/ext / Parrot - Embed / blib / arch " , ) ; the above is plain Perl 5 code adding two directories to the @INC include path .
require Parrot :: Embed ; my $ interp = Parrot : : Interpreter ->new ; Firing up the Parrot virtual machine embedded into Perl 5 my $ perl6 =<<" END_PIR " ; .sub myperl6 load_bytecode '$ ENV{RAKUDO_DIR}/perl6.pbc ' .local pmc compiler , invokable compiler = compreg ' Perl6 ' invokable = compiler .' compile '( ' " hello world " . say ' ) invokable ( ) .end END_PIR
This is the preparation of the PIR code .
It first loads the Rakudo byte - code , then invokes it with the given perl 6 code .
my $eval = $ interp -> compile ( $ perl6 ) ; my $ myperl6 = $ interp->find_global ( ' myperl6 ' ) ; $ myperl6 -> invoke ( ' PS ' , '' ) ;
This is where we compile the PIR code , locate the newly created PIR subroutine called myperl6 and then invoke it .
That 's it .
At least it works on my computer ...
Inline :: Rakudo ?
We need more than that and it would be nice if all this could be moved to an external file .
So I created a Perl 5 module that will hide all the details and will allow retrieving values from the perl 6 code .
The way it can be used now is simple but it still needs lots of improvements .
Here is what the end user would write in a perl 5 script : #!/usr /bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ; use Inline : : Rakudo ; my $ rakudo = Inline : : Rakudo -> new ; my $ code = << ' END_CODE ' ; sub f( $n ) { return $ n+1 ; } END_CODE $ rakudo -> run_code ( $ code ) ; print $ rakudo -> run_code ( ' f ( 41 ) ' ) . "
" ; Which will print 42 .
The implementation of Inline :: Rakudo package Inline :: Rakudo ; use strict ; use warnings ; sub new { my ( $ class ) = @_ ; my $ self = bless {} , $ class ; $ self - > {parrot} = _load_rakudo ( ) ; return $ self ; } The part of loading the byte - code of Rakudo was separated to the _load_rakudo function and it is called in the constructor of the Inline : : Rakudo class .
sub _load_rakudo { die " need PARROT_DIR " if not $ ENV {PARROT_DIR} ; unshift @INC , ( " $ENV{PARROT_DIR}/ext / Parrot - Embed/ blib/lib " , " $ENV{PARROT_DIR}/ext / Parrot - Embed / blib /arch " , ) ; require Parrot : : Embed ; my $ interp = Parrot : : Interpreter -> new ; my $ load_rakudo =<<" END_PIR " ; .sub load_rakudo load_bytecode '$ ENV{RAKUDO_DIR}/perl6.pbc ' .end END_PIR my $eval = $ interp -> compile ( $ load_rakudo ) ; my $lr = $ interp->find_global ( ' load_rakudo ' ) ; my $ pmc = $ lr - > invoke ( ' PS ' , '' ) ; return $ interp ; } The run_code method can receive an any Perl 6 code it will compile it and run it returning the results sub run_code { my ( $ self , $ code ) = @_ ; my $ perl6 =<<" END_PIR " ; .sub myperl6 . param string in_string .local pmc compiler , invokable .local string result compiler = compreg ' Perl6 ' invokable = compiler .' compile '( in_string ) result = invokable ( ) .return ( result ) .end END_PIR my $eval = $ self ->{parrot} -> compile ( $ perl6 ) ; my $ foo = $ self ->{parrot}->find_global ( ' myperl6 ' ) ; my $ pmc = $ foo -> invoke ( ' PS ' , $ code ) ; return $ pmc->get_string ( ) ; } 1 ; That 's it .
I hope someone will pick up this code and add a nice API to it so it will be seamless to use it from Perl 5 .
Getting Perl 6
I am using and recommending the Rakudo implementation of Perl 6 that runs on top of the Parrot Virtual Machine .
See the up - to - date instructions on how to get Rakudo That 's it for now .
Comments and Discussion I am always open to comments and criticism ( just have a positive spin to it :-)
So if you find any issue with the examples , please do n't hesitate to let me know .
If you 'd like to ask question about Perl 6 , probably the best would be to sign up on the Perl 6 users list by sending an e-mail to perl6-users-subscribe@perl.org
You can also look at the archive of the perl6 - users list .

The S&P / Case - Shiller monthly home price data was released on Tuesday and showed another abysmal month for home prices .
The Composite 20 index is off by 27 % from the peak and the Composite 10 index is off by 28.3 % .
Yet even with these dramatic price drops , we are still nowhere near a bottom .
We need to reach a 50 % drop from the peak given our current economic conditions .
That is the troubling nature of this current bubble .
It grew to such a level that even 28 % nationwide drops still keep us at overpriced levels .
This is n’t even considering regional markets like Southern California that are now off by 50 % from their peak levels .
Today I want to examine a few key data points as to why housing is still very much miles away from a bottom .
The first chart I want to look at is the Case - Shiller data dating back to the late 1800s .
This chart really helps to put things into context but also the magnitude of our current housing bubble .
In fact , we even see in the chart that prices can even undershoot historical measures if things get really bad like during the Great Depression :
Chart 1 – Case - Shiller Historical Data
Click for sharper image
This is really a beautiful chart to look at because it really encapsulates the mania during this current housing bubble .
Even in more recent peaks and bubbles , we have seen prices go up 30 or 40 percent above the 100 baseline .
Yet starting in the late 1990s this housing bubble took off and went into the 200 range .
That is home prices doubled in less than a decade .
Now this would have made sense if incomes had doubled during that time as well .
Yet that is not the case .
Incomes remained stagnant and now given our raging unemployment rate , are now facing a pull toward the downside .
You ’ll also notice that interest rates are now at historical lows .
Normally , in previous recessions any sign of a market struggle or credit drying up , the Fed would simply lower rates and flood the market with easy money .
They do not have this option in their arsenal anymore .
In fact , we are now realizing that the Fed and U.S. Treasury are nothing more than big debtors .
What the chart above tells us is that prices still have a long way to go on the downside .
And we are talking potentially beyond the 100 baseline .
If you look at the period during the Great Depression , home prices were actually under the 100 level for many years .
Do not fool yourself , this is a deep crisis and to think we ’ll trend easily back down is too optimistic .
Major market moves on the upside usually have equally feverish moves on the downside .
Chart 2 – Nationwide Foreclosures
As you can see from the chart above , right out of the gate we are starting out with record monthly foreclosures .
You also have to factor in that we have multiple foreclosure and loan modification programs in the market yet this chart shows how much of an impact they are actually having dealing with keeping foreclosures at a lower and more manageable rate .
Until we start seeing foreclosures decline , there is absolutely no reason to believe we are nearing a bottom .
Recent figures put nationwide foreclosure resales at 40 to 50 percent of the entire market .
In California , the number is approaching 60 percent .
So with that factored in , only half of sales are happening without some fire sale or distressed history .
That is not a good and healthy market .
When we see the above numbers trending down significantly then we ’ll know we are starting to see a bottom but until that time , any bottom talk is foolish .
Chart 3 – Housing Starts
Another sign of major market distress is with housing starts .
Back in December I was talking about the 80 percent drop in housing starts during the Great Depression and how this played out in the housing market overall .
At the time only a few months ago , the current fall off rate for us was 70 percent .
Well guess what ?
We are now at Great Depression levels .
Housing starts have fallen by 80 percent , today .
This is simply stunning .
Now why is this even significant ?
Well first , it demonstrates the massive glut of housing that we had in our current market .
We built for a decade in a few years .
Much of our economy was built around real estate , finance , and insurance .
So now with fewer housing starts a large part of the economy will sit passively by because we simply do not need more product .
With all the foreclosures hitting the market for the next few years , this only ensures a steady stream of inventory onto the market .
No need for new homes .
Also , there was a high vacancy rate on many properties so until we start seeing these properties filled up with renters , then we are still nowhere near a bottom .
Chart 4 – Home Sales
Nothing really drives this point deeper than the above chart .
What you ’ll notice is that existing home sales although they took a beating , have suffered nothing to what new home sales have faced .
Existing home sales are off their annual rate by approximately 30 % and keep in mind this also includes the fact that nearly 50 percent of all these sales are distressed properties .
These are horrible numbers .
Yet what is more troubling is the pounding taken by newly built homes .
Newly built home sales are off by a stunning 75 + percent annual adjusted rate !
This above chart correlates directly to the 80 percent drop in housing starts above .
Until we see any movement here , again there is no reason to believe we are at bottom .
Chart 5 – Household Debt
Some charts sum up the credit crisis so perfectly .
Here , you can see that starting at roughly 2000 , renting households saw their debt service burden decline while homeowners saw their debt burden shoot up .
You can argue this has to do with merely being a homeowner but this chart goes back to 1986 .
What occurred is homeowners massively over stretched themselves .
Basically , some were never meant to be homeowners yet were sucked from the renting category to the homeowner category .
We had this cultural obsession where everyone deserved to be a homeowner .
Nothing could be further from the truth and more financially destructive .
No one deserves a home like no bank deserves a bailout .
You deserve to own a home if you are prudent and have savings to back you up without going into massive debt .
Yes , this goes for all those “ prime ” borrowers that over extended their household balance sheet because they could n’t resist the granite countertop siren call .
In fact , that group is the most irresponsible .
After all , these are the folks taking out HELOCs to add $ 50,000 pools and going on $ 20,000 vacations .
So anytime someone tells you we are near bottom , just look at the above data and see if there are dramatic changes in the trend .
If there is n’t , then you know full well we are not even close to having that debate .

An old man sorts through rubbish looking for items to sell as crowds swarm Bamboo Pole to buy everything from firewater to firecrackers for Chinese new year 's celebrations in January .
CHINA'S DIVIDE CHINA'S DIVIDE Population : 1.3 billion Rural : 737 million Urban : 577 million Average annual income Rural resident : $ 690 Urban resident : $ 2,300 Source : Chinese government 's Central Rural Work Leading Group , Xinhua News Agency , CIA World Factbook Enlarge By Calum MacLeod , USA TODAY Liu Yulan , 50 , watches her sons , from left , Liu Shulin , 18 , Jiang Hong , 23 , and Jiang Cheng , 20 , play cards outside their parents ' home in Eight Pine Three Village .
Their reunion is marked by worries about the future and employment .
Return of jobless strains China BAMBOO POLE , China 
In times like these , people take their problems to Gao Guohe .
The fortuneteller 's services are available for just 60 cents — cheaper than a pint of sorghum liquor at the distillery down the lane , and far more sobering .
" I tell the truth , even if it 's bad news , " promises Gao , 76 .
Lately , it 's been mostly bad :
Thousands of his neighbors have come home , some for good , after the financial crisis sweeping the globe cost them their jobs at factories 1,300 miles away .
PHOTO GALLERY :
The jobless flood Bamboo Pole From his perch on a bamboo stool near the town market , Gao listens to their worries .
Some are timeless — " Can my son find a wife ? " — but most are contemporary .
" They ask ' Can I find a job this year ? ' " Gao says .
Nationwide , the Chinese government estimates that the number of jobless migrants looking for work may reach 26 million — a gargantuan figure even by Chinese standards , greater than the population of Texas .
Some of them came home to lush but poorer places such as Bamboo Pole that largely missed out on China 's economic boom of the past two decades , forcing officials in Beijing and elsewhere to find a way to reincorporate them into the labor force — or face possibly dramatic consequences .
" We must find jobs for the returning migrants , or there could be social unrest , " warns Liu Yanguan , 57 , the official responsible for creating businesses in Bamboo Pole .
China 's growing unemployment could strain U.S. relations over trade matters as the United States seeks China 's help to deal with North Korea 's nuclear program .
If unrest grows , " China could become more belligerent internationally .
It is in our interests to keep the passions down , " warns Dorothy Solinger , a political science professor at the University of California - Irvine who studies China 's migrants .
Workers ' protests defy ban
Even the communist regime 's strict ban on political protest has n't fully suppressed public anger over the reversal of China 's economy , which slowed sharply in recent months because of plummeting demand for its exports of toys , shoes and other products in the USA .
Workers have protested outside shuttered plants for lost pay and rioted in front of government offices .
The concern is shifting to China 's countryside , where 56 % of the country 's 1.3 billion people reside in a world distinct from the gleaming skyscrapers and superhighways of prosperity found in booming cities such as Shanghai , Guangzhou and Beijing .
For Lei Sanjun , 25 , who spent seven years making sneakers in the coastal factory city of Dongguan in Guangdong province , government help will take too long to transform Bamboo Pole .
" My hometown is backward .
Just look at the poor roads and few factories here , " he says .
The average income for Chinese farmers is about $ 690 a year — less than a third of what is paid in urban areas .
The shortage of well - paying jobs explains why as many as half of the laborers in Bamboo Pole , population 50,000 , decided to seek factory jobs — and why their return is so problematic now .
" It 'll be a troubling year , " predicts Victor Shih , a Northwestern University professor who researches China 's economy .
Many of the jobless migrant workers will stay in cities to try their luck , possibly at smaller salaries .
For those who go home and stay , Shih says , rural life will come as a shock .
" These young people were farmers , but they have lived in big cities , and their expectations are now a lot higher . "
Chen Xiwen , a top rural planner for the Chinese government , says new arrivals will face entrenched rural problems such as pollution and land expropriation .
He encourages government officials not to use force to break up protests .
The government in Beijing is trying to counteract any problems by investing in job training programs and new roads to boost the rural economy .
" This is a big , historic opportunity to invest in rural infrastructure , " says Wen Tiejun , an economist and expert on rural areas at Renmin University in Beijing .
" The government must act now . "
Worries over work
The mood appears calm for now in Bamboo Pole , where people shop with baskets strapped to their backs .
Some traditions highlight China 's ancient culture :
For good luck , residents seek out Chen Xiankuan , the town 's top calligrapher , who transcribes respectful messages to his customers ' ancestors on posters , which they hang in their homes .
Yards from the calligraphy shop is an Internet cafe , where the three Jiang brothers are together for the first time in four years for the Lunar New Year celebration .
The festival was mixed with fears about finding work .
The two older brothers lost their factory jobs , while the youngest works on building a kindergarten in nearby Deyang to replace the one leveled by the massive earthquake May 12 .
The financial crisis " is like an economic earthquake for us migrants , as factory bosses lay off workers , " says Jiang Hong , 23 , the eldest , who used to make insoles for tennis shoes .
" I have been very depressed .
Most of my friends do n't want to go back to the factories , as the wages are low , " he says .
" But if we stay home , we The middle brother is in similar straits .
Jiang Cheng , 20 , made electric switches for toy cars until the factory went bankrupt in September , and the 30 workers lost a month 's wages .
Of the 45,000 workers who returned this year to Jintang county , which includes Bamboo Pole , about 13,000 lost their jobs or quit over lower pay because their hours were cut , says Liao Xiangui , deputy director of the county labor department .
Local governments are trying to help .
Sichuan province started offering $ 11 million in training vouchers , at $ 73 a person , to teach workers new skills .
" We have set up 15 training centers for returned migrants in Jintang , and there are already over 2,000 workers receiving the courses , " Liao says .
There are also programs to assist farmers and migrant workers to set up businesses at home .
" We encourage them to become ' little bosses ' of their own , " says Liu , the Bamboo Pole official .
Returning migrants " often have good commercial contacts and economic knowledge .
We can help them find an existing building or factory and convert it to their needs . "
Jiang
Hong is turning his back on factory life .
He hatched a plan to find a chef in Chengdu , the heart of spicy Sichuan cuisine , to teach him that trade .
" I have n't cooked before , " he admits , " but if I work hard , I could be like my friend who studied cooking for 10 years and now earns $ 1,020 a month in a restaurant in Japan .
That 's a job I could do when I am 40 or 50 .

I ’ve received an overwhelming amount of responses to my article last week : “ I ’m tired . "
I seem to have struck a nerve .
A lot of different reactions , responses and suggestions : some friendly souls have offered me asylum abroad if the need ever arises .
Others have offered to house me domestically , help me financially and join the fight .
One even offered to lead the legions on the northeastern front !
You guys are great .
But it ’s not about me , it ’s about our country ; it ’s about my children ’s future , so I wo n’t leave the country .
Right here is where we need to be in order to fight the government .
I remember when I was growing up in the 70’s .
My father was a retired enlisted man from the Air Force with a $ 600 a month pension .
He went to work at age 40 as a maintenance man at the post office for about $ 15,000 / yr .
All together his income was n’t more than $ 22,000 / yr .
My father bought our house for $ 18,000 on a 15 - year bank note .
It was on a quarter - acre lot and had : 3 bedrooms , a living room , a Florida room ( this was in Clearwater , Fl ) , a den , a full kitchen and dining room , a large back patio and a garage .
We took a family vacation every summer .
And I mean cool vacations : visiting relatives up north , Disney , Sea World , Cape Kennedy , even Las Vegas one summer !
We had 2 cars : my mom drove a Ford Granada and my father a Ford Pinto .
My father played golf every weekend .
He always had a boat ; he loved to fish .
My parents drank beer , whiskey and my mother smoked ( all very expensive vices ) .
We kids were in Boy Scouts , little league , and other social activities .
We got new bikes for Christmas twice and one Christmas even got a T.V .
We had great health insurance ( which I put to the test on many occasion with broken bones ) .
My parents had only gas credit cards .
My father had no 401 ( k ) , no stocks or bonds or any of that crap .
My father even managed to work 6 days a week and paid for my sister ’s college costs out of his own pocket !
Can you believe that ?
My mother was a homemaker and yet they retired in 1985 at the age of 55 !
Where has that life gone ?
A man w/o a college education was the sole provider for a family of 4 like that ; unbelievable .
Now as the sole provider for my family of 4 , with more college education than any one man needs and thousands of dollars in debt for that education , I ca n’t even come close to providing that kind of life for us .
My father sold that house in 1985 for $ 85,000 .
Its current market value is over $ 200,000 and my salary is far below that .
We have no house ( I ca n’t even get a mortgage ) , only one car ( a Ford Focus ) , my 401 ( k ) has become a 201 ( k ) and it looks like I ’ll be working till the day I die .
Our summer vacations are not much more than visiting family in Florida .
We simply do n’t have any money to save anymore .
No college funds for the kids .
No money for a rainy day .
My wife stays home to raise our kids like my mother did .
Oh we pay the bills with the occasional movie or dinner out but that ’s a far cry from the America I grew up in .
I remember everyone talking about “ mortgaging our children ’s future ” back in the 70’s and 80’s when we were running such outrageous budget deficits .
We ’ll that future is here !
We ’re the children and I certainly feel as if I ’m paying the debt on that mortgage now , as I ’m sure other ’s do as well .
So what do we do ?
Well we just work harder .
We work more .
We skimp .
We ’re Americans which means we are convinced that these are uncontrollable hard times that the government will pull us out of with absolutely no thought as to whether they really were uncontrollable or not .
No thought as to the cause , just what we need to do to weather it and let the government do “ its job ”
My point in my last article was a revelation actually : it ’s completely within our power to actually shut the government down with our actions .
According to factcheck.com personal income taxes account for some 45 % ( 2007 ) of the government ’s revenue stream .
It ’s actually quite liberating .
If they twist and finagle the democratic voting system so as to keep those in power , in power , then we ’ll find another medium through which to vote : money .
Every tax dollar withheld is a vote of “ NO Confidence ” in this government .
How simple is that ?
Think they ’ll listen to us now ?
Funny how hitting the pocketbook seems to get their attention so quickly in Washington .
If everyone did what I and others are doing then the government would come to a screeching halt , AND it would come to a halt with minimum violence .
Oh sure they would try to prosecute the first offenders and fund their endeavors by printing more money or borrowing but that would lead to a rapid devaluation of the dollar which would lead to a violent revolt rather than a more peaceful one .
Remember what happened when record labels tried to sue people who were illegally sharing music files ?
That lasted about a year at most .
There were just too many people doing it and the record labels just threw up their hands in defeat and said : if you ca n’t beat ’em then join ’em , and that ’s what they did .
The people spoke ; the people voted with their actions , they voted by withholding their dollars and they voted for a new age of selling and distributing music .
The music industry had no choice but to completely revolutionize the way they do business , its pricing schedule and how they distribute music .
It was a beautiful thing .
We need to do the same thing with the government .
We ’ve seen that it works ; it just needs to be orchestrated and done .
I do n’t want to find ways to not pay taxes legally .
I want them to notice .
I want others to notice .
Since I ca n’t vote for whom I choose and I can’t count on my congressman to do the right thing then I ’ll represent myself and vote for what I know is right for me and other American citizens .
My position is not about the 16th amendment or the legitimacy of the income tax but rather a patriotic act .
How can I , as a law - abiding American , support an illegal government ?
Is n’t that illegal ?
Is n’t that unpatriotic ?
Supporting people that , if they were not in such high offices , would be in prison themselves .
I refuse to acknowledge that these morons are smarter than me .
If the cretins in their infinite wisdom feel the need to lock up an honest man , then I ’ll be freer than I ’ve ever been and freer than they ’ll ever be .
My conscience will be clear , my character , integrity and honor intact and my mind and my soul will be free .
How easy will it be to look at the pathetic puppets of the system : the prison guards , the prison warden , the court lawyers and judges , the cops and the squirmy little IRS agents and feel pity for them not envy that they are outside while I am inside .
They live in a self - imposed prison of ignorance , fear and self - doubt and feel comfortable and safe because they go along with everyone else .
I ’ll get out of prison one day .
They ’ll die in theirs .
Many have asked me to show them what my " Personal Declaration of Independence " will look like .
I ’ll be more than happy to have LRC post it when I ’ve written it .

Since the release of DSL , Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) have been marketing the Internet Bandwidth Speeds of their service to steal customers away from their competitors .
The first battle was Dial - Up vs. DSL .
Followed by DSL vs. High - Speed Cable and of course today it ’s High - Speed Cable vs. Verizon FIOS .
Honestly , the battle for “ Speed ” supremacy will probably never end NOR IS THAT WHAT I WANT IT TO DO . :)
After all , when it comes right down to it , as the growth of the ONLINE services continues ( HULU , YouTube , Streaming Netflix , Amazon Unbox , PORN … ) so do the demands of Faster Internet Connections .
So , as a Groovy Reader , you are in for a treat because today I ’m going to talk about :
How to convert your ISP Marketing Lingo into English
Where you can Test your Internet Speed Sorry , that ’s it
So , let ’s jump right into it !
How to convert Marketing Internet Speed / Bandwidth Lingo into Real English
Be an informed consumer .
It ’s even more important to be a GROOVY informed consumer !
So let ’s take a look at a Verizon FIOS Internet Advertisement and dissect it .
Note : Mbps above is supposed to be written as mbps .
Verizon marketing guys should fix that .
WOW ! 10 mbps Download and 2 mbps Upload !
That ’s amazing !!
Right ?
At those speeds , I should be able to download an entire DVD in …
1 DVD = 4 Gigabytes
4 Gigabytes is 4000 Megabytes
So at 10 Mbps the math would be 4000 / 10 = 400 seconds !
WOW !!
An entire DVD in 6.6 Minutes !
Actually no .
You see , here ’s the problem .
Mbps does not = MegaBytes per second .
Mbps = MegaBits per second .
Let ’s quickly get familiar with the Math of the Verizon FIOS Ad above using 10 mbps :
Speed KiloBit KiloByte MegaBit MegaByte GigaBit GigaByte Abbreviation kbps KBps mbps MBps gbps GBps 10 mbps conversion 10000 1250 10 1.25 0.01 0.00125
Reference : Numion.com has a GREAT Data Unit converter I highly recommend !
So the actual math for a DVD download at 10 mbps would be :
1 DVD = 4 Gigabytes / GB
4 Gigabyte = 4000 Megabytes / MB
4000 Megabytes = 32000 Megabits
32000 Megabits / 10 mbps = 3200 seconds or 53 Minutes
Here are a few more examples of downloading at 10 mbps / Verizon FIOS Ad Above :
Type Web Page Kid’s Picture iTune Song CD DVD Size 100 KB 1 MB 3.5 MB 700 MB 4 GB Download Time Instant .8 Seconds 2.8 Seconds 9 Minutes 53 Minutes
Note :
These are BEST CASE scenarios .
Normally if you get 50 % your speed , you ’re doing good !
Clear as mud ?
Just remember :
8 Megabit ( mbps ) = 1 Megabyte ( MBps )
Okay Geez I understand Megabits already !
How do I check my connection speed ?!
How - To Test your Internet Connection Bandwidth Speeds
There are a couple of places that I frequent for this purpose , and both are dead simple :
Usually , I use Speakeasy.net .
It does n’t have all the eye candy of Speedtest . net , but I like simple and clean .
1 ) Just Open your Browser and Type http://speakeasy.net/speedtest/ in the address bar .
2 ) Once the page loads Click the closest Server Location to begin .
The SpeakEasy site will test out your Download and Upload speed .
When the test finishes , your Upload , and Download speeds are displayed using kbps or Kilobits per second .
In my example , my test came in at 14,740 kbps Download and 11435 kbps Upload
14,740 kbps = 14.7 mbps which = 1.84 MBps or Mega bytes Per Second
Per Second 11,435 kbps = 11.4 mbps which = 1.42 MBps or Megabytes Per Second
Not bad EXCEPT , I ’m currently paying Verizon for the 20 mbps Download and 20 mbps Upload FIOS plan .
It looks like Verizon Owes me some bandwidth ! :)
Personally , I ’m not going to call Verizon and demand my money back .
Why ?
Well , the problem ( that we ’re ALL going to start facing ) is that the bottleneck with Internet access is no longer you and me .
The bottleneck is slowly shifting to Websites and Internet Services .
Websites like Youtube , Netflix or even Speakeasy only have so much bandwidth , so all their customers have to share what they have .
Just think what happens to Speakeasy if 100 FIOS customers all hit the server at the same time to test their internet connection .
Now granted , HUGE companies like Google and Microsoft have super groovy Internet Pipes , but smaller sites do n’t .
And when people like me connect and try to consume a full 20 mbps , the Website / Service might not have enough Bandwidth to give me all 20 mbps .
So be patient .
As consumers get faster Internet pipes , so do Websites and other Online Service providers .
This article was fun to write .
I would LOVE to hear about your Speed Test results !
Do YOUR results match what your ISP sold you ?
In your comments below , please include the following so we can compare and get some perspective :

Speed Test Results
One thing to note , on Windows machines , I recommend running the tests using Internet Explorer .
Running the tests with Firefox I consistently get slower upload speeds ( 4000 - 5000 kbps slower upload ) .
Some say it ’s because the FLASH plugin for IE is faster than Firefox but I have no idea .
Check on your own and post your comments below .
Technology.am ( Apr. 17 , 2009 ) — Clouds are on the horizon and could change the way we use computers forever .
Cloud computing has the potential to bring about irreversible changes in the way computers are used around the world .
“ The cloud computing phenomenon is more than just another technological fad – it combines the benefits of outsourcing and pay - per-use and provides companies with a springboard for further innovation ” , explains Jordi Torres , coordinator of the Cloud Computing ( CC ) research team at the UPC , which works under the supervision of the High Performance Computing Group , is in New York .
In general terms , cloud computing can be described as a web architecture that allows users to work and save information online .
David Carrera , one of the directors of the CC team , said “ The aim is to move all of the applications installed on our computers to a remote location . ”
In other words , to do away with a number of standard components , including operating systems and hard disks , and make them accessible through an online desktop accessed via a standard browser .
The CC team is also researching systems for coordinating the thousands of terminals and nodes that make up the cloud , which is one of the principal concerns of companies in the IT sector .
In the opinion of Ricard Gavaldà , the real magic of cloud computing lies in the automatic and intelligent management of the software and hardware used by thousands of computers : “ By applying artificial intelligence to the cloud , we are hoping to develop a system through which computers can manage themselves ” .
This is known as ‘ autonomic computing ’ .
‘ Virtualization ’ , ‘ utility computing ’ and ‘ software as a service ’ ( SaaS ) are key concepts in understanding the potential of the cloud .
Their basic function is to create multiple virtual machines within a single physical computer to make it more efficient .
Utility computing is the provision of computational resources , such as processing or storage , as if they were traditional public utilities ( electricity , water and gas ) .
The advantage of this system is its low cost , as the hardware required is extremely cheap and the resources themselves are essentially rented .
It will also have a significant impact on the business sector and the wider community , although its specific repercussions in Catalonia are yet to be seen .
While some companies are already working in this field , such as eyeOS and Abiquo , many others in the ICT sector will clearly have to adjust their business strategies to accommodate such far - reaching changes .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( Mormon Church ) has been leading the national crusade against same - sex marriage since President Gordon B. Hinckley issued such a proclamation in 1988 .
The Church showed just how effective it could be beginning in Hawaii in the mid-nineties all the way through to California ’s Proposition 8 in 2008 .
They were involved to some degree with all 30 state elections outlawing same - sex marriage .
The purpose of Mormongate.com is to tell the real truth about the Mormon Church ’s massive involvement and cover - up of this issue .
Nearly all of their activities are intended to be highly secretive .
This strategy has served them well over the past 20 years ; however , we have recently received documentation of just how they operate .
H/T to Mike Tidmus .
“ In my Congressional district in Michigan , there are thousands of UAW employees who have employment contracts , and they ’ve been told they need to renegotiate those contracts and make concessions to justify taxpayer investments .
There are thousands of white collar employees with employment contracts who have forgone promised bonuses and benefits and have taken pay cuts in order to save the companies they work for .
People are sick of this double standard where working class and middle class workers are treated differently than the financial industry executives . ”
“ ‘ Just say no ’ is the right advice to give your teenagers about drugs ; it is not an acceptable response to what our economic policies propose by the other party .

In November , Blue America donors helped replace hapless Republican rubber stamp Joe Knollenberg with a former Michigan state senator who we identified not just as a solid progressive voter -- but as a progressive .
In his introduction at the House Financial Services Committee meeting , Gary showed what a leader does .
Amid a gaggle of finger - pointing partisan clowns , Gary made powerful and important points that went right to the heart of what a congressional hearing is meant to be .
Today all Blue America donors should be very proud -- along with MI - 09 voters -- that it was Gary Peters sitting there and not a shill like Knollenberg .

In a recent TSAC meeting , Travis brought in rather interesting little problem : parsing Roman numerals .
It ’s more difficult than it looks , at least if you want to write beautiful code .
I ’d looked at this a couple of times since the meeting , but today I finally sat down and built a reasonably nice solution to the problem ( in Haskell , of course ) , which I ’ll share here .
I ’ll present the code more or less in the order of my thinking about how to solve the problem , and at a few points I ’ll introduce for the purposes of explanation and example code that is n’t in the real implementation .
I ’ll also entirely pass over the tests and the ( trivial ) code for running the parser on an input file and generating output .
However , you can download the runnable source and play with it yourself if you like ; I encourage you to do so .
So let ’s dive in !
We not only have to convert valid Roman numerals to their Arabic form , but also indicate when a string of characters is not a valid Roman numeral .
Thus , the first step is to figure out just what the rules are .
Having had a couple of quick stabs at this before , and found that it turned out to be a fair amount of work for my tiny little brain , I wanted not only to write down the rules , but write them down in as clear a form as possible so I could read and understand them later .
The beauty of Haskell , of course , is that I can both write down the rules in this very clear way , and have a valid Haskell program that I can execute .
The letters themselves were pretty easy ; we just match up the characters and their values :
i = letter ' I ' 1 v = letter ' V ' 5 x = letter ' X ' 10 l = letter ' L ' 50 c = letter ' C ' 100 d = letter ' D ' 500 m = letter ' M ' 1000
You ’ll note that the letter function does not exist at this point , nor do I even have a type for it yet .
This is the way I work : I first write the perfect , clear , explanatory top - level code that I want , and I worry about implementing the functions ( such as letter ) and determining the types of the functions and their result values , later .
( I ’m a very “ top - down ” programmer these days , which is quite the reverse of where I was ten years ago . )
Now , a Roman numeral can have up to three M s at the beginning , and then after that the rules are similar for the groups of letters within the hundreds , tens and ones , or what I ’ve decided to call “ decades . ”
Each decade uses a combination of letters for the unit ( such as I ) , five of that unit ( V ) , and ten of that unit ( X ) to express what in Arabic numerals are the ones place , tens place , and hundreds place .
( I would have said “ column ” rather than “ place , ” had I not grown up just as we were switching to New Math . )
The key insight here for me was that a decade uses not only the letters representing the unit and five times the unit , but also the letter representing ten times the unit , which is the unit from the next decade up .
We never have a number that big within the decade , but the letter is used within the decade in combination to represent one less than the unit of the next decade ( e.g. , ” IX ” for 9 ) .
The top decade , the thousands , is slightly different in that it can’t combine with decades above it , because there are none .
So we start with up to three M s , signifying thousands , and then have decades for the hundreds ( D and C ) , tens ( L and X ) , and ones ( V and I ) , which all work in the exact same way :
romanNumber = addingUpTo 3 m >. decade m d c >. decade c l x >. decade x v i >.
end
We start with up to three ’ M ’ characters that add a thousand each to the total for this number ( remember m = letter ' M ' 1000 ' above ? ) and then we ’ve got decades of the smaller quantities .
Here I ’ve introduced >. as the sequencing operator , indicating the order in which the components appear .
Note also that I ’ve indicated that the string we ’re parsing must end after the lowest decade ; XIV is a valid Roman numeral , but XIVX is not !
But how does a decade work ?
It turns there are five alternatives .
One , of course , is that it does n’t exist at all : MLXI ( 1061 ) has no hundreds decade .
Otherwise it ’s a combination of the letters where , depending on their position , they either add to or subtract from the total .
So , adding some operators to determine whether a letter is adding or subtracting , using my sequencing operator from above , and adding |. as the alternatives operator , I can list all the alternatives :
decade decem quintum unit = subtracting unit >. adding decem |. subtracting unit >. adding quintum |. adding quintum >. addingUpTo 3 unit |. addingUpTo 3 unit |. nothing
In less mathematical notation , this means we may have one of the following alternatives :
a unit ( I ) before a decem ( ten times the unit , X ) , meaning that we subtract the unit from the decem ( IX is 9 )
a unit before a qunitum , meaning that we subtract the unit from the quintum ( IV is 4 )
a quintum ( V ) before up to three units ( V , VI , VII or VIII )
up to three units alone ( nothing , I , II or III )
or nothing at all , ” ”
And that ’s pretty much it for the rules !
All that ’s left is to implement the various functions I ’ve invented to express the rules .
I do this in a way similar to a standard monadic parser .
( Why did I not implement this as a Monad ?
That ’s an interesting topic for discussion . )
First , we define a state for the parser that holds what remains to parse and the result of our parse so far , if we ’re currently parsing , or otherwise indicates a successful parse or failure .
We also define a function that , given the string to parse , creates an initial state .
I use a ByteString here instead of a String for efficiency1 .
data State = Parsing ByteString Int | Success Int | Failure input :: ByteString ->
State input s = Parsing s 0
Then we declare a type for a parser : a function , that , given a State , returns a new State indicative of the work it ’s done .
romanNumber above is of this Parser type , as are the various things we combine to make that parser .
The sequencing and alternative operators take two Parser s and return a new Parser that combines them in sequence or chooses one .
I also define the priority of the those operators to be the same as the “ and ” and “ or ” boolean operators , to which they are parallel .
newtype Parser = Parser { run :: State -> State } romanNumber :: Parser ( >. ) , ( |. ) :: Parser -> Parser -> Parser infixr 3 >. infixr 2 |.
The run accessor above allows us to get the parsing function out of the Parser , so applying run p to a State will give us the new state produced by parser p .
Now we can create a function that , given a Parser as defined above , runs it and if it finishes successfully , returns the result , otherwise returns Nothing to indicate failure .
We also add a convenience function to run the romanNumber parser on a ByteString .
parse :: Parser -> ByteString ->
Maybe
Int parse parser s = case run parser $ input s of Parsing {} -> Nothing Failure -> Nothing Success n ->
Just n parseRoman :: ByteString ->
Maybe Int parseRoman s = parse romanNumber s
All that done , it ’s time to implement some of the lower - level pieces that make romanNumber and decade work !
After a fair amount of mucking about , I realized that my concept of a “ letter , ” introduced in the first fragment of code at the very top of this post , was missing something essential , though it was very strongly hinted at in the way it was used in decade .
Letters actually do different things depending on their position : in ” VI ” the ” I ” adds 1 to the number we ’re building , but in ” IV ” the ” I ” subtracts 1 .
So let ’s introduce a type to explain this : we ’ll have an operator , that being add or subtract , and the letter function will take that operator and return a parser that makes the appropriate state change the appropriate thing when it parses the letter :
type Op = ( Int -> Int -> Int ) type Letter = ( Op ) ->
Parser i , v , x , l , c , d , m :: Letter
That leads to appropriate type declarations for the adding and subtracting functions we used in decade :
adding , subtracting :: Letter ->
Parser addingUpTo :: Int -> Letter ->
Parser
The definitions of the first two are easy :
adding letter = letter (+ ) subtracting letter = letter (-)
addingUpTo is a little more complex , but fairly obvious when you think about it : it ’s either nothing , or a letter followed by a recursive application of itself .
addingUpTo n letter = adding letter >. addingUpTo ( n - 1 ) letter |. nothing
But what ’s the base case of this recursion ?
Once we ’ve read up to as many as we ’re going to , we stop , and let the next parser in the sequence take over .
We neither consume any letters nor change the number we ’ve calculated so far , which means we do n’t change the state at all .
This is very simply when we have higher - order functions , pack the “ give back what you got ” function into a Parser :
addingUpTo 0 _ = Parser id
If that confuses you , it may help to think of the same thing expressed as a lambda expression returning exactly what it got :
addingUpTo 0 _ = Parser ( \x -> x )
( Note that in the actual program , that base case equation comes before the other one ; we need to match 0 as the first parameter before we try the other equation , which matches anything . )
Now that we ’ve got that , how do we define letter itself ?
Well , it takes a Roman character and amount that it stands for , and produces a function that , given an add or subtract operation , produces a parser that will parse that letter and perform the operation .
letter :: Char ->
Int ->
Letter
Our actual definition looks a bit different from this , though ; it starts :
letter roman arabic op =
What ’s up with this ?
We had two arguments in the type definition , but have three in the equation !
But remember , a Letter is actually an ( Op ) ->
Parser , and an Op is in turn an ( Int -> Int -> Int ) .
So doing standard algebraic substitution here , just like we did in high school ( we ’re now beyond New Math here ) , we have :
letter :: Char ->
Int ->
Letter letter :: Char -> Int -> ( Op ) ->
Parser letter :: Char ->
Int -> ( Int -> Int -> Int ) ->
Parser
So our third parameter , op , is a function that takes two Int s and returns an Int .
But just in case I ’ve not lost you yet , it gets more complex .
Remember , a Parser is actually a wrapped function as well :
newtype Parser = Parser { run :: State ->
State }
so we need to return a function wrapped by handing it to the Parser value constructor .
This is typically done with a lambda expression .
Recall that a State is
data State = Parsing ByteString Int | Success Int | Failure
So , if we had a parser that merely added one to the Int within our state when we ’re in a Parsing state , we could write it as
addOne :: Parser add One = Parser ( \Parsing s n -> Parsing s ( n+1 ) )
or , alternatively expressed using $ instead of parentheses :
addOne = Parser $ \ Parsing s n -> Parsing s ( n+1 )
What we ’re doing here is creating a function that takes a Parsing state , binds the variables s and n to the ByteString and Int within it , and returns a new Parsing state with the same ByteString , but with an Int incremented by one .
We then wrap this function back up into a Parser by passing it to the Parser value constructor .
( This parser does n’t deal with the Success Int and Failure values of State , as befits a simple example designed to break in the real world . )
So now we can look at our full definition of letter :
letter roman arabic op = Parser $ \state -> case state of Parsing s n -> case ( ) of _ | s == empty ->
Failure | head s == roman ->
Parsing ( tail s ) ( n `op` arabic ) | otherwise -> Failure _ ->
Failure
Here we return a parser that , given a Parsing state with a non-empty ByteString whose first character is roman , returns a new Parsing state with the first character of the ByteString consumed ( removed ) , and the parsed value so far having arabic added to or subtracted from it , depending on whether op was + or - .
In any other case , it returns Failure .
It may be helpful to walk carefully through the expansion of adding c .
We have
c = letter ' C ' 100 adding letter = letter (+)
giving us
adding c = letter ' C ' 100 (+)
and then
letter ' C ' 100 (+ ) = Parser $ \state -> case state of Parsing s n -> case ( ) of _ | s == empty ->
Failure | head s == ' C ' ->
Parsing ( tail s ) ( n + 100 ) | otherwise -> Failure _ ->
Failure
If this still is n’t quite clear , it may be helpful to read some of the other examples further on in this article and then come back to this .
But now , we ’re almost done .
We still need to give definitions of the sequence ( “ and ” ) and alternative ( “ or ” ) operators .
The sequence operator runs the first parser and , if it succeeds ( i.e. , returns an updated state that indicates we are continuing parsing ) , runs the second parser on the state produced by the first :
( >. ) :: Parser -> Parser -> Parser a >. b = Parser $ \state -> case run a state of Parsing s n -> run b ( Parsing s n ) _ ->
Failure
The alternative operator does the exact opposite : it returns the state that the first parser produced if it succeeded , but if the first parser fails , instead runs the second parser on the original state :
( |. ) :: Parser -> Parser ->
Parser a |. b = Parser $ \state -> case run a state of Failure -> run b state state ' -> state '
That taken care of , we have only nothing and end left .
nothing , as with the base case of addingUpTo , says “ everything is ok , carry on ” by consuming nothing from the ByteString and not changing the currently calculated value , i.e. , returning the state unchanged :
nothing :: Parser nothing = Parser id
end , on the other hand , is a bit more special .
Recall that it ’s used after we ’ve finished parsing all of our decades , and we should have nothing more , as so :
romanNumber = addingUpTo 3 m >. decade m d c >. decade c l x >. decade x v i >.
end
This is the point at which we either declare success , if we ’ve parsed everything fine so far and there ’s nothing left in the string , or failure if there was a problem earlier on or we think we should be done but there ’s still stuff remaining parse .
( Recall above , I mentioned that ” XIVX ” is not a valid Roman numeral ; the parser would be successful through ” XIV ” and then would fail on the final unexpected ” X ” .
It ’s instructive to work though precisely what decade x v i would do with the above input . )
But there ’s one one more little hitch : addingUpTo and decade both match no input at all .
It ’s of course possible to have a valid Roman numeral with no M s at the beginning , and also with missing decades , as per my example above .
This means that , given an empty string , addingUpTo and the following three decade s will happily match it .
However , the empty string is not a Roman numeral !
Here , we can take advantage of the fact that there ’s no zero in Roman numerals , and that happens to be our initial value of the result ( or really , “ result so far ” ) in the state .
If , at the end , everything matches but our result is still zero , we ’ve been given an empty string instead of a valid Roman numeral .
In that case , we also need to fail .
So our definition is :
end :: Parser end = Parser $ \state -> case state of Parsing " " 0 -> Failure Parsing " " n ->
Success n _ ->
Failure
And now , appropriately enough , on that function we ’ve come to the end of this post , which is more than three times as long as the program itself , including various I/O logic and unit tests that I ’ve not mentioned here .
That ’s a testament to the concision of Haskell .
But more importantly , I think that the highest levels of this program , the first three examples of code introduced in this post , express , much more clearly than usual in computer programming , the specification of what we ’re doing .
That ’s beautiful code .
" Twitter blackout " appears to be the new " march downtown waving placards . "
Emboldened by the success of New Zealand 's recent avatar blackout , a group called Blackout Ireland tries the same approach on the Emerald Isle in an effort to head off graduated response policies from Irish ISPs .
The idea is that avatars on Twitter , Facebook , and similar services will be replaced with a black box , starting today , in protest over demands from the Irish Recorded Music Association ( IRMA ) .
IRMA recently sued the country 's largest ISP , Eircom , and dismissed the suit only when Eircom agreed to disconnect P2P users identified by the music industry for swapping copyrighted files .
Soon after , IRMA pressed its advantage by firing off a strong letter to other ISPs ( one Internet hosting company has posted the letter it received ) .
In the letters , IRMA agrees that ISPs are generally " mere conduits " under European law but that they must still take down copyrighted material when notified of its existence by a rights - holder .
Rather than applying this simply to cases in which the ISP actually has something to " take down " — it might host free subscriber web pages or online storage lockers , for instance — IRMA says that ISPs must actually disconnect repeat P2P infringers and block access to websites like The Pirate Bay .
The letter demands that other Irish ISPs agree to the same terms as Eircom , threatens legal action against those ISPs that do n't comply , and provides only a week in which to respond .
New Zealand has been pushing a similar approach to copyright infringement , but one that came from the government rather than private agreements .
It was due to go into effect last week , but implementation was delayed after ISPs and rights - holders failed to come to terms on all sorts of important questions , such as how many warnings would be given , what the standards of evidence would be , whether a third party would hear customer appeals , and whether libraries and businesses would also be cut off after a couple of infringing transfers were detected .
The same issues are riling up Irish bloggers , including Aubrey Robinson , who describes himself as a " has - been activist and radar maker . "
" These new policies have serious implications for internet freedom , as they open the door for other private companies to obtain similar powers in dictating , without due process , who or what is permissible online , " said Robinson yesterday .
In response to IRMA , Robinson has organized Blackout Ireland ( and the requisite Facebook group ) .
In addition to the avatar blackout , the site also suggests writing one 's representative and the Irish Communications Minister , Eamon Ryan .
( Which is , probably , the more effective approach . )
Despite the bluff certainty displayed in the IRMA letter , graduated response plans have received a sharply mixed reception in Europe , especially when the ultimate penalty is total Internet disconnection .
The European Parliament has already expressed its displeasure with this approach , as has the German government .
Even the UK , which is considering some form of mandated graduated response , has taken disconnection off the menu .
The thinking in most cases is that the penalty simply does n't fit the crime — and such moves would likely lead to a rash of court cases .
While the Irish situation would appear to more closely mirror France and New Zealand 's approaches , both of those countries had industry consultations before giving government backing to any specific scheme .
In Ireland , graduated response appears to be much more of a one - sided imposition — an " our way or the highway " approach to dealing with ISPs that seems sure to invite resistance .
YAZAN AMMARI
Gamer
How did the renowned “ clowN ” -- dreaded , revered and awesomely lethal with a SG552 commando high - powered assault rifle -- end up back home with Mom and Dad ?
ClowN , not so long ago , was a hero to every kid whose parents ever nagged that computer games were a waste of time .
He earned nearly a quarter of a million dollars over three years as a professional player of “ Counter - Strike : Source ” -- your ultimate run -around - and - shoot - everything - in - sight - before - someone - blows - you - up kind of game .
It ’s played by about 10 million people .
But these are tough times -- canceled tournaments , dwindling prizes , sponsorless players adrift like wandering samurai .
“ Suddenly , I ’m Yaz , ” said the 23 - year - old college senior as commandos scrambled across his computer monitor .
“ Just Yaz . ”
Yazan Ammari -- tan and lanky , with a huge , cheeky grin -- is back in his old room with a neon - green gaming trophy doubling as a lamp and foam - board prize checks leaning against the wall .
The Marina del Rey apartment that he lived in rent - free while playing in a now - defunct DirecTV series on gaming is gone .
His family had to help him pay off $ 6,000 in credit card debt .
He is about to graduate from Cal State Northridge in business marketing and has no idea what he ’s going to do .
“ There ’s nothing to do but move on , ” Yaz said .
The atmosphere at home these days is laden with a certain I - told - you - so kind of feeling .
While his mom and dad -- Roxy and Monty , both Jordanian immigrants -- are proud of their only son , they ’re also worried .
In the living room , they watched CNN as headlines scrolled across the bottom of the screen -- mass layoffs , squatters taking over foreclosed homes , people committing suicide over financial troubles .
Yaz was practicing in his bedroom .
Got to stay sharp .
“ He has to finish school and start working , ” Monty said to Roxy , ignoring the occasional sound of explosions from their son ’s room .
“ There is a time to move on . ”
Father and son have talked .
Yaz admitted that he ’s terrified to graduate .
His father said he could always work at the family ’s tow - truck business .
Yaz stood up to stretch his legs and grab a snack .
He grimaced as he walked past his closet .
Inside , shelves were crammed with software , hard drives and video graphics cards he had won over the years .
Somewhere , he thought , was a pair of diamond earrings .
His BMW M3 with loads of extras is long gone .
He ’s embarrassed to say what he spent on the 19 - inch deep - dish customized black rims .
“ Stupidity , ” Yaz said .
“ Sheer , utter stupidity . ”
Now , he ’s grateful to be driving the used Toyota Highlander that his father bought him .
His father had warned him to be frugal .
“ ‘ Buy what you need , not what you want , ’ ” Yaz recalled .
“ Parents know everything . ”
So , he is spending less time playing and more studying and helping his father .
He ’s launched a website , Gamerworld.net , devoted to professional computer game players and fans .
Maybe he can make some money off it .
The last four years have n’t been a waste , Yaz reasoned .
He ’s traveled .
He ’s negotiated contracts .
He ’s figured out how to do his own laundry .
Sitting back down at his computer , his fingers blurred across the keyboard as he led a team through a sprawling , abandoned train depot somewhere in the Middle East .
He threw a flash - bang grenade .
The sound of the explosion rattled the room ’s windows .
His mother peeked into the bedroom and closed the door .
Try as he might , the dream of making a comeback still haunts his thoughts .
He ’s tempted by a fundraiser offering a $ 50 prize and all the soda he can drink .
There ’s a tournament in Montreal where the cash prize would pay for his airfare and hotel . . . if he wins .
The sums are paltry , but the thought of being forgotten is worse .
“ It ’s kind of like those one - hit wonders in a song , ” he said .
“ Now people just look at them , laugh at them , they do n’t even think about them .
Nobody even knows their names anymore . ”
He glanced at his watch and sighed .
7:30 p.m .
He had classes the next day , starting at 8 a.m .
“ I should call it an early night , ” clowN told his teammates via headset .
Groans and profanity filled his ears .
“ Really ? ” asked Solange “ fireb0 mb ” LeBreton , 18 , from her home in Quebec .
“ Loser , ” said Tarik “ rockyte ” Elkhatib , 22 , in Ohio .
Outside , the moon was rising , bright and fat .
ClowN was restless , drumming the desk with his fingertips , eyes roaming the screen .
A crackly voice called through the computer speakers .
Lock and load . . . lock and load . . . lock and load . . .

On the Edge : Staff writer P.J. Huffstutter and photographer Genaro Molina are traveling the country , chronicling the hopes and struggles of Americans in this time of economic hardship .
Gerald F. Joyce admits that when he saw the results of the experiment , he was tempted to halt further work and publish the results immediately .
After years of trying , he and his student Tracey Lincoln had finally found a couple of short but powerful RNA sequences that when mixed together along with a slurry of simpler RNA building blocks will double in number again and again , expanding 10 - fold in a few hours and continuing to replicate as long as they have space and raw material .
But Joyce was not fully satisfied .
A professor and dean at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , the 53 - year - old molecular chemist is one of the founding champions of the " RNA world " hypothesis .
That is the notion that perhaps life as we know it life based on DNA and enzymatic proteins , with RNA acting for the most part as a mere courier of genetic information evolved out of a simpler , prebiotic chemical system based mostly or even solely on RNA .
Of course , the idea is plausible only if RNA can support evolution on its own .
Maybe , Joyce thought , his synthetic RNA could help prove that possible .
So he and Lincoln spent another year working with the molecules , mutating them and setting up competitions in which only the fittest would survive .
In January , one month before the bicentenary of Charles Darwin 's birth , they announced the results in Science .
Their little test - tube system did indeed manifest nearly all the essential characteristics of Darwinian evolution .
The starting 24 RNA variants reproduced , some faster than others depending on the environmental conditions .
Each molecular species competed with the others for the common pool of building blocks .
And the reproduction process was imperfect , so new mutants Joyce calls them recombinants soon appeared and even thrived .
" We let it run for 100 hours , " Joyce recalls , " during which we saw an overall amplification in the number of replicator molecules by 1023 .
Pretty soon the original replicator types died out , and the recombinants began to take over the population . "
None of the recombinants , however , could do something new that is , something that none of its ancestors could perform .
That crucial missing ingredient still separates artificial evolution from true Darwinian evolution .
" This is not alive , " Joyce emphasizes .
" In life , novel function can be invented out of whole cloth .
We do n't have that .
Our goal is to make life in the lab , but to get there we need to increase the complexity of the system so that it can start inventing new function , rather than just optimizing the function we 've designed into it . "
That goal clearly seems possible , because the RNA replicators in Joyce 's lab were relatively simple : each has only two genelike sections that can vary .
Each of those " genes " is a short building block of RNA .
A replicator , being an RNA enzyme , can gather the two genes and link them together to create an enzyme that is the replicator 's " mate . "
The mate is set free and gathers two loose genes , which it assembles into a clone of the original replicator .
Recombinants appear when a mate is unfaithful and links up genes that were never meant for each other .
Recombinants did not , however , create genes .
It may be possible to engineer a system that does , or to add complexity by giving each replicator more genes with which to work .
Scott K. Silverman , a chemist at the University of Illinois who has done pioneering work with DNA enzymes , hopes that " by capturing Darwinian evolution in new molecules , we might be able to better understand the basic principles of biological evolution , " much of which is still somewhat mysterious at the molecular level .
Joyce and Lincoln , for example , noticed in their postmortem examination of the experiment that the three most successful recombinants had formed a clique .
Whenever any clique member made a reproduction error , the result was one of the other two peers .
The next big step toward the creation of life in the lab , Joyce says , will be to engineer ( or evolve ) a set of synthetic molecules that can perform metabolism as well as replication .
Geneticist Jack W. Szostak of Harvard Medical School has developed nonbiological proteins that bind ATP , an energy - carrying chemical crucial to metabolism .
Szostak 's lab is also attempting to fashion protocells that encase RNA within tiny spheres of fatty acids , called micelles , that can form , merge and replicate spontaneously .
Even if biochemists do manage to cobble RNA and other basic compounds into some form of synthetic life , the engineered system will probably be so complex at first that it will hardly prove that natural life began in some similar way , four billion years ago .
Joyce 's replicators consist of a mere 50 chemical letters , but the odds of such a sequence appearing by chance are roughly one in 1030 , he notes .
" If it were six or even 10 letters long , then I 'd say we might be in the realm of plausibility , where one could imagine them assembling spontaneously " in the primordial soup .
From Test - Tube Life to Diagnostic Tools
Creating life in the laboratory would be a momentous occasion for humanity , even if it is more molecular than Frankensteinian .
But there may be more mundane uses for such chemistry .
A paper in press at Nature Biotechnology , Gerald F. Joyce says , describes how his lab at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , has modified RNA replicators so that they must perform a biochemical function to reproduce .
The winners of that evolutionary race will be good candidates for a medical diagnostic , he thinks .
Scott K. Silverman of the University of Illinois says the idea has merit : " Suppose you need to do detection in a dirty environment with lots of different chemicals present say you want to find Salmonella inside peanut butter .
That 's hard to do without purification steps .
It would be useful to be able to evolve the diagnostic system so that it still finds the signal despite all the noise . "

Advertisement Firefighters are continuing to tackle a fire in a building in central London , London Fire Brigade ( LFB ) has said .
Crews were called to Field House in Chancery Lane , near Holborn , at about 1540 GMT on Wednesday .
The fire is in the five - storey Immigration and Appeals Commission building , which was being refurbished at the time .
No -one was trapped inside .
An LFB spokesman said 75 firefighters are at the site " making sure it does not spread to adjacent buildings " .
The fire spread very rapidly , one student said it was just a little fire on the roof and 10 minutes later it was this blaze I photographed
Jasper Pandza , eyewitness
See more of your pictures LFB said most of the roof and a part of the fifth floor of the building caught fire .
The spokesman said : " We are doing salvage work on floors up to the fourth floor . "
It added that 130 people had been evacuated from the building before fire crews arrived .
Parts of two other adjacent buildings have also been evacuated , LFB said .
Three 2.3 stone ( 15kg ) propane cylinders were found on the site .
Fifteen fire engines continued to tackle the blaze on Wednesday night .
A Tribunals Service spokesperson said : " We are at present trying to contact those who were due to have hearings in the building tomorrow to advise them not to attend . "
Police have cordoned off Chancery Lane at the junction with Fleet Street and stopped traffic from entering .
Jasper Pandza , who is based at the Maughan Library at King 's College , said : " The fire spread very rapidly , one student said it was just a little fire on the roof and 10 minutes later it was this blaze I photographed .
" The library building was luckily not evacuated . "
Chancery Lane is an historic area , with some parts dating back centuries .
It derives its name from the historic High Court of Chancery .
The area is predominately occupied by the legal profession and consulting firms .

So how does it feel ?
I comply , daily .
I reify .
I reproduce the relationships of power and domination with every move I make within this state - sanctioned routine I call my life .
I consent , and furthermore , I benefit .
If the global system was a huge pyramid ( scheme ) , I would be positioned with other over - educated people who have access to both personal credit and a social safety - net , with many humans below me .
If I ( and presumably you , reader ) exist somewhere above the middle , where the pyramid starts to visibly narrow and no one has to worry about a next meal or a warm , safe place to sleep , what provides the base of this structure ?
Could it be the children who walk over rubble and crave water ?
Or the oil profits made out of countries like Ecuador , where the swamps bleed crude oil and the beautiful countryside is devastated and carcinogenic after being raped by Exxon ?
Or even the structural certainty that the people at the bottom of the pyramid are so desperate that men scramble to scavenge rotting chickens culled after they were exposed to bird flue ?
No one wants to believe their access to a big screen TV is predicated on the misery of women and children in Congolese refugee camps or the despair pervading Gaza , but I argue that it absolutely is .
Forgive me ( and thank you ) those of you who are reading this but who have not always lived with the assurance of material security - I do not speak for you .
Everyone else , friends and peers ( and particularly us white , middle - class Americans ) , your life is a lie .
I guess first we have to agree to the premise that the US is an empire that arose from and was maintained through the marginalization , impoverishment , dependency , envy , admiration and , to some degree or another , subjugation of the third world .
From the genocide and land expropriation integral to US relations with the original North American inhabitants , to Jefferson ’s Empire for Liberty and the illegitimate Louisiana Purchase ( If I were Spain I would totally sue France for the recovery of the illegally alienated lands ) and the violent and dishonorable seizure of half of Mexico , evidence of the imperial history of the US is gaining traction with many academics .
Countering the narrative of American Exceptionalism , or at least Benign American Inevitability is not easy , however .
Sure slavery was bad and the early Americans were mean to the Indians , but all of that was a long time ago and now we have affirmative action , casinos and high profile black heroes ( Obama , I love you , but our nation is not yet post- racial ) .
Thus we are redeemed .
I mean if the alternatives are so great then how come everyone wants to come here and be me ?
1898 marks the start of the episode of US imperialism , according to official history , as if before that the US was a non-expansionistic republic and after a beacon for democracy .
Do n’t be fooled .
The empire upon which our excesses , luxuries , comforts and maybe even subsistence depend , runs on deprivation like a 4X4 runs on gas – and had for the century before we liberated the Cubans from their own independence movement and slaughtered and water - boarded our way to victory over the Philippine nationalist insurgency .
But because our nineteenth - century continental empire was built on the backs of Africans , in the blood of Indians and at the expense of Mexicans it ’s bad manners to acknowledge past crimes .
That ’s the kind of imperialism gentlemen agree to forget .
Delusions of Anglo - Saxon racial supremacy justified the spread of the republic .
Racism saved the republic by providing a rationale for the land seizure that was necessary for the material abundance that fueled the US .
The American narrative combined constructions of whiteness with popular misunderstandings of Darwin ’s theory of evolution and became a movement that inspired both images of American identity and German fascists of the intra-war period .
Hmmm weird crossover .
The spread of the yeoman farmer across the land of the free , fulfilling the inevitable providence of Manifest Destiny somehow connected to a racial ideology that justified lynching , ethnic cleansing , and the Holocaust ?
( I know , Godwin ’s law )
Perhaps the continuity of the American imperial project , from Jefferson to Monroe , from Jackson to Polk , and from McKinley to Roosevelt was briefly interrupted by the Great Depression and FDR ’s Good Neighbor policy ( and then only if you ignore the US intervention in Mexican politics , economy and culture ) , but quickly resumed after WWII .
Domestic and international organizations funded by the participants of the social compact ( taxpayers ) used self - conscious and at times slapstick methods to assert cultural , economic and political hegemony .
The American empire extended through Central and South America , Southeast Asia , and the Middle East .
What a heady time of US empire : coups in Guatemala and Iran ; civil war in Vietnam ; assassination in the Congo ; and cultural indoctrination in West Germany
As Africa and Asia underwent the contortions of decolonization , the US imperial project remained veiled behind the Cold War bipolar ( dis ) order .
A world with opposing sides , divided so neatly along religious , economic and philosophical lines is easier to understand .
Godlessness v God , Corruption v Integrity , Stagnation v Vitality , Destitution v Wealth , East v West , Evil v Good .
With organizing principles like that a little empire - building can seem unimportant to imperial subjects ( Americans ) and even benign to willing participants ( Americans ) .
From other perspectives , the 50s , 60s and 70s were all about the US brutally suppressing the occupied zones – whether directly through warfare , dictatorships , assassinations , coup d’etats , and death - squads , or less obviously through market forces , structural violence and cultural hegemony .
The Carter administration was a brief and incomplete hiatus from the most blatant of machinations , but where government stood down , private industry stepped up .
Once Carter left power the leaders of expansionist corporations became cabinet members in the next administration .
The men who privatized water in Bolivia led the Thatcher - Reagan neo-liberal revolution .
Synchronicity in political and economic interests works best .
For empire anyway .
International organizations had begun to develop the third world in earnest in the 1960s , working in lockstep with US foreign and corporate interests .
Corrupt , opportunistic , or blackmailed ( whatever ) , the political leaders of third - world countries entered into agreements with global financial organizations – loans to develop infrastructure and exploit natural resources .
Their immediate economic potential regularly over - estimated , however , nation after nation became hopelessly overextended and indebted .
Now hobbled by foreign debt and destructive trade agreements , emergent third - world countries became candidates for the type of privatization , austerity , neoliberal reforms , impoverishment , land expropriation , famine , civil war , and debt - relief programs we have seen over the last few decades .
Now “ softened up ” emergent countries like India and Argentina have dropped their protective tariffs , stopped subsidizing their farmers and businessmen , and political leaders all over the world have privatized previously guaranteed necessities like water .
Social services ( education , public health services ) are curtailed while natural resources are exploited without restraint .
This beautiful system has produced modern day success stories for capitalism like Ecuador – poisoned , poisonous , and locked in financial agreements with the IMF that has 95 % of the nation ’s oil profits going to foreign speculators as cancer rates sky - rocket as a consequence of environmental decimation .
Clinton did n’t exactly dismantle the empire , and this examination does not exonerate Democrats , but lately Republican administrations have been giant empire - building daisy chains .
The current Bush administration stroked those in their circle so relentlessly that up to a million of the world ’s civilians have died in Iraq , creating obscene profits for those with interest in arming enemies , starting wars , inciting warfare , suppressing warfare , supporting warfare , practicing warfare , and reconstructing after warfare .
The blood and pain of the women and children ( dismembered in Afghanistan , broken in Iraq , uprooted in Colombia , orphaned in Guatemala ) does n’t deter the spread of US Empire , but instead serves as an industrial - grade lubricant .
The more graphic and gratuitous the horror the more invisible it is to the American people .
That many consequences to our privileges are unimaginable .
It is difficult to empathize with humanity on a large scale , and besides , discussing that magnitude of carnage is un-American .
Even the deaths of American troops are subsumed by the heroic narrative and inevitability of sacrifice during warfare , while those questioning the legitimacy of our wars are treated as unhelpful and sophomoric .
Well the course of empire pulls all in its wake , and the current direction of our American Empire bodes ill for planet earth and our species .
If the world is wracked by environmental destruction , energy crises , food scarcity and terrorism , it is at least partly ( mostly ) as a consequence of or in reaction to the rise of the hegemon ( us / Us ) ?
So what are we ?
An imperial warrior state , consolidating capital and extracting wealth in service to a partisan and greedy God ( Mammon ?
Baal ? )
The most aggressive example of a potentailly lethal human - based virus attacking the life systems of Planet Earth ?
Animals entangled in webs of significance we ourselves have spun ?
Masters of our fate , both individual and collective ?
Each one a revolution of personal agency waiting too long for a spark ?
The blood wo n’t wash off of my hands , but then I ’m kind of morbid .
And I tend to think its all about me , therefore when I see the devastation wrought by my nation ’s pursuit of domination , wealth , and impunity at the expense of so many fellow humans ( innocents and criminals ) I mark my complicity as a factor in the war crimes .
I benefit from the death , famine , and atrocities that prop up the pyramid , and my consent props up the empire .
I comply , I reify .
My life is a lie .

A usually quiet U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Cemetery , has been unusually active lately .
The National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona is a beautiful 225 acre facility located in Phoenix .
For the past 30 - 45 days in the early hours of the morning until sunset , a massive construction operation has been underway .
Major amounts of earth have been excavated out about 9 - 10 feet deep and 600 - 1000 feet wide .
There is multiple locations on the property like this .
From the satellite view there appears to be more sections that have been covered with the concrete lids and backfilled to look as if nothing is there .
ABC rock is put in place under the burial vaults for good drainage and solid bedding .
This will help not contaminate ground water sources from decomposition of human bodies .
The cleanliness of the heavy equipment operation and the large perfect cuts of earth is im pressive .
These Massive concrete boxes are transported from a nearby storage yard on various privately owned flatbed semi-trucks , then unloaded and put into place a half mile away at the actual mass grave site .
They are installed tight together side by side with no space in between .
An interview was conducted between my friend and a truck driver involved in this operation .
After beating around the bush for ten minutes , the driver admitted “ I got paid a whole lot of money to speak good english . ”
Take it for what it ’s worth but that sounds suspect .
The truck driver also admitted “ Each burial vault holds four caskets . ”
I took note that if caskets were not used you could fit 40 bodies or more in each one .
So if these were to hold four troops each and the truck driver did know what he was talking about ; this would mean that there are plans in advance for over 4000 U.S. soldiers deaths .
If these are not to contain caskets and only bodies are inserted there could be room for over 40,000 civilians bodies .

With the verdict of first - degree murder in , the teen convicted in the killing of Stefanie Rengel now faces a battle over whether the court will sentence her as an adult .
" The Crown moves for an adult sentence , your honour , " prosecutor Robin Flumerfelt told Justice Ian Nordheimer on Friday after the three - woman , nine - man jury had left .
The court will reconvene on Tuesday to start that aspect of the case .
The stakes are high for 17 - year - old convicted murderer M.T. , who can't be fully named under the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act .
If she is sentenced as an adult , M.T. would get life in prison and be barred from seeking parole for at least five years .
Adults face an automatic sentence of life in prison with no parole eligibility for 25 years .
However , M.T. was 15 at the time of the offence -- New Year 's Day 2008 .
If Nordheimer decides M.T. is to be sentenced as a youth , she would face a sentence of no more than 10 years , with six of those to be served in custody and the remaining four in the community .
Her identity would remain officially hidden from the public .
CTV legal analyst Steven Skurka said Saturday that Nordheimer would look at M.T.'s age , maturity and character when considering what to do .
He would also consider the offence 's seriousness and circumstances .
Two Mississauaga sisters convicted of first - degree murder in 2005 for killing their mother received the maximum 10 - year sentences .
In 2007 , a Medicine Hat , Alta . girl was found guilty of first - degree murder in the deaths of her parents and little brother even though they found her boyfriend Jeremy Steinke did the actual killing .
She also received the maximum 10 - year sentence .
She has been undergoing a program of intensive psychological treatment .
Steinke , an adult when he killed the three , received the automatic first - degree murder sentence for full adults upon conviction in December 2008 .
The murders in that case occurred in April 2006 when the girl was only 12 .
The girl pressured Steinke , almost a decade older than her , to kill her parents because they disapproved of her relationship .
They decided to also kill her brother , who was only eight , because they feared he could identify them .
The two had exchanged online love letters .
The girl had written the following to Steinke : " I hate them ( her parents ) .
I have this plan .
It starts with me killing them and ends with me living with you . "
The Crown alleged that the girl counselled Steinke to kill her family rather than take part herself , although Steinke claimed at his own trial that she slit her own brother 's throat .
M.T. is n't alleged to have killed Rengel , someone she had never actually met .
Instead , she was shown to have pressured her boyfriend D.B. , now 19 , to kill the victim .
On Jan. 1 , 2008 , D.B. is alleged to have stabbed Rengel six times very close to her East York home .
He will face trial on a charge of first - degree murder in the fall .
For months before that , the jury heard evidence that the two had intensively discussed killing Rengel .
The Crown submitted huge volumes of evidence relating to the electronic communications -- instant messages , cellphone records -- of M.T. and D.B .
M.T. had essentially told D.B. that he would n't have any sexual relations with her until Rengel was dead .
On the day of the murder , she had taunted him about being interested in another boy .
She reportedly bragged in a Facebook exchange with a friend that she made love with D.B. after Rengel 's death .
Police videotaped an interview with M.T. about 12 hours after Rengel died .
Det. -Sgt. Steve Ryan conducted that interview , which many saw as chilling because of the blase nature of M.T. , and he called this case a first for him .
" The age and the planning -- a 15 - year - old girl planning a murder .
It 's rare , " he told reporters on Friday after the verdict .
His opinion is that the crime committed warrants an adult sentence .
M.T. had been very expressionless throughout the trial , but cried after the conviction was registered .
However , in the interview , the only time she cried is when she talked about the problems that Rengel had allegedly caused in her relationship with D.B .
Ryan said M.T. 's outburst in the courtroom was the only sign of remorse he 's ever seen from her -- if indeed it was remorse .
While some of Rengel 's friends rejoiced in M.T. 's conviction , another saw it as bittersweet .
" It 's not something we can celebrate as a victory .
It 's a tragedy all around , " said the Rev. Scott Patton of Presteign - Woodbine United Church .
He said Stefanie will be missed : " She was somebody that everybody just liked being around . "
With a report from CTV Toronto's James MacDonald
This picks up from some comments posted here , and also from a Twitter debate I had with a musician from the London Symphony .
( Thanks , @londonsymphony ! )
And it all comes from my suggestion that classical music organizations consider Twittering during concerts — sending out real - time thoughts about the music , from musicians , for instance , or ( a very interesting option , for me ) from members of the audience .
Some people do n’t like this — and understandably , of course — because they feel that it would interfere with listening .
That ’s a point to take seriously .
We have a tradition ( not as long - established as we think it is , but still very firmly established now ) of listening to classical music in silence , without distractions .
And yes , this has been head - butted a little in recent years , with video screens at concerts , and other innovations .
But still most concerts are untroubled with distractions , and many people want to keep it that way .
I want to make it clear that I sympathize with them , and that — no matter what innovations might appear — there should be concerts , maybe the majority of concerts ( to serve our existing audience ) , where nothing will trouble people who want to listen silently .
Where I take issue , though , is when the discussion turns ideological — when people say that classical music absolutely demands silent listening , and when some of us start drawing large conclusions about our society , saying ( as my London Symphony debating partner said ) that we ’re bombarded by music everywhere , and that we might be losing the ability to truly listen .
I do n’t agree with either point .
I ’ve said many times that the entire pre-19th century classical repertoire — with the exception , I ’d imagine , of church music — was created for performances when the audience talked while the music played , and applauded whenever they heard anything they liked .
There ’s no sign that composers disapproved of this .
Quite the contrary — we have evidence from Mozart and Verdi , for instance , that they were highly gratified .
Now , I could even name advatnages we ’d get from an active audience .
If we want their attention , we ’ll have to earn it .
And it ’s not at all clear to me that 18th century audiences did n’t pay attention .
Mozart ’s famous letter about the premiere of his Paris Symphony shows an audience apparently alert to what he compose .
He teased them by starting the last movement quietly , instead of with the loud , resounding coup d’archet — stroke of the bow — that in Paris was traditional .
They immediately shushed each other , taken by surprise , then burst into cheers when , a few bars later , Mozart brought in the whole orchestra , forte .
They understood the joke that was played on them .
There ’s also an anecdote about the opera audience in Lully ’s time , a raucous bunch , who ’d scream insults to each other , among much else , while the operas were performed .
A star singer could n’t appear ; his substitute was bad ; the audience immediately noticed , and began insulting him .
He answered wittily , and from then on , they listened to him happily .
I once programmed the first movement of the Paris Symphony at a concert with the Pittsburgh Symphony , which I was hosting .
I read Mozart ’s letter , and told the audience that they were free to clap whenever they felt like it .
The results were fascinating .
The applause , first of all , varied greatly from point to point .
People clearly were listening very hard .
And when they clapped , and then something new started in the music , they fell silent , to listen to what happened next .
It soon was clear to me that Mozart designed the piece for that , constantly bringing in attractive new ideas , to hold the audience ’s attention .
None of which , of course , tells us what would happen if people started talking , or clapping , or tweeting during something as profound and serious as the last movement of the Mahler Ninth .
But now let me ask what we think our present audience is doing ?
Yes , they ’re sitting quietly , but are they paying attention ?
To what extent do their minds wander ?
A little ?
That ’s for sure .
My mind wanders during concerts , and I ’m a musciain .
We ’re all human .
But maybe the audience has minds that wander a lot .
Maybe they pay very sketchy attention .
How do we know ?
And might they pay more attention if they had something else to do , besides sitting still and listening ?
Virgil Thomson — who , to judge from his writing , was an acute listener — wrote once that he listened more carefully if he had a little bit of distraction .
I ’ve found the same is true for me .
If I force myself to concentrate , to pay attention , my mind will sometimes wander .
( A famliar happening , I might add , in any form of meditation . )
If I distract myself a little — if , let ’s say , I look at an app on my iPhone that displays floating clouds — I ’ll focus better on the music .
( I do that at home , with CDs .
Not at concerts . )
And now suppose I got up and moved .
Even danced to the music .
I think that would focus my attention even more .
Even in the Mahler Ninth .
( The last movement , I might add , is one of my touchstones for great music that deeply gets to me . )
Likewise if I was talking quietly to a friend about the music .
“ Listen to that …interesting countermelody there …oh , no , the conductor completely missed the point , a moment ago … ” I think I ’d pay much closer attention than I do at concerts .
And no , i’m not necessarily saying that people should talk to each other during Mahler .
If 1000 people did it all together , the chaos might outweigh the benefits .
Or maybe not !
Have we tried this ?
What would actually happen ?
Let ’s also remember that there are cultural differences about these things .
( Which is where ideology comes in . )
In western , European - derived culture , it would be highly inappropriate to react out loud when music is played at a church service .
Highly inapprorpriate !
Just about irrrelgious .
But if you go to a gospel church , the rules are turned around .
There , it would be highly inapprorpriate not to react , not to cry out something when the music ( or the preacher ) gets to you .
Likewise in Kabuki .
Connoisseurs will bark out little syllables , when something onstage seems especially good .
Our kind of silent listening goes back , I think , to a long - established trope of western philosophy , in which the mind is hugely favored over the body .
The mind is rational , responsible ; the body is childish , dangerous , and primitive .
So we sit in silence when we listen to profound music ( or music that ’s thought to be profound .
But is this what we still have to believe , now that we have a multicultural society ?
Other cultures see the world quite differently , and give the body equal weight .
So what would happen if we listened to classical music with our bodies — and with our feelings visible , for all to see — instead of mainly with our minds ?
Maybe we ’d listen better , as I ’ve been saying .
And maybe the established habit of silent listening actually gets in the way of concentration !
This is a point that ’s not original with me .
But I think it ’s worth taking seriously .
Take a group of people .
Shackle them .
Tell them they can’t move , or speak , or visibly react in any way .
And now expect them to pay full attention to Mahler .
I do n’t think they ( or I ) can do it .
But if I could participate in the experience , put my body and my voice into action alongside the music , I think I ’d listen harder .
And I think that ’s also true of the existing audience , although they might be hesitant or even shocked to try this , even as an experiment .
Which leaves one more point of ideology — the idea that people are n’t listening to anything , because we ’re drowned in music .
This reminds me of something I read in an exhaustive history of Britain in the late ’ 50s and early ’ 60s , Never Had It So Good , written by Dominick Sandbrook .
In the late ’50s , just as in the US , British cities started growing suburbs .
British intellectuals hated the suburbs , and wrote extensively abo
ut how alienating they were , how people were atomized , isolated from each other , losing all community ties .
And then some sociologists looked into this , and found out what suburban life was actually like .
It was n’t anything like what the intellectuals had feared — and assumed , without any data at all , to be reality .
People in the suburbs formed community groups , looked after each other when anyone got sick , and did n’t behave in any way as the intellectuals had assumed .
I fear that we in classical music may be in the same position , when we look at music outside the classical world .
Of course there ’s music everywhere .
I myself do n’t often mind it , and might suddenly find myself looking up with pleasure when ( as happened a while ago ) the background music at an airport turns out to be a song I really like , and whose words do n’t suggest background music at all , the Pet Shop Boys ’ “ Rent . ”
But suppose the music is largely trivial , and might in some way trivialize both the idea of music , and the spaces where background music plays .
Why do we assume that nobody outside the classical music world resists that ?
In fact , popular culture is full of debates about things like that .
There is n’t anything anyone in classical music says about mass - market pop music that rock critics do n’t already say , and often much more strongly .
Nobody hates Celine Dion , for instance , as much as rock critics do .
And if you get at all involved with pop music , you see people listening to it very hard and carefully , and making detailed critical judgments .
So if mass - market listening is some kind of problem , classical music is n’t the only antidote , and maybe not the most effective one .
Serious pop music , entering the same cultural arena ( loosely speaking ) as mass - market pop , is far better placed to combat whatever ills mass - market pop might encourage .
Which would mean that the listening habits we ’re used to in classical music might have nothing to do with these larger debates .
We know , many of us , how we like to listen , and we should n’t be deprived of that .
But our listening is n’t the only way to pay serious attention to music , and is n’t the only answer to whatever ills music in society at large might get caught up in .
If notes underlying even some of these mortgages were improperly assigned or lost , that will surely complicate pending legislation intended to allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms for troubled borrowers .
A so - called cram - down provision in the law would let judges reduce the size of a loan , forcing whoever holds the security interest in it to take a loss .
But if the holder of the note is in doubt , how can these loans be modified ?
Bookkeeping is such a bore , especially when there are billions to be made shoveling loans into trusts like coal into the Titanic ’s boilers .
You can imagine the thought process : Assigning notes takes time and costs money , why bother ?
Who ’s going to ask for proof of ownership of these notes anyhow ?
But as the Fernandez case and others indicate , bankruptcy judges across the country are increasingly asking these pesky questions .
Two judges in California  one in state court , another in federal court  issued temporary restraining orders last month stopping foreclosures because proper documentation was not produced by lenders or their representatives .
And in another California case , a borrower ’s lawyer was awarded $ 8,800 in attorney ’s fees relating to costs spent litigating against a lender that could not prove it had the right to foreclose .
California cases are especially interesting because foreclosures in that state can be conducted without the oversight of a judge .
Borrowers who do not have a lawyer representing them can be turned out of their homes in four months .
Samuel L. Bufford , a federal bankruptcy judge in Los Angeles since 1985 , has overseen some 100,000 bankruptcy cases .
He said that in previous years , he rarely asked for documentation in a foreclosure case but that problems encountered in mortgage securitizations have made him become more demanding .
In a recent case , Judge Bufford said , he asked a lender to produce the original of the note and it turned out to be different from the copy that had been previously submitted to the court .
The original had been assigned to a bank that had then transferred it to Freddie Mac , the judge explained .
“ They had no clue what happened after that , ” he said .
“ Now somebody ’s got to go find that note . ”
“ My guess is it ’s because in the secondary mortgage market they have been sloppy , ” Judge Bufford added .
“ The people who put the deals together get paid for the deals , but they do n’t get paid for the paperwork . ”

While the Caprica pilot goes on sale Tuesday , the series will not air until 2010 .
Caprica is a religious experience .
That 's not to say the highly anticipated Battlestar Galactica prequel , which will be available in DVD and digital download formats Tuesday , is a blinding experience that will transform you forever .
But the movie - length pilot makes it clear that theology will play a huge part in the series when it hits the airwaves in 2010 , just as it did in Galactica .
In the " uncut and unrated " Caprica pilot , there are no nuclear explosions , no grimy spaceships , no sexy or deadly encounters with robotic Cylons .
Aside from a bloody assassination and some gratuitous topless shots , the show almost completely lacks the action and hard - edged sci- fi eye candy that helped give Galactica its gritty appeal .
Instead , Caprica delivers a broad , deliberately paced introduction to the themes that will presumably drive the show : the tension between science and religion , the dangers of religious zealotry , the racism that can simmer in a societal melting pot , the nature of humanity in a world filled with sentient machines .
( Spoiler alert : Minor plot points follow . )
None of this is new , especially to fans of the recently wrapped Galactica , but luckily producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick have imported to Caprica other hallmarks of their award - winning Sci Fi Channel series as well : the lean writing , the strong acting , the exceptional soundtrack by Bear McCreary , the Cylons .
Galactica fans get their first glimpse of the shiny cybernetic creations about a third of the way through the 93 - minute pilot .
It 's a welcome blast from the future past that boosts the show after a somewhat sluggish start .
Like one of Galactica 's less - frenetic episodes , the Caprica pilot unfolds languidly , introducing the Graystone and Adama families and framing the show 's central themes .
The clans ' wounded patriarchs , successful Caprican roboticist Daniel Graystone ( played by Eric Stoltz , The Butterfly Effect ) and tough Tauron lawyer Joseph Adama ( Esai Morales , Jericho ) are drawn together in the wake of a terrorist attack that shatters their families .
Polly Walker , right , looks as if she will be a powerful force in Caprica .
Image courtesy Universal Studios Home Entertainment * * Lots of languid cigarette - smoking follows .
The two men become unlikely friends , only to eventually be pushed apart as Graystone becomes obsessed with bringing his dead teenage daughter Zoe ( the perpetually wide - eyed Alessandra Toreson ) back to life , or something like it .
Stoltz transforms from a shallow Caprican technoyuppie to a Frankenstein - inflected mad scientist .
And Morales brings the kind of backbone needed to convincingly play the father of the boy who will eventually helm Galactica .
The adult female leads — Graystone 's wife , Amanda ( Paula Malcomson , Deadwood ) , and Clarice Willow ( Polly Walker , Rome ) — get less screen time , but these strong actresses will undoubtedly shine as the series continues .
Playing the part of a religious school administrator with ties to the monotheistic cult Soldiers of the One , which is seducing teens on the technologically advanced planet Caprica , Walker shows just a smidgen of the deliciously manipulative creature she played so well in Rome .
Let 's hope Moore and Eick give her plenty of room to turn up the heat in future episodes .
Set 58 years before the Cylons ' sneak attack on humanity , the Caprica pilot does not deliver the kind of explosive action that turned Galactica into a nail - biting sensation .
Instead , it is a little like the " begat " - riddled genealogical sequence that opens the New Testament :
It draws much of its tension from the knowledge of what lies ahead .
The characters are richly drawn and ripe for further exploration .
And the show 's willingness to tackle religion , immigration , corporate espionage and racism right out of the gate indicates that Moore is framing up another thoughtful sci-fi series .
Caprica could become another sacred text for sci - fi fans yearning for brainy television .

Addendum :
In the press release announcing Caprica 's premiere , Sci Fi
Channel makes it clear that there are two reasons for the pilot 's release so long before the series will be aired .
One is to capitalize on the buzz from Galactica 's series finale .
The other reason : To " get viewers ' feedback before production on the Caprica series begins this summer , " according to Mark Stern , Sci Fi's executive vice president of original programming .
Wired.com encourages you to start that process in the comments section below .

" Are We All Socialists Now ? "
That was the plaintive title of a panel discussion at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington .
The word " socialist " is being heard all over America these days as the federal government takes over banks , tells automakers what to do and tightens regulations in an effort to pull our economy out of its current tailspin .
The label is not generally intended as a compliment .
To many Americans , socialism means being governed by the government - suffocating under layers of bureaucracy that sop up tax dollars and smother individual initiative .
And that 's the positive view .
Some critics carelessly lump socialism together with anarchism or even communism .
After invoking the " s " word at the recent conservative conference , former Arkansas Gov.
Mike Huckabee said , " Lenin and Stalin would love this stuff . "
He conveniently forgot , or perhaps never knew , that most American socialists were sworn enemies of Soviet Communism .
The view from Milwaukee is radically different .
I 'm not a socialist and never have been , but I can testify that Socialism - with a capital " S " - was one of the best things that ever happened to this city .
Without realizing it , even the most red- blooded capitalists are enjoying the fruits of their efforts , from spacious parks to clean streets and from a working infrastructure to an expectation , however frequently disappointed , of honest government .
Before the Socialists took charge , Milwaukee was just as corrupt as Chicago at its worst .
Our mayor at the turn of the 20th century was David Rose , a political prince of darkness who allowed prostitution , gambling dens , all - night saloons and influence - peddling to flourish on his watch .
Grand juries returned 276 indictments against public officials of the Rose era .
" All the Time Rosy " escaped prosecution himself , but district attorney ( and future governor ) Francis McGovern called him " the self - elected , self - appointed attorney general of crime in this community . "
In 1910 , fed - up voters handed Socialists the keys to the city .
Emil Seidel , a patternmaker by trade , won the mayor 's race in a landslide , and Socialists took a majority of seats on the Common Council .
The election was not a fluke .
Seidel served from 1910 to 1912 , Daniel Hoan from 1916 to 1940 and Frank Zeidler from 1948 to 1960 .
No other big city in America entrusted its government to the Socialists , much less kept them in office for most of 50 years .
That record makes Milwaukee unique in the nation .
What did the Socialists stand for ?
In his tellingly titled memoir , " A Liberal in City Government , " Zeidler described the party 's tenets as a hybrid of lofty thoughts and real - world concerns :
" The socialist movement was inspired by the hope of a brotherhood of workers , the Cooperative Commonwealth ; by a fierce opposition to war ; by a belief in the rights of people ; by a passion for orderly government ; and by a contempt for graft and boodling . "
Where had Socialism come from ?
It came , first of all , from Germany , in the baggage of assorted intellectuals who had fled a failed revolt against royal rule in 1848 and transplanted their ideals in Milwaukee .
It also came from the city 's huge population of industrial workers , many of them German , who were attuned to any and all appeals to class consciousness .
And it came from the fertile mind of Victor Berger , the Austrian immigrant who became the movement 's chief strategist .
Left - leaning parties always have been famously fractious , prone to splintering over doctrinal fine points .
Berger saw through the ideological trees to the electoral forest .
He became a convinced gradualist - an " evolutionary moderate , " in Zeidler 's phrase - who believed that the " cooperative commonwealth " would come only after a long period of education and reform .
How better to educate and reform than by governing ?
The Socialists set out to win elections , and they built a remarkably effective campaign organization .
It was based on a hand - in - glove alliance with organized labor and fueled by the famous " bundle brigade , " a platoon of party workers who could reach any household in the city with literature on any issue in any of several languages within 48 hours .
And what did they do once they were in office ?
They governed , first of all , with unimpeachable integrity .
Berger was fond of declaring that honesty was the highest virtue to which a Democrat or a Republican could aspire .
" With us , " he said , " this is the first and smallest requirement . "
The Socialists applied that honesty to the practice of creative government .
Contrary to popular belief , they did not try to socialize everything in sight .
With the exception of the streetcar company , whose services they felt belonged in the public domain ( and eventually got there ) , they accepted the American premise of private ownership .
When one of Zeidler 's 1948 opponents charged that he would socialize the corner grocery store if he were elected , Zeidler promptly went out and got the endorsement of the Independent Grocers Association .
The key to understanding Milwaukee 's Socialists is the idea of public enterprise .
They did n't just manage , and they did n't just enforce laws and regulations .
They pushed a program of public necessities that had a tangible impact on the average citizen 's quality of life : public parks , public libraries , public schools , public health , public works ( including sewers ) , public port facilities , public housing , public vocational education and even public natatoria .
Underlying their notion of public enterprise was an abiding faith - curiously antique by today 's standards - in the goodness of government , especially local government .
The Socialists believed that government was the locus of our common wealth - the resources that belong to all of us and each of us - and they worked to build a community of interest around a deeply shared belief in the common good .
The results were plain to see .
After years in the political sewer , Milwaukee became , under " sewer Socialists " Seidel , Hoan and Zeidler , a model of civic virtue .
Time Magazine called Milwaukee " perhaps the best - governed city in the U.S. " in 1936 , and the community won trophy after trophy for public health , traffic safety and fire prevention .
The health prize came home so often that Milwaukee had to be retired from competition to give other municipalities a chance .
The Socialists governed well , and they did so without breaking the bank .
Contrary to another popular myth , these were not tax - and - spend radicals intent on emptying the public coffers .
They were , in fact , every bit as frugal as the most penny - pinching German hausfrau .
The Socialists managed civic affairs on a pay - as - you - go basis , and in 1943 , Milwaukee became the only big city in America whose amortization fund exceeded its outstanding bond obligations .
It was , in other words , debt - free .
I 'm aware that running a city is different from solving a global economic crisis .
The scale of the problems confronting the Obama administration is worlds removed from the difficulties any Milwaukee mayor has faced .
But let 's not allow " socialist " to become a dirty word in the current debate .
As it came to life in Milwaukee , the Socialist movement had a moral gravity and a passion for results that still resonate in our civic life .
Honesty , efficiency , creativity , frugality ?
If that 's Socialism , let 's bring it back tomorrow .

Brokerages with Free Stock Trading
Do n’t you want to trade stocks for free ?
As recent as a decade ago , free stock trading was pretty much a oxymoron .
I mean , why would someone offer something for free when others were paying up to $ 100 per trade with full service brokers ?
Fast forward a couple short years and these days , everyone is asking “ How Do I Get Free Stock Trading ? ”
A Little History of How We Got to Free Stock Trading
As the Internet became more and more popular during the dot com boom , companies such as E - Trade and Charles Schwab started offering low commission stock trades by giving traders a “ do it yourself ” user interface .
This was the era of the discount brokerage .
The change was revolutionary because we no longer needed to call some broker up to not only place a trade but listen to his / her sales pitch on financial products that needs to be sold .
Slowly , the competition amongst discount brokerages heated up and commissions started coming down even more but no one ever came close to the $ 0 trades for obvious reasons .
Eventually , it happened .
Zecco Trading was born with $ 0 free trades .
This again took the industry into another plateau of pricing standards .
Nowadays , there are a few options for free stock trading so let ’s explore these in more depth .
E - Trade IRA with Free Trades for 60 Days
E - Trade as mentioned is one of the more established discount brokerage in the industry , but they too have jumped on the free trades bandwagon ( if only temporarily ) .
E- Trade is offering new accounts free trades for 60 days , plus up to $ 600 ..
E - Trade Free Trading Details
Individual , Joint , and Retirement Accounts are Eligible
Commissions will be deducted like normal , but the account will be reimbursed for the full amount
This is actually 500 free trades within 60 days , and you need to fund the account with at least $ 10,000
It ’s hard for me not to recommend E - Trade because I ’m a happy user of its services .
If you are looking for free trades , then this is a decent option but join because you are looking for a good discount brokerage with reasonable fees and good overall user interface and service .
WellsTrade from Wells Fargo
I ’ve been a Wells Fargo customer since I got my first checking account so it was easy for me to consider them when I had to rollover my IRA .
WellsTrade is Wells Fargo ’s DIY investment option and the neat thing about it is that they give you 100 trades per account as long as your combined assets with them are over $ 25,000 .
This means that if I have a Roth IRA , Rollover IRA , and a taxable account with them , I get 300 trades a year for free !
WellsTrade Free Trading Eligibility
Combined assets with Wells Fargo of $ 25,000 or more
100 free trades per year , $ 5.95 thereafter
Thoughts of Wells Trade
While the user interface is not as robust and intuitive as E - Trade ’s offering , it gets the job done .
Sure , it took a while to get used to and some screens show real time data while others show delayed quotes and others that show yesterday ’s closing cost but it works .
Another thing I noticed is that enrolling in DRIP through Wells Trade requires calling a representative , while I can do it all online through E - Trade ’s interface .
This is not a major hiccup for people who just need to call once to enroll everything they have ( and everything they will ever buy ) into DRIP but if you cherry pick every stock into DRIP and you trade frequently , it may become a hassle .
Of course , it ’s hard to argue with 100 commission free trades a year per account so weigh the pros and cons .

Merrill Edge ( aka Merrill Lynch aka Bank of America Investment Services )
BofA also has its own free trading service .
While it does n’t have a slick name like “ WellsTrade ” , it trumps everyone with 30 commission free trades per quarter if you have $ 25,000 combined balance with them .
However , make you sure read all the fine print if you are going to enroll because I found something called an semi-annual maintenance fee of $ 50 if you do n’t at least have one of the following :
a BofA personal checking account
$ 50,000 combined household balance with them ( I assume this means everyone in your family and not just you )
A Columbia Funds or Funds Solutions mutual fund position
( variable - priced funds only ; excludes money market mutual funds ) .
( variable - priced funds only ; excludes money market mutual funds ) .
Six trades or $ 150 in commissions in the last 12 months ( free trades does n’t count )
As I do n’t have an account , I cannot comment on the usability of it but I ’m pretty sure it ’s very similar to Wells Trade ’s offering in that you get what you pay for .
Conclusion of Free Stock Trading
Maybe it ’s due to marketing , but it seems like Zecco is a popular choice when I was doing the comparison .
I would recommend Zecco only for those that do n’t really need the comfort of having great customer support .
For those that do , consider WellsTrade .
Last thing to note is that when you are looking for a good brokerage account , you should not only consider trading cost but also the user interface , customer support and whether there are any extras .
For example , a company like may cost you money every time you trade , but at a low commission of $ 4.95 , you may find that it ’s worth it to pay .
The world 's richest children 's literature prize has been awarded to an organisation that has spent 20 years working to promote reading on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
The Palestinian Tamer Institute for Community Education beat contenders including Quentin Blake , Michael Morpurgo and Eva Ibbotson to take the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award , which is worth SEK5 m ( £ 422,000 ) .
The prize , which is intended to increase interest in children 's literature around the world , is given annually to an author , illustrator or an organisation that encourages reading .
Set up in 1989 in response to the educational needs of the Palestinian community during the first intifada , the Tamer Institute for Community Education works across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with children and young people to develop alternatives and supplements to formal education .
The Astrid Lindgren judges praised the centre 's " perseverance , audacity and resourcefulness " , which they said had " stimulated Palestinian children 's and young adults ' love of reading and their creativity " .
" Under difficult circumstances , the Institute carries out reading promotion of an unusual breadth and versatility , " they said .
" In the spirit of Astrid Lindgren , the Tamer Institute acknowledges the power of words and the strength of books , stories and imagination as important keys to self - esteem , tolerance and the courage to face life . "
The award was set up seven years ago in memory of the " deeply humanistic spirit " of the much - loved Swedish author Astrid Lindgren , creator of Pippi Longstocking , with previous winners including Maurice Sendak , Philip Pullman and Sonya Hartnett .
The Tamer Institute will be presented with its prize on 2 June by Sweden 's crown princess Victoria .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
Fox Broadcasting 's move this season to offer the new drama " Fringe " with limited commercial interruption is showing some success , with audiences showing better - than - average recall of the ads , according to a new survey .
In an era when an increasing number of viewers watch their shows on digital video recorders -- skipping ads in the process -- Fox NWSA , +0.75 % NWS , +1.01 % ( NWS ) decided to see what would happen if , during " Fringe " and another drama , " Dollhouse , " it aired fewer , and shorter , commercial breaks .
The bet was that viewers would pay more attention to the ads they do see .
It calls the experiment " Remote Free TV , " and research issued by ad agency Magna Global IPG , +2.01 % suggests that the plan worked .
" We 're really trying to look for ways to keep viewers tuned to the commercials , " said Steve Sternberg , executive vice president of audience analysis at Magna Global .
" So we 're working with broadcast and cable networks to figure out how best to restructure commercial pods to enable that . "
Magna Global selected a random sample out of 20,000 TiVo viewers on Feb .
3 . Of those surveyed , 60 % recognized that the show had shorter commercial breaks than other programs .
During the program , Fox runs messages , known as bumpers , that say " ' Fringe ' will return in 90 seconds . ' "
About 36 % of those surveyed fast - forwarded past the ads .
Respondents were asked to write in the names of any commercials the remembered seeing while watching the show .
Some 10 % of " Fringe " viewers correctly recalled at least one ad .
This was nearly twice as a high a percentage as during any other Tuesday night drama , including popular offerings " Law & Order : SVU , " " NCIS , " " Without a Trace " and " The Mentalist . "
Asked if they saw the show 's advertisers more or less favorably , 34 % said they saw them more favorably .
Some 62 % were neutral , but the favorable number was quite high , said Sternberg .
" That 's a giant number .
Most people are going to say ' neutral . '
But if you have a high positive number , that 's a very good thing . "
In the DVR environment , 56 % of " Fringe 's " commercials were played back , Magna Global found , well ahead of the primetime average of 40 % .
" Fringe " viewers also took note of movie ads , with 14 % of respondents correctly remembering at least one trailer .
Previous studies done by Fox with research firms Innerscope and IAG seem to support Magna 's data , but those were based on " Fringe 's " pilot episode , which was heavily promoted .
Fox Broadcasting is owned by News Corp. , which also owns MarketWatch , the publisher of this report .
" I think it was very effective , " Sternberg said of the experiment .
" The problem financially was that it was much more expensive for advertisers to buy those spots [ on ' Fringe ' ] , so a lot of advertisers did n't want to do it without knowing what the results would be .
So for Fox , the higher rates were n't expensive enough to offset the fact that there were fewer commercials . "
Kevin Reilly , head of Fox Entertainment , has said the network will wait until the end of the season to make a final determination about the Remote Free TV format .
Whatever Fox decides , said Sternberg , " it gives us some idea of the dynamics of limited commercial pods , and maybe some of the dynamics we need to be looking at as we go forward . "
Robotic crawler carries you to safety in an earthquake
by Dhiram Shah
Soon to be inducted in Yokohama ’s fire department is this robotic crawler which is designed to carry a human from the disaster zone to safety .
In case of an earthquake rescue workers can load an injured person in the crawler which will then automatically carry it from the site to relief operations .
It has four wheel belts and can easily move over rubble and other obstacles .
The onboard motor is powerful enough to carry a 110 kg person .
The crawler constantly measures the patients blood flow and other vital signs .
It has infrared cameras which allow it to be operated remotely in the night and harsh weather conditions .

Wind powered Greenbird reached speeds of 126.1 mph A British engineer from Hampshire has broken the world land speed record for a wind - powered vehicle .
Richard Jenkins reached 126.1mph ( 202.9 km/h ) in his Greenbird car on the dry plains of Ivanpah Lake in Nevada .
Mr Jenkins told the BBC that it had taken him 10 years of " hard work " to break the record and that , on the day , " things could n't have been better " .
American Bob Schumacher set the previous record of 116 mph in 1999 , driving his Iron Duck vehicle .
" It 's great , it 's one of those things that you spend so long trying to do and when it actually happens , it 's almost too easy , " Mr Jenkins told the BBC .
The Greenbird is a carbon fibre composite vehicle that uses wind ( and nothing else ) for power .
The only metalwork used is for the wing bearings and the wheel unit .
Sail away
The designers describe it as a " very high performance sailboat " but one that uses a solid wing , rather than a sail , to generate movement .
Mr Jenkins , from Lymington , spent 10 years designing the vehicle , with Greenbird the fifth vehicle he has built to try to break the record .
Richard Jenkins spent 10 years trying to break the record Due to the shape of the craft , especially at such high speeds , the wings also provide lift ; a useful trait for an aircraft , but very hazardous for a car .
To compensate for this , the designers have added small wings to " stick " the car to the ground , in the same way Formula 1 cars do .
" Greenbird weighs 600 kg when it 's standing still , " said Mr Jenkins .
" But at speed , the effect of the wings make her weigh just over a tonne . "
Richard Jenkins spent much of his childhood sailing on the South Coast of England and from the age of 10 was designing what he calls " radical contraptions " .
He has also built a wind powered craft that travels on ice , rather than land .
" Now that we 've broken the record , I 'm going back on to the ice craft .
There 's still some debate as to whether travelling on ice or land will be faster , " he said " But I think we 've got some time .
126.1 mph was a good margin to beat the record and I think it will be some time before anyone else breaks it . "

California unemployment statistics hide full impact of recession
By D. Lencho and Rafael Azul
17 March 2009
" Figures often beguile me , particularly when I have the arranging of them myself ; in which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force :
‘ There are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies and statistics . ' "
— The Autobiography of Mark Twain
Nowhere does the above observation more aptly apply than in the realm of employment statistics .
According to official statistics , unemployment in the US is now at 8.1 percent and at 10.1 in California .
Dire as they are , these figures vastly understate the actual impact of the current crisis on working people .
They fail to take into account underemployed and discouraged workers , not to mention those fully employed in low - wage jobs that do n't pay enough to meet basic needs .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS )
Web site , " people are considered employed if they did any work at all for pay or profit during the survey week .
This includes all part - time and temporary work , as well as regular full - time , year - round employment .
Persons also are counted as employed if they have a job at which they did not work during the survey week , whether they were paid or not .... "
For this last inclusion , the Web site lists examples like vacation , illness , child - care problems , " industrial dispute " and others .
But it does n't stop there .
Two hypothetical cases are offered by the BLS as earning the " employed " designation .
One is a jobless 16 - year - old young man who helps his father with chores around the farm for free .
The other is a housewife who helps out her husband at his computer store Fridays and Saturdays .
Neither of these people — nor similar cases — would figure in the calculation as being unemployed .
According to the BLS , " Persons are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job , have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks , and are currently available for work .
Those who have given up looking for work — known as discouraged workers — are n't counted as unemployed either . "
This official sleight of hand leads to consistent misrepresentation of the seriousness of the economic straits that many working people and their families find themselves in .
The economic crisis in California anticipated the economic crash of the fall of 2008 by more than a year .
Unemployment began to rise in the state in December 2006 .
Since then more than 7 million California workers have lost their jobs .
Millions more have had their wages cut and their hours reduced ; others have been forced to take lower paying jobs , for which they are overqualified , and are thus under - employed .
An article in the 6 March Guardian cites Sung Won Sohn , economics professor at California State University Channel Islands , who " said the jobs report understates reality and the effective unemployment rate was more like 14.8 percent when considering those too discouraged to look for work and part - time workers who want to go full - time . "
The consequence of this has been a massive increase in demands for Food Stamps , General Assistance and other government welfare transfers .
A team of World Socialist Web Site reporters visited an industrial area in Los Angeles County .
The workers to whom they talked — two factory workers whose workweek is down to four days ; a union carpenter who has n't worked in two months ; a " payday advance " worker whose hours have been cut — bear witness to the concealment of the uncertainty and pain felt by those who are employed , yet are seeing their hours and incomes shrink .
Their words paint a picture of increasing hardship .
" Now everything is tough "
José Cejas and his son
José Cejas is a member of Carpenters union Local 409 .
José is from Mexico , and he has been in the US for nine years .
Forty years old , he lives with his wife , their two young sons and two older daughters .
He has n't worked for two months .
The WSWS interviewed him at a laundry .
Asked about the reduction in his work , José replied , " More than half , I think .
At first they 'd laid us off a week , and then we 'd work a week .
This year things got worse .
I have been two months without work . "
Formerly , the relatively high wages compensated somewhat for the seasonal nature of his job , " plus the little bit we make on the side and unemployment . "
But all that has changed .
" It took us by surprise .
In my line of work , the months of December and January are always slow .
From February on , one starts to see more work .
Last year was very slow as well .
" My unemployment check is not enough , so we have to adjust .
We 're in a real squeeze .
Now we 're spending the little bit that we 've saved . "
The family still has some savings , he said , " but they 're disappearing .
" Now everything is tough .
It 's harder to get out .
We rent .
The rent is very expensive .
Right now I 'm paying $ 900 a month . "
José 's co-workers have all felt the pinch .
" Many of my friends that I talk to are also without work .
They 're carpenters and others in construction work . "
Union members go to a hiring hall to find work .
" They have a waiting list and you have to call daily to keep on it .
For example , on Friday you have to call a number to hold your place on the list . "
Before , workers had to wait " a week , 15 days at most ; now people are being made to wait way too long .
It 's very slow .
Right now there are about 300 people on the jobs list , waiting to work . "
Though José did n't express an opinion about the Obama administration 's stimulus package — " Politics does n't interest me much .
I 'm only concerned about my family , " he told us — when asked , " Do you think the government should give more money to working people ? " he answered , " not more money , but more work . "
As to whether people should have the right to a job , he replied , " Well yes , one has the right to go forward .
There has to be some way to progress . "
" Now we do n't eat the same "
María Gómez and Alejandro González work at a Golden Tiger Chinese food factory .
The factory has cut the workweek to four days .
María has worked there for about 20 years .
Two of her sons , 21 and 26 , live with her and her disabled husband .
She agreed to be interviewed at a bus stop near her job .
María said that so far , the company has n't laid off anybody .
" Oh no , but things are very slow .
There are about 300 workers in two shifts . "
Instead of layoffs , the company has cut the workweek down to four days .
Asked about how the family is doing , she said , " I myself , I 'm not making enough to pay the rent or the bills .
You have to deprive yourself of buying things .
We work at different places , my two sons I , and my husband does n't work .
He 's disabled , and gets money from disability .
They give him very little to live on .
" We have to put our checks together .
People today have to not buy lots of things in order to pay the rent .
I worry about the rent .
I have to pay the rent so they do n't throw me out .
Now we do n't eat the same .
We have to eat nothing but vegetables .
There are lots of things that we like to eat but we can't buy .
Now we do n't buy so much meat .
Once a week we eat chicken . "
Talk turned to the causes of the crisis .
" So much is spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , " she observed .
" What do I think of the war ?
Well it 's not good .
Why are they there ?
You know why I say that ?
It is because I have another son in Iraq .
What do they have them there for ?
Nothing !
Nothing , except to get killed ! "
Nonetheless , María has faith in the Obama administration : " I think that he 's going to take us forward .
We hope so .
I am 100 percent sure that he 's going to take us forward .
That 's why we voted for him . "
The WSWS pointed out that Obama has n't stopped the war .
María rejoined , " Because he can't stop it all at once , but he 's going to stop it .
You know well he's not going to say , ‘ Stop now ! '
He 's going to stop it in 2010 .
Let 's see , if we get there . "
The conversation then returned to the economy , specifically to the stimulus plan .
Did she expect that it is going to help ?
" Only if they use it well ; if they know how to administer it .
Because if the money only goes to the rich ... many people have lost their houses ; it does n't help them .
Yes , to the banks and the banks do n't loan money to people .
What happens is that people lose their homes . "
" It 's going to get worse before it gets better "
Claudia , left
Claudia , 30 , works at a payday advance shop .
She 's from El Salvador and came to the US when she was a girl .
She 's 30 years old with three children .
Her boyfriend works in a restaurant .
Lately , work has slowed down at her job .
" Yes , hours have been cut .
I worked 80 hours plus overtime every two weeks .
Now there 's no overtime and we only work 70 hours . "
The resulting cut in pay has led to some painful adjustments : " We do n't go out as much as we used to .
We do n't eat out anymore .
We brought our expenses down , like cell phones and cable TV ; we 're cutting out a lot .
Things are not getting better .
Gas is going back up , food is expensive .
We used to buy the name brands , now we go to the 99 - cent stores to buy fruits and vegetables .
It has changed a lot . "
Claudia sends money to her home country — " to my mother " — but recently has had to send less .
Claudia explained the payday advance process where she works and the effects of the crisis on her workplaces ' clientele , who take out short - term loans to get them to the next payday : " They sign a check , we process the check .
If it 's not paid , we try to work with them , so they can pay it back .
Interest does n't accumulate .
It 's a flat fee and stays the same until it 's paid off .
If you want to borrow $ 100 , the fee 's $ 17.50 and you have until your next payday to pay .
The annual percentage rate changes , but the fee stays the same , depending on how many days you get . "
Things have been busy , she explained , " because people do n't have money , so they come to us .
One can see that things have become much worse for the poor and the middle class . "
Asked whether people have been able to pay back the loans from the payday advance office , she said , " Most of the time , but lately it 's been really bad .
They 're not coming back to pay . "
About Obama 's stimulus plan Claudia commented , " I do n't know .
We 're waiting for a change , I guess .
It 's going to get worse before it gets better .
I 've been working for 10 years and these are the worst . "
Cooking and connections :
Although they might look like two unrelated thoughts , the fact is that they go hand - in - hand .
How do you inquire ?
Cooking is a process that enables a few to join on a romantic level , to be imaginative , and strengthen their connection .
The thought of preparing a homemade meal with your girlfriend or boyfriend might excite some ; whereas , others might look cringe - worthy .
Irrespective of where you lie about the “ Just How Much I Love Cooking ” spectrum , spending some time in the kitchen for a few can greatly reinforce the bond between both of you , together with tasty results .
Think about this : Culinary abilities are alluring , and knowing your way around a kitchen can be a more desired quality in a spouse .
It does n’t have anything to do with the degree of ability and what related to the simple fact that you ’re just keen to devote time and effort to cook at the first location .
To set it into a cliché manner , it is the idea that counts .
While making something as easy as scrambled eggs basic pasta and sauce may make a couple closer since they did it collectively .
Figure out together .
Not certain what it intends to purée ?
Have no idea which kitchen appliance should you buy ( see https://forhomekitchen.com/ for kitchen reviews and buying guide ) .
Do not know which knife to use to lower the veggies ?
Perhaps your spouse knows that the answer , possibly not .
We are not all the professionals , that is the charm of cooking using a substantial other .
Nobody really is competing ; the objective is only to get a fantastic time and make something yummy together .
Not only are you going to learn about culinary conditions and methods , however , you ’ll also find out more about your significant other to a private , deeper degree .
What ’s her favorite meal to prepare ?
Who instructed him how to cook ?
What ’s her fondest memory ?
What cooking customs has he ever developed ?
Cooking is an easy means to enlarge your knowledge independently while increasing as a couple .
Communicate with one another .
Cooking with somebody else needs immeasurable quantities of communicating if anything else could get done .
Without communicating , disagreements could ensue and time , resources , and energy are wasted .
This contributes to both parties feeling bloated and hangry .
Having the ability to get together from the kitchen can be great for the both of you to remain on precisely the exact identical webpage for a couple .
Appreciate together !
That instant once the timer goes away , also the kitchen fills with the aroma of a tasty meal , which could be unbelievably exciting .
All of the hard work you and your spouse did jointly repaid .
Even though some areas of the meal do not work out how that you anticipated , that does not mean that all is lost .
Again , it is the idea , care , and love that went to the meal which counts .
The satisfaction you ’ll feel does n’t come in the food itself , but instead , by the understanding which you and your spouse could work collectively , as a staff , toward a frequent aim .
It ’s possible to apply this ability to many things beyond ingestion ; you are able to apply it .
Spending time at the kitchen generates an experience the both of you — along with the two of you alone — may discuss , and it is different each time .
Possibly one of you inadvertently used sugar rather than salt .
Maybe you worked together to make the most remarkable recipe for macaroni and cheese which led to the ideal number of cheesy goodness .
No matter cooking makes a memory the both of you discuss and also adds yet the following page to this narrative of the connection .

An unprecedented plunge in advertising in the UK saw spending fall by almost a tenth in the final three months of last year , new figures revealed yesterday , with the economic crisis set to prompt even steeper falls in 2009 .
The total spent on advertising in the UK in 2008 was down by 3.9 per cent on 2007 , according to figures compiled by the World Advertising Research Center ( WARC ) on behalf of the Advertising Association .
But the research reveals an astonishing increase in the rate of decline in the final quarter of the year , when spending was 9.6 per cent lower than in the same period of the previous year .
Colin Macleod , research director at WARC , said : " The fourth quarter was the worst of the year , and was tied in with the arrival of the recession .
It was a sharp turnaround .
The quarter is comparable to the levels seen in the economic downturn of 1991 . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He warned that spending would fall further , but offered some hope to the beleaguered industry .
" There is a feeling that advertising spending will go down quite sharply again , although it should pick up by the end of the year . "
Sir Martin Sorrell , chief executive of the advertising agency WPP , said the numbers were likely to be repeated over the next few months .
" The first half of 2009 will be very difficult around the world , " he warned .
" There will be some recovery in the second half in relation to the first , and it should then get better in 2010 . "
Sir Martin named the US and western Europe as the toughest markets for advertising in the current environment .
WARC said the decline in the UK had accelerated throughout the year .
" In the UK , the amount of money spent , especially on display and classified advertising , tends to be driven by changes in consumer expenditure as well as the levels of corporate profitability , " Mr Macleod said .
" Both of those have been hit and that will bring spending down right across the industry . "
The research reveals that spending is falling faster on newspaper advertising than any other category , down 12 per cent in 2008 over the previous year .
Over the same period television advertising fell by 4.9 per cent
In the last quarter alone , the newspaper industry 's ad revenues fell 18.9 per cent , with only magazines performing worse , down 19.2 per cent .
Mr Macleod added : " The newspapers , especially the regional ones , were particularly affected by the loss of classified advertising , with money moving online . "
One analyst estimated that advertising makes up 80 per cent of regional newspaper revenues , and of that 80 per cent is through the classifieds .
Classified adverts are dominated by the recruitment , property and motor vehicle sectors , all of which have been smashed by the onset of the credit crunch .
Lorna Tilbian , head of media research at Numis , said : " Those industries are right in the eye of the storm . "
She added : " In a downturn , classified advertising always does worse than display . "
Johnston Press , which owns
The Scotsman and the Yorkshire Evening Post , announced last week that advertising revenues fell 17 per cent in the UK in 2008 and 23 per cent in Ireland .
So far this year its total advertising revenues are down 36 per cent .
Other regional publishers including Northcliffe Media , owned by the Daily Mail & General Trust , and Trinity Mirror , which has a portfolio of local papers , have also suffered .
The Local Media Alliance , which includes all three companies , has approached the Government for help .
The entire newspaper industry has been struck by the plunge in advertising , as companies across the UK slash costs and reduce headcount .
But newspaper advertising still had the largest share of spending , with a quarter of the total spent last year .
Television advertising makes up 23 per cent and the internet accounts for 20 per cent .
Online advertising was the only sector to enjoy positive growth in 2008 , with spending estimated to be up 17.3 per cent .
But even that was tempered , as it slowed from 39.5 per cent the previous year .
Mr Macleod said : " The growth rates on the internet are slowing .
The more it has grown the harder it is to grow further , but it is also being affected by the wider economic issues . "
WASHINGTON
In 1989 , someone raped a 72 - year - old woman in Pensacola , Fla .
Joe Sullivan was 13 at the time , and he admitted that he and two older friends had burglarized the woman ’s home earlier that day .
But he denied that he had returned to commit the rape .
The victim testified that her assailant was “ a colored boy ” who “ had kinky hair and he was quite black and he was small . ”
She said she “ did not see him full in the face ” and so would not recognize him by sight .
But she recalled her attacker saying something like , “ If you ca n’t identify me , I may not have to kill you . ”
At his trial , Mr. Sullivan was made to say those words several times .
“ It ’s been six months , ” the woman said on the witness stand .
“ It ’s hard , but it does sound similar . ”
The trial lasted a day and ended in conviction .
Then Judge Nicholas Geeker , of the circuit court in Escambia County , sentenced Mr. Sullivan to life without the possibility of parole .
I fear there are a large number of gun owners and supporters of the Second Amendment ( 2A ) who believe there still remains in the Congress some support ( fear of not being reelected if they vote for gun control ) for 2A .
They are also of the belief , especially among the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) crowd , that the recent Heller decision was a major victory for gun owners .
Both beliefs are highly suspect .
It is true that Bill Clinton stated in his biography that the Democrats lost the Congress in 1994 because of the party ’s support for gun control .
It is also true Al Gore very possibly lost the presidential race in 2000 because he was unable to carry his home state of Tennessee , many believe because of his anti-gun stance .
Had he won Tennessee , Florida would not have mattered .
But that was then , and this is now ; the political and economic climate is much different today .
It is also true that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has , for the time being , shown no spoken interest in pursuing an Assault Weapons Ban in the House of Representatives .
Pelosi , who comes from a predominantly antiwar district has consistently voted a pro-war stance , routinely betraying her base of support .
She is also a professing Catholic who supports abortion and openly lies about the tenets of her faith .
Exactly how much credence can we give to anything she says she will , or will not do ?
There was a rumor early in the George W. Bush administration concerning Karl Rove , who many considered to be the brains of the GOP .
Supposedly , a party operative questioned Rove on how the GOP should position itself on certain issues in order to cater to the GOP base of anti-abortionists and pro 2A voters .
Rove reportedly said to the operative , " We need not concern ourselves with those voters ; where else are they going to go ? "
Whether the rumor is true or not matters little , for the results are evident : in the 2008 Presidential election the GOP offered as their candidate a pro-choice politician with an F — rating on the 2A from Gun Owners of America .
Of course the folks at the NRA jumped into the election fray with total support for McCain .
How could McCain ’s opponent have a lower score than F— ; did n’t Obama claim to support the 2A too ?
I ’m sure the anti-abortion voting crowd was just as duplicitous in their support of candidates .
The bottom line is : there is no support in the Congress for the Second Amendment , certainly not enough to override any attempt by those in power to disarm American citizens .
Ron Paul and a very few others , will stand strong in defense of our rights , but like trying to stop the " bailout , " the effort will fall short .
To place one ’s right to protect themselves , their loved ones and their property in a political body populated for the most part by those who steal and lie as a normal function of everyday life is dangerous in the extreme .
Many gun owners , especially those in attendance at the recent S.H.O.T .
Show in Orlando , were beside themselves with glee over the DC v Heller Supreme Court decision .
In actuality , this decision , a 5 — 4 vote , does very little to actually support the 2A other than state what the 2A defines , with the caveat that even then it is subject to " reasonable " government restrictions .
Libertarian gun rights advocate L. Neil Smith puts it very well .
" Although many gun rights advocates mistakenly believe that the recent Heller Supreme court decision was a victory for our side , in fact it authorizes all manner of infringements — in the form of " reasonable " regulation — on the individual right to own and carry weapons . "
Are we the people ever consulted on what constitutes " reasonable " when it comes to our rights ; do we have a say in the implementation of " reasonable " restrictions on our freedoms ?
What Heller actually accomplished was to establish a climate of never ending litigation to determine what is reasonable to those in political positions to make such determinations .
The Heller vote was 5 — 4 , which means that four of the Supreme Court Justices disagreed with our right to own and possess the tools necessary to defend ourselves ; indeed , a precarious position for liberty .
Basically , our rights depend on the capricious nature of one bureaucrat .
Another serious mistake 2A supporters could fall into would be to believe that the Obama administration will be too busy with the economic storm to move for draconian firearms legislation .
The chaos that will result from the Keynesian economic approach now being employed by this administration will eventually lead to the rapid breakdown of law and order as the desperate and criminal - minded seek to secure the property of others .
The state will then convince Boobus the only way to stop the violence will be to seize all privately owned firearms .
Magnify the chaos and violence in the aftermath of Katrina by thousands of US cities and the picture should become clear .
The state ’s answer to the violence in New Orleans was to seize the firearms of law - abiding citizens .
It will happen again .
The mentality of those who believe their salvation / safety lies in the state was clearly illustrated by a vendor at a gun show I attended this past weekend .
A private citizen was walking around with a Heckler and Koch model 91 slung on his shoulder with a for sale sign attached .
The vendor , resplendent with his NRA Life - Member hat , asked the man if he had had any offers to purchase the rifle .
He stated that he had received several offers to purchase , but none of the prospective buyers wanted to complete the formal federal paperwork required on gun show property .
The vendor promptly responded that anyone who feared a government background check was obviously a criminal and / or a terrorist and had something to hide .
He was obviously of the opinion that the state will never use these records of purchase when they decide to confiscate firearms from those who " legally " possess them .
Supporters of the 2A best come to their senses and realize very quickly that the only support we have for the right to keep and bear arms is ourselves .
Depending on others , especially politicians and judges will prove fatal .
In the words of Karl Rove , " Where else are we going to go ? "
The fall at the end of the ride is going to be rough .

TOKYO , Feb 16 ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s economy plunged deeper into recession with its worst quarterly decline since the 1974 oil crisis as the global downturn slashed demand for its exports , and economists warned there was more pain ahead .
The world ’s second - largest economy shrank 3.3 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , more than other major economies , as its heavy reliance on exports and chronically weak domestic consumption left it badly exposed to the worldwide slump .
Group of Seven policymakers pledged at the weekend to do all they could to combat recession while in Japan there is growing debate about how much the heavily indebted government can do to stimulate the economy .
[ ID:nLE523133 ]
Adding to the economy ’s woes , the deeply unpopular government faces a revolt in parliament , while its finance minister is under pressure to quit after an embarrassing performance at the G7 meeting in Rome , casting doubt over any near - term action .
“ There ’s no question that this is the worst recession in the post - war period , ” Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano told a news conference .
However , he struck a cautious note on large scale spending , saying the government could not get “ addicted to pain killers ” .
Even though Japan has avoided much of the initial fallout from the U.S. credit and housing market meltdown , its economy contracted at an annualised rate of 12.7 percent -- three times the fall in the United States , at the epicentre of the global turmoil .
[ ID:nN29308953 ]
With Japanese exporters cutting production and laying off staff and many retailers reporting sharp falls in sales , economists saw little hope of a rebound .
Four out of six economists quizzed by Reuters forecast a further slide of around 10 percent in the current January - March quarter with one forecasting an even deeper fall .
“ The data showed a severe picture of the Japanese economy and highlighted the weakness in exports , ” said Takeshi Minami , chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute .
“ The January - March quarter is likely to show another minus figure ( annualised ) in double digits or something close to double digits . ”
POLITICAL TURMOIL
Pressure is building on the government to roll out a third stimulus package , which Japanese media said could include up to 30 trillion yen ( $ 327 billion ) in fiscal spending .
But Prime Minister Taro
Aso ’s tentative hold on power ahead of an election due later this year , is casting doubt over a swift government response to the deepening recession .
Aso faces an upper house of parliament in the hands of opposition parties , a swelling rebellion in his own party ranks and , on Monday , his finance minister and close ally Shoichi Nakagawa was forced to deny being drunk at a G7 media conference in Rome .
[ ID :nT229091 ]
“ It is a fact that I did n’t conduct myself clearly , and I feel I must put it straight , ” Nakagawa told reporters in Tokyo , blaming his shaky performance on a large amount of cold medicine he had taken .
Analysts said a departure by Nakagawa would further weaken Aso ’s ability to act .
The Bank of Japan has responded to mounting economic woes by nudging interest rates down near zero and taking unconventional steps , such as purchases of commercial paper and launching a new funding scheme using corporate debt as collateral .
The central bank meets again this week , with markets seeing little scope for more action on rates .
The prospect of more government borrowing pushed Japanese government bonds down .
March 10 - year government bond futures 2JGB v1 fell more than one - third of a point .

The October - December quarter contraction was Japan ’s second - worst in modern times , lagging only a 3.4 percent decline in 1974 , after the first Middle East oil shock .
The slump was worse than expected and also bigger than suffered by other major economies .
Euro zone GDP shrank 1.5 percent in the same quarter while the U.S. economy contracted by just under 1 percent for an annualised rate of 3.8 percent .

FACTORIES STALL
A plunge in exports was the main culprit behind the massive Japanese contraction , with external demand shaving 3 percentage points off GDP .
The resulting build - up in inventories of unsold cars , flat - screen TVs and many other goods has forced Japanese manufacturers to halt factory lines , pushing industrial production off a cliff and boding ill for the current quarter .
As big exporters cut jobs and production the pain spread to to their suppliers , sending company bankruptcies sky - rocketing and raising worries that the country ’s already fragile consumption could sputter even more .

元のタイトル は 「 Top 10 mistakes in Eclipse Plug-in Development 」なので 、 「 Eclipseプラグイン開発の間違いトップ10」の方が正しいんだろう。10位から順番に上がっていきます。また、画像は引用していません。
引用ここか ら
私はEclipseプラグイン開発をし始めた方をトレーニングしてきました。そしていつも同じように間違えてしまう点を見つけました。そこで今回、そうやって見つけてきた10の良くある過ちを一覧にしました。もしあなたがこれらの間違いをしていたとしても、それはあなただけのことではないのです。
( 10 ) JavaDocを読まな い
これは特 にEclipseプラグイン開発に限った話ではありません。Javaプログラマーにとって共通の話題だし、もっと言えば全てのプログラマーにとって同じことでしょう。そう、ドキュメントを読まないことです。どれだけ多くの、継承してはいけないクラスや実装をプラグイン開発者であるあなたからされることが考えられていないインターフェースがあるか知っていますか？もちろんAPIツールはあなたを助けてくれますが、JavaDocを読むのとは違った角度からの助けでしょう。私はいつも間違いを犯します。正直に言えば長い間、Commandのhandlerはnullを返されることが仮定されていることを知りませんでした。(これは実行結果です。)あなたはいつこれを知りましたか？
念のために言うと、JDTが提供しているJavaDocビューを使うとJavaDocが整形されて表示されます。
(9 ) デフォルトコンストラクタを追加することを忘れる
あなたがナイスなウィザードクラスを作りました。そしてウィザードダイアログの中に入れて動かしてみるとちゃんと動きます。でもINewWizardと一緒に動かそうとすると動きません。その後「ちょっと」デバッグしてみると、ウィザードクラスの中でデフォルトコンストラクタが定義されていないことを見つけました！そう、これはウィザードクラスに限った話ではなく、plugin.xmlに記述する、" class"属性で書くクラス全てにデフォルトコンストラクタが必要です。これらのクラスはリフレクションを使ってインスタンスが作成されるためです。
(8) 異なったプラグインに分割していない
新規開発者の間で共通して良くみられます。かれらは全てのものを一つのプラグインにしてしまう傾向があるのです。幾つかのプラグインに分けることでコードを分けることはモジュール性や保守性を上げるでしょう。あなたは少なくともUI部分とコア部分に分けるべきです。そうすることでコア部分のテストを行うことを簡単に行えるでしょう。
( 6 ) クラスパスを直接指定している。 全てのプラグインプロジェクト
はJavaプロジェクトでもあります。しかしそれはあなたが必要とするJarファイルをJavanoクラスパスに追加すればいい、というものではありません。なぜならプラグインの実行時のクラスパスはそれとは異なるからです。もしJarをクラスパスに追加したいのであれば、RuntimeタブにあるClasspathセクションでAddボタンを押してください。
( 4 ) 空のdisposeメソッ ド この黄金律は忘れないでください。「何かを作ったら、捨てる(dispose ) 」 。SWTのリソース、例えば画像やフォントはいつも使い終わったらdisposeメソッドを呼ぶこと。私はたくさんの人たちがこれをするのを忘れているのをみてきました。他にもdisposeメソッドをオーバーライドしたときにsuper.dispose()
を呼んで親クラスで作られたプロパティのdisposeを確保してください。また、IPartListenerやIResourceChageListenerなど、あなたのクラスがライフサイクルを終えたらこれらのリスナーを確実に削除するよう、disposeメソッドで削除してください。
(3 ) monitor .isCanceled ( ) を無視している あなた のJobは非常に長期に渡る仕事をしていて、ユーザーがキャンセルをしたいとしますよね。そういう時はProgressMonitorダイアログやウィザード、またはProgressViewからキャンセルを押すことで終了できます。キャンセルボタンを押すと、IProgressMonitorはキャンセルフラグをtrueにするだけです。あなたは一定の期間でisCancelled()をチェックし、操作を終了させるようにする責任があります。ユーザーが" キャンセル"を押した後に何も起きなかったら、信じてほしいんですが、それはとても悪いユーザーエクスペリエンスでしょう。
THE World Bank has broken a taboo , becoming the first official organisation to predict the global economy will shrink during 2009 , to collapse for the first time in more than 60 years .
A previous forecast from the International Monetary Fund predicted global growth of just 0.5 per cent this year , something it described as a recession but " still positive " .

The new World Bank assessment , prepared for next week 's meeting of finance ministers and treasurers from the world 's 20 largest economies , was not specific about the extent of the collapse other than to say that global economic activity would shrink " for the first time since World War II , with growth at least 5 percentage points below potential " .
Global industrial production would be down 15 per cent by the middle of this year , with world trade on track to record its largest decline in 80 years .

The Abel Prize 2009 has been awarded today to the Russian - born mathematician Mikhail Gromov for " his revolutionary contributions to geometry " .
In terms of prestige , as well as monetary reward , this puts Gromov on a par with a Nobel Prize winner .
In fact , the Abel Prize was established to make up for the fact that there is no Nobel Prize in mathematics .
Much of Gromov 's work on geometry revolves around the notion of distance .
We all know what we mean by the distance between two locations , but what is slightly less obvious is that in any one space — a city centre , a map , or a region of the sky — there are several ways of thinking of distance .
In a town , for example , you could measure distance along a straight line as the crow flies , or along the streets you have to walk down to get from one point to another point — in general , these two metrics are not the same .
It 's even possible to think about distance when the object you 're considering is not a geometric space at all .
In a network of friends , for example , the distance between two people could be defined as the length of the chain of people that links one to the other .
Mathematicians have a way of making the intuitive idea of distance precise .
Given a collection of objects , be they the points on a map , or people in a social network , a mathematical metric assigns a number to each pair in the collection .
This number is the distance between the two objects , and it has to be positive if the two objects are distinct , and zero if the two objects are one and the same .
Moreover , a metric has to reflect the fact that , in terms of our ordinary notion of distance , the direct path from x to y is shorter , or the same length as , the path from x to y via z .
In terms of our mathematical notion of distance , this means that the numbers assigned to the two pairs ( x , y ) and ( y, z ) , should add up to a number which is greater than or equal to the number associated to the pair ( x , z ) .
A social network forms a metric space .
This slightly abstract definition makes it possible to define a notion of distance for any collection of objects , whatever they may be ( we 'll call such collections spaces from now on ) .
What 's more , you can define many different notions of distance — many different metrics — for any one space , simply by changing the numbers associated to pairs of points .
In our geographical example above , one metric might correspond to distance as the crow flies , while another might correspond to distance measured along roads .
A space with a mathematical metric defined on it is called a metric space .
Pure geometry
Gromov 's secret of success has been his ability to use the concept of a metric space to greatest possible effect .
One of his most important results involves a notion of distance , not between points located in any one space , but between metric spaces themselves .
As an example , think of two neighbourhoods in a city , for example Chelsea and Westminster in London .
Each is a metric space in its own right — you can construct a chart of distances between locations for each neighbourhood , and one chart can exist perfectly happily without reference to the other .
But how should you define the distance between Chelsea and Westminster , given that each area is a collection of many individual points ?
If you 're the passenger in a cab negotiating the fare , you might define it as the shortest distance you can find between any two points in Chelsea and Westminster .
If you are the driver , you might define it as the largest distance you can find between any two points in Chelsea and Westminster .
Depending on what information you 're trying to gain , both approaches might be useful , and there are many more besides .
One which has proved particularly useful ( for mathematicians , rather than cab drivers ) is known as the Hausdorff distance and is based on a mixture of the two ideas we just described .
What 's the distance between Chelsea and Westminster ?
This is straight - forward enough , but what if your two metric spaces are not part of a bigger metric space ( in this example the city of London ) ?
What if one of them is a social network consisting of people linked by acquaintance , and the other is the surface of a doughnut ?
Can you still find a notion of distance that somehow reflects the extent by which they differ ?
Gromov 's idea was to think of all the ways in which the two spaces can be visualised as sitting in a third space .
For example , the doughnut can be visualised as sitting in three - dimensional space , centred on the origin , and the social network can be represented by dots sitting in the same three - dimensional space , with the appropriate distances between them .
Once you have both metric spaces sitting in a third space , you can use Hausdorff distance to define how far they are apart .
Based on this idea , Gromov developed the Hausdorff - Gromov distance , which can be extended to apply to any two metric spaces .
Esoteric as it may sound , the Hausdorff - Gromov distance has proved invaluable for mathematicians , and Gromov himself has derived many important results with its help .
This is particularly true when it comes to an interesting class of spaces , known as Riemannian manifolds , which include a large variety of different beasts , including the sphere and the doughnut , as well as higher - dimensional spaces .
The Gromov- Hausdorff distance provides mathematicians with a complete map of this large and varied collection of spaces .
It enables them to discover their rich geometry by following routes along this map , and prove results about particularly exotic representatives by creeping up on them along a cleverly - chosen route .
Algebra
The pseudosphere has negative curvature .

Gromov 's grip on metric ideas has also enabled him to impact on algebra .
If you have ever worked with coordinate geometry , you will know that algebra has an important role in describing geometric shapes : a parabola , for example , can be described by the algebraic equation y=x2 .
Algebra has also played a vital role in describing the wider notion of symmetry .
The symmetries of a square , for example , form a neat self - contained system which can be described algebraically , and which is known as a group .
Groups are useful in describing other geometric spaces too , and algebraic geometry , the study of geometry using groups , has been practised by mathematicians since the nineteenth century .
Gromov 's work in this area can be more suitably described as geometric group theory — using techniques from geometry to study abstract groups .
Inspired by a certain type of negatively - curved metric space , he came up with a way of defining a metric on groups .
Not all groups admit this metric , but those that do are known as hyperbolic groups .
Gromov came up with a programme to study these hyperbolic groups which has inspired a generation of mathematicians .
Theoretical physics
The Earth rising over the Moon .

Maybe surprisingly , Gromov 's work on geometric spaces also influenced areas as far afield as physics .
As an example , think of the three - body system formed by the Moon , the Earth and the Sun .
At any given moment in time , the system is defined by the position of each of the three bodies and the velocity with which it is travelling .
These are two bits of information for each body , giving a total of six bits of information needed to describe each possible state of the system over time .
Taken together , all the possible sextuplets form a mathematical space — they form a collection of objects , just like a social network or the points on a map .
The question is what kind of structure this kind of phase space might have .
Mathematicians know that in this case , as well as in many other physical situations , phase space is something called a symplectic manifold , but the trouble is that symplectic manifolds in general are not the same as the above - mentioned Riemannian manifolds , about which mathematicians know quite a lot .
Gromov 's ground - breaking result in this area was based on the observation that symplectic manifolds exhibit just enough of a type of structure mathematicians are familiar with to draw useful conclusions about their nature .
The theory he developed from this observation has given rise to concepts that now play a key role in string theory .
And much more
You can usually spot a brilliant mathematician by counting the number of pies he or she has a finger in , and Gromov is a case in point .

Pretty much every product that Google works on has to go through gatekeeper Marissa Mayer , who decides whether it 's ready to be released or needs more work .
She even approves every single Google Doodle that adorns the search giant 's homepages around the world .
From being hired as the first female engineer nine and a half years ago to becoming one of the key decision makers at Google , she 's come a long way .
" We were very small , just 20 people , " Mayer , now Google 's vice president of search products and user experience , recalls .
" There was a tremendous amount of energy , scruffy entrepreneurialism and a sense of hope .
We really felt we were working on something that might change the world .
We were all very excited to be working on such an important problem and we thought it would really have an impact .
Even from that vantage point , though , it was n't clear to us what type of impact it would have . "
Mayer simply did n't anticipate that Google , which had just signed a deal to become Netscape 's default search engine when she started , would turn into the biggest internet company in the world .
" I actually felt that we had about a two per cent chance of succeeding .
That might sound tiny , but actually that 's about a hundred times higher than the average start - up .
I thought that the odds relative to the other start - ups were very , very good – but even with those odds there was still a lot left to chance . "
Chance , it seems , is something Mayer does n't rate that highly .
She 's brainy , precise and ambitious , obsessive even , when it comes to shaping Google 's product suite .
Critics , notably Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag , call her mechanical and robotic – and maybe she has to be to stay on top of it all .
She looks after 150 product managers , and every month 10 - 12 major products are pitched to her .
On top of that , 1,000 - 2,000 outside projects need to be reviewed .
She has to make decisions all the time , and insiders call the rigid process of her critiquing and approving new features ' the Marissa Gauntlet ' .
Usually , each team has no more than 10 minutes to present their projects .
During this time , though , they get her undivided attention – she wo n't check her email or take phone calls .
Aside from the official meetings , Mayer 's office door is open for an hour each day , so Googlers can go in , ask questions and get more advice on a project .
Of course , as her job title suggests , the focus is on the user experience .
She 's absolutely devoted to the needs of the ' end user ' and often uses her mom as a reference point to check whether an idea is simple enough .
But what other criteria does she take into account when she decides whether a product is a goer ?
" I look for the insight and innovation that 's baked into the idea , " Mayer explains .
" I also look at the overall energy and strength of the team that 's presenting it .
Then I develop an overall sense of confidence that it's both a good product idea and that we have a good team who are interested in moving it forward .
If those two things come into alignment , it 's going to be a successful product . "
Innovation is her real passion ( along with cakes – she 's actually invested in a speciality cake company called I Dream Of Cake ) .
She uses her ' 20 per cent time ' ( the time Google apportions its employees for personal projects ) to figure out how the search giant can continue to innovate as it builds new products .
The future of search
As the self - proclaimed search addict points out , there 's still a lot of opportunity for innovation , change and progress in search .
Although typically tight - lipped about future products , she does hint at the direction Google is going to take .
MacGyver escaped dangerous situations using household items
Cult 1980s TV show MacGyver is to be remade as a feature length movie , it has been announced .
No stars have committed to the project but film studio New Line says it is looking for " an A - list writer " .
MacGyver ran from 1985 - 92 , and starred Richard Dean Anderson from Stargate : Atlantis and SG - 1 as an extremely resourceful secret agent .
He frequently escaped dangerous situations by making imaginative use of common everyday household items .
Two made for TV films were produced in the years after the show 's cancellation .
The character has since been spoofed in countless movies and TV shows .
Anderson even provided his voice for an episode of The Simpsons , in which he was kidnapped by Marge Simpson 's sisters Patty and Selma who were obsessive fans of the show .
The new film will be produced by the father - daughter team of Dino and Raffaella De Laurentiis , whose previous hits include Serpico , Flash Gordon and Hannibal .
" We think we 're a stick of chewing gum , a paper clip and an A - list writer away from a global franchise , " said New Line spokesman Richard Brener .
Asking the simplest of questions can debunk the oddest of requests .
Asking
Why ?
means those requesting the questionable must stand tall and proud and explain with certainty why they make their request .
If they cannot answer , then it proves it was on a whim and probably worth ignoring .
If they answer well , then chances are there is something beautiful - in - reason to be found in the answer .
As designers , we provide a service .
Ok , nothing revolutionary in that statement .
We ’re service providers .
Clients come to us with a problem , we perform the service of giving them a solution .
Right ?
Right .
Hmmm .
A problematic mind set …
is that we are nothing more than button pressers
A problematic mind set that has infectiously attacked many of our brothers and sisters of design is that we are nothing more than button pressers .
An easily found conclusion .
After all , when clients come to us for something , we must give it to them , that ’s our role as , all together now , service providers .
They want – we give .
The client , or some of the nastier ones , think along these lines , but are n’t stopped by the cure carrying designer .
They demand we do it their way .
And that ’s fine .
What is n’t fine is when the designer does n’t question the decisions .
Because when you , the designer , does n’t question and just acts , then you simply become an interface that sits dumbly between the client and the software .
You know the magic buttons to press , you have the software and the large monitor .
Apparently this makes a designer .
You simply become an interface that sits
dumbly between the client and the software
The best part of doing so is that these types of designers later bitch and moan the loudest .
The job looks awful !
My client is an idiot !
Why , oh why do I get the bad ones ?
Wah wah wah .
Do n’t be one of these stooges .
Just do n’t , it ’s stupid and a waste of your talent and time .
The only difference between the self - loathing Mac operator and the happy and successful designer , who have both had their suggestions ignored , who both have clients who push them to develop shitty work — work the client loves and the designer loathes — is a simple question .
Why ?
The good designer will always ask Why ?
The good designer might end up with the same result as the bad designer , at the behest of the client , but they questioned it .
If the bad decisions were able to be justified by the client , if their reasoning and logic could stand up to your simple question , then maybe it is n’t completely a bad idea ?
After all , it ’s their message you ’re voicing .
Because chances are they ’ll probably give you an answer you can live with – an answer in which their real needs are hidden .
Let ’s play this out — —
Client : “ Make this line of text fluro pink , I like pink .
And the background yellow .
Yeah !
Yellloooww .
I like pink and yellow . ”
Designer : “ Pink on yellow ?
Mmm .
From what depth of the ABYSS did the logic you insult the intelligent by pretending to posses come ?!
Answer me with nobility and reason , lest I cast you into the fiery pits of the damned for wishing such a horror on the eyes !
Why ’s that ? ”
Client : “ It ’s more important than that other text there ”
Designer : “ Ah , I see what you ’re going for .
But ..
Pink on yellow will be a bit strong and hard to read because of the low contrast — in fact , it ’ll probably be ignored because of it …
Why do n’t we go with a rule in the margin , between this column and the one next to it ?
Nothing big and bold , something subtle and gentle – it ’ll grab attention without being too over the top , which means people will be invited to read the text .
We can also make the heading a red , which is your corporate colour , so it links in with your other branding materials as well as the rest of the book and will grab attention to this text , which will clearly be important because of it .
Client : “ You ’re awesome , have more money ”
fin
The good designer asked why , discovered why the client was making their request and turned it around .
Sometimes the client has no real reason and the suggestion disappears into the ether .
Sometimes they ’re just masks for an effect or emotion they are going for but ca n’t articulate .
Sometimes they ’re just masks
for an effect or emotion they are going for
The bad designer would have said “ ok ” , gone out , gotten drunk and left a curse filled message on the client ’s answering machine .
Or hate themselves a little .
We all roll differently .
If the client had not cared about the reasoning ?
Had they told you to do it their way ?
Well , two ideas come to mind – either ditch them amicably when the current job is finished , or be happy in knowing that you played the role of the designer and do what you can to make the client resepect your decision making , should you choose to work with them in the future .
And remember that , just because you did n’t get the response you wanted does n’t mean asking the questions is any less satisfying and a flexing of your creative skills .
So ask Why ?. A simple question .
A question that can be asked in a million different ways without once using the word .
Be a good designer and ask the client Why ?
Be a great designer and ask the same of yourself
We get it beaten out of us through education .
Do n’t ask Why ?!
It ’s annoying !
I do n’t have the answer !
Do n’t question the material !
Do as your told !
It happens to us and our clients as children .
It happens and so we forget the power it holds , the insight it can provide .
Be a good designer and ask the client Why ?.
Be a great designer and ask the same of yourself .
I spent a lot of time in 2003 and 2004 thinking about object orientation .
Specifically , I wanted to find a better solution to duck typing , fragile base classes , deep inheritance hierarchies , cross-cutting concerns , and code reuse .
A talk by Dr. Andrew Black led me to a paper which described actual results of what I 'd been designing in my head .
After some discussion with the Perl 6 design team , we developed the concept of Perl 6 Roles .
In those days there was no Moose .
I and several other people wrote proof - of - concept modules to demonstrate how to use roles in Perl 5 .
Now Moose is the state of the art in object systems , and it 's definitely the way to use objects in modern Perl .
... with one exception .
Never Wrong By Design
My colleague and co-author Curtis " Ovid " Poe has written about his concerns about " silent " overriding of role methods with declared class methods .
( If you have n't read my explanation of roles already , you 're already lost .
You just wo n't know it until the next paragraph . )
Ovid 's code has several roles , which each provide several named methods .
This is rather the point of roles : they 're named collections of useful behavior and attributes .
They do n't stand on their own .
You build up classes from collections of roles .
The only relationship between roles is when you apply a role to a class ( or another role , but if you have n't used roles before , ignore this parenthetical note ) .
Ovid declared a class and applied several roles to that class .
That 's normal .
Then he declared several methods within that class .
That 's also normal .
Note that , at this point , the available methods of the class come from multiple places .
Some of them come from the class declaration .
Others come from the applied roles .
If the class inherits from other classes , other methods may come from its parent classes .
This is all normal .
This is all by design .
The Perl 6 Roles and Parametric Types specification says :
A class 's explicit method definition hides any role definition of the same name .
A role method in turn hides any methods inherited from other classes .
The method resolution is :
Methods defined explicitly in the class .
Methods defined in roles composed into the class .
Methods defined in superclasses .
Role composition is somewhat special , at least when compared to inheritance .
Because composition is declarative , the compiler can resolve dispatch to methods at compilation time .
That is , if you have two roles which declare methods of the same name , the compiler will produce an error message : you must resolve the conflict explicitly , by writing your own redispatch mechanism , excluding one variant method , or providing your own implementation of the method .
That last possibility gives away the punchline , if you read it closely .
Ovid 's code composes several roles into a class which declares its own methods .
At one point , someone added or renamed a method in a role or added or renamed a method in a class such that the class method took priority over the role method he expected .
At that point , he argued ( successfully , it seems ) that Moose should give a warning when role application behaves as specified in Perl 6 .
When Warnings Attack
I do n't want to argue the utility of the design , and I 'm not going to discuss why adding a warning is wrong ( it is , but I wo n't argue it directly ) .
It 's more important to discuss good and bad examples of warnings and error messages .
Consider the ( sadly optional ) error checking when perl says " You used strict , but you never declared this variable ! "
This is useful because it tells you something about your scoping , hints that you may have made a typo in a name , and tells you where the problem was .
Consider a hypothetical warning that you 've used a declared variable only once ; perhaps its a parameter to a function which you increment , or decrement , or read -- but in all of its scope , you only access it once .
Is this warning useful ?
Perhaps it indicates vestigial code that you can safely delete .
Perhaps not , though : what if someone has passed a tied or overloaded object which does something useful when you read a value or increment or decrement it .
That 's likely bad design with all of its implications for weird action at a distance , but the compiler can't know that statically .
Is the potential value for warning about vestigial code which a decent compiler can optimize away worth the potential cost of warning in the wrong circumstances ?
Consider the " use of uninitialized value " warning , enhanced in Perl 5.10 with the name of the variable containing an uninitialized value .
The warning suddenly became an order of magnitude more useful , as now you can check your assumptions without performing lengthy debugging sessions to determine which variable combined with which set of input produces the unexpected condition .
Of course , I know of several codebases which disable this warning .
Sometimes explicitly initializing several strings to empty ( not undef , but '' ) is too troublesome -- Scalar : : Util 's reftype ( ) function is one of my least favorite offenders here .
Then again , in a previous job where I worked with Ovid , I spent refactoring time over several days removing all potential uninitialized value warnings from a piece of code so that we could see actual problems in our code .
Is that warning valuable ?
Sometimes .
Consider the warning against using symbolic references in Perl 5 .
It 's optional , but unless you 're Damian Conway , Abigail , or Tom Christiansen you 'll hear a lot of complaints for not using the strict pragma .
For the most part , this is good advice -- it 's all to easy to write code that misbehaves in difficult to debug ways without a little help from the compiler , especially when you 're a novice programmer .
However , Perl 5's metaprogramming support usually requires symbolic references ( but thank goodness for Moose , which alleviates this ) .
In other words , the compiler can only determine whether you intended the behavior by the presence of the declaration of use strict ; or use strict ' refs ' ; .
The question is whether the warning is useful enough for novices and the warned - against behavior is rare enough even for experts that the cost of disabling the warning lexically is small enough to justify the warning .
Besides that , it 's not enabled by default .
The feature -- symbolic references -- work as designed and specified , but in general they 're useful only to people who know how to disable the warning .
( One flaw in my argument here is that symbolic references are also available to everyone not yet clueful enough to ask perl to detect potentially dangerous behavior -- but turn the idea around and ask why , in 2009 , this should still be . )
Role On New Warnings
When analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of new warnings , I believe it 's important to evaluate at least three criteria implied earlier :
How valuable and accurate is the warning ?
How common is the warned behavior actually dangerous ?
How onerous is working around the warning ?
In the first case , perl cannot determine the source of a collision between a method declared in a role and a method declared in a class .
Is it a typo ?
A renaming gone bad ?
A false cognate ?
A true cognate ?
Deliberate behavior ?
One proposal is not even to try , as if " Hey , something went wrong ! " is a useful warning message .
If that were the case , adding the name of the variable containing an undefined value to the " Use of uninitialized value " warning would have been of low utility .
In the second case , perl can only guess whether a locally declared method exists for disambiguating colliding methods from multiple composed roles or does something else entirely .
The names of roles are as meaningless to the compiler as are the names of methods .
It does n't care .
The intent of code is useless to a Universal Turing Machine Simulator .
It 's only useful to people -- so useful that only crazy people with something to prove write directly to UTMs .
The real question is " Why is there a collision ? "
Did someone misread or misunderstand the documentation for a role ?
Did someone make a typo ?
Did someone upgrade part of the system ?
None of this context is available to the compiler .
It can only guess -- and for it to guess correctly , someone needs a statistical model of the world which demonstrates that people rarely override composed methods with locally declared methods .
You must actively debug the problem to find the source of the conflict .
Which methods did each role provide ?
Where did all of the methods come from ?
What changed recently ?
Compilers are notoriously bad at history and change management .
Fortunately , there 's a perfectly good field of study which deals with change management ; it 's called change management .
The third case is the least important .
Then again , it might be the most important .
How often is this a problem ?
Typos in variable names are often a problem , and the compiler can detect them trivially .
Metaprogramming is rare enough that enabling symbolic references in a small scope is rarely onerous ( though to be fair , it 's all too easy to disable them in a greater scope than you anticipated , if you assign an anonymous function to a typeglob and do n't re-enable strictures within the function ) .
The best reason against this warning is that it thinks of roles as mixins instead of composable types , but that 's a very different discussion .
A class which composes several roles to take on the types of those roles instead of to reuse code -- that is , allomorphism -- may produce many , many of these warnings .
Another proposal is to allow explicit exclusion of lists of methods when composing a role , as if explicit declaration of methods in two places ( first when composing the role and second when declaring the methods in the class ) were an improvement .
Optional or Not
One facet of this discussion rarely seen is whether a warning should be optional or mandatory .
The cost / benefit tradeoffs change dramatically when you flip this switch .
Optional typo and symbolic reference checking in Perl 5 has helped a lot of bad code spread -- even the proliferation of global variables is a net drawback .
It 's also cost a lot of people a lot of debugging time .
Perhaps it 's helped more people write one - liners , but when was the last time you spent hours debugging a one - liner ?
Compare that to optional Perl : : Critic warnings .
If your project decides that a method length of more than 24 lines is a code smell , you can determine that yourself .
If you decide that a specified , implemented , and tested feature of Perl 5 is troublesome ( tie ) , you can disallow it yourself locally .
You have the information .
You know your history .
You can improve the heuristic .

It was only a matter of time before Hollywood got itself in a hot mess over Twitter , and it seems appropriate that the first celebrity accused of slandering someone on the micro- blogging network is one who was stirring scandal long before the Internet age : Courtney Love .
The rocker and widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was slapped with a lawsuit last week by her former fashion designer , Dawn Simorangkir , over comments Love has written about her on Twitter and MySpace .
CLICK HERE to read the complaint against Courtney Love .
According to a libel claim filed by Simorangkir in Los Angeles Superior Court March 26 , Love used Twitter to disseminate " an obsessive and delusional crusade " of malicious libel against her .
Simorangkir , who 's based in Austin , Texas , also claims Love slandered her on MySpace .
The court documents claim that Love " became infatuated " with Simorangkir and her " Boudoir Queen " clothing line after discovering the designer on Etsy , an online marketplace catering to independent designers .
Love commissioned Simorangkir to create clothing for her and flew her out to Los Angeles , but then balked when she was invoiced for the designer 's work in February and March .
When Simorangkir suspended her work for Love , according to the court documents , the singer began her online onslaught in earnest , " exhibiting an intense level of animosity towards Simorangkir that has gone well beyond what any reasonable person would consider acceptable behavior . "
Many of Love 's alleged Twitter messages appear to be combative , and are disjointed and littered with spelling errors .
Among those cited in Simorangkir 's complaint :
" oi vey do n't f*** with my wardrobe or you will end up in a circle of corched earth hunted til your dead . "
" as one of her many bullied victims smashes her face soon as she 's an assault addict herself ( there 's apparently prostitution in her record too "
Simorangkir claims the rants also continued on Love 's MySpace page .
" i promise you , within a few weeks , Madeoff will seem warm and fuzzy , " Love allegedly wrote March 17 ( the same day she allegedly posted the above tweets ) apparently referring to jailed Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernie Madoff .
" I can't afford this s*** 2 lifes too short for mean girls / homophobes / racists / untrained women who attach a piece of chiffon to an d dress and call it worth thousand of dollars ! , " Love wrote on MySpace , according to the complaint .
Simorangkir is seeking unspecified punitive damages from Love .
" Whether caused by drug - induced psychosis , a warped understanding of reality , or the belief that money and fame allow her to disregard the law , Love has embarked on what is nothing short of an obsessive and delusional crusade to destroy Simorangkir 's reputation and her livelihood , " her complaint states .
Love 's lawyer did not return ABCNews.

Twitter Ideal for ( Most ) Celebrities
Besides Love , in recent months
Twitter has attracted a slew of celebrity users , most of whom have managed to stay out of trouble .
Lance Armstrong , Ashton Kutcher , Demi Moore , P. Diddy , Martha Stewart , John Mayer , Ellen Degeneres , Kathy Griffin , Margaret Cho , Jimmy Fallon and Perez Hilton count themselves among the celebrity " Twitterati , " updating accounts themselves or sometimes employing ghost Twitterers / assistants to do the dirty work for them .
Twitter mania has reached into some of the loftiest levels of society .
Britain 's Queen Elizabeth tweets , with the help of royal staffers .
And President Obama , who began twittering during the election campaign , issued the first presidential tweet this week .
Why has Twitter eclipsed blogging as the rich and famous ' choice form of fan communication ?
According to Kathy Griffin , star of " My Life on the D - List , " Twitter 's 140 - character per message limit is perfect for scatterbrained celebrities .
" I think that is key to celebrity - dom , because if you let celebrities go on and on , you 'll have a list that 's longer than anything anyone wants to read , " she said in an interview with ABCNews.com last week .
" It puts a limit on celebrities ' verbiage . "
Though it seems that may not be the case with Love .
The complaint against her reveals that she updated her Twitter account more than two dozen times on the evening of March 17 , effectively negating the purpose of the site 's 140 - character per post limit .
Love 's flurry of posts on Twitter and MySpace is the latest scandal to get her in hot water .
She lost custody of her daughter with the late Cobain in 2003 and spent multiple stints in rehab before regaining custody in 2005 .
In July 2008 , Love was sued by management firm London & Co. for allegedly failing to pay the company its share of proceeds from her sale of Nirvana 's publishing catalog .

American weaponry globocorp Raytheon has been awarded a contract by the US military to improve the state of the art in microwave blasters for ground troops , offering " lighter - weight , non-lethal " rayguns as an alternative to deadly force .
The company announced a deal with the Pentagon 's Joint Non Lethal Weapons Directorate ( JNLWD ) to provide " a gallium nitride solid - state source for use in non-lethal weapons " this week .
The US forces already have microwave weapons , of course - most famously the crowd - frying Active Denial System ( ADS ) , intended to play a beam of millimetre - wave goodness across riotous mobs and so forth .
This is supposed to heat up the outer layer of the targets ' skin , causing intense pain but no lasting harm .
The idea is that this is actually one of the nicer things that heavily outnumbered US troops might do to testy mobs if reasoning with them did n't work .
A crowd - scattering dose of microwaves would be painful , but less so than a lengthy burst from a machine gun or a close encounter with a tank - so goes the thinking .
It 's even thought by proponents of the ADS that it might be a kindlier option than everyday beanbag projectiles , rubber or plastic bullets , taser electro - cattleprod guns , riot gas , metal truncheons etc .
Nonetheless it remains unclear whether millimetre - wave weapons will ever see military service .
If they do , however , the rayguns are a trifle cumbersome at present .
The ADS in its smallest form has to be mounted on a Humvee , and with the cooling equipment it would require to function somewhere like Iraq it 's a lorry - load of gear .
Thus the Pentagon push for something a bit more lightweight .
That 's where Raytheon come in with their new gallium - nitride semiconductor tech , which they think will be a lot lighter - weight for a given output than present day gallium - arsenide kit .
Raytheon spokesmen have previously said that they could deliver tenfold power for a given amount of semiconductors .
This could see the long - heralded , semi-mythical handheld microwave blaster become a reality , perhaps .
A prototype " rifle sized " man portable raygun is known to exist .
This would possibly offer pain - blaster settings and potentially be able to act as a handheld nudie through - clothes millimetre wave scanner - or at least a person - tracking radar - as well .
However this has not seen field service , perhaps due to issues of power vs weight .
Raytheon 's gallium - nitride tech could help out here , potentially putting a multifunction pain - blaster / electropulse electronic weapon / perv scanner / mantracker radar device in the hands of US grunts on the ground .
The weapons firm is keen to develop less aggressive applications too , of course .
The pain - ray gear has already been tried out in the form of enormous patio - heater towers for warming up fruits in California , for instance .
It is intended to see service in radars and communications too .
At the risk of triggering an outbreak of mass hysteria among the tinfoilclad Wi-Fi-fearing community , we can also point out that Raytheon intend this same gallium nitride pain - raygun technology for use in cell towers .
" We want to get it inserted in the base stations of cell towers very quickly , " a corporate tech partner exec told the Boston Globe in 2005 .
Boringly though , that 's because cellphones have always used these frequencies .
Much as the prospect of cell towers able to see through your clothes or inflict a sizzling heat - beam enforcement whiplash from afar would be professionally satisfying news , we reluctantly offer the assessment that there 's no need for the tinfoil undergarments just yet . ®
THE ROCKEFELLER PLAN
PART 5
By Dennis L. Cuddy , Ph.D .
February 9 , 2009

[ NOTE : On July 2 , 2008 Barack Obama in Colorado said , “ We ’ve got to have a civilian national security force that ’s just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded as the military . ”
Obama ’s attorney - general Eric Holder on NBC’s This Week ( May 2 , 1999 ) said : “ [ The Second Amendment ] talks about bearing arms in a well - regulated militia .
And I do n’t think anywhere it talks about an individual . ”
Since Holder does n’t believe you as an individual have a right to bear arms , can you envision Obama ’s civilian national security force knocking on your door and asking you to turn over any weapons you may have ?
What would you do ?
Further to my recent column “ If War Had Not Come In Fierce and Exaggerated Form , ” the ( London ) Daily Mail on December 20 , 2008 published “ Secret of the Lusitania : Arms Find Challenges Allied Claims it was Solely a Passenger Ship . ” ]
Continuing with the final ( political / New World Order ) element of the Rockefeller plan , in David Rockefeller ’s Memoirs ( 2002 ) he revealed on page 405 that he ’s part of a “ secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , … conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world , if you will . ”
Of course , in David Brooks ’ lengthy review of this book in The New York Times on October 20 , 2002 , there ’s absolutely mention of this remarkable admission by Rockefeller .
Many believe Americans will never succumb to the Rockefeller plan .
However , that ’s why David Rockefeller praised Chairman Mao in his August 10 , 1973 New York Times article , helping to open the door to Communist China and thus increasing its economic ( and military ) power .
More recently , Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had traveled to China 70 times and started the U.S. - China Strategic Cooperation and Communication Initiative .
Paulson was formerly with Goldman - Sachs , which financially represents China in the U.S. in some important areas .
In addition CFR member Paulson recently was given authority by Congress to use TARP ( Emergency Economic Stabilization Act ) money any way he saw fit , so Bank of America used $ 7 billion of their loan from Paulson to buy an interest in a Chinese bank ( Citigroup used $ 10 billion to buy 44 Spanish toll roads ) .
How ’s any of this supposed to help homeowners in the U.S. not default on their mortgages ?
It ’s not !
And where are we now in 2009 ?
The Chinese are poised economically to begin to coerce the U.S. to restructure our education and economy in order to compete successfully globally .
Recently on the national news , it was reported that BYD Auto Company of China would introduce soon its electric car which simply could be plugged into a wall socket overnight .
An auto industry analyst said there are those in Detroit who are “ sweating bullets ” over this because BYD ’s car will cost only $ 22,000 compared to the first American electric car which will cost about $ 40,000 when it ’s introduced .
Since BYD has only been making cars about 5 years , how could they beat the U.S. with the first mass - produced electric car ?
It may well be because education in China is far more rigorous than in the U.S .
For example , there ’s a small town in China named Zhenzhou which has a high school where its 10,000 students arrive at 6 AM for calisthenics and do n’t leave school until 10 PM .
In China , high school students take four years of biology , four years of chemistry and four years of physics , with the Senior year integrating all three subjects .
Regarding math , algebra , geometry , trigonometry , calculus and statistics are integrated in all four years of high school .
Compare this to American students who never take four years of all these subjects .
In the workplace , I ’ve already mentioned one town in China that specializes in the manufacture of neckties .
Another town , Putian , is the largest shoe manufacturer in the world , and one - third of all shoes in the U.S. come from Putian .
In previous columns , I ’ve mentioned how years ago I proposed a number of ways to improve elementary and secondary education in the U.S. Regarding higher education , about 30 years ago I proposed colleges offer courses called “ Contemporary Cultures , ” which would introduce students to the history , geography , culture ( e.g. , art and music ) , language , politics and economics of individual foreign nations .
Had colleges done this , we may well not be in the dire position we are in today in terms of global competition .
Now , it ’s probably too late !
On the other hand , Chinese institutions of higher education have Departments of Entrepreneurship .
This sounds contradictory for a “ Communist ” regime , but one must realize that David Rockefeller ’s promotion of China over 35 years ago was n’t because his ideal was for a nation of just communal peasants .
The Rockefeller plan was rather that China would be the fulfillment of Frederick Gates ’ “ dream ” of docile rural folk satisfied with their own lot and led by an educated elite .
This would not only be a political elite , but a technical elite as well , such as those at BYD who beat Detroit in the mass production of an electric car .

There is still a large rural population in China , and those poor who move to cities such as Shanghai often live as poor workers in hovels between the modern skyscrapers .
A friend of mine actually took photos of this , as well as of two women on the front lawn of a skyscraper cutting the grass with just scissors !
It ’s the return to feudalism described in W.J. Ghent ’s Our Benevolent Feudalism ( 1902 ) , which Jack London in The Iron Heel ( 1907 ) proclaimed would be “ the textbook ” the oligarchs and plutocrats would use in “ moulding the thought processes of the nation . ”
At the end of my book , The Road to Socialism and the New World Order , I quote extensively from Ghent ’s plan , which I project as resulting in a Techno - Feudal Socialistic New Age New World Order ( including a World Socialist Government ) .
As I ’ve written before , crises are used to get the public into accepting things they otherwise would resist .
In that regard , in “ Global Economy Hit By Massive Wave of Job Cuts ” ( The Economic Times , January 26 , 2009 ) , one reads that “ British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted that the [ current economic ] crisis should ultimately give birth to ‘ a new global order . ’…
We could view the threats and challenges we face today as the difficult birth - pangs of a new global order – and our task now as nothing less than making the transition through a new internationalism to the benefits of an expanding global society . ”
Toward that end , the “ moulding of thought processes ” mentioned above is brought about by saying only global solutions can solve global problems .
Relevant to this , Ben Barber with Demos ( which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Rockefeller Foundation ) on Tavis Smiley ’s show on PBS ( January 16 , 2009 ) stated that “ the war on terrorism , like the war on drugs , like the war on AIDS , like the war on over - leveraged banks and markets can only be fought together , not one nation at a time … .
President Obama has a chance to create a shared destiny for an interdependent world in which the United States leads but it also listens , in which the United States is a model for change and for democracy but also learns from others how it ’s done . ”
Barber has led “ Interdependence Day ” on September 12 of each year since 2003 , and Tavis Smiley referred to him as “ a great American public intellectual . ”
It ’s efforts like those of Demos and Barber which will help bring about the fruition of the Rockefeller “ one world ” plan .
And the movement toward Socialism in the U.S. will be an important part of this effort .
Concerning this movement , Dick Morris in “ The Obama Presidency : Here Comes Socialism ” ( January 20 , 2009 ) wrote that “ We will shortly become like Germany , France , the United Kingdom , or Sweden – a socialist democracy in which the government dominates the economy , determines private - sector priorities and offers a vastly expanded range of services to many more people at much higher taxes … .
Obama will so sharply cut taxes on the middle class and the poor that the number of Americans who pay no federal income tax will rise from the current one - third of all households to more than half .
In the process , he will create a permanent electoral majority that does not pay taxes , but counts on ever - expanding welfare checks from the government … .
In the name of stabilizing the banking system , Obama will nationalize it ….
The government will impose healthcare rationing , denying the older and sicker among us the care they need and even barring them from paying for it themselves … .
Obama will use the expansive powers of the Federal Communications Commission to impose the ‘ Fairness Doctrine ’ on talk radio… .
The large stimulus package deficits will likely lead to rapid inflation , probably necessitating a second recession to cure it .
So Obama ’s name will be mud by 2012 and probably by 2010 as well .
And the Republican Party will make big gains and regain much of its lost power .
But it will be too late to reverse the socialism of much of the economy , the demographic change in the electorate , the rationing of health care by the government , the surge of unionization and the crippling of talk radio . ”
At that point , the U.S. will be ready for absorption into the planned World Socialist Government , and a currency transition will be key to this .
Todd Harrison in “ How Realistic is a North American Currency ?
Uniting U.S. , Canada , Mexico Money Could Result From Crisis ” ( Market Watch , January 28 , 2009 ) explained : “ As governments take on more risk – as they price assets on behalf of the market and transfer debt from private to public – the common denominator for release valve becomes the currency . ”
Harrison continued : “ The New World Order is upon us … .
For years , the notion of an ‘ invisible hand ’ was conspiracy theory until we learned that the Working Group on Financial Markets was a central policy tool … .
The North American Currency – called the ‘ Amero ’ in select circles – would effectively comingle the Canadian dollar , the U.S. dollar and Mexican peso .
On its face , while difficult to imagine it makes intuitive sense .

By Norman Kent , Esq. , NORML Board Member
Okay , it is only February 1st , and more people this year have already died from peanut butter than pot .
Seriously , when you think about what has crossed the pages of our nation ’s conscience in the past month , you have to wonder why we are all not getting high .
With thanks to Michael Phelps , I have ten good reasons to believe drug law reform will ‘ take ’ this year .
Here is why .
Number One : The President
First of all , we elected a President who has admitted inhaling , and whose half brother just got arrested in Kenya for possession of marijuana .
Growing up in urban Chicago , and having come from Hawaii , home of ‘ Maui Waui , ’ we have a man in the oval office that has an herbal background .
I am therefore not intimidated that , on his third day in office , while he was working on a nationwide economic stimulus package , some renegade prosecutors raided a medical dispensary in California .
Those ugly efforts will cease soon enough .
I am encouraged by President Obama ’s prior public statements that such raids are counterproductive and provide illusory answers to real problems .
Number Two : The Medicine
Just as I was exploring the placement of my mom into an assisted living facility for early stage Alzheimer ’s patients , I see a study released by Ohio State University this month .
The research is indicating that marijuana has some potential capacity to reduce brain inflammation , which plays a role in Alzheimer ’s .
Mom , those brownies might taste differently next week .
While evidence showing the benefits of marijuana in multiple sclerosis cases has been advancing significantly , work in Alzheimer ’s disease is still in its infancy .
Still , another recent study performed at the Scripps Research Institute in California found that THC , the active ingredient in marijuana , inhibits the formation of a brain plaque that is a hallmark of Alzheimer ’s disease .
Number Three : The Politics
If you light up a joint while walking down High Street in Medford , Massachusetts , not much is likely to happen to you .
As of Jan. 2 , Massachusetts became one of 12 states that have decriminalized marijuana possession to some extent .
The new civil penalties for possession of less than 1 ounce include a $ 100 fine and forfeiture of one ’s stash for those over 18 years of age .
Minors will receive the same fine and be required to attend drug education classes .
In city after city , and state after state , once silent minorities are becoming vocal majorities and voting to enact legislation freeing marijuana from unjust law enforcement .
When given the chance , we are winning the war against prohibition .
Legislators in Michigan , Connecticut and even Florida are starting to re-introduce bills to lower penalties for pot .
The whirlwind is commencing ; just ask anyone in a dorm room within a wave of the White House after the inauguration .
Number Four : The Media
Marijuana has gone mainstream .
Media outlets are no longer hiding in the shadows afraid to produce honest reports about the culture of marijuana .
We are less likely to see commercials of pot smokers having their brains grilled in a frying pan .
We are more likely to view legitimate programming which produces truths rather than trash about your stash .
One such report was featured on NBC news last week , a snippet of an hour long production on MSNBC entitled ‘ Marijuana , Inc . ’
Focusing more on economics then the sociology of pot , the well - supported report inescapably concluded that marijuana commerce is here to stay and unlikely to change .
As even the NY Daily News said , “ When it comes to marijuana , a whole lot of people voted some time ago to just say yes . ”
Ask the cast of the award winning Showtime series , ‘ Weeds , ’ which captures a growing American spirit .
Number Five : The Public
Even the Department of Health has said that 95 million Americans have over the age of 21 have tried marijuana at least once .
Everyone except Bill Clinton has inhaled .
The anti drug warriors have a hard time explaining to the average adult in the 21st century that millions of Americans are wrong when they light up every day .
It is normal to smoke pot .
The vast amount of marijuana users today are parents choosing to calm down instead of liquor up , not just kids , looking to get high after class .
Of course , they are too , adults treating arthritis , patients using it for multiple sclerosis , or people with HIV fighting a wasting syndrome .
Pot smokers cross ethnic , sociological , and economic boundaries .
Number Six : The Celebrities
There is a lot of reason to hate the celebrity culture , paparazzi , and people who get their daily pulp from finding out where Brittany Spears went shopping .
As more media types get busted with pot , the less newsworthy it becomes .
The public could care less .
An arrest for pot is not a career - ending event .
As I finish this piece and send it off for distribution , I am watching Snoop Doggy Dogg being interviewed on ESPN for the NFL Countdown to the Super Bowl .
It does not seem to have hurt him .
And guess what Michael Phelps got caught doing this weekend ?
Toking off a bong !
Macauley Culkin , Bud Bundy , Willie Nelson , Art Garfunkel , and Al Gore ’s son also make the High Subscription List .
So do Allen Iverson , Matthew McConaughey , Whitney Houston , Oliver Stone , and even Queen Latifah .
All have posted bail for pot .
They are not doing too badly for themselves .
Go visit Celebstoner for more prime examples of the intersection of celebrity and cannabis .
Number Seven : The Growers
In speaking out against rescheduling marijuana so as to remove it from its classification as dangerous , the most significant point that the Office of Drug Control Policy makes is that today ’s weed ‘ is not your grandfather ’s pot . ’
Exactly !
It is not , but they miss the mark when they say today ’s pot is ‘ stronger . ’
Today ’s pot is also cleaner , safer , and healthier to consume .
From vaporizers to hydroponic labs , the marijuana grown and consumed today is more precisely cultivated , carefully processed , and lovingly manicured then the mold - encased , dried - out weed we grew up on decades ago .
That pot was often delivered to Americans from overseas after being buried in the dark , musky cargo hulls of ships for weeks at a time .
Now that Americans grow our own marijuana at home , we do not hear stories on a daily basis about people smoking rat poison or buying oregano .
We have returned to the roots of our forefathers , lest we forget that George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and James Madison all grew hemp .
They did not turn out too bad , either .
Today ’s pot growers are the new revolutionary farmers .
Number Eight : The Police and Jails
Sadly , the criminal justice system in America is teeming with serious crimes and violence against Americans .
A Department of Homeland Security must necessarily focus on threats from abroad .
From drive - by shootings to corporate white collar crime , the jails in our country are simply not capable of housing all those who should arguably be locked up .
So law enforcement has to prioritize .
Building jails and keeping people in prisons costs more money than communities can afford .
Pot smokers are the residual beneficiaries .
The necessities of twenty first century law enforcement have reduced pot to secondary priorities .
More and more cities are encouraging cops to treat simple pot possession as a civil traffic infraction and just write a ticket .
As those progressive initiatives take hold , pot prosecutions will diminish and pot users will be treated more fairly .
Number Nine : The Non Profits
The wealth of non profit organizations advocating drug law reform is growing exponentially .
We are not just NORML anymore .
Benefactors like Peter Lewis and George Soros have underwritten drug reform movements the way Hugh Hefner once helped NORML .
The Marijuana Policy Project , Students for a Sensible Drug Policy , the Drug Policy Alliance , and Law Enforcement Against Prohibition are just a small sampling of honorable groups fighting to change the public perception in the way drug consumers are viewed and treated .
If you enhance their efforts today , there is less of a chance that you will be bonding yourself or your child out of jail tomorrow .
Number Ten : The Internet
There is no better way to end this column then to point towards the awesome power of networking to generate partnerships for the common good .
Overnight , hundreds of thousands of reformers can be linked for a specific goal , a targeted protest , or unified voice to speak out for or against a new law or proposed regulation .
The NORML blog and podcast draws hundreds of thousands of Americans daily who would otherwise never be reached but for the arm of the ‘ Net. Stopthedrugwar.org , Marijuananews.com , and cannabisnews.com are amongst the target specific Internet resources drug law reformers can access instantly .
There are too many more to mention .
Finally , the Internet has spawned awesome networking groups such as Facebook and MySpace , where activists , organizers , and reformers can synthesize their partnerships and causes .
And there is always something new unfolding , like Twitter , which I have not figured out , but I know is catching on .
It ’s Up to Us !
For too many years , pot smokers have been political prisoners , captive to repressive government and a rolling tide .
2009 represents a renewed opportunity to make the waters of justice run our way again .

Dec. 22 , 2008  -- " Survivorman " host and producer Les Stroud has written a real - world guide to survival using his decades of experience for the title .
Read an excerpt of the book below .
Introduction
In Surviving the Extremes , Dr. Kenneth Kamler writes , " Human beings are the only animal whose emotions , spiritual imperatives and lust for adventure overrides our survival instincts .
We get into trouble because we have an insatiable desire to explore .
We know very well we have assumed risks when we travel in an extreme environment and that our decisions could have fatal consequences . "
My own insatiable lust for adventure has seen me voluntarily place myself , time and time again , in survival ordeals or extreme adventures .
I used to do it for fun , and I guess I still do .
I have always channeled my creative energy toward filling voids , doing things that nobody else has done .
Creating a survival series for television was no different .
I had seen lots of survival films ; they seemed dry , boring , and of little interest to anyone but the hardest - core survivalists .
What was missing was the drama that unfolds in real - life situations .
I realized that to really show how to survive you need to go out and actually do it — and film the experience .
Out of this thinking , my idea for producing a television series , eventually called " Survivorman , " was born .
From the get - go , I vowed not to let Survivorman make a mockery of survival by incorporating games and challenges , or by cheating my way through it by staying in hotels every night or bringing along a makeup artist to help me look dirty .
There would be no camera crew to offer me food and assistance .
I needed to be out there , alone , just as I had for years trained to be , actually surviving , or at least coming as close as I could to simulating that experience .
Dr. Kamler notes , and I agree , that there are four forces at work in the struggle for survival .
Knowledge — well , you 've got a good start by reading this book .
Conditioning — an often - overlooked aspect of preparation for wilderness adventure .
Luck — my dad would have called it " dumb " luck ; hopefully you 've got some !
And the single most important force of all : the will to live .
Without it , people have perished beside packs of supplies .
With it , others in similar situations have survived seemingly impossible ordeals .
To this list I would add survival kit .
Certain gear can make a huge difference in your struggle to survive .
Snowmobiler Chris Traverse certainly had most of those forces when he got lost on his way home from a fishing trip in northern Manitoba in March 2008 .
To reach safety , he had to endure five days of walking through waist - deep snow without supplies .
I was humbled when Chris credited Survivorman with helping him survive .
Stories like Chris 's are a large part of what led me to write this book and to make sure that , like my TV show , there is nothing phony about my work .
The field of wilderness survival is cluttered enough with information .
I stick to tried - and - true methods , providing the background and explaining the skills that I know can help you to survive .
The skills are ones that anyone can easily learn and use , and that should work anywhere , anytime .
I also provide essential checklists , which you 'll find at the end of the book ; photocopy these and use them to plan your next adventure .
Preparation is everything .
Yet no matter how prepared you may be , you should never lose sight of the fact that a survival situation is an emergency .
It may seem fun on a survival - skills weekend when you 're fully fed , guided by an instructor , and surrounded by a group of like - minded students , all smiles and dirty faces .
But in a real - life ordeal , " fun " is not part of the equation .
Survival is not about smelling the pines and feeling the breeze on your weathered and tanned face .
Survival is not fun .
It 's not pretty .
It 's never comfortable .
It may involve eating gross things , enduring pain and deprivation , and battling fatigue and loneliness .
It may involve danger .
It 's about life or death .
If you want to learn how to survive , read on .

( CNN ) --
Twenty state attorneys general announced investigations Friday into the $ 165 million bonuses paid by insurance giant AIG last week , with Connecticut 's top lawyer issuing subpoenas to CEO Edward Liddy and 11 other executives .
AIG chief Edward Liddy has asked some employees to give back their bonuses .
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and the Democratic chairman of the General Assembly 's Banks Committee want Liddy and other executives to appear Thursday and bring with them " original or copies of documents regarding the AIG Financial Products Corp. retention bonus plan and any related contracts or agreements . "
" Now living off supersized taxpayer - paid bonuses , these AIG employees have a moral and legal obligation to appear at this legislative hearing and disclose details about corporate compensation to employees as well as investment decisions by AIG Financial Products Corp.
involving credit derivatives and dealings that have led to market destruction , " said Blumenthal , a Democrat .
AIG officials are citing a Connecticut law to justify their payment of the bonuses .
The law says that employees can sue in civil court for payments withheld that are due them and recoup double the amount of money .
Many AIG employees live in Connecticut .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is already investigating AIG 's bonus payments , and on Thursday received a list of employees who received bonuses that he had demanded a day earlier .
It was not clear where Blumenthal got the list of executives he subpoenaed .
At least one of them , Doug Poling , is know to have received a retention bonus .
Earlier Friday , Poling , a senior executive , announced through a company spokesman that he would be returning the $ 6 million he received .
The attorneys general of Arizona , Delaware , Illinois , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Michigan , Mississippi , Montana , Nebraska , New Jersey , New Mexico , Ohio , Oklahoma , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Texas , Washington and West Virginia have also launched investigations .
New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram said all 19 state attorneys signed a letter to Liddy demanding names and documents concerning the bonuses .
" We are investigating whether this compensation was paid to those working in the AIG subsidiary largely responsible for the financial crisis at the company , " Milgram said .
" This crisis , in turn , resulted in the loss of billions of dollars in shareholder equity and necessitated a huge influx of taxpayer money . "
Meanwhile , Sen. Chris Dodd , Connecticut 's Democratic senior senator , said Treasury Department officials misled him on the issue of bonuses for AIG executives .
He said he would not have drafted key legislative changes allowing the bonuses to move forward if he knew the purpose of those changes .
Dodd , who was visiting constituents in Enfield , Connecticut , said he was disappointed that the Treasury officials who asked him to make the legislative changes had not identified themselves .
People are " incensed " about the " infuriating " bonuses to officials at AIG and elsewhere , Dodd said , and " I do n't blame them . "
Dodd told CNN on Wednesday that he was responsible for language added to the stimulus bill to make sure that already - existing contracts for bonuses at companies receiving federal bailout money were honored .
A Treasury Department official told CNN earlier that the Obama administration had pushed for the language .
Dodd had initially denied he had anything to do with adding the provision .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told CNN's Ali Velshi Thursday that his department had asked Dodd to make the changes .

Rick Santelli Rant on CNBC ( VIDEO )
, on - air editor for CNBC , broadcasting from CME Group in Chicago , got the floor traders going with his impassioned speech about the mortgage bailout , and now he 's got the rest of America riled up as well .
Inviting capitalists to join him at Lake Michigan in July for a tea party , Santelli says he 'll be dumping in some derivative securities .
Santelli's comments are , of course , being hotly debated by the left and the right , with much hullabaloo .
Check out Rick Santelli's rant , which has unofficially been dubbed the " rant of the year , " in the video below .
Treasure , in fairytales , is stored underground and guarded by gnomes .
The gnomes of Zurich have over the years performed heroically .
They have succeeded in protecting from the world 's tax authorities nearly a third of the world 's $ 7 trillion of privately held wealth .
But against their will , Swiss bankers are being dragged from subterranean vaults into the light .
The fairytale that has delivered a standard of living envied by the rest of the world is slipping away .
And the country 's power brokers know it .
Last Tuesday , on the day Switzerland 's biggest bank , UBS , saw its share price sink to an all - time low , the country 's president , Hans - Rudolf Merz , himself a former UBS banker , suggested for the first time that bank secrecy - his country 's most precious commodity - is no longer non-negotiable .
A historic moment , it was followed a day later by the sudden resignation of the chief executive of UBS , once its richest institution .
The departure of Marcel Rohner , who lasted just 20 tempestuous months , is yet another calamitous milestone in the collapse of what is arguably Europe 's most powerful bank .
For Switzerland , these are dark days .
Private banker to the world , the country - and in particular its shadowy financial elite - has suffered a wave of unprecedented humiliations .
No European bank has suffered bigger write - downs than UBS .
Its reputation for risk - free sobriety in shreds , UBS has dumped $ 40 bn worth of toxic sub - prime mortgages and CDOs into a " bad bank " and required a $ 3bn government bail - out .
It has even been forced to order bankers to hand back bonuses after the traditionally phlegmatic Swiss public reacted with fury when it realised UBS was doling out $ 2bn to loss - making money - men .
Even more damagingly , UBS is embroiled in a multi-million - dollar tax evasion scandal in the United States that has led to the bank being sued by the US Department of Justice , which is demanding the identities and details of 52,000 of its American account holders .
The future of Swiss banking hangs on this case .
Two weeks ago , UBS paid a $ 788 m fine and handed details of 250 private accounts to US investigators after court documents revealed that UBS wealth managers smuggled diamonds in toothpaste tubes , deliberately destroyed offshore bank records on behalf of clients and assisted wealthy Americans to conceal ownership of their assets by creating " sham " offshore trusts .
Misleading and false documentation was routinely prepared to facilitate this .
The motivation , according to a former senior UBS executive who last year entered into a plea bargain to reduce his sentence , was to ensure the bank managed a staggering $ 20bn of assets owned by wealthy US individuals , which generated the bank $ 200 m in fees each year .
The scandal has seen a huge outflow of funds from UBS since it broke last summer and sparked a wave of litigation against the bank from wealthy clients furious at having their identities revealed .
Switzerland is now an international whipping boy .
This year it suffered the indignity of being refused an invitation to the international G20 conference to be held in London in April to discuss reforms to the global financial system - despite a plea by president Merz , who doubles as his country 's finance minister , to Gordon Brown at the World Economic ( WEF ) meeting in the Swiss ski resort of Davos at the end of January .
For the world 's seventh largest financial centre , the snub is more than an embarrassment .
It means the country has become neutered , unable to influence events that could shape globalisation for decades to come .
The problems have led the country 's justice minister , Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf , to fly to Washington next week to talk to her American counterpart in a desperate bid to resolve the escalating legal dispute between the two countries .
The mainstream Swiss business community is praying for a breakthrough .
Switzerland has also spawned some of the world 's biggest non-banking corporations , including food giant Nestlé ; Roche , the pharmaceuticals firm ; and Glencore , one of the world 's most powerful mining companies .
Mindful of the harmful ramifications of the tax scandal , leading executives appear to be backing a form of financial glasnost to counter the threat of being isolated on the world stage .
Johann Schneider - Ammann , a board member with many of Switzerland 's leading firms , an industrialist and an influential political figure , said last week that tax evasion should be treated as a crime .
In Switzerland , this is a revolutionary statement .
What makes it unique as a major European country is its distinction between tax evasion , which is legal , and tax fraud , which is not .
To make matters harder for international revenue investigators , the Swiss will only co-operate with tax officials if the issue they are pursuing is also a crime in Switzerland .
It is a situation that helps the world 's richest individuals hide trillions of dollars .
And despite growing international pressure for it to lift the veil of secrecy , powerful conservative forces are massing , determined to stand up to what they argue is hypocritical bullying by the international community .
When earlier this month Brown and Alistair Darling both attacked Swiss secrecy , its bankers were beside themselves with rage .
They argue that the UK is at the forefront of aggressive tax evasion through a nexus that connects the City of London with the Channel Islands , the Isle of Man and the Caribbean .
But a senior UK figure working for a Swiss bank said while London bankers are adept at hiding cash from the tax man , Switzerland 's role is also crucial : " Swiss and other banks use the same methods in London as they did in the US , including offshore entities in the British Virgin isles et al , indirect telecommunications , credit card accounts linked to the Swiss account , utility bills sent to the bank for payment , even account officers collecting cash from Switzerland . "
It is one thing contending with the ire of Britain , France and Germany .
But the Swiss have to deal with an increasingly hostile US administration .
US officials are infuriated at what they see as obstruction from the Swiss who , they believe , do not have a leg to stand on .
President Barack Obama 's officials are acutely aware of how leading figures in the Swiss government backed his presidential opponent , John McCain , last year .
The country that helped finance Hitler 's rise to power , hid gold looted from Holocaust victims and protected the illicit fortunes of some of the world 's most corrupt rulers will not go down without a fight .
Right - wing parties have started collecting 100,000 signatures to trigger a referendum to enshrine bank secrecy in Switzerland 's constitution .
But the decline in Switzerland 's fortunes is largely tied to the collapse of UBS : if the bank was not so weak , the country 's financial community believes they would have more chance of resisting international pressure .
The anger among UBS bankers towards board members who not only sanctioned huge investment in sub - prime assets at the top of the market , but failed to stop its wealth management arm breaking US law - despite being so advised by its staff - is palpable .
" The board were a third - rate Swiss old boys ' network , " says a senior UBS figure in London .
" They are far too distant .
They deserve to be shot . "
That opinion is shared by the Swiss media and most of the public .
Last month , the Zurich headquarters of UBS was attacked by furious protesters , who splattered its imposing whitewashed stone walls with paint .
The Swiss media has , unusually , lambasted its financial elite , helping to force UBS bankers to hand back a portion of their windfall .
Bankers are unused to derision .
And it shows .
Shrunken and nervous , Rohner 's last public act as UBS chief executive last Tuesday was to tell viewers on Swiss television talk show Club that the bank would not give an inch on secrecy .
" To disclose and divulge bank data : this is a conception of the world that I do not share , " Rohner said .
The next day , he lost his job .
A UBS spokesman this weekend said that with the appointment of Oswald Grübel - seen as the man who rescued Credit Suisse after it was laid low by its part in the dotcom flotation scandal - as the new chief executive , the bank was now fighting back .
" UBS is going through change , " he said .
" We are addressing and solving problems .
The problems led to outflows .
That 's quite clear : it 's not just a flight of clients .
Clients are deleveraging .
" But we are paying back debt .
We are on the way .
We think we will be profitable in 2009 .
We are rebuilding trust .
We have clearly acknowledged fraud .
We took responsibility .
It 's part of our deferred prosecution that we will overhaul our compliance and control framework .
Also in our offshore overseas operations , this is something we are working on . "
Grübel is seen as UBS 's last hope of survival .
But those close to the bank say it has suffered such huge shocks that another blow could be fatal .
The risk of corporate loan defaults and its exposure to international credit markets during a recession are cited as major risk factors .
Swiss insiders suggest it will offer to pay a proportion of tax on its wealthy clients so long as it can protect their identities .
But the future of Switzerland lies in Obama 's hands .
He has promised a crackdown on tax havens .
If he convinces fellow world leaders at the G20 that bank secrecy cannot be tolerated at a time when the world needs every penny to haul itself out of the mire , then Switzerland will be done for .
This was not the way the fairytale was meant to end .
The secret history
The secrecy of Swiss banks dates back to the middle ages and was used to hide wealth by many of Europe 's dynasties and the Vatican , even though Switzerland had embraced Protestantism .
Secrecy became official Swiss government policy during the First World war and was made law in 1934 .
Swiss financiers have faced criticism for destabilising democracy during the last 100 years .
In 1923 , Adolf Hitler visited Zürich to raise money for his party , and was said to have met bankers at the famous Hotel St Gotthard .
Swiss banks were used by the Nazis to stash looted gold .
A UBS security guard blew the whistle on the bank 's attempts to destroy records dating back to that time ; he was sacked for his trouble .
In 1998 , an independent panel of experts found Swiss banks were guilty of accepting Nazi deposits , even though they knew those deposits involved theft .
Up to 19 Swiss banks , including Credit Suisse , were used by corrupt former Nigerian ruler Sani Abacha , who looted £ 3 bn from his country .
But the Swiss Bankers ' Association points out that its report revealed the banks ' identities , which is more than British regulators managed in the Abacha case .
Enlarge By Chung Sung - Jun , Getty Images South Korea 's stem cell scientist Hwang Woo -Suk speaks to reporters at the Seoul National University on December 23 , 2005 in Seoul .
Woo - Suk resigned from his position as a university professor after his school stated that he had damaged the scientific community by fabricating the results of at least nine of 11 stem - cell lines he claimed to have created .
Scientists do n't often turn the microscope on themselves , and when they do , the results sometimes prove disappointing .
" It 's just too easy to cut and paste these days , " says Harold Garner of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , an expert of scientific plagiarism .
In a report in the current journal Science , his team lists excuses offered by " potential " plagiarists , authors of studies in which the text was , on average , 86.2 % similar to previously - published work .
Last year , the same team reported in Nature that a sample of the federal government 's PubMed database of studies suggests about 1 in 200 papers is plagiarized .
" Over time , the responses just got crazier and crazier , " says Tara Long , Garner 's colleague at Texas Southwestern .
" There 's every excuse in the book , from ' my hard drive crashed ' to ' the other guy did it . ' "
The team used a computer program they wrote called " eTBLAST " ( available online ) to detect about 9,000 suspicious duplicates from PubMed .
The team then sent out 163 questionnaires to potential plagiarists and authors of copied works on the list , and to editors of the journals that published the studies .
They received 144 replies .
" The reactions by the respondents were intense and diverse , " notes the study , with 93 % of the plagiarism victims unaware and " appreciative . "
Potential plagiarists were " more varied " in their responses : • 28 % denied plagiarism • 35 % admitted wrongdoing and expressed remorse • 22 % were from co-authors " claiming no involvement in the writing of the manuscript . "
• Others claimed they did n't know their names were on the studies .
" It was a joke , a bad game , an unconscious bet between friends , 10 years ago that such things ... happened .
I deeply regret , " was one duplicate paper author 's response .
" That 's my favorite , " Long says .
The team found the regretful jokester had eight other duplicate papers and was the head of an ethics committee in his country .
" The truth is that it 's an equal - opportunity offense , " with researchers from all over the world implicated , including a case at Harvard , Long says .
However , China and Japan had slightly elevated rates , and some responses complained of lax plagiarism standards overseas .
" The most alarming thing was papers that could affect doctors and patients , " Long says .
About 42 % of the duplicates also contained botched data , calculations or images .
Doctors make decisions about treatment , and researchers make decisions about experiments based on the scientific literature , adds Garner , making fudged data in plagiarized studies a concern .
" ( My ) major concern is that false data will lead to changes in surgical practice regarding procedures , " was one response from an original paper 's author .
The biggest plagiarism concern is self - plagiarism , says Garner , researchers who copy their work again and again , republishing old data in varied journals .
The team found those cases about eight times more common than authors ripping off other researchers .
" Plainly , scientists are human and they get into desperate situations , " he says , likely due to the " publish or perish " requirement for keeping a job at many schools .
A survey in Naturelast June led by Sandra Titus of the federal Office of Research Integrity , which polices federally - funded research , found about 3 % of researchers observed scientific misconduct each year , largely faked data but also plagiarism .
High - profile cases , such as stem cell researcher Hwang Woo - Suk 's faked data or the Bell Lab 's prodigy Jan Hendrik Schön 's discredited results , have rocked science labs in the last decade .
" Although our numbers can sound like a lot , you have to remember there are 18 million papers in PubMed and more than 95 % of studies are painstakingly high - quality efforts , " Garner says .
" We just need the culture of science to have the same high standards everywhere . "
Some potential plagiarists ' responses to the questionnaire ( from Science ) : • " I was not aware of the fact I am required to take such permission . "
• " There are probably only ' x ' amount of word combinations that could lead to 'y ' amount of statements .
... I have no idea why the pieces are similar , except that I am sure I do not have a good enough memory — and it is certainly not photographic — to have allowed me to have ' copied ' his piece ....
I did in fact review ( the earlier article ) for whatever journal it was published in . "
• " I know my careless mistake resulted in a severe ethical issue .
I am really disappointed with myself as a researcher . "

Several ant species practise " reproductive policing "
Worker ants in colonies with a queen are physically attacked by their peers if they try to reproduce , a study says .
In ant society , workers normally give up reproducing to care for the queen 's offspring , who are also their brothers and sisters .
The researchers found worker ants that try to reproduce - against convention - produce chemicals that give away their fertility status .
The findings by a US - German team are published in Current Biology journal .
To test the idea , scientists applied a synthetic compound typical of fertile individuals to non-reproductive worker ants belonging to the species Aphaenogaster cockerelli .
In colonies where a queen was present , the workers with the hydrocarbon chemical applied to them were attacked by other ants .
The researchers reported that deceitful ants were bitten , pulled and held by their peers .
But this was not the case in colonies without a queen ant , where workers were free to reproduce .
Co-author Jurgen Liebig of Arizona State University in Tempe , US , said the hydrocarbon chemicals produced by the cheating ants were an " inherently reliable signal " .
This " reproductive policing " plays an important role in maintaining harmony in the ant world , Dr Liebig explained .
" The idea that social harmony is dependent on strict systems to prevent and punish cheating individuals seems to apply to most successful societies , " he said .
For cheating to be a successful strategy for some ants , the researchers say , two conditions would need to be satisfied .
Firstly , worker ants would need to suppress the hydrocarbon signals on their bodies .
Secondly , they would need to continue to express the signal on their eggs , so that their offspring could not be distinguished from those of the queen .
Some ant species are known not only to attack cheating workers , but also to destroy their eggs .

Who is the invisible woman ?
In America , she 's a size 14 and 162 pounds , on average ( The L.A. Times article says the average U.S. male is 189 pounds ) .
The first inclination is to say , whoa , somebody 's been eatin ' , but on deeper inspection you have to remember :
The average American woman today is a multicolored , multiethnic hodgepodge of the world 's greatest people , most notably , African - American , European - American , Asian - American , Mexican - American , and so on .
All these different people have , historically and culturally , different eating patterns , metabolisms and what not .

WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama wants the government back in the policing business , big time .
Obama 's huge stimulus plan includes about $ 4 billion to resurrect grants that put tens of thousands of police on the streets during the 1990s .
The programs were all but eliminated during the Bush administration amid criticism that their results did n't justify the hefty price tags .
The grants are popular with Democrats , and restoring them was central to Obama 's campaign plan to combat rising violence .
By tacking the money onto the stimulus plan , Obama avoids having to defend the spending during the normal budget process .
The proposal allocates $ 3 billion for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant , a program that has funded drug task forces , after - school programs , prisoner rehabilitation and other programs .
Another $ 1 billion in stimulus money is set aside for the Community Oriented Policing Services program begun under President Clinton .
The program , known as COPS grants , paid the salaries of many local police officers and was a " modest contributor " to the decline in crime in the 1990s , according to a 2005 government oversight report .
President George Bush slashed both grant programs over the past eight years , citing a series of reports questioning their efficiency and oversight .
But the programs remain popular among many lawmakers , who often used the grants to steer money to their home districts .
Mayors and police chiefs love them , particularly during lean economic times .
In New Bedford , Mass. , a port city of about 92,000 , Police Chief Ronald Teachman said a new round of grants would put police on the streets at a time when experts expect crime to rise with the unemployment rate .
With the mayor warning of city layoffs , Teachman said grants would keep him from having to move detectives and school resource officers into patrol cars to fill shifts .
And it would mean jobs , he said , which is why the stimulus was written .
" Any dollar they spend in New Bedford is going to be used better than one they spend on Merrill Lynch or others on Wall Street , " Teachman said .
" I 'm not going to hold the money back and not tell you where I 'm spending it . "
The House passed the stimulus bill , but the version that makes it out of the Senate is expected to be different .
But because Obama , Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General - nominee Eric Holder strongly support the grants - and Democrats control Congress - the programs will likely be resurrected even if they do n't make it into the final stimulus bill .
So , I was reading an article on Joystiq about a panel that was held as SXSW ( South by Southwest ) called Gaming as a Gateway Drug : Getting Girls into Technology .
From there my mind recalled another article that I read last year called How to get your Girlfriend into Gaming .
And that just made me think of games that could “ potentially ” be created to appeal to the female gaming audience .
And here we are …
So after a comic that will be seen less as a blatant parody and more as male chauvinistic , I decided to post my solution for getting females into gaming : create good , strong , fun games .
Just like Field of Dreams , “ If you build it , they will come . ” Look at Tetris and World of Warcraft .
Both of those games have had a lot of success with female gamers .
Why ?
Because they are both genuinely fun .
Remember , just because women are willing to settle when it comes to their significant others that does n’t mean they ’re willing to settle on what video games they play .
When it comes to this , they actually want quality .

UK annual inflation measured by the Retail Prices Index ( RPI ) went negative in March for the first time since 1960 , to - 0.4 % , down from zero in February .
RPI includes mortgage costs , which have fallen following the Bank of England 's reductions in interest rates .
The Consumer Prices Index ( CPI ) , fell in March to 2.9 % after February 's unexpected rise to 3.2 % , the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said .
The official CPI figure is still well above the government 's target of 2 % .

How families are being squeezed Recession tracker : full report
The ONS said that the biggest downward pressure on inflation had come from energy prices as the price of oil was significantly below the level it had been in the same month last year .
Rob Pike , an economist at the ONS , said further reductions in energy prices would have an effect on April 's figures .
" Clearly on the horizon there are downward pressures , " he told the BBC , citing further energy price cuts which are due to come into effect .
Vegetable imports from Spain revived , sending vegetable prices lower , after being hit in the previous month by poor weather conditions .
Transport costs also fell as a result of lower fuel prices , which also fed into lower air fares .
Falling wages Items in the ONS basket that were more expensive included the games , toys and hobbies category , with the price of computer games rising .
Kevin Peachey , personal finance reporter , BBC News
For those UK residents with a mortgage , the cost of living fell in March compared with a year earlier - but that does not give a complete picture of deflation .
So who benefits ?
Older people have just had a 5 % rise in their basic state pension - so if prices rise by less than 5 % , in theory they will be better off .
However , many pensioners rely on the interest on savings to top - up their pensions and these returns have dropped sharply .
One blow would be for workers ' wages .
If employers take RPI into account when deciding on any pay agreements , then a pay freeze is the likely result .
The real value of their wage will arguably be higher though .
Graduates who took out student loans before 1998 may even get a rebate as their interest payments are set according to March 's negative RPI rate .
What deflation means for you Graduates may get rebate
The price of clothing was also up from a year ago , with women 's outerwear a particular driver .
While the CPI is important as the rate that is targeted by the Bank of England 's interest rate - setters , the RPI is used by many companies as the starting point for wage bargaining .
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber has warned that the negative RPI figure should not be taken as an excuse to freeze wages .
" Although in some workplaces unions have agreed to put pay increases on hold or take cuts in wages to save jobs , many companies are still profitable and able to afford decent pay rises , " he said .
" Widespread wage freezes would prompt families to cut back on their spending , which would be the last thing the UK 's struggling economy needs right now . "
The RPI is also the figure that determines what happens to benefits and the basic state pension .
The figure used for pensions will be the one that comes out in September , although there is a minimum increase of 2.5 % .
But it is the March RPI figure that is used to determine the interest rates paid on student loans .
The new rates will be announced between now and when they take effect in September .
People who have outstanding debt from student loans taken out before 1998 may even end up with a negative interest rate .
The government is currently considering whether they could be due a rebate .
It has more flexibility in setting rates on loans taken out after 1998 .
Deflation threat
There are signs that inflation could fall further before September .
" We suspect that the weakness of retail spending and activity in general will bear down strongly on core inflation in time , " said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics .
" UK inflation is still set to drop a lot further and the threat of a broader bout of deflation has not evaporated . "
Michelle Mitchell , charity director of Help the Aged and Age Concern said : " Falling headline inflation masks the fact that that many older people 's real rate of inflation remains far higher than the average .
" With up to £ 5 billion of benefits going unclaimed by pensioners every year , we are strongly urging older people to ensure they are getting all the support they are entitled to . "
There was a warning from the British Chambers of Commerce of the challenges posed to the chancellor by the downward trend in inflation .
" Deflationary pressures could make the recession worse in the short - term , despite quantitative easing and the huge budget deficit posing inflationary pressures over the medium - term , " said the organisation 's chief economist David Kern .
" The chancellor must address both these conflicting risks in his Budget . "

ASUNCION , Paraguay ( CNN ) --
A second woman stepped forward Monday to say that Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo fathered a child out of wedlock when he was a Roman Catholic bishop .
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo says Monday he will comply with justice on the latest paternity allegation .
Benigna Leguizamon said Lugo fathered her son in 2002 in the city of San Pedro .
She served notice that Lugo has 24 hours to acknowledge paternity or she will take legal action .
" I am waiting in good will , " she said in an interview on CNN affiliate Telefuturo TV .
" But if they do n't do something , oh , my God . "
Lugo , 57 , acknowledged last week that he is the father of a 2 - year - old child conceived in the months before he stepped down as bishop .
He said last week he was making the admission " with the most absolute honesty , transparency and feeling of obligation . "
Without acknowledging paternity , he expressed similar sentiments Monday about the latest allegation .
" We 're going to act always in pursuit of the truth ... in this private matter , " he said in a nationally televised announcement on Telefuturo .
Do n't Miss Paraguay leader says he fathered child out of wedlock
Last week 's announcement came after a woman filed suit in a southern Paraguay city seeking a paternity test .
" It 's true that there was a relationship with Viviana Carrillo , " Lugo told reporters , naming the mother .
" I assume all the responsibilities that could derive from such an act , recognizing the paternity of the child . "
Leguizamon , 27 , said Monday that last week 's announcement had encouraged her to come forth .
" When I saw the case with Viviana , I was strengthened to make my accusation , " Leguizamon said .
She said she made the accusation to help her 6 - year - old son , who is starting school .
She will ask for a DNA test , she said .
In last week 's case , Judge Evelyn Peralta said she was treating it routinely .
" It is a case like any other , which involves the president and nothing more , " she said .
" It will be processed at it should be . "
Some Cabinet members interpreted Lugo 's acknowledgment of paternity as an indication of the change he has promised to bring about to achieve greater transparency in the public sector .
" This is the Paraguay that we want , " said Liz Torres , minister of children 's issues .
" This is the Paraguay of serious change in which there is no double standard or secrets .
It seems to be an example , a very big lesson . "
But some opposition party members said it appeared that Lugo practically had been forced to acknowledge what happened and that he had not done so willingly .
Sen. Julio Cesar Velasquez of the opposition Colorado Party called on the Vatican to excommunicate Lugo .
Lugo was made a lay Catholic last year , around the time he assumed the presidency .

If a new proposal gains support , Washington state could enlist the help of several hundred thousand big - toothed , furry mammals to manage the region 's water , reports Sightline Daily .
With climate change causing mountain snow to melt earlier in the spring , Washington 's rivers are low on water by mid-summer , threatening farmers and causing problems for fall salmon runs .
To store more of the spring runoff , the state ecology department has proposed the construction of three large dams , which would carry hefty price tags for taxpayers .
The Lands Council , a Washington - based nonprofit , has come up with a counter proposal : Let beavers do the work .
Native to the area but overhunted back when beaver pelts were in vogue , the Washington beaver has a population around 400,000 .
The Lands Council hopes to more than double that number by reintroducing beavers into key areas .
The council is hosting a Working Beavers Forum at the end of March to discuss the proposal .
Will Washington state residents take kindly to the idea ?
While some people consider the industrious builders to be pests , worldwide supporters of the animal praise its ecological benefits and encourage peaceful coexistence between humans and beavers .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia has asked Iran and Syria to help persuade the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas to accept an Egyptian proposal on ending the fighting in Gaza , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday .
“ Egypt ’s initiative ... is , for us , optimal and we believe all efforts should be thrown into supporting it , ” Lavrov told a news conference .
“ In connection with this we are sending corresponding signals to representatives of Hamas , and those states which have influence on Hamas , ” he said .
“ First and foremost that is Iran and Syria .
We have spoken to our colleagues .
I hope that everyone will concentrate on this . ”
The Egyptian peace plan includes securing the Egypt - Gaza border , across which Israel alleges weapons are smuggled , and ending the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
Israel said its three - week offensive in Gaza , which has killed more than 1,100 Palestinians , could be in the “ final act ” Friday after Hamas made a cease - fire offer .
Russia maintains close ties to Tehran and Damascus and has official contacts with Hamas , which is shunned by Western powers for refusing to abandon its objective of destroying the Jewish state .
( CNN ) --
Do you remember the scene in the movie " Something 's Gotta Give " where Jack Nicholson 's character lies about Viagra to a doctor in the emergency room ?
Jack Nicholson in " Something 's Gotta Give " denies having taken Viagra -- a move that could 've killed him .
He 'd just had a heart attack after romancing a ( much younger ) woman , and the doctor is furiously calling out orders to give him aspirin , blood pressure drugs , and ... nitroglycerine .
" Mr. Sanborn , did you take any Viagra today ? " the doctor asks as the nurses load him up with the medicines .
" No. No Viagra , " he says .
" Okay , good .
Just need to be sure .
Because I put nitroglycerin into your drip .
And if you 'd taken Viagra , the combination could be fatal , " the doctor warns .
Cut to Nicholson , who rips the IV out of his arm .
Hollywood got it right :
It can be deadly to lie to your doctor .
Your doctor " must know everything about you , even if the discussion feels a bit uncomfortable , " says Dr. Bernard Kaminetsky , the medical director of MDVIP , a group of boutique medicine doctors with headquarters in Boca Raton , Florida .
" What you omit may be the key to a diagnosis . "
Dr. Vicki Rackner says patients lie to their doctors for a variety of different reasons .
Sometimes they do n't want to talk about intimate subjects -- she calls them " the three P's : peeing , pooping , and procreating . "
Other times they want to seem like the ideal patient , one who eats right and exercises and follows the doctor 's orders 100 percent .
" I think it 's a drive to be seen as a good patient .
We all want to be seen as good boys and girls , " says Rackner , a general surgeon from Mercer Island , Washington , who writes and speaks about patient empowerment issues .
Watch more on what to tell your doctor »
From finances to sex , bathroom habits to spousal relationships , herbs to illicit drugs , here are 10 things about which you should always be open with your doctor .
Do n't hide from your doctor the fact that you :
1. Smoke , drink excessively , do illegal drugs
No one 's proud of any of the above , but your doctor needs to know .
He can't accurately diagnose and treat your health problems if you hide your substance abuse .
" Remember , there are strict privacy laws between patient and doctor , so the information is not going to be shared , " Kaminetsky says .
2 . Have peeing or pooping issues
" I once had a patient who literally died of embarrassment , " Rackner says .
" She had blood in her stool , but she was too embarrassed to tell her doctor .
A year later she was in terrible abdominal pain , and did go see her doctor .
It was colon cancer , and it had spread to other parts of her body . "
The patient came to see Rackner , but it was too late to do surgery .
She died six months later .
" As children , we 're taught ' Do n't talk about poop .
That 's potty talk . '
So on some level we do n't like to talk about these things , " Rackner says .
" But if she 'd brought up the blood in her stool to her doctor , [ the cancer ] would probably have been at an early stage and she could have been cured . "
3 . Take herbs
You might feel like your doctor looks down on herbs and other forms of alternative medicine , and there 's a good chance you 're right ; many M.D. 's are dismissive of alternative medicine .
But even if you fear seeing your doctor 's eyes roll back in her head , tell her about the supplements you 're taking .
Certain herbs do n't mix well with certain medications , so she needs to know .
4 . See a chiropractor or an alternative healer
See above about the eye - roll you might get if you tell your doctor you 're seeing a chiropractor .
But if you 're having neck pain , it would help your doctor to know that just a few days ago your chiropractor adjusted your neck .
5 . Are having financial troubles
" Money is the ultimate taboo , " Rackner says .
" We have no idea how to talk about money . "
But talk about it we must , she says .
For example , if your doctor recommends a procedure you can't afford , just say so .
You might be able to work something out with the doctor .
" Patients can offer to set up payment plans for expensive procedures and pay over time rather than a lump sum , " says Dr. Lisa Forbess , assistant professor of cardiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas , Texas .
6 . Want cheap medicine
If you want a cheaper medicine than the one your doctor prescribes , do n't be embarrassed to say so .
Rackner says for $ 4 you can buy a list of the generic drugs .
Ask your doctor if something on the list could work as well as the one he 's suggesting .
7 . Feel depressed or anxious or stressed out
Along with money , many people have trouble talking about their feelings .
" Depression is a serious disease and a lot of patients hesitate to tell their physician because because they think it 's embarrassing , or the problem will go away by itself , " Kaminetsky says .
" Depression is too dangerous to keep a secret . "
8 . Defied the doctor 's orders
When your gynecologist asks if you are doing your breast exams every month , do n't lie and nod your head .
Admit that you 're not .
Perhaps she 'll come up with a way to make it easier to remember .
Same goes for medicines :
If you 're bad about taking the drugs your doctor prescribed , she needs to know .
This is n't school ; you wo n't be punished .
9 . Do n't exercise and eat badly
If cupcakes are your best friend and you have n't exercised since the last century , just admit it .
Perhaps together you and your doctor can come up with ways to develop better habits .
10 .
Have a small problem you think is unimportant
One of Kaminetsky 's patients hesitated to tell him that he was experiencing subtle and occasional difficulty in swallowing .
" The patient thought it was so minor and inconsequential that he did n't want to waste the doctor 's time mentioning it , " Kaminetsky says .
But in the end , the patient did mention his symptoms and Kaminetsky says he was able to diagnose early -- and curable -- esophageal cancer .
So how do you get the guts to admit these things to your doctor ?
" You can just say to the doctor , ' Hey , this is embarrassing for me to talk about .
This is hard for me .
This is a taboo topic , ' " Rackner suggests .
Another option :
Tell the nurse , if you feel like you connect with her better .
A third idea : " If your doctor does e-mail , try that , or just write a note , " says Rackner .
" Some people do better writing things than saying them . "

Earlier this week , as 3,000 employees of Spansion , the Sunnyvale semiconductor company , were being laid off , many of their bosses were getting pay increases .
That juxtaposition — against the backdrop of the deteriorating economy and nationwide anger about greedy executives — has triggered outrage among the workers who have been let go .
Scores of the laid - off workers jammed a West San Jose pizza parlor Thursday to join two class - action lawsuits against the firm and to vent their anger .
“ It ’s just callous , ” said 38 - year - old Eric Rebaker of Boulder Creek , who lost his job as a Spansion plant maintenance specialist .
“ To hurt all these families — it makes me absolutely angry . ”
The employee layoffs , constituting about 35 percent of Spansion ’s global workforce , were announced as a cost - cutting measure in a company news release Monday .
In a separate filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission the same day , Spansion disclosed that its board had rescinded a six - month 10 percent pay cut imposed in October on some managers .
The decision to restore the pay was “ to provide an incentive for executive officers and certain other key employees to remain employed by the company , ” the filing said .
Layoffs ‘ regrettable ’
In a prepared statement Thursday , Spansion called the layoffs — which affected 615 California employees — “ regrettable . ”
But it added that “ the board of directors made a strategic decision to restore the full salaries of our key executives to ensure their continued commitment to the company ’s future . ”
In an interview , Russ Barck , Spansion ’s chief of staff , declined to say how many people had their pay restored , except to note that it was “ a very small subset of the company . ”
Although “ none of us feel good about the reduction in force , ” Barck said , “ it was one of those things we felt from a business perspective we had to do . ”
He added that Spansion is confident the layoffs were done lawfully .
However , two class - action suits filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose on behalf of fired Spansion employees dispute that .
Both claim that Spansion failed to adhere to federal and state law , known as the WARN Act , requiring large employers to give a two - month notice before laying off more than 50 workers .
“ What we ’re seeking on behalf of the folks who were recently let go by Spansion are damages in the form of back pay and other benefits that they likely were entitled to but did n’t receive , ” said Eric Gibbs , a San Francisco lawyer handling the cases .
Company spokeswoman Holly Burkhart said Spansion filed a WARN Act notice Monday , but that it has an “ exemption ” to the 60 - day notice requirement .
The company would not elaborate .
Neither suit addresses the issue of the executives ’ pay being restored .
But the attorneys handling the suits said that issue may become relevant later in court .
“ Right now I just think that ’s a very unsavory aspect of it , ” said San Francisco attorney Ken Sugarman , who filed one of the suits .
He questioned Spansion ’s claim that restoring the pay would help keep key employees from leaving .
With so few companies hiring in this economy , Sugarman asked , “ Where are they going to go ? ”
Maker of flash chips
Spansion was formed by Sunnyvale computer chip maker Advanced Micro Devices and Fujitsu , the Japanese technology company , in 1993 under the name Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited .
In 2003 , AMD and Fujitsu renamed it Spansion , and the firm became an independent public company in December 2005 .
Its bread and butter is so - called flash memory chips used to store data in cell phones , cars , printers and other electronic devices .
But it has struggled , especially during the worldwide recession , which has reduced consumer demand for gadgets containing such chips .
The company has consistently lost money since it went public and was $ 133 million in the red for the third quarter of 2008 , the most recent period for which it has disclosed financial data .
The company ’s stock closed Thursday at 5 cents ; its 52 - week high is $ 3.70 .
In addition to the layoffs , Spansion recently announced it would delay paying some of its debt and consider selling itself or merging with another company .
Making sure its top executives stick around during tough times could be an important selling point if Spansion wants to attract a buyer , said Jim Balassone , an executive in residence at Santa Clara University ’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics .
But Spansion ’s decision to pay the executives more while laying off others does n’t look good , he said , adding , “ It appears there is no shared sacrifice . ”
A lot of those who lost their jobs feel the same way .
“ It ’s greed , ” said Jose Alejandrino , 50 , of San Ramon , who said he worked in a Spansion testing area .
He worries how he will pay his mortgage and three kids ’ college bills .
“ I ’ve had a really hard time sleeping the last few nights , ” added 54 - year - old Paula Rao of Santa Clara .
“ I guess the bottom line is they have money to reward the execs that trashed the company , but not a crumb for the employees that truly deserved better . ”

Why We Can't Legalize Drugs
We can't legalize drugs - despite political , economic , even survival pressures to do so - because of deep underlying American mindsets against drugs , the two primary ones being that we believe continuing drug use is , or causes , a disease , and that parents can't bear to imagine their kids taking drugs .
As to the disease mindset , it is maintained and promoted by both pro- and anti-legalization proponents .
Mexico 's national nightmare , in which drug cartels are overwhelming the country 's law enforcement agencies , is the most serious political consequence to date of the current policy of " banning " drugs .
( Banning is in quotes since drugs are all around us . )
At the same time , California 's multibillion dollar sales of marijuana can't be taxed while the State drowns in red ink .
Yet the Obama Administration wo n't contemplate the possibility of legalizing marijuana .
Why not ?
Obama 's selection of Seattle police chief R. Gil Kerlikowske as American Drug Czar signals the Obama team 's rejection of the Bush emphasis on interdicting drug supplies and arresting drug users .
VP Joe Biden introduced Kerlikowske with the invocation that " combating drugs requires a comprehensive approach that includes enforcement , prevention , and treatment . "
Kerlikowske himself noted , " The success of our efforts to reduce the flow of drugs is largely dependent on our ability to reduce demand for them . "
But the major policy debate over drugs had already flown past the office of Drug Czar by the time Kerlikowske was selected .
The infiltration of the America 's domestic drug trafficking by Mexican cartels , illustrating both the porousness of our southern border and the continuing gargantuan illicit drug trade in the United States , now dominates American drug policy discussions .
And the Obama Administration has indicated no slackening of American attacks on supplier nations ' drug production and drug interdiction when it comes to this emergency .
Curtailing drug production and trafficking is an important motivation for Obama 's expansion of the War in Afghanistan .
And military options are the only ones being considered in the war that has erupted around Mexican drug commerce .
The only issue being argued in Congressional hearings is how much to step up our military support of Mexican President Felipe Calderon .
Changing American drug laws is simply not on the table .
When MSNBC's Rachel Maddow interviewed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano , only military and border policing options were discussed .
Two incurable American prejudices rule out the idea that changing the legal status of drugs can impact an increasingly out - of - control world drug trade .
1. Drug use is an uncontrollable disease .
In one striking way , opponents to American drug laws and defenders maintain the same idea -- drug use is a disease .
For reformers , this supports the idea that users should be treated , and not imprisoned .
This is behind former Senator Biden 's introduction of the " Recognizing Addiction as a Disease Act of 2007 , " which states : " Addiction is a chronic , relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use , despite harmful consequences .
It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain 's structure .
. . ( as ) seen in people who abuse drugs . . . "
And , hence , the purpose of the bill : changing the name of the National Institute on Drug Abuse to " National Institute on Diseases of Addiction . "
( Will this then include gambling ? )
Note Biden 's segue from " addiction " to " abuse " above .
So anyone who takes drugs -- like marijuana -- suffers from this disease ?
What about the large majority of people -- like the last three presidents -- who explore drugs ( including not just marijuana ) and move on ?
Will treating all such people as addicts really improve their and America 's situation in regard to drugs ?
One person who favors the coalescence of the terms " use , " " abuse , " and " addiction " is John Walters , Kerlikowske 's predecessor as Drug Czar in the Bush Administration .
But his purpose in doing so is to perpetuate drugs ' pariah status .
Defending the great success of his tenure , Walters argued strictly on disease lines in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that " Drug Legalization Is n't the Answer " :
Substance abuse is a disease .
Until recently , we failed to grasp the nature of this disease and how to reduce the suffering it causes .
For decades , we did not want to believe that alcohol or drugs could have the power to take over our lives , despite the evidence we witnessed when our loved ones grappled with drug addiction .
We did not understand how this disease could alter personality and steal individual freedom .
We have paid a high price for this confusion .
Biden , Kerlikowske , Walters , and the National Institute on Drug Abuse maintain the same attitude towards drugs .
Thus there will be no change from Bush to Obama in this regard .
2. Kids should never take drugs .
Discussing drugs in response to the Mexican - American crisis today , Joe Scarborough introduced the idea of legalizing marijuana on MCNBC's Morning Joe show .
Dr. Nancy Snyderman , NBC 's medical expert and a cohost on the show , quickly and decisively answered , " No. Marijuana makes you dumb .
It 's plain and simple : I do n't want my kids smoking dope " -- even though the large majority of teens will take drugs , drink illicitly , and be prescribed psychoactive medications .
And , so , illegal drug use extends endlessly on the horizon in front of us .
The American government tried to force a British resident held at Guantanamo Bay to drop allegations of torture in return for his release , court documents published yesterday revealed .
Binyam Mohamed , 30 , held by the US for nearly seven years , was told by the American military that he could win his freedom if he pleaded guilty to terrorism charges , ended his High Court case to prove his claims of torture and agreed not to speak to the media about his ordeal .
He rejected the deal .
Details of the extraordinary plea bargain were seized on by Mr Mohamed 's lawyers as further evidence to support his allegations that he was illegally detained and brutally tortured after his capture by Pakistani and US security agents in 2002 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The document released by the High Court in London reveals that the plea bargain was offered last year while Mr Mohamed was held in the US naval base in Cuba , but after terrorism allegations against him had been dropped .
Mr Mohamed was eventually released from Guantanamo Bay this year and allowed to return home .
Clive Stafford Smith , the director of the legal group Reprieve who has represented Mr Mohamed for four years , said : " The facts reflect the way the US government has consistently tried to cover up the truth of Binyam Mohamed 's torture .
He was being told he would never leave Guantanamo Bay unless he promised never to discuss his torture , and never sue either the Americans or the British to force disclosure of his mistreatment ...
Gradually the truth is leaking out , and the governments on both sides of the Atlantic should pause to consider whether they should continue to fight to keep this torture evidence secret . "
Last year , Mr Mohamed 's lawyers became engaged in a series of High Court battles to obtain access to 42 documents which they argued supported his case against the US authorities .
He claims he was flown to Morocco by the CIA where he was held for 18 months .
During this detention he says he suffered barbaric abuse , including repeated razor cuts to his genitals .
Last October , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones ruled at the High Court in London that there was a " clear evidential basis " for accusations that the US government was doing " all it could " to avoid disclosing the documents .
They referred to " delays and unexplained changes of course " by the American authorities , and the judges said the documents were " essential " for Mr Mohamed 's defence .
But they concluded that it was for the US courts to resolve the issues raised .
But yesterday it was disclosed that the judges had heard evidence that the US had drafted a plea bargain for Mr Mohamed to sign .
The details could not be included in the judges '
October judgment for reasons of confidentiality .
They said it was now " appropriate " to reveal details of the agreement in an annex to the judgment consistent with " principles of open justice and the rule of law " .
The judges said Clause 7 of the draft agreement required Mr Mohamed , in return for a lighter sentence , to plead guilty to two charges .
He also had to agree not to take part in any legal challenge relating to his " capture , detention , prosecution " and detainee combatant status .
In return , the maximum period of imprisonment for pleading guilty to the two charges would be 10 years , nine of which would be suspended .
The judges said Mr Mohamed had " wanted it to be made clear to the world what had happened and how he had been treated by the US government since April 2002 " .
The British economy shrank at the fastest rate in 30 years in the first three months of this year , raising fresh doubts over Alistair Darling 's budget forecasts just 48 hours after they were announced .
Official figures released this morning showed gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell by 1.9 % between January and March .
This is the sharpest quarterly decline since the third quarter of 1979 , the year when Margaret Thatcher came to power .
The fall was far worse than the 1.5 % decline forecast by City economists .
It contradicts the chancellor 's claim on Wednesday that the economy shrank " by a similar amount " to the fourth quarter , when it contracted by 1.6 % .
The Conservatives were quick to launch a fresh attack on Darling .
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne , said : " Just two days ago , the chancellor said his figures for this quarter would be similar to the last quarter – in fact they are worse .
This is worrying as it means the recession will be deeper and people will suffer more .
This budget has unravelled quicker then any in living memory as we discover a secret tax bombshell , hidden spending cuts and fantasy forecasts on which the government 's whole plan for recovery is based . "
Analysts were equally critical .
ING economist James Knightley said : " Today 's GDP report again highlights how optimistic Darling was in his budget assumptions and that the risk to the fiscal deficit remains heavily to the upside . "
The downturn is forcing the chancellor to borrow £ 175 bn this year .
The data from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) revealed that economic output in the first quarter was 4.1 % less than a year ago , the worst annual decline since the end of 1980 .
James Hughes , the chief investment officer at Black Swan Capital wealth management , said the UK economy was " very clearly in serious , serious trouble " , with more pain to come .
" Our research suggests that the latter stages of this crisis will be characterised by rapidly escalating inflation and further weakening of sterling , much like the stagflation of the 1970s .
The chancellor 's forecasts in the budget are now looking even more out of touch , " said Hughes .
Darling confirmed on Wednesday that the UK was in the grip of the deepest recession since the second world war as he slashed his GDP forecast for this year to a decline of 3.5 % .
But he surprised economists by predicting a rapid recovery , saying that the economy would return to growth towards the end of the year and expand by 1.25 % in 2010 and by 3.5 % in 2011 and the following years .
Many analysts believe this is wildly optimistic .
The average forecast is for growth of just 0.3 % next year .
Yvette Cooper , the chief secretary to the Treasury , said this morning that the government stood by its forecast that the recovery would begin at the end of 2009 .
Gloomy views
The breakdown of today 's numbers made grim reading .
Manufacturing slumped by 6.2 % on the quarter , its worst performance since records began in 1948 , and overall industrial production including utilities and mining was down 5.5 % .
The dominant service industries declined by 1.2 % , the sharpest fall since 1979 , with the financial sector particularly weak .
The Centre for Economics and Business Research calculated today that the economy would contract by at least 4 % this year , which would be the largest slide since 1931 .
The thinktank 's economist Benjamin Williamson said : " A contraction of only 3.5 % this year as outlined in the budget on Wednesday seems now to be wishful thinking from the chancellor . "
The International Monetary Fund takes a similarly gloomy view .
It warned two days ago that Britain would be stuck in recession for another year as consumers , reeling from the housing crash , cut spending .
The organisation predicted a 4.1 % slump for the UK this year and a further 0.4 % contraction next year .
However , the IMF backed Darling 's claim that Britain would suffer less than other major economies , including Germany and Japan .
The CBI business organisation said today 's GDP data showed " how grim the last three months have been " .
Its deputy - director general , John Cridland , said : " Looking ahead , the best we can say is that the pace of economic decline may slow in the coming months .
Given that unemployment will continue rising sharply , even if businesses begin to see the rate of decline in activity starting to ease , consumers are likely to feel anxious about job prospects . "
Industry is suffering severely after world trade collapsed , with carmakers hit particularly hard .
Industry figures out today showed that the number of new cars produced in the UK fell by more than half in March from a year ago .
The 51.3 % drop was slightly better than February 's record decline of 59 % , according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders .
Many manufacturers have moved to shorter working hours or even suspended production .
Sterling came under pressure even before the GDP figures were released , dropping by over 1 % against the euro to € 1.1062 this morning on fears that the UK may lose its triple - A credit rating because of the scale of public debt outlined in the budget - with Darling forecasting it will reach 79 % of GDP by 2013 .
A downgrade would make it more expensive for the government to borrow money by selling bonds , potentially leading to further tax rises or cuts in spending .
But Moody's , the ratings agency , said this morning that the UK's AAA rating was " stable , not under review " .
There is some optimism that the worst of the slump may now be behind us .
Colin Ellis , European economist at Daiwa Securities , said : " Today 's data are undoubtedly bad , and could serve as a rude awakening to anyone who had started dreaming of an eventual recovery ( stand up , Mr Brown ) .
Despite this , the marked size of the fall could even end up bolstering hopes that further cuts in output may be less pronounced - because if so much of the adjustment in the economy has already come through , maybe less is required going forwards . "
What Happened to American Unions ?
By Bryan Caplan
My favorite subplot in Brink Lindsey ’s “ Nostalgianomics ” is his tale of the decline of American unionization rates .
He begins by ridiculing people who blame the change on virtually non-existent policy changes :
Scrounging about for a policy explanation for declining unionization , Levy and Temin point to the failure of a 1978 labor law reform bill to survive a Senate filibuster .
They might as well have added the failure in any year to pass legislation requiring all employees to be union members .
In any event , maintenance of the policy status quo is not a policy change …
Brink then highlights some fascinating evidence that I should have heard about long ago :
As economist Henry Farber of Princeton and sociologist Bruce Western of Harvard have pointed out , the main cause of declining unionization has been a dramatic difference in employment growth between unionized and nonunionized workplaces .
Between 1973 and 1998 , employment at unionized firms declined on average by 2.9 percent a year , while jobs at nonunion firms grew at an average rate of 2.8 percent a year .
To counteract this differential and hold union density constant would have required torrid rates of organizing new workers .
Yet organizing rates have been in long - term decline since the early 1950s .
Only organizing rates at early - 1950s levels would have sufficed to prevent the drop in union density experienced since the early 1970s .

Our friends from MoneyEstate compiled a concise yet useful list of five common budgeting mistakes .
It ’s truly amazing to watch people with college degrees and lots of life experience literally be clueless about budgeting ( and we ’re not talking about such advanced concepts like financial modeling or calculating investment risks ! ) .
Good news is that when we developed the Weekly Envelope online budgeting system ( which is free , by the way ) , we incorporated means for users to get ready for the unexpected and to follow all Personal Finance Commandments .
Let ’s have a look at the list of mistakes compiled by MoneyEstate :
Not writing down and defining your budget .
You wo n’t believe how conveniently flexible you are when it comes to defining a budget and sticking to it if it all happens in your head .
Depending on circumstances , you can think that your weekly budget might be $ 300 - when in reality it ’s half that .
Where does the surplus money come from ?
Well , your cash reserves or ( unfortunately , much more often ) credit card debt .
Weekly Envelope system gives you an exact figure how much you can spend a week in order to spend less than you earn and to save for your goals .
If you spend more - you ’ll see the impact of excessive spending immediately .
Non planning for surprise or one - time expenses .
From our experience , an average person saves less than 50 % of the planned amount because of unexpected expenses ( car breakdown , child expenses , social events , etc ) .
The solution ?
Most “ unexpected ” expenses are in fact known in advance and are predictable .
Day Care center for your kids ?
Totally expected .
Car broke down ?
Unless it ’s a major repair ( in which case it might be a good idea to dispose of a car altogether ) , you could ’ve saved up for the repair : after all , you knew that it was just a matter of time , did n’t you ?
Weekly Envelope system allows you to specify your expenses in advance and save up for special occasions .
You will be surprised to see that most your “ unexpected ” expenses are in fact recurring and can easily be planned .
Not budgeting for contributions to an emergency fund .
This is the most basic rule of personal finance : no matter what - emergency fund is something that you must religiously build up .
20 % is the best , 10 % is OK , but even 5 % is better than nil .
Do n’t expect to get a salary raise or a fat bonus ( especially in the current economic climate ) : start with things you can actually change .
Weekly Envelope system suggests you to save a certain amount of money on a regular basis and informs you about the optimal size of your emergency fund .
Not changing the budget .
If you do n’t correct your budget from time to time , you risk forgetting about regular expenses or about changed income structure or about additional financial obligations or … well , you name it .
The result ?
It ’s always spending more than you earn and steadily heading toward debt .
It ’s a good idea to look carefully at your budget every month or so .
The best part ?
Weekly Envelope does it for you and adjusts your budget based on the planned expenses .
Leaving income for spending without budgeting .
Let ’s face it : the day you deposit your paycheck is probably the happiest day of the month / fortnight .
And it ’s so tempting to spend just this little bit on something you ’ve always wanted .
Just one little purchase … or maybe two .
Spending without budgeting gets you in financial troubles faster than anything else .
That ’s why it ’s extremely important to use a reliable method or tool to help you with budgeting .
What might this tool be ?
Well , you guessed correctly : Weekly Envelope personal finance system .
Do n’t leave your life to chance .
Taking control over your budget and spending is really easy if instead of stressing yourself with details you look at the big picture first .
Good luck !

U.S. Imperialism
The covert and overt interventionist actions of the U.S. to overthrow democratically elected governments , to crush national liberation struggles , and to prop - up brutal despotic regimes across the world exposes the complete bankruptcy of the U.S. claim that it is an ardent champion of “ freedom ” and “ democracy ” .
The U.S. exploits in this regard have been well documented by veteran journalist William Blum in his books titled Killing Hope : US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II and Rogue State : A Guide to the World ’s Only Superpower ( Common Courage Press , Monroe , USA , 2003 & 2005 ) .
Allusions to “ freedom ” and “ democracy ” provide a convenient cover for vested interests in the U.S. to corner USA ’s national wealth and for advancing the imperialistic goals of the same sections abroad !
Since WW - II alone , the U.S. has time and again covertly or militarily intervened and unlawfully overthrown democratically elected governments in Iran ( 1953 ) ; Guatemala ( 1954 , 1963 and 1968 ) ; Congo ( 1960 ) ; Dominican Republic ( 1965 ) ; Indonesia ( 1965 ) ; Ghana ( 1966 ) ; Chile ( 1973 ) ; Granada ( 1983 ) ; and in Haiti ( 2004 ) .
The U.S. ( with or without its British / Zionist ally ) has also time and again attempted to crush national liberation struggles and progressive movements in Greece ( 1947 - 49 ) , Palestine ( 1948-2009 ) , Philippines ( 1948 - 54 ) , Malaysia ( 1948 -55 ) , Puerto Rico ( 1950 ) , Korea ( 1950 - 53 ) , Kenya ( 1952 -59 ) , Egypt ( 1956 and 1967 ) , Lebanon ( 1958 , 1982 and 2006 ) , Vietnam ( 1960 - 75 ) , Cuba ( 1961 ) , Cambodia ( 1969 -75 ) , Laos ( 1971 -73 ) , Angola ( 1976-92 ) , Afghanistan ( 1978-1990 ) , Nicaragua ( 1981-90 ) , Venezuela ( 2004 ) , and in several other countries at various times .
Furthermore , the US has consistently backed and aided the world ’s most brutal dictatorships : Gen. Trujillo in the Dominican Republic ( 1930 - 61 ) , Salazar in Portugal ( 1932 -68 ) , the monarchy in Saudi Arabia ( 1932-2009 ) , Gen. Franco in Spain ( 1936 - 75 ) , the Samozas in Nicaragua ( 1937 - 79 ) , the racists in South Africa ( 1948-1990 ) , the Zionists in Israel ( 1948-2009 ) , the junta in South Korea ( 1948 - 87 ) , Gen. Batista in Cuba ( 1952-1959 ) , the Shah in Iran ( 1953 - 79 ) , Gen. Rojas Pinilla in Colombia ( 1954 -58 ) , Gen. Stroessner in Paraguay ( 1954-1989 ) , the junta in South Vietnam ( 1954 -75 ) , the Duvaliers in Haiti ( 1957 - 86 ) , Gen. Suharto in Indonesia ( 1965 -1998 ) , Marcos in the Philippines ( 1966 - 86 ) , the junta in Greece ( 1967 - 1973 ) , Gen. Pinochet in Chile ( 1973 - 1990 ) , and several other despotic regimes .
The defeat suffered by the U.S. military in Vietnam in 1975 and the collapse of Portuguese imperialism the same year , drove the U.S. to complete desperation ; they could not conceive of anything else but of adopting terror as a strategy to contain national liberation movements .
This strategy for furthering U.S. imperialist interests , which did not entail loss of American lives , has been well described by Prof.
Mahmood Mamdani of Columbia University , New York , in his book titled Good Muslim , Bad Muslim : America , the Cold War , and the Roots of Terror ( Pantheon , New York , 2004 ) .
Summarising the points he has made in his book , Prof. Mamdani in an interview to New York based e-journal AsiaSource on 05 May 2004 stated as follows :
Terror emerges as a strategy of the US after defeat in Vietnam , when it is on the verge of losing the Cold War .
The strategy comes to a head with the Reagan administration , which throws overboard the language of “ peaceful coexistence ” , now demanding an agenda to “ rollback ” the Soviet Union … .
Ronald Reagan ideologized proxy war in a religious idiom .
Reagan ideologized the Cold War as a war against “ evil ” , against the “ Evil Empire . ” …. you cannot convert evil , you have to eliminate evil .
In that titanic battle , any alliance is justified … .
It was under the American protective umbrella that apartheid South Africa created Africa ’s first genuine terrorist movement : Renamo in Mozambique , which was genuinely terrorist in the sense that it was not interested in fighting the military , its focus was on targeting civilians as a way of demonstrating that an independent African government was incapable of protecting its citizens .
The U.S. adopted the same strategy in Nicaragua and Afghanistan .
According to Prof. Mamdani :
Whereas the US was an understudy in Mozambique , its embrace of terror became direct and brazen after the Sandinista Revolution of 1979 .
In Nicaragua , the US created a terrorist movement called Contras , more or less as apartheid South Africa had created Renamo in Mozambique , also from scratch .
The lessons it learnt from southern Africa and Central America were put into practice in Afghanistan in the concluding phase of the Cold War .
There was also a direct link between undeclared / proxy wars and the drug trade .
As Prof. Mamdani puts it :
The reason was simple : if you do n’t declare war , you do n’t have access to public funds to wage it .
The search for funds to wage an undeclared war time and again led the CIA into an embrace of the underworld , particularly the drug lords .
The Afghan war exemplified the extreme development of two tendencies : one , the ideologization of war in a religious idiom , and two , its privatization .
As a result , as Prof. Mamdani points out :
The war in Afghanistan was justified as a global jihad .
To wage it , the CIA recruited volunteers globally ; Muslims everywhere , in the US , in Britain , all over the world , were invited to participate in this global war .
The CIA was busy creating cells everywhere , the nuclei of the same cells they are busy trying to smash today as a network of terror … .
The Islamist network was both global and private .
What we are reaping today is the whirlwind .
Under the guise of spreading “ freedom ” and “ democracy , ” the U.S. establishment consciously chose to arm and fund in Afghanistan the most anti-democratic , anti-women , and ultra -conservative elements of society , who were projected as “ jihadies ” fighting for a just cause , in order to contain what the U.S. called “ Soviet expansionism . ”
With the demise of the Soviet Union , which committed hara - kiri , the U.S. establishment has found a readymade “ enemy ” in the “ jihadies ” who have now chosen to bite the hand that fed them .
Thus , the very forces , which are instrumental in aiding and abetting terrorism the world over , are today purportedly waging war against those very same terrorist networks .
It is so obvious that without an omnipresent and everlasting “ enemy ” , the U.S. leadership will be hard put to divert attention away from the social crises at home and to justify the existence of a huge military establishment with its worldwide network of military bases and a questionable military alliance in the form of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) .
Curiously enough , while seemingly waging the never - ending war against terror abroad , there has been a concurrent curtailment of “ freedom ” and “ democratic rights ” at home .
Onslaught on Civil Rights
When universal suffrage was beginning to become a reality and the moment it appeared that all hindrances to the exercise of democratic rights by all U.S. citizens were being practically removed , the 9/11 attack and its aftermath provided the requisite justification for enacting the USA PATRIOT Act .
The “ Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 ” is anything but a “ patriotic ” initiative as it was being made out .
Incidentally , the PATRIOT
Act was already in the pipeline before 9/11 , which raises questions regarding the real motives behind its enactment !
The adverse impact of the PATRIOT Act across the U.S. has been well documented and analysed by Dr. Walter M. Brasch , professor of journalism at Bloomsburg University , Pennsylvania , in his book titled America ’s Unpatriotic Acts : The Federal Government ’s Violation Of Constitutional And Civil Rights .
In the preface to the book , Dr. Brasch points out that :
In the Bush–Cheney era , dissent is not tolerated ; jingoism is encouraged … .
In Columbia , South Carolina , a fifty - four - year - old man was arrested for carrying a sign , “ No More War for Oil ” … .
On Independence Day , 2004 , at an official presidential appearance , two people were arrested when they refused to turn their T - shirts inside out so an anti-Bush message did n’t appear .
In Scranton , Pennsylvania , a woman was ordered to remove a small metal peace button from her lapel .
In Hamilton , New Jersey , where Laura Bush was rallying the faithful to support the war in Iraq , a mother whose son was killed in Iraq was escorted out because she wore a T - shirt that declared , “ President Bush You Killed My Son , ” and had the audacity to ask what the Republicans believed was a hostile question .
Outside the auditorium , while talking with a reporter , she was ordered to leave , did n’t do so , and then was handcuffed and arrested on defiant trespass charges .
In Medford , Oregon , three peaceful women were thrown out of a campaign rally , and then threatened with arrests .
Their offense ?
They wore T - shirts that said , “ Protect Our Civil Liberties . ”
Their cases are just a few of thousands throughout the country .
Furthermore , according to Dr. Brasch :
Throughout the country , libraries have put up signs warning that the FBI , under authority of the PATRIOT Act , may seize library records to determine reading habits of patrons .
The congressional authority extends to bookstores , physicians ’ offices , grocery stores , Internet service providers , and virtually any business or organization that has personal data of customers .
Essentially , what this meant was that :
Enforcement of the PATRIOT
Act butts against the protections of six amendments to the Constitution : the First ( freedom of religion , speech , press , and assembly , and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances ) , Fourth ( freedom from unreasonable searches ) , Fifth ( right against self - incrimination and due process ) , Sixth ( due process , the right to counsel , a speedy trial , and the right to a fair and public trial by an impartial jury ) , Eighth ( reasonable bail and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment ) , and Fourteenth ( equal protection guarantee for both citizens and non-citizens ) .
Later , in an interview to Monthly Review on 22 July 2005 , Dr. Brasch stated that :
… this administration has repeatedly used 9/11 to justify even greater restrictions upon Constitutional rights , while making it appear it is doing its best to protect Americans from terrorists … .
Under the way the current administration can enforce the PATRIOT Act , Americans are all considered guilty until proven innocent .
According to Dr. Brasch , among dozens of national organizations that uncover abuses and fight for the preservation of U.S. constitutional and civil rights are the following : American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression ; American Civil Liberties Union ; American Library Association ; Bill of Rights Defense Committee ; Center for Constitutional Rights ; Center for Democracy and Technology ; Electronic Frontier Foundation ; Electronic Privacy Information Center ; Free Congress Foundation ; Free Expression Policy Project ; National Coalition to Repeal the Patriot Act ; Open the Government , and People for the American Way ; all of which have challenged how the PATRIOT
Act is being enforced .
Immediately after the enactment of the PATRIOT Act , President Bush , on 13 November 2001 , issued what is known as Military Order No.1 .
In response to this Order , Michael Ratner , a human rights attorney and the President of the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) in an article titled “ November 13 , 2001 : Coup D’etat in America ” stated that :
… it is a day , as they say , that should live in infamy .
On that date in 2001 , two months after 9/11 , President Bush issued Military Order Number 1 . … the President claimed the authority to capture , kidnap or otherwise arrest any non-citizen ( it was later extended to citizens ) anywhere in the world including the United States whom the President believed was involved in international terrorism and hold them forever without any charges , proceedings or trial … .
This order embodies within it the violations of fundamental rights we are facing today : indefinite detention without trial , Guantanamo , secret sites , special trials and disappearances … .
Let ’s also repeat : this was a military order in a society and country that was still or purported to be under civilian rule .
This order more then any other single document embodies our lost liberties .
Gregory T. Nojeim , a Senior Counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology ( Washington D.C. ) brought these disturbing developments to the notice of the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s Subcommittee on the Constitution on 01 October 2008 .
In a deposition titled “ Restoring the Rule of Law ” , he expressed his concern that :
Privacy , one of our most fundamental rights , recently has been dramatically eroded as a result not only of policy failures stemming from the response to September 11 , but also because our privacy laws and policies have not kept pace with advances in technology … .
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks , laws and policies have been adopted that unnecessarily weaken privacy rights and other constitutional liberties .
The government has adopted data mining techniques , expanded electronic surveillance , and launched new identification programs without adequate safeguards for the rights of Americans .
Towards a Police State
Already several concerned individuals have been expressing the fear that attempts were being made to slowly turn the U.S. into a police state .
Certain foreign observers too have commented on the unexpected turn of events .
One of the first foreigners to make an adverse comment about the disturbing development that was taking place in the U.S. was a German diplomat , Jürgen Chrobog , who was the German Ambassador to the U.S. from 1995 to 2001 and later State Secretary in the Federal Foreign Office .
According to a news report titled “ Envoy dubs US a police state , ” which was published in The Times ( London ) on 06 May 2003 , Mr. Chrobog “ was reported to have told Foreign Ministry colleagues that America was turning into a ‘ police state . ’ ”
Among the first in the U.S. to raise the question “ Is America Becoming a Police State ? ” was Ron Paul a conservative Congressman from Texas , who later became the fourth placed candidate in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries .
In his column “ Texas Straight Talk ” on 20 December 2004 , Mr. Paul pointed out that :
The question is no longer rhetorical .
We are not yet living in a total police state , but it is fast approaching … .
The atmosphere since 2001 has permitted Congress to create whole new departments and agencies that purport to make us safer – always at the expense of our liberty … .
Unfortunately , the new intelligence bill passed by Congress two weeks ago moves us closer to an encroaching police state … .
Those who believe a police state can’t happen here are poor students of history .
An overview of the major legislations that have been enacted post 9/11 and which impinge on the democratic rights of U.S. citizens was brought out in 2007 in an article by Stephen Lendman titled “ Police State America . ”
According to Lendman , a research associate at the Centre for Research on Globalization ( Montreal ) :
’ Police state America ’ has been in the works a long time , and it now may be near the boiling point … .
The nation is at war and laws are in place that end constitutional protections , militarize the country , repress dissent , and our government is empowered to crush freedom and defend privilege from beneficial social change it wo n’t tolerate .
It ’s the price of imperial arrogance we the people are paying , and that wo n’t end until the spirit of resistance gets aroused enough to stop it in our own self - defense .
While few articles of this kind ever get published in the mainstream print media or are referred to in the audio- visual media , a whole lot of such articles are circulating over the Internet .
Numerous books have also been written regarding the unprecedented growth of authoritarianism under the Bush Administration .
These include the following :
Elaine Cassel , ( Lawrence Hill Books , Chicago , 2004 ) .
It has been reviewed as follows : “ Offering sharp critiques of the Patriot and Homeland Security Acts , Cassel argues that Bush and Ashcroft have dangerously curtailed Americans ’ freedom of speech and religion , their right to a fair trial , and their protection from torture and unreasonable search and seizure .
She astutely criticizes the “ continued expansion of the word terrorism , ” which now encompasses , she says , “ any opponent of government policy . ”
— Publishers Weekly , New York .
C. William Michaels , No Greater Threat : America After September 11 and the Rise of a National Security State ( Algora , New York , 2005 ) , which has been reviewed as follows : “ In this very important study , C. W. Michaels gives us a unique guide and commentary , based on meticulous research , to the ominous growth of the national security state .
His analysis of the USA PATRIOT
Act is immensely useful and a wake up call for all Americans concerned with defending our civil liberties . ”
– Howard Zinn , author , A People ’s History of the United States .
Joe Conason , It Can Happen Here : Authoritarian Peril in the Age of Bush ( Thomas Dunne Books , New York , 2007 ) , which has been reviewed as follows : according to Conason : “ … fascism can indeed take root and blossom in the U.S. if Americans are n’t more vigilant about freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Although we are not facing full - blown fascism , Conason sees a “ gradual and insidious turn toward authoritarian rule ” for the first time since the Nixon administration .
He explores how and why … an increasingly secretive Bush administration usurp the power of the legislature and disregard provisions of the Constitution by stoking fear of terrorism . ”
— BOOKLIST , the review journal of the American Library Association .
Naomi Wolf , The End of America : Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot ( Chelsea Green Publishing , Vermont , USA , 2007 ) , which has been reviewed as follows : “ You will be shocked and disturbed by this book .
Most Americans reject outright any comparison of post 9/11 America with the fascism and totalitarianism of Nazi Germany or Pinochet ’s Chile .
Sadly , the parallels and similarities , what Wolf calls the ‘ echoes ’ between those societies and America today , are all too compelling . ”
– Michael Ratner , Center for Constitutional Rights , New York .
Naomi Wolf is a noted feminist writer and lately a supporter of President Barak Obama .
In an article titled “ Fascist America , in 10 easy steps , ” which was published in the Guardian ( London ) on 24 April 2007 , Naomi Wolf wrote :
It is my argument that , beneath our very noses , George Bush and his administration are using time - tested tactics to close down an open society .
It is time for us to be willing to think the unthinkable – as the author and political journalist Joe Conason , has put it , that it can happen here .
And that we are further along than we realise .
Conason eloquently warned of the danger of American authoritarianism .
I am arguing that we need also to look at the lessons of European and other kinds of fascism to understand the potential seriousness of the events we see unfolding in the US .
These ominous changes have taken place in the U.S. , especially in the last eight years .
At the beginning of this essay , a reference was made to the unsavoury incident that Bela Malik et al. had to endure .
However , it is now evident that the manner in which pressure was brought to bear on Bela Malik and her friends on 02 March 2006 in New Delhi in order to prevent them from expressing their anger at the ongoing war in Iraq during the visit of Laura Bush to a South Delhi Orphanage was nothing unique .
Ever since 9/11 , Bela Malik ’s counterparts in the U.S. have had to endure far worse abuses due to the enactment of a series of legislations , which intrude into privacy in an unprecedented manner and thereby considerably interfere with exercise of constitutional rights .
In the light of the realities of the situation as explained above , tall claims of the U.S. being the “ world ’s oldest democracy ” and about its purported commitment to promotion of “ freedom ” and “ human rights ” are not only rather farfetched but also are an indication of the extent to which the Bush Administration had indulged in doublespeak .
However , the myths created by the establishment tended to get credence because the mainstream print and audio- visual media , which are controlled by a few media conglomerates , widely propagate such myths as truths .
Media and Democracy
Largely due to the self - cultivated image , there is a popular misconception that news and views purveyed by the mass media is based on independent , objective and enlightened reportage .
As one journalist recalls :
For more than a century , objectivity has been the dominant professional norm of the news media .
It has at its heart the noble aim of presenting indisputable facts upon which everyone in society can agree , and build upon towards the goal of a better society …
The uncorrupted ideal of objectivity , in the sense of reporters driving to dig out verified facts and present them fully and fairly , is indispensable in journalism … .
During the 20th century , the ideal of objectivity in news coverage went from strength to strength …
We think of objectivity as meaning neutral .
But also balanced .
Impartial .
Non-partisan .
Neutral .
Accurate .
Verified .
Fair .
Factual .
Unemotional .
Detached .
Scientific .
Reasoned .
Unbiased .
With such an exalted image of the media , at least at subconscious level , many people often form their opinions based on reports that appear in the print and audio - visual media .
However , in reality , many a time the mainstream media tends to peddle partial truths , or even outright falsehood , as the whole truth – especially such news and views that are politically and socially sensitive .
This is primarily because , as the saying goes , ‘he who pays the piper calls the tune ’ !
The fact is that a handful of media conglomerates control much of the global mass media ; the exercise of monopoly control in the U.S. is even greater .
The media oligarchs , who in turn hold definite political and social biases , invariably decide the content and form of the news and views that are broadcast .
Propagation of politically and socially biased news and views , thus , have adverse impact on the collective consciousness .
Strong reaction against this negative trend arose in the 1970s .
As Ulla Carlsson , Director , NORDICOM ( The Nordic Information Centre for Media and Communication Research , Göteborg University , Sweden ) has pointed out :
Global flows of news and information were the subject of intense debate in international fora in the 1970s .
News gathering and reporting has been controversial , both within nations and between nations … .
The United Nations , and UNESCO in particular , were the prime arenas where these issues were thrashed out … .
The issue of a new international information order is bound up with ideas about the role of communication in the development of societies , on the one hand , and the relations between developed and developing countries , on the other .
Therefore , acceding to the demand of the non-aligned countries for a new international information order , UNESCO appointed a commission known as The International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems in 1977 to study all manner of problems of communication in the world .
Sean MacBride , former Minister for External Affairs of Ireland and the then Assistant Secretary - General of the United Nations , officiated as Chair of the 16 - member Commission .
The Commission ’s final report titled “ Many Voices , One World .
Communication and Society , Today and Tomorrow .
Towards a New , More Just and More Efficient World Information and Communication Order , ” was submitted to UNESCO in 1980 .
The Report is popularly known as the MacBride Report .
According to Dr. Carlsson :
The Commission report stresses that it is not only about developing countries , but about the whole of humanity , because unless the necessary changes are made in all parts of the world , it will not be possible to attain freedom , reciprocity or independence in the exchange of information worldwide .
The Commission confirmed the persistence of imbalances in news and information flows between countries and marked inequalities in the distribution of communication resources … .
For the first time ever , a UNESCO document plainly stated that a few transnational companies controlled the international information system and that their control posed a threat to the cultural integrity and national independence of many countries .
Dr. Carlsson further added that :
The commercialization of information is harshly criticized , as is the expansion of advertising markets .
The Commission stressed the importance of the social function of information .
An important theme in the report throughout is , for that matter , an emphasis on the societal roles of information and the need for democratization of communication flows … .
These demands [ for the 4 Ds – Development , Democratization , Decolonization and Demonopolization ] call for measures not only in the developing countries but , perhaps even more so , in the developed countries … .
A lot of emphasis is put on the right to communicate , defined as ‘ the right to be informed , the right to inform , the right to privacy , the right to participate in public communication ’ at all levels – ‘ international , national , local and individual ’… .
There was also a hint of the idea that the causes of underdevelopment might be found in the developed and the developing countries alike .
The governments of USA and UK were furious with the MacBride Report .
This was because the attack on media monopoly was construed as a direct attack on the interests of the wealthy classes .
One of the first to expose the extent of corporate control over the mass media in the U.S. was Ben Haig Bagdikian , who taught journalism and subsequently served as Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley .
His book titled The Media Monopoly ( Beacon Press , Boston , 1983 ) warned about the adverse effects of corporate ownership in the media .
The work has been updated six times ( through 2000 ) before being rewritten and renamed The New Media Monopoly in 2004 .
During this period , according to the publishers , “ the number of corporations controlling most of America ’s daily newspapers , magazines , radio and television stations , book publishers , and movie companies has dwindled from fifty to ten to five . ”
In Ben Bagdikian ’s analysis :
It is a handful of large media conglomerates that create the daily and nightly news world for a majority of Americans … .
Our picture of reality does not burst upon us in one splendid revelation .
It accumulates day by day and year by year in mostly unspectacular fragments from the world scene , produced mainly by the mass media .
Our view of the real world is dynamic , cumulative , and self - correcting as long as there is a pattern of even - handedness in deciding which fragments are important .
But when one important category of the fragments is filtered out , or included only vaguely , our view of the social - political world is deficient .
Another important publication on the subject was by Edward S. Herman ( Professor Emeritus of Finance , Wharton School , University of Pennsylvania ) & Noam Chomsky ( Professor , Department of Linguistics & Philosophy , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) titled Manufacturing Consent : The Political Economy of the Mass Media ( Pantheon Books , New York , 1988 ) .
This seminal work is an attempt to show that :
contrary to the usual image of the news media as cantankerous , obstinate , and ubiquitous in their search for truth and defense of justice , in their actual practice they defend the economic , social , and political agendas of the privileged groups that dominate domestic society , the state , and the global order … .
What emerges from this work is a powerful assessment of how propagandistic the U.S. mass media are , how they systematically fail to live up to their self - image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world , and how we can understand their function in a radically new way .
Prof. Noam Chomsky followed it up with a work titled Media Control : The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda ( Seven Stories Press , New York , 1997 & 2003 ) .
In this book , Prof. Chomsky
… reveals how falsification of history , suppression of information , and the promotion of vapid , empty concepts have become standard operating procedure for the leaders of the United States–both Democrats and Republicans–in their efforts to prevent citizens from raising awkward questions about U.S. policy .
Robert W. McChesney ( Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Illinois ) is also a major contributor to the debate with his work titled Corporate Media and the Threat to Democracy ( Seven Stories Press , New York , 1997 ) .
As Prof. McChesney points out :
… private control over media and communication is not a neutral or necessarily a benevolent proposition .
The commercial basis of U.S. media has negative implications for the exercise of political democracy : it encourages a weak political culture that makes depoliticization , apathy and selfishness rational choices for the citizenry , and it permits the business and commercial interests that actually rule U.S. society to have inordinate influence over media content … .
The right - wing assault on journalism and public broadcasting is not an isolated or exceptional phenomenon .
It is part and parcel of a wholesale attack on all those institutions that possess some autonomy from the market and the rule of capital .
Thus , according to Prof. McChesney :
… so long as the media are in corporate hands , the task of social change will be vastly more difficult , if not impossible , across the board .
The biggest problem facing all who challenge the prerogatives of corporate rule is that the overwhelming majority of Americans are never exposed to anything remotely close to a reasoned , coherent , consistent , democratic socialist , pro-labor , or even old - fashioned New Deal Democratic perspective .
This is why , in the end , media reform is inexorably intertwined with broader social and political reform .
They rise or fall together .
The present challenges facing the media were discussed at the third National Media Reform Conference in Minneapolis during 06-08 June 2008 , “ an event that brought together thousands of people dedicated to making America ’s media system more democratic , diverse and accountable ” .
One of the keynote addresses were delivered by veteran journalist , Bill Moyers , a former White House Press Secretary in the Johnson Administration from 1965 - 67 , a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award in 2006 , and currently the host of a weekly public affairs series entitled Bill Moyers Journal on Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) .
In a scathing attack on corporate media he noted that :
… our dominant media are ultimately accountable only to corporate boards whose mission is not “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ” for the whole body of our republic , but the aggrandizement of corporate executives and shareholders …
Referring to the war in Iraq he said :
… this Administration – with the complicity of the dominant media – conducted a political propaganda campaign , using erroneous and misleading intelligence to deceive Americans into supporting an unprovoked attack on another country …
Sadly , the Fourth Estate became the Fifth Column of democracy , colluding with the powers - that - be in a “ culture of deception ” … that subverts the thing most necessary to freedom – the truth .
Moyers was equally appalled by the continued existence of poverty in the midst of plenty in the U.S. Expressing his concern in this regard , he said :
Extremes of wealth and poverty cannot be reconciled with a truly just society .
Capitalism will breed great inequality that is destructive unless tempered by an intuition for equality which is the heart of democracy .
When the state becomes the guardian of power and privilege to the neglect of justice for the people who have neither power nor privilege , you can no longer claim to have a representative government .
In Moyers view , many such critical issues escape the attention of the larger public because of media consolidation .
According to him :
As conglomerates swallow up newspapers , magazines , publishing houses , and broadcast outlets , news organizations are folded into entertainment divisions .
The “ news hole ” in the print media shrinks to make room for ads , celebrities , nonsense , and propaganda , and the news we need to know slips from sight .
In short , the powerful role being played by the media in shaping public opinion cannot be overstated ; the more and more it goes under monopoly control , the public is likely to have less and less access to the truth !
Conclusion
The analysis of the claim that the U.S. is the “ world ’s oldest democracy ” has necessitated examination of various historical aspects from the formation of USA to the role of slavery , to the fate of American Indians , to the abolition movement , to the expansion of franchise , to the disenfranchising laws , to the civil rights movement , and to the voting rights act .
It also necessitated analyses of the nature of the U.S. Constitution , the iniquitous development , the role of U.S. imperialism , the onslaught on civil rights , the threat of emergence of a police state , and the nature & role of the media in the U.S.
All the evidences from the analyses negate the dubious claims of the U.S. establishment regarding its commitment to “ freedom ” and “ democracy . ”
As far as the current state of electoral laws and processes are concerned , the inferences drawn by Alexander Keysser from his analysis of the history of voting rights in the U.S. are especially noteworthy .
According to him :
At the opening of the twenty - first century ( and the new millennium ) , nearly all adult citizens of the United States are legally entitled to vote … .
That it took so long for universal suffrage to be achieved reflects elements of our history that fit uneasily into the official portrait of the United States as the standard bearer of democracy and representative institutions .
One such element …is that the right to vote has never been formally enshrined in our nation ’s constitutional order .
The range of choices offered to the public has been kept narrow , in part through the increasing institutionalization of the two - party system : rules governing ballot access limit the ability of dissident parties to mount national campaigns … .
As a result , the voices of the more privileged are heard more loudly in the halls of governance , and the ideal of democracy – that all voices be heard equally – is consistently undermined .
In addition , the role of money in elections is enormous .
Campaigns , waged largely on television , have become extraordinarily expensive , and candidates who cannot raise larger war chests are doomed to failure … .
Indeed , if current trends continue , the actual casting of ballots may be in danger of becoming a pro forma ritual designed to ratify the selection of candidates who have already won the fund raising contests … .
No political system can claim to be democratic without universal suffrage , but a broad franchise alone cannot guarantee to each citizen an equal voice in politics and governance .
The arrangements and institutions that surround the conduct of election … all can promote or vitiate the equality of political rights … .
The current debate over campaign financing and the use of soft money can be viewed as the latest battle in the two - centuries war over the democratization of politics in the United States ; at the movement , antidemocratic forces are winning that battle , and in so doing , are undercutting the achievements of universal suffrage .
Keyssar ’s warning eight years ago , that “ antidemocratic forces are … undercutting the achievements of universal suffrage , ” appears to be almost prophetic !
Ever since the ascendancy of George W. Bush as the U.S. President in January 2001 , through the highly disputed and controversial presidential election of 2000 , there has been systematic erosion of civil rights in the U.S.
The concerted attempt to curtail civil rights of U.S. citizens is an indication of the panic reaction from the side of the U.S. establishment , which is scared of the broadening of franchise and of the likely increased participation of the citizens at large in the decision - making processes .
The spectre of “ terrorism ” is a convenient excuse to clampdown on all anti-establishment protests and to ensure that the restrictions neatly remain in place throughout the never - ending war against “ terror ” !
At the same time , the U.S. establishment is compelled to repeatedly proclaim its adherence to laudatory precepts of “ freedom ” and “ democracy ” in order to conceal not only its authoritarian pursuits but also the fact about the widening economic disparities between the elite and the mass of U.S. citizens .
There was also a forlorn hope that the self - proclamation of being the “ world ’s oldest democracy ” would somehow cover - up the sins the U.S. committed in the past and is committing in the present both at home and abroad .
The real nature of democracy in the U.S. cannot be understood without reference to the observations made by those like :
( a) Prof. Charles Beard regarding the elitist nature of the U.S. Constitution ;
( b) Prof .
Alexander Keyssar regarding the history of the right to vote ;
( c ) Prof. Henry Call , Prof. Gar Alperovitz , and the Working Group on Extreme Inequality regarding the iniquitous economic system ;
(d) Journalist William Blum and Prof.
Mahmood Mamdani , who have documented the misdeeds of U.S. imperialism and debunked the U.S. claim of spreading “ freedom ” and “ democracy ” abroad ;
(e) Dr. Gordon Lafer regarding absence of democratic rights for nearly 88 per cent of the 138 million workforce at their work place ;
( f) Prof. Walter M. Brasch and attorneys Michael Ratner & Gregory T. Nojeim , who have raised concerns about erosion of civil rights ;
(g) Congressman Ron Paul , researcher Stephen Lendman , Prof. Elaine Cassel , attorney C. William Michaels , journalist Joe Conason , and writer Naomi Wolf , who had raised alarm about the dangerous drift towards a police state ; and
(h) Journalist Ben Bagdikian , Prof. Edward S. Herman , Prof. Noam Chomsky , Prof. Robert W. McChesney , and journalist Bill Moyers , who have exposed the disastrous effects of media monopoly that has resulted in the discarding of objectivity , accuracy and fairness in the dissemination of information .
It is a disturbing sign that despite the Bush Administration ’s frightening legacy , nearly 60 million voters , or over 45 per cent of those who cast their ballot in the 2008 U.S. presidential election , voted for the Republican Party !
While the bulk of the 69 million voters , or nearly 53 per cent , who voted for Barak Obama may have cast their ballots with the ardent hope that President Bush ’s authoritarian legacy would be dismantled , it is not very clear whether the Democratic Party is predisposed towards fulfilling that earnest expectation .
It also remains to be seen whether Barak Obama , in his new role as President of the U.S. , has the will to uphold the cause of civil rights ( to which he was purportedly committed ) and world peace or he would succumb to pressure and end up remaining a prisoner of his circumstances .
Hopefully , the various democratic institutions that were arduously built with determination to seek justice for all – during the long period of the abolitionist movement , the suffragette movement , the working - class movement and the civil rights movement – should be able to withstand the onslaught and succeed in dismantling the authoritarian and iniquitous structures erected before and during the hideous Bush era .
Democratic right is not merely a right to vote once every few years .
Fair access to nation ’s material wealth ; right to education , information , communication and association ( including at the work place ) ; and non-discrimination of any kind – by way of creed , language , colour , caste , region , ethnicity or gender – are all integral for nurturing a democratic society and in giving meaning to the notion of freedom .
Using a projection called anamorphosis to create the illusion of three dimensions when viewed from the correct angle , these four artists create some of the finest 3D pavement illusions we ’ve seen .
Four artist , one art .
1 Edgar Müller
At the cutting edge of 3D pavement art is german artist Edgar Müller .

GRAND RAPIDS -- Students at University of Michigan and Michigan State are joining Grand Valley State University students in protesting the shooting of Derek Copp .
Copp , a 20 - year - old GVSU student , was shot in the chest by police last week during the execution of a drug - related search warrant at his off - campus apartment .
Organizers expect hundreds of students to participate in the protests Friday in Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids to rally against drug policies they blame in Copp 's shooting .

The protests are being organized by members of Students for Sensible Drug Policy ( SSDP ) at the universities .
Copp , who was unarmed at the time of the shooting , is recuperating from his wounds .
His family has hired an attorney to represent him .
The unnamed officer who shot him has been advised by his union 's lawyer not to talk to investigators in the case .
" The War on Drugs is a War on Us , " said Chris Chiles , executive director of SSDP at the University of Michigan in a press release late Wednesday .
" Those who defend the prohibition of marijuana and other drugs can no longer use the safety of young people to justify a policy that most Americans know has failed .
For it is the War on Drugs that puts young people like Derek in the line of fire . "
Blake Walton , of GVSU 's anti-war on drugs group , said in the release : " Thankfully , Derek is still with us , but the War on Drugs claims countless lives every day , and drugs are more available than ever before .
" The situation is out of control .
The only way to effectively deal with the problems of drug abuse is to legalize and regulate drugs , and begin putting our scarce resources toward education and treatment . "

The House passed a bill yesterday which includes disturbing language indicating young people will be forced to undertake mandatory national service programs as fears about President Barack Obama ’s promised “ civilian national security force ” intensify .
The Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act , known as the GIVE Act , was passed yesterday by a 321-105 margin and now goes to the Senate .
Under section 6104 of the bill , entitled “ Duties , ” in subsection B6 , the legislation states that a commission will be set up to investigate , “ Whether a workable , fair , and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed , and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the Nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic , ethnic , and educational backgrounds . ”
Section 120 of the bill also discusses the “ Youth Engagement Zone Program ” and states that “ service learning ” will be “ a mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency . ”
“ The legislation , slated to cost $ 6 billion over five years , would create 175,000 “ new service opportunities ” under AmeriCorps , bringing the number of participants in the national volunteer program to 250,000 .
It would also create additional “ corps ” to expand the reach of volunteerism into new sectors , including a Clean Energy Corps , Education Corps , Healthy Futures Corps and Veterans Service Corps , and it expands the National Civilian Community Corps to focus on additional areas like disaster relief and energy conservation , ” reports Fox News .
The Senate is also considering a similar piece of legislation known as the “ Serve America Act , ” which also includes language about “ Youth Engagement Zones ” .

Fears about Obama ’s plans to create involuntary servitude were first stoked in July 2008 , when Obama told a rally in Colorado Springs , “ We can not continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we ’ve set .
We ’ve got to have a civilian national security force that is just as powerful , just as strong , just as well funded . ”
Despite denials that Obama plans to institute a mandatory program of national service , his original change.gov website stated that Americans would be “ required ” to complete “ 50 hours of community service in middle school and high school and 100 hours of community service in college every year ” .
The text was only later changed to state that Americans would be “ encouraged ” to undertake such programs .
In addition , Obama ’s Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , publicly stated his intention to help create “ universal civil defense training ” in 2006 .
“ The bill ’s opponents — and there are only a few in Congress — say it could cram ideology down the throats of young “ volunteers , ” many of whom could be forced into service since the bill creates a “ Congressional Commission on Civic Service , ” reports Fox .
“ We contribute our time and money under no government coercion on a scale the rest of the world does n’t emulate and probably can’t imagine , ” said Luke Sheahan , contributing editor for the Family Security Foundation .
“ The idea that government should order its people to perform acts of charity is contrary to the idea of charity and it removes the responsibility for charity from the people to the government , destroying private initiative . ”
Lee Cary of the conservative American
Thinker warns that Obama ’s agenda is to , “ tap into the already active volunteerism of millions of Americans and recruit them to become cogs in a gigantic government machine grinding out his social re-engineering agenda . ”
CFR luminary Gary
Hart hit back at critics , claiming in a Huffington Post piece that , “ Resistance to expanded public service programs can be expected from the ideologically sclerotic , those who occupy the negative ground between government as the problem and government as our enemy . ”
The frightening prospect of Obama ’s mandatory government servitude is covered in - depth in Alex Jones ’ new documentary blockbuster , The Obama Deception .

Mr Obama hopes to create a global consensus on greenhouse emissions
US President Barack Obama has invited figures from the world 's 16 major economies to Washington for a meeting on climate change at the end of April .
The event will be the first meeting of what the White House styles " the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate " .
It will focus on increasing the supply of clean energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions , the White House said .
It was announced as millions worldwide observed Earth Hour , turning off lights in a protest against climate change .
The Washington meeting is scheduled to take place on 27 - 28 April and the sessions will culminate in a July meeting in Italy .
International agreement
The forum - which will bring together representatives of the 16 major economies and the UN secretary general - is designed to help broker a UN agreement on global warming , the White House said in a statement .
It aims to create dialogue between nations and " help generate the political leadership necessary to achieve a successful outcome at the UN climate change negotiations that will convene this December in Copenhagen " , the statement said .
That pact that would take over from the Kyoto Protocol - an international agreement setting targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
Some 190 countries will be represented in the German city of Bonn on Sunday for talks on a new treaty on curbing greenhouse gases after 2012 , when the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol expire .
The world 's major economies include : Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , the European Union , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Korea , Mexico , Russia , South Africa the UK and the US .
Acetaldehyde And Alcohol - More Than Just A Hangover , Maybe Cancer Too
A new study published today in the journal Addiction shows that drinking alcohol is the greatest risk factor for acetaldehyde - related cancer .
Heavy drinkers may be at increased risk due to exposure from multiple sources .
Acetaldehyde is ubiquitous in daily life .
Widely present in the environment , it is inhaled from the air and tobacco smoke , ingested from alcohol and foods , and produced in the human body during the metabolism of alcoholic beverages .
Research indicates that this organic chemical plays a significant role in the development of certain types of cancers ( especially of the upper digestive tract ) , and it is currently classified as possibly carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization .
New research from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health ( CAMH ) in Toronto and the Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Laboratory Karlsruhe ( CVUA ) in Germany recently provided the necessary methodology for calculating the risk for the ingestion of alcoholic beverages .
The research team found that risk from ingesting acetaldehyde via alcoholic beverages alone may exceed usual safety limits for heavy drinkers .
Their risk assessment study found that the average exposure to acetaldehyde from alcoholic beverages resulted in a life - time cancer risk of 7.6/10,000 , with higher risk scenarios ( e.g. contaminations in unrecorded alcohol ) in the range of 1 in 1,000 .
As such , the life - time cancer risks for acetaldehyde from ingestion of alcoholic beverages greatly exceed the usual limits for cancer risks from the environment .
The team noted , however , that this risk is compounded by the addition of acetaldehyde exposure from different sources .
" The problem with acetaldehyde has been that although it has been recognized as toxic by Health Canada some years ago , most risk assessments to date were based on one source of exposure only " explained Dr. Jürgen Rehm , the lead scientist of the Toronto group and head of the Public Health and Regulatory Policies section at CAMH .
" This has led to a negligence of the overall risk . "
For example , in Toronto , even though there are limits for air exposure of acetaldehyde set by the responsible Public Health agency , these limits have been surpassed in the past .
Alone , the risks associated with surpassing limits of acetaldehyde from the air may not yet be alarming , but for heavy drinkers and smokers , it adds to the acetaldehyde levels already received from these sources .
This overall risk then surpasses established safety limits .
Based on their study the scientists of CAMH recommend :
* That the classification of acetaldehyde with respect to cancer be re-examined , incorporating new evidence which points to an additional cancer risk to humans .
* That a further risk assessment should take into consideration all sources of exposure from this substance .
* That the risk for cancer stemming from acetaldehyde from alcoholic beverages is recognized , and necessary preventive steps are taken to reduce the acetaldehyde content in alcoholic beverages .
* That the overall level of acetaldehyde exposure be minimized to the lowest level technically possible .

I made an unfair statement in my extremely harsh review of this past weekend ’s The Haunting in Connecticut .
What I said was that I hate haunted house movies .
But upon further reflection , I realize that that ’s not entirely true .
I guess what I hate is the painfully standard template that ’s used for haunted house movies .
Movies like The Grudge , An American Haunting and even classics like Robert Wise ’s original The Haunting , The Amityville Horror , and The Innocents just bore me to tears .
I do n’t know what it is about them , I just do n’t like them .
But to suggest that there are n’t any horror films depicting a “ haunting ” of some type that are n’t any good is just wrong on my part and I take it back .
There are plenty of films out there depicting evil spirits or ghosts creating havoc for a group of unsuspecting people that are pretty impressive little ventures .
And would n’t ya know it ?
I ’ve got five of ‘em in yonder paragraphs .
5 . The A Nightmare on Elm Street Franchise ( 1984-1994 , dirs : Wes Craven ( 1 ) , Jack Sholder ( 2 ) , Chuck Russell ( 3 ) , Renny Harlin ( 4 ) , Stephen Hopkins ( 5 ) , Rachel Talalay ( 6 ) , and Wes Craven ( 7 ) )
Like it or not , friends , this series is totally a string of ghost movies .
Freddy Krueger is nothing if not a ghost , and he haunts the house at 1428 Elm Street .
It ’s mainly considered a slasher series , and it is , but it ’s got more visual mastery and supernatural creativity in a random sampling of five minutes than any Friday the 13th or Halloween movie out there .
Horror master
Wes Craven started it all off with his creepy 1984 original and it continued with six sequels ( plus Freddy vs. Jason ) .
Highlights among the sequels include the massively underrated A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 : Freddy ’s Revenge which does n’t exactly follow the rules established by the other films but nevertheless helms a pretty fascinating little picture all on its own ( and with great make - up effects and a very interesting beneath - the - surface character study ) .
Part 5 : The Dream Child , I greatly enjoy for its darker nature .
None of the other ( pre- New Nightmare ) films were able to mine humor from Freddy as well as this film does , managing to keep all of the laughs in the vein of the macabre and of general discomfort .
“ Bon appetit , bitch , ” has always been a favorite Freddy one - liner of mine .
Wes Craven ’s New Nightmare is another terrific gem in which Craven stepped back behind the camera ( as well as in front of it , too ) to tell a totally different kind of Freddy story .
Lots of dark self - referential humor abound in this one as Freddy Krueger stalks all of the people involved with the making of the first film .
All in all , this is an outstanding series involving some rough ghostly business that cannot and should not be easily dismissed .
4 . The Evil Dead ( 1982 , dir : Sam Raimi )
This first film in Sam Raimi ’s quirky franchise has always been my favorite .
It ’s not exactly a “ ghost ” movie , but I figure that demons and evil spirits are close enough .
Truly great low - budget horror begins and ends here .
No one can do it with the abrasive , cheery gusto that Raimi brings to the table .
The imcomparable Bruce Campbell steps into the role of Ash for the first time in this film where a group of four friends , spending the weekend in a cabin in the woods unwittingly stumble across the Necronomicon ( Book of the Dead ) and awaken a hoard of demons who have been resting for years .
Terror ensues .
Its sequels , Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness were much more in the vein of off - the - wall slapsticky splatter comedy , but The Evil Dead likes to keep all of its elements , including the humor , in a much darker tone .
It ’s got brutal violence , gobs of gore , tree - rape , and totally deranged and genuinely frightening demon make - up .
But , while this movie can certainly be pretty rambunctious at times , Raimi gets his biggest chills from the more low - key moments in the picture–like a lightbulb slowly filling with blood .
It ’s always been one of my favorite supernatural fright flicks and really one of my favorite horror movies in general .
Because sometimes the best means of fighting off evil spirits is n’t seances or the chanting of ancient incantations , but using a big damn chainsaw .
It ’s a big freaky tongue - in - cheek ride that never seems to get old .
I ca n’t wait to see Raimi ’s long - awaited return to the horror genre with next month ’s awesome - looking Drag Me to Hell .
I may soon find it in myself to forgive him for the debacle that was Spider - Man 3 .
3. Ghostbusters ( 1984 , dir : Ivan Reitman )
It ’s not really a horror movie , per se , but it ’s certainly a movie where haunted houses cause a lot of problems for a lot of people .
And since I ’m feeling really honest and lovely right now , I have to admit that there were many a moment in this movie that scared the ever - loving shit out of me when I watched it as a kid .
But to look at it today , it ’s plain to see that it ’s one of the smartest and funniest comedies of the eighties .
It ’s got all of the ingredients that I ca n’t stand about traditional haunted house movies , but they ’re all mere side - notes–catalysts for the much larger beast that is Ghostbusters .
Ivan Reitman ’s film really knows how to subvert a whole genre in ways that you would n’t think of , creating a wonderfully outside - the - box kind of ghost story .
The whole cast , including Bill Murray , Dan Aykroyd , Harold Ramis , Sigourney Weaver , and Rick Moranis ( who I ’d really like to return to movies ) are all on their best game , creating a constant stream of memorable moments .
“ We came , we saw , we kicked its ass ! ” I do n’t think I ’ve ever met anyone in my life that did n’t love Ghostbusters .
There ’s a reason for that , friends .
Go watch it now , and then come back and check out my picks for numbers 2 and 1 .
2. Kwaidan ( 1965 , dir : Masaki Kobayashi )
Kwaidan is , without question , one of the best anthology films of all time .
It ’s a terrific collection of four ancient Japanese ghost stories that clocks in at a monstrous ( for a horror film ) 161 minutes .
This is the only horror film I ’ve ever seen to truly capture the quiet awe of sitting and listening to someone else tell you truly frightening ghost story .
Masaki Kobayashi’s film is an expressionistic and heavily atmospheric movie that uses light , shadow , and color against gorgeously painted backdrops to create a dream - like mood that puts you into a trance while its stories unfold before you .
The first story is The Black Hair and may just be my favorite .
It ’s about an impoverished samurai ( Misako Watanabe ) who comes to regret ( in more ways than one ) leaving his wife for the daughter of a wealthy official .
The second story , The Woman of the Snow is also quite powerful and perhaps the most beautifully shot piece in the film .
The story involves a woodcutter ( played by Kurosawa frequenter and star of Kobayashi ’s outstanding Harakiri , Tatsuya Nakadai ) who is trapped in a snowstorm with his brother and recieves an unwelcome visit by the titular lady .
Hoichi the Earless is the third story and probably the one that the film is most famous for .
It ’s a stirring bit of folklore about a blind musician ( Katsuo Nakamura ) who is called on by ghosts to perform a ballad , but for protection against them must have all of his flesh marked in ancient scripture by a Buddhist monk ( played by another Kurosawa regular , Takashi Shimura ) .
Only , he missed a spot …
In the last story , In a Cup of Tea , a renowned samurai ( Kanemon Nakamura ) begins to see visions of another samurai staring back at him in his tea .
When he finally sees him in the flesh , he challenges him to a duel .
But there ’s more to this visitor than meets the eye .
Like I said , it ’s 161 minutes , so you may have to clear your schedule for this one , but it ’s well worth it .
1. The Shining ( 1980 , dir : Stanley Kubrick )
Often times I like to stay a little less obvious than a movie like this .
I ’m a fan of throwing movies on my lists that either stretch the generally accepted boundaries of the genres I ’m placing them in ( kinda like A Nightmare on Elm Street ) or are something that most people have n’t heard of ( like Kwaidan ) .
The Shining is really the only one on my list that is indisputably a haunted house / ghost movie that you ’ll find on every list of the best of ‘ em .
But there ’s a damn good reason .
No horror movie out there embodies the term “ horror ” as wholly and powerfully as this masterful film from the master himself , Stanley Kubrick .
It starts out with that same template that I do n’t like : a family moves into a big old house with a haunted history of madness and murder and slowly things start to go a little nutty .
But there ’s just more to it than that .
Everything that anyone could ever find terrifying is in this movie .
Within the confines of both supernatural terror and serial killer suspense stories , The Shining creates a terrifying portrait of the kind of horror where no safety exists whatsoever ; where those you love and trust the most are now your enemy and you cannot escape .
It ’s one of those movies ( not unlike many a Kubrick movie ) that , for whatever reason , may rub you the wrong way the first time you see it , but it grows on you more and more until you find yourself completely mesmerized by it .
For one thing , it used to bother me that the titular “ shining , ” Danny ’s and Scatman Crothers ’s means of communicating through telepathy , seemed inserted in the film only as a very convenient plot point .
And to some extent , I still feel that way , although its convenience kinda gets thrown out the window in the most brilliant of ways .
But on the other hand , I kinda love it because it ’s just so bold of the movie to ask you ( or is it just telling you ? ) to accept the existence of these supernatural tendencies as a given .
As a result , the movie is a twisted fusion of a realistic descent - into - madness movie and an epic piece of haunted house fiction .
At the end of the day , no movie has ever used the standard template that I hate so much to better effect than this endlessly spooky film .
The Amityville Horror would like to think that it has , but The Amityville Horror is fucking wrong .
The performances are stellar , the cinematography is outstanding , and –for lack of an adjective that will do it justice –the direction is Kubrick .
And so ends another ShepRamsey Top 5 .
Hopefully you learned something today .
I know I did .
It is often said that to reach the end of any journey , one needs to look back and see where it all began .
It ’s from this vantage point that the first part of the BSG series finale “ Daybreak , Part 1 ” starts out and in doing such , provides us with some greater insight into these characters and through it , the significance of the choices they ’ve made and probably will make in the final two hours of this remarkable drama series .
Watching the flashback scenes of what life was like on Caprica , we now learn that many of the series characters had in fact lost much of what mattered to them well before the fall of the thirteen colonies .
The Kara we see traipsing around the apartment getting the place ready for her first dinner with her fiancé ’s brother is almost unrecognizable from the Starbuck character we ’ve known from the start , making the psychological impact of Zack ’s death and her sense of responsibility for her part in it that much more palpable than it was before .
When Adama wraps his arm around Kara later in the episode , reminding her that no matter what has happened she is still his daughter , serves to reinforce this reality , that those who knew Kara when she was engaged to Zack have seen the tectonic shift in her emotional grounding .
Adama ’s gentle words to Kara at this point also serves to remind her and all of us that the bond they have over that shared grief transcends any concerns over the nature of Kara ’s existence , that such issues ultimately do n’t change who she is or what she means to those around her .
Compare this now to the Lee Adama we ’re shown during those days on Caprica .
Instead of the self - assured , do - gooder we ’re accustomed to seeing , we see a Lee who ’s clearly lost without a purpose , stumbling about his apartment in a drunken stupor .
The scene where he finds that pigeon in his home that he vainly tries to chase away is evocative of the listlessness he clearly feels at this point in his life .
The imagery of the bird seeing freedom just outside those windows but being unable to figure out how to get out there reflects
Lee ’s state of mind at this point , with his annoyed utterance “ stupid frakkin ’ bird ” being said as much to himself as it is to the pigeon .
Clearly , Lee is trapped in his current life on Caprica as much as that bird is trapped in his house .
But just as he is unable to get the bird out to freedom , he ’s also incapable of freeing himself from whatever shackles are holding him down in his life on Caprica .
In this short scene , Moore reveals to us that even before this journey had begun , Lee was in many ways like the bird in his apartment , fluttering around the place trying to figure how to get out to a place where he could be free ( remember his admission to Dee about how he did n’t want to be rescued when his Viper was destroyed during the attack on the Cylon Resurrection ship ? ) .
The sudden scene switch to Lee as the head of the fleet ’s government and his obvious comfort in addressing the concerns and fears of all those around him tells us that finally , the bird had broken out from this cage of glass and metal and is now flying about , free in the air where it belongs .
We also get some valuable insight into the character of Gaius and with it perhaps a glimmer of the true nature of Head Six .
In the first scenes featuring Gaius and Caprica Six in the limousine , Caprica Six makes the observation that unlike her , Gaius is a person who prefers that others do things for him , something that becomes more apparent with Gaius ’ attempts to bribe the nurse to stay with his dad for another night .
Of course , this is hardly a revelation in regards to Gaius since his narcissistic attitude was clearly evident to everyone around him from the beginning .
And yet , from the scenes with Gaius ’ dad , we finally understand the nature of his narcissism – it ’s not that he ’s in love with himself as it is he ’s in love with what he ’s transformed himself into and in particular , how it removes him from the working - class , ‘ people of the land ’ lineage he originally came from .
This move by Gaius to distance himself from his true origins is no doubt the key reason for the spite and hatred Gaius and his dad have for each other as both now represent what the other despises most .
The sad irony is that this also makes it impossible for Gaius to truly understand his father who , as Caprica Six points out , is in many ways like Gaius in being a complicated man who is nonetheless capable of being contented “ by the most simple of things ” .
The fact that Caprica Six was capable of making his father happy , something that was clearly elusive for Gaius , might in some ways explain the existence of Head Six and Gaius ’ burgeoning need for Caprica Six ’s aid .
As the only person who ever seemed to understand his father , it ’s possible that Gaius created Head Six as a means to sustain this persona he ’s created for himself while at the same time seeking out the one person who was able to help his father and thus perhaps himself .
In some ways even , Head Six is the bridge between his true origins and the reality he has built for himself .
That ’s why it ’s clear that his hesitation to join Adama ’s mission to rescue Hera has less to do with a selfless act for the greater good than his desire to try to gain some ground with Caprica Six in the hopes that she might be able to help him in the same way she did for his father .
His conversations with Lee regarding his followers having a seat on the government reinforce the comment Caprica Six made to Gaius in last week ’s episode of still being the same person he was on Caprica ; despite all the twists and turns that Gaius has taken over the last four years , he is still in that same position of wanting others to do the work for him .
But the most dramatic revelation had to be in the character of Roslyn , not only because the event that leads her to that emotional coldness that ’s been her source of strength to keep pushing ahead is a powerful and heartrending one , but also because it highlights the significance of her admission in last week ’s episode regarding her sentiments about finding home again in Adama .
In that first scene at the end of her younger sister ’s baby shower , we clearly see a Laura Roslyn we ’ve never seen before , one that ’s infused with a joy and effervescence for life and family .
When the police arrive to inform her of the death of her entire family – her dad and her two sisters – that moment when she turns away and addresses the officers to leave , you could feel the chill entering the room ; it ’s a testament to Mary McDonnell ’s performance that in that moment , her inflection sounded very much like the Laura Roslyn we ’ve grown accustomed to hearing over these last four years .
Indeed , the subsequent scenes showing Roslyn tiding up her place – a task her sister told her to stop and take a break from – evoked the no-nonsense , let ’s - just - move - on Roslyn we know , the one who told Adama a few episodes back how he needed “ to clear his head ” to deal with the unpleasant realities that they faced .
With this character reveal , we now understand the weight of those words , and that possibly it ’s something that ’s been her mantra ever since that painful day back on Caprica when her whole world was torn asunder .
The next scene showing Roslyn walking into the fountain , resting against the rock formation and opening her arms to the cascading water is powerful in its imagery , prefaced by the bubbling of grief shown on Laura ’s face before she takes her walk into the wading pool of the fountain .
Her embrace of the falling water was her physically clearing her head of this pain , of washing herself of her old life , a life that now had no meaning given the loss of her whole family .
Indeed , when she picks up that picture of her dad and her two sisters , we see her abruptly shaking her head , as if attempting to deny herself that this should have any meaning or importance to her .
Although Adama ’s scene on Caprica is rather cryptic for the moment ( I ’m assuming we ’ll be given more insight into the relevance of that short scene in next week ’s two - hour finale ) , we still are given a wonderful Adama moment in this episode on board the Galactica after he encounters Hotdog collecting the pictures of all the lost pilots .
As Adama walks down this corridor , looking at the images left on the walls because there ’s no one left who knows who these individuals are , it ’s a poignant reminder of what the fleet is about to leave behind .
As Gaius admits to Lee in an earlier scene , Galactica has been a repository for both the fleet ’s hopes as well as a reminder of the life they left behind .
This corridor was very much what a memorial is – a tangible connector to some past loss that we do n’t want to forget or lose touch with .
And yet , the almost barren walls reflect the reality that they now have to cut ties with that past life and accept the reality of starting anew , with some new way to define who or what they are .
The moment when Adama stops dead in his tracks after seeing the picture of Hera is an important one because he realizes that Hera is not another fragment from their past lives ; instead , she is very much a reflection of the new lives they must now start , if not perhaps the very key to that new life .
Adama ’s fixed stance just outside the corridor for such a long time reflects his own internal battle to not only finally accept this reality , but also his coming to the realization that he has one final mission to complete , one last person who is in need of his saving them .
Granted there were some gaping plot holes like how they were able to find the location of the Cylon Colony – simply asking Anders while he ’s hooked up for that information is just a tad too sloppy .
Although this is the first of a two - part episode , I doubt they ’re going to explain this relevant point further as there are larger series issues that need to be resolved before the series ends .
Another moment that was equally disappointing was the casual scene shown between Helo and Tyrol .
Given Tyrol ’s part in the abduction of Hera , I could n’t see why Helo would even want to speak to Tyrol , let alone what he could gain from such a conversation .
Yes , it was nice to see that Tyrol was being held accountable for his part in Boomer ’s escape .
However , his release soon after at the episode ’s end made this scene feel a bit too much like a throwaway one that really would have served the storyline better had it been included in last week ’s episode .
Regardless , given the continued stellar performances of the actors , it ’s easy to move past these points in order to enjoy the more significant portions of this part of the final episode .
When BSG resumed earlier this year , Moore and Eick assured fans that ‘ all would be revealed ’ .
In “ Daybreak , Part 1 ” , they certainly have gone about doing just that by shedding light into who these characters were before the apocalypse , not only so we can better appreciate the transformation they have undergone , but also where they are headed .
As I said at the start of this review , the only way to truly appreciate how this journey will end is to understand how it all first began .
Earlier this month Caroline Sabey crossed a threshold she never imagined she would see : the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services .
The single mother had been laid off in February from her $ 55,000 - a- year job as an executive assistant .
Almost immediately , Sabey , 42 , struggled to make ends meet .
She went to the county hoping to get money to buy food for her two young sons .
By asking for help , Sabey joined a growing number of middle - class families applying for government aid only to discover that their safety nets -- savings , severance packages , unemployment payments -- put them at a disadvantage in a system designed to serve the very poor .
At the crowded Chatsworth Social Services office , Sabey waited hours .
Caseworkers had her apply for food stamps and CalWorks , which offers cash benefits for families .
Advertisement
Late last week she was told her application was denied .
Her monthly unemployment payments of $ 1,943 put her $ 36 over the federal income limit for food stamps .
The monthly income limit for a family of three for CalWorks was even lower .
“ What happens to us middle - class families who were making good money and then boom , something like this happens , and we have to meet these guidelines ? ” she said , adding that her unemployment check barely covers her rent and basic bills .
“ I do n’t think America was prepared for us to fall under this . ”
County officials say Sabey ’s story is increasingly common .
At a meeting earlier this month of the county ’s Commission for Children and Families , participants were startled when Miguel Santana , a deputy to the county ’s chief executive , told them caseworkers are turning away those who are not already “ living in their cars . ”
Santana later said that he had exaggerated a bit , but only to underscore how stressed the system is .
He called the system for determining benefit eligibility “ a very ineffective way of helping people ” that “ does n’t consider this very unique circumstance we are in . ”
Advertisement
“ A lot of these folks , once the economy picks up again , are going to be able to land on their feet , ” Santana said .
“ But it ’s going to take a while .
What ’s going to happen in between ? ”
In February , the county denied 6,605 applications for CalWorks -- which saw a substantial increase in requests from two - parent families -- about 18 % more than the same month last year .
Among those who applied for and received CalWorks were 674 two - parent families , 37 % more than the same month last year .
Food stamp denials were up 14 % , general relief denials were up 10 % , and Medi-Cal denials were up 7 % .
Philip L. Browning , the county ’s director of social services , said the increased denials reflect an overall surge in applications for assistance in recent months .
Although the largest spikes in demand for aid were in working - class and low - income communities , middle - class areas also saw significant increases .
Advertisement
But to qualify for CalWorks , a family of four cannot earn more than $ 1,218 a month or have more than $ 2,000 in cash or property , not including their home .
If they have a car worth more than $ 4,650 , the added value counts as property .
To qualify for food stamps , an application that takes into account monthly living expenses such as rent and utilities , the same family cannot earn more than $ 2,297 .
Although the county has earmarked more than $ 195 million in stimulus money for CalWorks , and $ 12.5 million for homeless services , that is not likely to reach middle - class families , Santana said .
He estimated that it will cost hundreds of millions more to expand such help .
“ The funding we ’re getting from the stimulus is barely going to cover the increase in demand , ” he said .
“ Now we have to find money for those who are on the cusp of becoming eligible . ”
The new demand and changing clientele are apparent in busy Social Services offices countywide .
Food stamp applications at the Chatsworth office increased 20 % this February over last , with CalWorks applications up 23 % for the same period .
Browning said he visited the office a few weeks ago on a Friday afternoon , expecting it to be nearly empty .
Instead , he entered a waiting room crowded with people dressed professionally , briefcases in tow .

“ All the seats were full , and you could really tell the difference in the people , people who had not been to a public welfare office before , ” Browning said .
“ Some of the intake staff will tell you they are seeing many more people like themselves and are saying , ‘ There but by the grace of God go I . ’ ”
Caseworkers at the Panorama City office say they have seen applications double during the last six months , with up to 800 on a busy day .
The office , which covers the eastern San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita , has seen food stamp applications increase 45 % this February over last , with CalWorks applications up 38 % .
“ We have people who have been in the banking and mortgage industry , mothers with two kids , married couples where the husband got laid off and the wife had her hours cut back , ” Browning said .
“ They never had to apply for assistance before .
It ’s a difficult thing . ”
Most middle - class applicants are not interested in Medi-Cal , Social Services staff said -- they need food stamps and cash to pay the mortgage .
“ They come in because they ’re at their wits ’ end .
They ’re already beginning to lose things , and they want to make sure they can feed their children .
This is really a last stop for them , ” said Carlos Perez - Carrillo , an eligibility supervisor in the Panaroma City office .
“ These are career people .
You can tell by the way they dress .
They have been working all their lives , and they ’re coming in here broadsided , just really confused . ”
Advertisement
Perez - Carrillo said caseworkers also are seeing more couples with children , workers from real estate brokerages and Circuit City trying to pay mortgages and avoid foreclosure in places like Sherman Oaks .
Most of the middle - class families Perez - Carrillo has seen turned away are receiving more than $ 500 a week in unemployment benefits .
When they get denied , they get upset .
“ ‘ I ’ve paid my dues . ’
That ’s what they say , ‘ and you do n’t want to help me , ’ ” Perez - Carillo said .
“ I ’ve been doing this for about 18 years , and this is the most difficult I ’ve seen it . ”
If someone is denied benefits , caseworkers refer them to food pantries , homeless shelters and private charities and advise them to return in a month if their situation worsens .
Often , they return and qualify , Perez - Carrillo said .
At her two - bedroom apartment in Oak Park , Sabey -- who until last month was a minivan - driving suburban mother with a good job -- said she ’s not sure what she should do next .
Advertisement
She has registered with five temp agencies , is studying for a bachelor ’s degree in psychology and has applied for everything from call center operator to restaurant hostess .
No one ’s hiring for jobs that pay more than $ 25,000 -- too little to support her family .
She refuses to ask her elderly father , who has stomach cancer , for help .
She said she is still seeking support from her estranged husband in court .
It was hard -- and humiliating -- for her to go to the government for help .
She said she felt like a criminal as a Social Service worker took her fingerprints .
As she waited for her name to be shouted like everyone else ’s , she wished they would just use those little buzzers like the restaurants she used to frequent .
She can not imagine standing in line at a food pantry .
“ You start to question yourself and how you got here .
I ’m in this age group where I should be at the peak of my career , looking forward to retirement , ” she said .
Advertisement
Why , she said , ca n’t Social Services be more flexible with people like her who almost qualify ?
She has cut back on everything she can -- got her grocery bill down to $ 65 a week , her utilities down to about $ 40 by dimming the lights and taking fewer baths .
Although she qualifies for federal assistance for her heat and gas , it will not start until April and wo n’t pay if she gets cut off before then .
Sabey , who had a sheltered childhood and never before experienced financial distress , was surprised that the referral list she got from Social Services included a homeless shelter for single mothers .
She had no idea such places existed .
“ Why are we allowing single mothers to get to that point ? ” she said .
“ Why are n’t we doing something ? ”

Every once in a while I ’m contacted by a fellow “ LifeRebooter ” who wants to share their story .
Glen Allsopp , a young guy who left his life in Europe to experience a new life in South Africa , recently contacted me wanting to share his thoughts on his radical life change .
Due to Glen ’s decision to reinvent his own life , he ’s become an expert at making a new environment feel like home .
Coincidentally , his article came to me at an interesting time : I ’m moving into a new apartment in a slightly more rural area tomorrow .
Glen ’s article starts below :
I always admire people who are able to see that they need to make a change in their lives and actually go out there and make it happen .
It might be by reading personal development blogs , switching up their career , setting goals or any number of different things .
On your path , there may come a time when a new location is in order .
For me , that was the case when I was offered a job in Cape Town , South Africa .
At 18 years old , and living in the UK , I accepted the offer to move across the world to a country where I did n’t know one single person .
At the time , that was the right decision and a change I really felt I needed in my life .
There will be some of you that find this post very relevant to your current situation , to others it may not apply , but that does n’t mean it wo n’t in the future .
Today I want to share some tips on making your new environment feel like home , just like I did in South Africa where I ’ve just finished having the best 16 months of my life .
1 ) Make Friends as Soon as Possible
When I first moved to South Africa this was a project on the top of my list .
Moving to a new location can be difficult , but being there and feeling confined to your home can make things even more so .
I ’ve written a guide on how to make friends but the basics always apply :
Just ‘ get out there ’ and be social
Invite colleagues or contacts to your home for lunch
Look for clubs where you can enjoy your hobbies with others
Join clubs such as book clubs or discussion groups
Having friends in a new environment can be the difference between loving where you are and wishing you were back to what you are used to .
To me , this is the most important of any of the points you are going to read here .
2) Take Time to Work Out Where Everything Is
The last thing you want to do is run out of food and realize you have no idea where the supermarket is .
Take time to learn your address ( including area codes ) , where the closest shops are and even where the hospitals are in case of emergencies .
On that note , if you have moved country , make sure you get the phone number for the emergency services ; it ’s likely they will also be different depending on whether you use a landline or a cell phone .
Additionally , see if you can find some nice ‘ spots ’ you enjoy .
In Cape Town , I would often take girls to a place called Signal Hill , which is right next to Table Mountain .
At night it rivals the most beautiful places in the world as you can see the whole city and there are some nice seating areas .
Having little hideaways like this can be invaluable to enjoying your new environment .
3 ) Try to Stick to a Familiar Routine
Moving to a new environment is going to be enough of a shock to your system without needing to adjust to a new lifestyle routine as well .
Of course , the reason you moved might not allow you to act in accordance with your familiar arrangements ; if it does , then keep as close to them as possible .
This applies to things such as :
The time you wake up
The job you have
The activities that you get up to on weekends
The times you make food and eat
If you know that you are going to have a new time schedule in your new location , try and adjust before you make the move , that way things will be much easier once you do make the switch .
4 ) Bring As Many Comforts As You Can
You probably do n’t like to admit it , but there are probably a few quirky things here and there you really enjoy that you can bring with you on your travels .
This may be something as simple as your favorite cushions or throw over , but it might also range to a particular piece of furniture you like from your antique mirror to your ‘ lazy - boy ’ chair .
The more comforts you have , the more familiar your environment is going to be to you and the less change your mind is going to have to deal with .
That is the key point when moving to a new location from one where you felt particularly homely , bringing as many comforts as you can to keep things familiar .
5 ) Where Possible , Invite Your Old Friends for a Welcome Party
Moving from England to South Africa , I could n’t exactly fly all my friends over for a house warming and say goodbye to them at the end of the night as they all leave for the airport .
However , your relocation may not be quite as drastic .
Where possible , see if you can get your friends , old and new , to come celebrate your move .
This works well because in your mind you identify your social life ( a very strong factor for feeling at home ) with your new environment and that makes things stick in your mind and feel more ‘ normal ’ .
Of course , if you ca n’t do this then it simply is n’t an option , but where possible , make the most of it .
If you keep all of these points in mind , it could seriously mean the difference between enjoying your new surroundings and wishing you had n’t made such a big ‘ mistake ’ .
I ’m about to make a move again and go live in the Netherlands where I do n’t know anybody .
Based on my experience in South Africa and my points above , I ’m sure I wo n’t have any problems .
I would love to hear about the relocation adventures of you all in the comments below …

My visit to the cult London cheese shop , selling no less than 57 types of British cheeses .
My visit to the cult London cheese shop , selling no less than 57 types of British cheeses .
I am at Neal 's Yard , a cult shop for British cheese lovers .
There are bigger cheese shops in London , selling fine crusts from the world over .
But I do n't come to London to buy Gruyère or Gorgonzola .
I want British cheese .
That 's what 's unique .
That 's what 's special to the place .
Let 's eat the products of the realm .
And Neal 's Yard offers the best selection of British cheeses in the world - 57 in all and only 3 imports - not a bad selection !
And there is no question that they get the finest heads in the realm for all the cheese types they carry .
The cheesemakers at Montgomery 's had told me about neelzhard who bought half their production .
This really is the place for the discerning cheese lover and there is something to keep make happy - even vegetarian rennet .
I usually charge my weight in cheese for an official FXcuisine endorsement , but in this case I might half my fee .
Tell Neal I 'm here !
does n't bring the lord of the manor in this shop .
« Neal 's Yard » , you see , is not where « Neal » has a cheese yard sale , but the name of a back alley in Covent Garden , London .
In a sort of large courtyard they have all sorts of organic shops and the former house of British director Monty Python .
The big cheese at Neal 's Yard Dairy is Randolph Hodgson , who 's been running the business for 25 years and now exports fine British cheeses all over the world .
But this is a girl 's cheese !
Give me something for a grown up man , I exploded .
Tom , the jovial cheesemonger , bursts into laughs , then leans back to tell my joke to his colleagues .
Yes , I want cheese with taste , and after having sampled the extraordinary Colston Bassett Stilton at Neal 's Yard Dairy in London , most other cheeses tasted rather bland - in comparison .
We settle on a fine Stichelton .
A touch by the Penicillium fairy will turn any cheese into a gourmet delight .
On the back wall , a pile of James Montgomery 's great Cheddar awaits the punter at 23 £ a kilo .
I paid a little less when we visited his farm last summer , and boy was it worth it !
This time I go for Keen 's Cheddar , not so different from Montgomery 's and made in a farm just 15 miles for his .
I review the various goat , sheep and ewes ' milk cheeses on display before settling on 4 blue cheeses and a piece of Cheddar ...
... then I pay , £ 38 for 5 pieces of cheeses , a kilo and a half of pure slow food delight .
What did I buy ?
How did it taste like ?
See and learn all - next page .
...
I can't look anymore , it 's just too much .
" Many Turbos ..DIED ... to bring us this amusement ... "
/ steps away from computer with dramatic , petrified stare
The person who has made this point most forcefully is Eliot Spitzer , of all people .
In his column for Slate.com , he wrote : “ Why did Goldman have to get back 100 cents on the dollar ?
Did n’t we already give Goldman a $ 25 billion cash infusion , and are n’t they sitting on more than $ 100 billion in cash ? ”
Mr. Spitzer told me that while “ there is a legitimate sense of outrage over the bonuses , the larger outrage should be the use of A.I.G. funding as a second bailout for the large investment houses . ”
Precisely .
IT IS DESTABILIZING
How can you run a company when the rules keep changing , when you have to worry about being second - guessed by Congress ?
Who can do business under those circumstances ?
Take , for instance , that new securitization program the government is trying to get off the ground , called the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility — or TALF .
Although it is backed by large government loans , it requires people in the marketplace — Wall Street bankers ! — to participate .
This program could help revive the consumer credit market .
But at this point , most Wall Street bankers would rather be attacked by wild dogs than take part .
They fear that they ’ll do something — make money perhaps ? — that will arouse Congressional ire .
Or that the rules will change .
“ The constant flip - flopping is terrible , ” said Simon Johnson , a banking expert who teaches at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Business .
A.I.G. offers another good example .
Not all the employees who face the possibility of having their bonuses taxed out from under them work for the evil financial products division .
Many of them work in insurance divisions .
Very few of them pull down million - dollar bonuses , and none of them brought A.I.G. to its knees .
( And employees who bought the company ’s stock are already hurting financially , having seen its value virtually wiped out . )
They are the ones the company badly needs to keep if it hopes to sell those units at a healthy price .
Taking away their bonuses — after they ’ve already put the money in their bank accounts — hardly seems like the right way to motivate them .
And demonizing them in Congressional hearings does n’t help either .
In previous columns , I have been an advocate of nationalizing big banks like Citigroup .
But after watching Congress this week , I ’m having second thoughts .
If this is how Congress treats A.I.G. , what would it do if it had a bank in its paws ?
What the country really needs right now from Congress is facts instead of rhetoric .
Instead of these “ raise your hand if you took a private jet to get here ” exercises of outraged populism , we need hearings that educate and illuminate .
Hearings like the old Watergate hearings .
Hearings in which knowledge is accumulated over time , and a record is established .
Hearings that might actually help us get out of this crisis .
It ’s happened before .
In 1932 , Congress established the Pecora committee , named for its chief counsel , Ferdinand Pecora .
It was an intense , two - year inquiry , and its findings — executives shorting their own company ’s stock , for instance — shocked the country .
It also led to the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other investor protections .
One person who has been calling for a new Pecora committee is Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama , a Republican and key member of the Senate Banking Committee .
The 10 - year - old who took the marijuana to Morton is likely to be assigned to an alternative classroom " where he will have a more structured environment and counseling about substance abuse , " Gallard said .
How is it that a penny slot machine designed to pay out no more than $ 9,025 displayed a jackpot message of $ 42.9 million ?
Paul Kusznirewicz , perhaps the world 's most unlucky lottery " winner , " thought he had struck it big at the Georgian Downs casino in Innisfil this past December , when the 2 - cent slot machine he had been playing for 20 minutes exploded in lights and music .
A message : " Call attendant .
You have won a jackpot of $ 42.9 million " popped up on the screen , the 55 - year - old says .
But when casino personnel arrived to investigate , they told the Wasaga Beach resident that the slot machine had messed up and he was n't entitled to any winnings .
All Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. machines display a notice that malfunctions void all pays and plays .
" This machine clearly malfunctioned .
The most it can possibly pay out is $ 9,025 , " said OLG spokesperson Allison Sparkes .
So where did the $ 42.9 million come from ?
Ryerson computer science professor Sophie Quigley thinks she has the answer .
" This looks like a casting error , " she said .
" It 's a programming error ( that occurs when ) a computer tries to interpret information one way , but it interprets it the wrong way . "
In a confusing nutshell : Computers speak in a language of bits .
Information is represented with zeros and ones .
Very often , these numbers – both positive and negative – are stored in 32 - bit sequences .
Still with me ?
In this system , the number — 1 can also be represented as 4294967295 .
Count that many pennies as dollars and you see 42,949,672.95 .
" Which seems awfully close to the number that was displayed on the slot machine , " Quigley said .
The complicated mathematical explanation is as follows :
When you fill 32 bits with 1s , this creates a binary number that represents + 2 to the power of 32 , minus 1 , as 4294967295 .
It 's a glitch that those working in computer programming run into now and again .
" It sounds as though it was meant to be a negative number , — 1 , but the program interpreted it to be a huge positive number , " Quigley said .
" The question now is : ` What 's going on inside the slot machine ? '
Why are there negative numbers in slot machine programming ? "
Quigley has a theory for that , too .
With each play , the slot machine was counting down to zero – the jackpot .
For whatever reason , an error occurred , and the countdown went below zero , the point when it was supposed to announce a big prize .

Latest results and the low average of goals scored by Brazil made many of us thinking at Ronaldo ‘s returning to the Brazil squad .
Brazil are currently fourth in the World Cup Qualifications ( Conmebol ) standings after Paraguay , Argentina and Chile and more then that they have scored only 16 goals in 11 games .
Ronaldo is in great shape , scoring four times in five games for Corinthians , just after returning from a long term injury .
Even if he is not 100 % fit Ronaldo could bring that extra motivation to the players and why not he could be the key to success .
Dunga could take Capello ’s example and do the same with Ronaldo as the Italian with Beckham .
Even if he does not play or he comes from the bench Beckham ’s presence means a lot for the youngsters .
It seems that everybody wants Ronaldo back , the fans all over the World and even legendary players like Romario , but this is Dunga ’s decision .
The Brazilian coach is thinking at the future of the “ Selecao ” knowing that old players are not a solution for the World Cup .
Also when you have players like Kaka , Ronaldinho , Pato , Baptista , Adriano , Robinho and Fabiano upfront you should be able to make a team capable of wining trophies .

Britain has offered its full backing for a renewed military offensive inside Pakistan , as UK ministers confirmed the country was now " part of a single campaign " alongside Afghanistan .
Defence secretary John Hutton said the UK supported targeting Pakistan - based Taliban and al - Qaida positions and urged Europe to begin offering assistance to eradicate insurgents in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan .
Confirming that Britain was being drawn into a widening regional conflict , Hutton said the time had come to target Taliban and al - Qaida havens inside Pakistan .
In his most explicit statement of intent against Afghanistan 's troubled neighbour , Hutton said that the military objectives in the region must now have " an equal focus on both countries " .
He added : " AQ [ al - Qaida ] is in retreat , scuttling across the border into Pakistan .
Trying to buy time .
Desperate to regroup .
That is why there must be no let - up ... there can be no escape , no hiding place . "
He indicated that Britain , which has deep historical ties with Pakistan and remains its largest trading partner in Europe , must play a principal role in supporting the American military effort in the region .
The defence secretary said : " In Europe , we can no longer offload the tough questions about how we deal effectively with AQ and the Taliban in Pakistan to the US .
" The political burden of dealing with the Pakistan side of the border must be shared .
And there are many European countries with strong ties to Pakistan that can more effectively share that burden with America . "
However , the US tactic of targeting senior al - Qaida figures using drones inside Pakistan has drawn international condemnation and undermined public support in Pakistan .
The country 's Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit warned recently that Islamabad regarded " drone attacks on our territory as a violation of Pakistan 's sovereignty and definitely counter - productive " .
An MoD spokesman said that Britain was ready to offer military , political and diplomatic support to a renewed offensive in Pakistan 's tribal lands , but what precisely that entailed was dependent on the resources other Nato members were prepared to offer .
However , the initial aim would be to support the Pakistani government , rather than place British forces on the ground inside the country .
US officials yesterday indicated that attacks along Pakistan 's western frontier , apparently by unmanned CIA aircraft , would continue , amid speculation that coalition ground units may begin crossing into Pakistan 's borderlands at some point .
A Pentagon spokesman , lieutenant - colonel Mark Wright , told the Observer that the US had already offered to launch " joint - military operations " with Pakistan 's Frontier Corps in the tribal areas .
The most recent evidence that Pakistan was becoming an increased focus of concern surfaced last week when Gordon Brown pinpointed al - Qaida in Pakistan as the greatest threat facing the UK in his national security strategy .
Two thirds of terror plots uncovered by British intelligence agencies have a Pakistani connection .
Additional military resources are also likely to be deployed to the region once Britain withdraws its 4,000 - strong force from Iraq this July , with moves to increase troop numbers in Afghanistan from 8,300 to potentially above 10,000 within a year .
The new - found focus on Pakistan will dominate Nato 's 60th anniversary summit in Strasbourg this week , in which Britain and the US will attempt to drum up more support for the twin Afghanistan and Pakistan - AfPak - mission .
President Obama has promised an extra 21,000 troops for Afghanistan on top of the 38,000 US troops already there .
By contrast , Nato has sent 32,000 , with Germany so far sending just 3,640 , France 2,780 and Spain 780 .
These three countries will , say Nato sources , be under pressure to increase their contingent .
Defence officials in Whitehall are increasingly exasperated that , even as the conflict broadens , prominent Nato members are not pulling their weight .
Hutton condemned " the massive leadership imbalance " between Europe and the US in Nato .
He added : " It 's an imbalance set to grow in the coming months as America commits vastly more resources of every kind to the mission in Afghanistan . "
Olive stones can be turned into bioethanol , a renewable fuel that can be produced from plant matter and used as an alternative to petrol or diesel .
This gives the olive processing industry an opportunity to make valuable use of 4 million tonnes of waste in olive stones it generates every year and sets a precedent for the recycling of waste products as fuels .
Researchers from the Universities of Jaén and Granada in Spain show how this can be achieved in a study published in the latest edition of the Society of Chemical Industry 's ( SCI ) Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology .
" The low cost of transporting and transforming olives stones make them attractive for biofuels , " says researcher Sebastián Sánchez .
Bioethanol is increasingly used in cars , but its production from food crops such as corn is controversial because it uses valuable land resources and threatens food security .
In addition , it makes use of only a small part of the whole crop .
By contrast , extracting energy from olive stones uses food industry by - products .
The olive stone , produced in processing of olive oil and table olives , makes up around a quarter of the total fruit .
It is rich in polysaccharides ( cellulose and hemicellulose ) that can be broken down into sugar and then fermented to produce ethanol .
" This research raises the possibility of using of olive stones , which would otherwise be wasted , in producing energy .
In this way we can make use of the whole food crop , " says Sánchez .
The team pre-treated olive stones using high - pressure hot water ( essentially a pressure cooker ) then added enzymes which degrade plant matter and generate sugars .
The hydrolysate obtained from this process was then fermented with yeasts to produce ethanol .
Yields of 5.7kg of ethanol per 100 kg of olive stones have been reached ,
The quantities of stones produced are relatively small in comparison with other agricultural and forestry wastes .
However , if similar principles were employed across all agricultural industries , energy gains would be significant .

About 160 people , including Dan Rather , Georgett Mosbacher , and the Daily Beast 's Tina Brown , packed the 21 Club for the breakfast meeting moderated by Joanne Lipman , Condé Nast Portfolio editor in chief .
Wiesel was joined on the panel by former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt and well - known short seller Jim Chanos , both of whom had suggestions on how to prevent future fraud — and both of whom believe major financial institutions may be next to face criminal charges for misleading investors .
Pitt also decried understaffing and " a lack of real sophistication " at the SEC .
Wiesel said he met Madoff only twice , introduced through a friend who had known Madoff for 50 years and also invested with him .
Wittingly or not , the intermediary played up Madoff 's aura of exclusivity by telling Wiesel , " It 's true , you are not rich enough . "
But he agreed to make an introduction .
Wiesel ultimately shared two dinners with Madoff and was impressed .
Madoff " presented himself as a philanthropist , " Wiesel said .
The men spoke , ironically , mostly about ethics and education .
Madoff gave the impression that he was making an exception by allowing Wiesel to invest with him .
" It was a myth that he created around him ... the myth of exclusivity , " Wiesel said .
" He gave the impression that maybe a hundred people belonged to his club .
Now we know thousands of them were cheated by him . "
Wiesel first gave Madoff personal funds to invest , he said .
" And because we thought we did so well , we said , come on , we have so many projects ....
Everybody we know in the field of finances , they told us , come on , you can do much more , more projects because of Mr. Madoff the savior . "
Asked if he could forgive Madoff , Wiesel paused for a very long moment .
" Could I ever forgive him ? " he asked , almost to himself .
Finally , he said firmly " No , " to a burst of applause .
Wiesel did , however , come up with an imaginative punishment : " I would like him to be in a solitary cell with a screen , and on that screen ... every day and every night there should be pictures of his victims , one after the other after the other , always saying , ' Look , look what you have done . ' ...
He should not be able to avoid those faces , for years to come . "
He added , " This is only a minimum punishment . "
Also during the panel discussion :
Wiesel rejected the idea that Madoff preyed on Jews , and that the scheme was some sort of affinity fraud .
" It 's not the Jewishness in him , it 's the inhumanity in this man ....
The man is , was not only a liar , a swindler , but he was — not a crook — he was somehow always more than that .
More .
Once you enter evil , it 's not static , it 's dynamic .
Charities that were scammed by Madoff should be bailed out by the government , Wiesel believes .
' Just as we bail out banks and car agencies , bail out charitable institutions ... I think it would be a great gesture that the Obama administration should show that we really think of those who are helpless . "
Wiesel sees parallels between Madoff and his Holocaust experience .
Although he emphasized that " Madoff is not the greatest story of our lifetime , " he added that in recent years , " Madoff is one of the greatest scoundrels , thieves , liars , criminals .
How did it happen ?
I have seen in my lifetime the problem is when the imagination of the criminal precedes that of the innocent .
And Madoff had imagination ... We have no idea that a person is capable of that , but then I should have learned , of course , that a human being is capable of anything . "
Donations to the Wiesel foundation have come in unsolicited : " Literally hundreds of people that we have never known sent us money though the internet ....
Just as in 9/11 , you remember 9/11 of course was the greatest tragedy , but it also brought out the best in the American people . "
Pitt , the former SEC chairman , estimates that despite Madoff 's claim that he lost $ 50 billion , the actual number is probably between $ 10 billion and $ 17.5 billion .
The larger number " was supposed to indicate how much money had passed through his portfolio ....
However big it is , it 's larger than it should be , and it's an incredible amount of money . "
To prevent future frauds Pitt advocates a new audit system , overseen by the SEC .
" What is needed is a system in which everyone who takes money from the public should be inspected every year , or , for smaller firms perhaps every other year , by a completely independent , wholly outside expert entity . "
The audit would determine whether there were " actual assets " behind financial statements .
The Bernie Madoff Story and interview with the Madoff Whistleblower , Harry Markopolos is pretty remarkable .
And the drug cartel war against the Mexican government can easily spill over the U.S. borders , it is that bad .

Mexico : The War Next Door
With fresh water resources becoming scarcer worldwide due to population growth and climate change , a growing movement is working to make access to clean water a basic universal human right .
But it 's a contentious issue , experts say .
Especially difficult is how to safely mesh public - sector interests with public ownership of resources – and determine the legal and economic ramifications of enshrining the right to water by law .
" It 's an issue that is snowballing , " says Tobias Schmitz , a water - resources expert with Both Ends , a Dutch environmental and development organization .
Some 30 countries have a constitutional or legal provision ensuring individuals ' access to water , up from a handful a few years ago , he says .
" Everybody is grappling with the issue , knowing that we need to secure this right .
But the question now is over the practical application of this right , " Dr. Schmitz says .
Government officials and leaders of numerous nongovernmental organizations and companies working on the water issue are meeting this week in Istanbul as part of the World Water Forum , which takes place every three years in a bid to shape global water policy .
One of the thorniest issues governmental officials at the forum have struggled with has been this question of the right to water .
A declaration to be signed by the ministers of some 120 countries attending the forum is expected to refer to access to water as a " basic need , " rather than a right .
The United States – along with Canada , China , and several other nations – has so far refused to recognize the human right to water .
There are concerns among some countries – based on a misconception , experts say – that enshrining a universal right to water would force them to share their water resources with other nations .
China , for instance , is struggling just to provide its rising population with enough water .
Rapid industrial growth and urbanization have taken a toll on the country 's water supply , with underground sources quickly drying up .
Water usage in the country has quintupled over the past 50 years , forcing China to turn to massive and environmentally unfriendly engineering projects – such as diverting water from rivers – in order to meet demand .
An estimated 1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water and United Nations officials warn that the situation could get worse if current patterns of water use continue .
" Unless we change our water consumption behaviors , we will face a major crisis in fresh water , " Koichiro Matsura , director - general of the UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , said at the forum , following the launch of a new UN report on the global water situation .
Experts in water issues say that providing citizens of a country with a legal right to what is deemed to be a minimally adequate amount of safe water would be an important way of mitigating the effect of any looming water crises .
" This is not a semantic issue .
If we can determine that water is a right , it gives citizens a tool they can use against their governments , " says Maude Barlow , a senior adviser on water issues to the president of the UN General Assembly .
" If you believe it is a human right , then you believe that you can't refuse to give it to someone because they can't afford it , " she says .
In South Africa , for example , the 1996 Constitution guarantees access to " sufficient clean water " as a basic right , which has allowed individuals to take legal action when their water has been cut off .
A landmark 2006 ruling determined that inability to pay is not a good enough reason to cut someone 's water off .
The South African courts have also determined that every household must be provided with a minimum of 6,000 liters ( 1,585 gallons ) of water per month , even if they can't afford it .
" You have pressures on both sides , between those who are pro-poor and those who are pro-development , but that has forced us to be innovative , " says Rosalie Auriel Manning , a former board member of two large public water providers in Durban and Johannesburg .
" It 's a balancing act ; you have to be clever . "
Even the private sector , whose involvement in supplying water in certain parts of the world has proved to be both controversial and poorly received , is now embracing the concept of a human right to water .
" There is absolutely no conflict between the right to water and the private sector .
Our industry supports the right to water , " says Gerard Payen , president of AquaFed , an international federation of some 200 private water operators operating in over 30 countries .
" But we are practitioners , and as practitioners , we know that proclaiming the right to water is not enough , " he adds .
" Our job is to deliver water to people . "
Delivering that water is certainly big business .
Worldwide annual water - related investments are estimated at $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion .
Critics of the private sector say they are not opposed to its involvement in delivering water , as long as control of resources remains in public hands .
In some countries , like India , rights to water resources have been sold outright to private companies , which use them for their own needs or sell the water to individual users .
" There 's a huge role for the private sector to help us secure our water future , but it has to be within this notion that water is a public trust , " says Ms. Barlow , of the UN .
" It 's not the market that should decide who has access to water .
It should be a public trust and a public right . "

NEW YORK , Feb 12 ( Reuters ) - Charter Communications Inc CHTR.O said on Thursday it will restructure its debt under bankruptcy protection , wiping out shareholders , after it reached a deal with senior creditors .
The cable operator , controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , said in a statement it would file for Chapter 11 on or before April 1 after it reached an agreement to reduce its debt by around $ 8 billion .
It had debt of around $ 21 billion as of Sept. 30 .
Various debt holders and bondholders will receive a mix of new notes , equity and cash , depending on their seniority .
Shareholders will not receive anything for common stock , which will be canceled .
Under the agreement around $ 10 billion of bank debt will remain on Charter ’s balance sheet untouched , while the $ 11 billion held by bondholders will be reduced to $ 3 billion , people familiar with the agreement said .
The bondholders will have most of their notes converted to new notes and common stock or warrants to buy common stock .
Some publicly traded Charter bonds soared after the news as investors bet the bonds might recover most of their value .
For details see here [ ID :nN12486440 ] .
Chief Executive Neil Smit said in a statement the agreement covered “ a significant portion ” of bondholders .
Paul Allen will continue as an investor and retain the largest voting interest in Charter of around 35 percent , another person close to the deal said .
Allen ’s various non-equity holdings in Charter , including debt and preferred were converted to equity under the new capital structure , these people said .
Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the prearranged plan helped avoid a " long and messy " bankruptcy proceeding that might have benefited competitors such as satellite TV operators DISH Network Corp DISH.O and DirecTV Group Inc DTV.O , or telephone companies such as AT&T Inc T.N and Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N , which also offer competing video services .
“ Charter ’s complex capital structure and the multitude of creditor groups could still derail the process , but it is possible that Charter could be restructured in as little as 3 - 6 months , ” Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne said in a client note .
Charter ’s new lower debt load of $ 13.5 billion will be around 5.5 times its 2009 average expected earnings , according to Reuters Estimates .
The largest cable operator Comcast Corp CMCSA.O has debt of around 2.3 times 2009 earnings and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N is around 3.3 times consensus earnings .
Charter ’s equity value has plunged in recent years to as low as $ 30 million this week from around $ 5 billion in 2001 .
After the restructuring announcement , Charter shares dropped even further , to around 3.5 cents , valuing the equity at some $ 15 million .
CASH ON HAND
The company , which has more than 5.5 million subscribers , said it would make an overdue interest payment of $ 74 million before a final deadline of Feb. 15 .
Charter said that , as of Feb. 11 , it had more than $ 800 million in cash on its balance sheet .
The company said it believed its liquidity , combined with its cash from operating activities , would be sufficient to meet projected cash needs .
The company expects fourth quarter earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization to grow 9.7 percent to $ 620 million .
It said revenue is expected to grow 7 percent to $ 1.656 billion and it expects to record an impairment charge of $ 1.5 billion .
Capital expenditures would be about $ 264 million .
Charter also expects to lose around 75,100 basic video subscribers , but add around 22,300 net digital video subscribers during the fourth quarter .
The company will add 22,900 high - speed Internet customers and 75,200 phone subscribers for the period .

Public buildings have closed across Mexico City because of the outbreak World health experts are investigating a new strain of flu that may have killed as many as 60 people in Mexico .
The US Centre for Disease Control ( CDC ) said tests so far seem to link Mexico 's outbreak with a swine flu virus that had sickened eight in the southern US .
The CDC said it was taking the virus - about which it was working to learn as much as possible - seriously .
Mexican authorities have closed public buildings , suspended public events and launched a vaccination campaign .
It is suspected the virus may have been involved in the deaths of about 60 people , mostly in and around Mexico City , since mid-March .
A new swine flu strain has been confirmed in 16 of the deaths and 44 others are being tested , Mexico 's health secretary said .
More than 900 other people are thought to have been infected .
Officials said most of those killed so far were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly .
Schools , museums and libraries have been closed across the capital region and people are being urged to avoid shaking hands or sharing crockery .
All public events have been suspended , an official said .
In Geneva , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said an emergency committee would likely convene over the weekend .
And in the US , the White House said it was watching the situation .
' Learn more ' Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the CDC , said that preliminary tests on seven out of 14 samples from patients in Mexico had matched the virus found in the US .
Eight people have fallen sick - six in California and two in Texas - with a virus that experts say is a new strain of swine flu .
All eight have recovered and only one was hospitalised .
SWINE FLU
Swine flu is a respiratory disease found in pigs Human cases usually occur in those who have contact with pigs Human - to - human transmission is rare and such cases are closely monitored
Q&A : Swine flu Dr Besser said more information was needed to determine the extent of the threat posed by the virus .
It was unclear , he said , why it was proving fatal in Mexico but not in the US .
" We are not at the point - WHO is not at the point - of declaring a pandemic ; we are at the point of trying to learn more about this virus , understand its transmission , and how to control it , " he said .
" In Mexico , other influenza viruses are circulating there , so sorting out which cases are caused by swine flu , which are other viruses and which are co-infections will be very important public health information . "
The WHO said it had prepared " rapid containment measures " in case they were needed .
But both it and the CDC said that there was no need at this point to issue travel advisories for parts of Mexico or the US .
The CDC said it planned to send experts to Mexico to help investigate the virus .
Swine flu is a respiratory disease which infects pigs .
It does not normally infect humans , although sporadic cases do occur usually in people who have had close contact with pigs .
There have also been rare documented cases of humans passing the infection to other humans .
Such cases are monitored very closely because of fears that a new strain of swine flu with the ability to pass from person to person could spark a pandemic .

So then , how and why is this Philip José Farmer 's Official Web Page ?
Below is a brief history of the evolution of this web site ...
From the ' how open is your country ' files :
Red Hat today published a new study together with Georgia Tech mapping open source activity across 75 countries .
Officially called the Open Source Index ( OSI ) , the final score is made of a number of factors including policies , practices in the Government ,
Industry , and Community .
Topping the list current is France with a score of 1.35 .
Spain is second at 1.07 , Germany third at 1.05 .
The United States came in 9th overall according to the study , Canada came in 28th .
The idea of attempting to map open source use and activity is an interesting one , that may potentially yield benefit to academics .
The total score is made up of an activity number combined with an environment number .
By the study 's own admission the environment score is ' speculative ' .
" Environmental factors are more speculative , " Red Hat 's FAQ on the study states .
" Even a country that does not have a high degree of current penetration of open source may have a high number of internet users and information technology patents .
These factors may indicate a favorable environment for open source software to take hold .
Still , the correlation between a countries score on the activity and environment is quite high . "
What I personally would like to see , from a similar type of study in the future , is an actual census of open source usage and some kind of per capita ratio based on that figure .
So for example , would n't it be great to know that there are more Linux ( and / or open source ) users in a give country by volume , but that a different country has a higher density of users ?

Amazing Antarctica pictures
Antarctica is Earth ’s southernmost continent , overlying the South Pole .
It is situated in the Antarctica region of the southern hemisphere , almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle , and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean .
At 14.4 million km2 ( 5.4 million sq mi ) , it is the fifth - largest continent in area after Asia , Africa , North America , and South America .
About 98 % of Antarctica is covered by ice , which averages at least 1.6 kilometers ( 1.0 mi ) in thickness .
On average , Antarctica is the coldest , driest and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents .
Antarctica is considered a desert , with annual precipitation of only 200 mm ( 8 inches ) along the coast and far less inland .
There are no permanent human residents , but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside at the various research stations scattered across the continent throughout the year .
Only cold - adapted plants and animals survive there , including penguins , seals , mosses , lichen , and many types of algae .
The name Antarctica is the romanized version of the Greek compound word Î±Î½Ï „ Î±ÏÎºÏ „ Î¹ÎºÎ® ( antarktikÃ© ) , feminine of Î±Î½Ï „ Î±ÏÎºÏ „ Î¹ ÎºÏŒÏ ‚ ( antarktikos ) , meaning “ opposite to the north ” .
Although myths and speculation about a Terra Australis ( “ Southern Land ” ) date back to antiquity , the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the Russian expedition of Mikhail Lazarev and Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen .
The aurora australis , commonly known as the southern lights , is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma - full solar winds that pass by the Earth .
Another unique spectacle is diamond dust , a ground - level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals .
It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies , so people sometimes also refer to it as clear - sky precipitation .
A sun dog , a frequent atmospheric optical phenomenon , is a bright “ spot ” beside the true sun .

What 's a good way to release your entire back catalog of music to a large audience without having to deal with the bureaucratic red tape of the record labels and the iTunes Store ?
Release it yourself through the App Store , of course .
The album - as - an - iPhone - app method has been experimented with by some bands already , but the Presidents of the United States of America ( yes , the guys behind the " Peaches " song ) have gone all out , selling its entire discography through the App Store in hopes of engaging fans in ways they could n't through the iTunes Store alone .
The app , called " The Presidents ' Music - PUSA , " sells for $ 2.99 on the App Store ( iTunes link ) offers users access to four full albums , including the band 's early " lost " recordings .
This includes the previously - unavailable FroggyStyle — " unless you have one of the 500 cassettes the band sold in 1994 , you 've never heard this before , " reads the app description .
The app also features a number of extras and exclusives that the band says are updated regularly , and fans can read the band 's blog directly from the app on their iPhones or iPod touches .
The music , however , is not actually contained within the application itself ; instead , it is streamed to the app from a server , requiring the user to be connected to a network of some kind ( iPhone users on the cell or WiFi network , iPod touch users on WiFi ) in order to access the media .
This allows the band to constantly update the app's offerings , but it also makes it possible for them to pull content at any time .
For $ 3 , however , it could most certainly be worth re-living your teen years , and if you find yourself dying to keep the songs around for longer , there are buttons that allow you to buy the music for your permanent collection .
In a way , this method is almost the beginning of the iTunes subscription model , except controlled entirely by the bands ( and not technically subscription , since the fee is not recurring ) .
It allows users to try before they buy to their heart 's content — so long as the music stays on the server — and for very little money up front .
And if the music does eventually go away , they 're only out a few bucks and hopefully still entertained .
PUSA is n't the first band to go the App Store route .
Snow Patrol made headlines in September of 2008 after it released an " interactive album " for the iPhone and iPod touch that included images , lyrics , artwork , and even videos .
And PUSA singer - turned - entrepreneur Dave Dederer thinks this is all just the beginning .
" The possibilities around these open app stores , with Apple being the first and foremost , and hopefully RIM , Android , and others to follow in terms of size and impact — they 've radically changed the mobile application , because they 're open , " Dederer told Wired .
" You do n't have to negotiate , you do n't have to go through the process of approval with a big carrier . "
More importantly , Dederer sees the value of bringing distribution control back to the bands themselves .
" If all the rights to the masters and the publishing are contained — if the artist has control of them or the label has control of them , they can sell music in this entirely new format , " said Dederer , " The first one we 're doing is for my band , The Presidents ... you can sort of pump anything in there that you want , at random .
Maybe we 'll put my bandmate Chris Ballow 's answering machine message on there ... it becomes an open conduit to the fans to promote tours ... and include links to the band 's blog . "

text by Office dA Architects :
Located in the old Penny Savings Bank , Banq is a new restaurant located at the base of the old banking hall .
Divided into two segments , the front area on Washington Street is programmed as a bar , while the larger hall behind serves as the dining area .
The design of the space , however , is conceptualized around another division , on the z axis , between the ceiling and the ground .
If the ground needs to remain flexible as a result of fluctuating activities of the restaurant space -- two seaters , fours , and sixes , among a range of other organizations related to parties and other events -- then , the ceiling contains fixed programs that are part of the building 's infrastructure -- the structure , drainage , mechanical equipment , sprinkler system , lighting , and other the acoustic systems .
To that end , we have developed a striated wood - slatted system that conceals the view of the mechanical , plumbing , and lighting systems on the longitudinal axis , while offering a virtual canopy under which to dine .
The geometry of the wood slats conform to each equipment above , but are also radiused in order to smoothen the relationship between other adjoining equipment , creating a seamless landscape .
The columns and the wine storage , in the middle of the hall , serve to uphold the fiction , and appear to be suspended from the ceiling .
if the longitudinal axis emphasizes the seamless surface , then lateral views offer striated glimpses into the service space above , and demystify the illusion .
To underline this strategy , certain areas of the ceiling " drip " and " slump " , acknowledging the location of to place exit signs , lighting features , and other details .
Below the ceiling , the functional aspects of a dining space are fabricated with warm woods and relaminated bamboo amplifying the striping affect already at play throughout the space .
Striations of the ground , the furnishings , and the ceiling all conspire to create a total effect , embedding the diners into the grain of the restaurant .
Acknowledging the historical setting of the building , the ceiling hovers away from all interior walls and instead finds its support in suspension from above .
Nearly running the entire width of the space , each rib of the undulated ceiling is made from unique pieces of three - quarter - inch birch plywood adhered together in a scenario that likens to a puzzle ; only one possible location for each unit , formulating the continuous member .
These continuous members are fastened to the main structural ribs running perpendicular to the lattice , tracing both the overall ceiling topography and the steel supports of the base building .
Spacing between the visible ceiling ribs is variable ; compressing and releasing to maintain visual densities of the overall surface as seen from different angles .

exploded perspective by Office dA Architects
BATHROOM :
The bathrooms are designed around the fixtures and their equipment : toilets , sinks , toilet paper , among other features are all ovals .
Drawing from this coincidence , the spaces are covered by monumental oval shells , lit from behind , and are further embellishes with other oval features , bringing thematic closure to the space .
Oval mirrors , reflect the spaces with ocular precision , while to occuli connect the men's and women 's bathroom .
These occuli frame the view of opposing domes , but reveal nothing of each others interiors beyond ; instead , the occuli function as auricular links between the two spaces .

Martin Fowler は( 多分 ) やっていないこと
ThoughtWorks アンソロジー を読んでいた ら Ruby を使った DSL の話が載っており , 仕事でうっか り Ruby DSL を作ってしまった私は興味深く読んだ .
特段目新しい話じゃないものの , ( DSL と言えば聞こえはいいけれど要は設定ファイルですからね. ) オレオレ DSL を作る際には " Martin Fowler もやっている " と言えば 説得力もあるってもんだろう .
説得力はさておき , Martin Fowler は私の DSL が抱える問題に答えてくれなかった .
最近の私は Ruby DSL の文書化に困っている .
その DSL / 設定ファイル はもともと余興にちまちま作っていたもので , 思ったより出来がよくなったため実プロジェクトで使いはじめたところだった .
ちゃんと使ってみると案の定ぼろぼろと問題がでて , 後始末のために残業が続いている. まあドッグフードの自業自得は仕方ない.
( 隣の同僚はとばっちりも著しいがドンマイとする.)
文書化は山ほどみつかった問題の一つだ .
DSL 言語自体の文書化ではなく , DSL で書かれた設定内容の文書化を求められている .
DSL を持ち込んだ動機の一つは簡潔な表記と高可読性だから , もともと他形式での文書化は乗り気でない .
DSL なんて趣味的なものを表立って使う予定もなかった .
それを一見した出来の良さに気を良くして実プロジェクトに投入したところ , やんごとなき書式での文書化を求められて立ち往生している.
Ruby DSL 文書化問題の 例
Martin Fowler の記事にあるように , 問題の DSL もメソッド呼び出しとブロックを中心に記述されている. 仮に JCFL ( 神保町カレー愛好言語 ) を考えよう .
shop ( " ethiopia " ) do type ( :indian ) since ( 1988 ) address ( : city => " Tokyo " , : address= > " chiyoda - ku , kanda .... " ) menu( ) do curry ( : beef ) { price ( 880 ) . limit( 70 ) } curry ( : chicken ) { price ( 880 ) . limit( 70 ) } curry ( : vegetable ) { price ( 930 ) .limit( 70 ) .may_with ( : beef , : chicken ) } end end
多くのプログラミング言語と同じく , JCFL もコメントとして文書を埋め込んでいる .
shop ( " ethiopia " ) do # 便宜的なもので , 典型的なインド風とは異なる type ( :indian ) # 昭和 63 年 since ( 1988 ) # @param city 東京 # @param address 千代田区神田小川町 ... address ( : city => " Tokyo " , : address= > " chiyoda - ku , kanda .... " ) menu( ) do # @param limit 4 倍くらいがせいぜい # @param price まわりの店も似たようなもの. curry ( : beef ) { price ( 880 ) . limit( 70 ) } curry ( : chicken ) { price ( 880 ) . limit( 70 ) } # @param may_with 肉が欲しいら : vegetable ではなく : beef を頼むと良い .
curry ( : vegetable ) { price ( 930 ) .limit( 70 ) .may_with ( : beef , : chicken ) } end end
rdoc 風じゃなくて javadoc 風なあたりに ruby 愛の低さが露呈している .
ruby_parser
さて , このコメント部分と言語本体から , どうやってやんごとなきオフィス文書を生成しよう?
Ruby DSL は自分でパーサを持たないから , コメント部分を解釈できない .
Ruby のクラスやメソッド定義を注釈しているわけではないから rdoc も使えない .
仕方ないからコメントではなくヒアドキュメントを使うか , 正規表現と手動でがんばるか...
などと悩みながらぐぐっていたら , ruby_parser というライブラリがあった .
pure ruby の ruby パーサで , 構文木を作ってくれるらしい .
試してみよう .
#! ruby - rubygems require ' ruby_parser '
TEXT = << EOF # 縮めました. shop ( " ethiopia " ) do # 便宜的なもので , 典型的なインド風とは異なる type ( :indian ) # 昭和 63 年 menu( ) do # @param limit 4 倍くらいがせいぜい # @param price まわりの店も似たようなもの.
curry ( : beef ) { price ( 880 ) .limit( 70 ) } end end EOF p RubyParser.new.parse( TEXT )
実行するとこうなる :
omo :~/ work / jcfl$ ruby hello.rb s( :iter , s( : call , nil , : shop , s( :arglist , s( : str , " ethiopia " ) ) ) , nil , s( : block , s( : call , nil , : type , s( :arglist , s( :lit , :indian ) ) ) , s(:iter , s( : call , nil , : menu , s( :arglist ) ) , nil , s( :iter , s( : call , nil , : curry , s( :arglist , s( : lit , : beef ) ) ) , nil , s( : call , s( : call , nil , : price , s( :arglist , s( :lit , 880 ) ) ) , : limit , s( :arglist , s( :lit , 70 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
構文木がとれた ! ( 適当に整形してある . ) でもコメントは失われている...
... exp = RubyParser.new.parse( TEXT ) p exp.comments p exp [ 1 ] .
comments
実行しても ...:
omo:~/work / jcfl$ ruby hello.rb nil nil
class や def のコメントはとれる .
... TEXT2 = << EOF # =begin # JCFL object model # =end class Curry # =begin # チーズが恋しい # =end def bondi ( ) ; end end EOF exp = RubyParser.new.parse( TEXT2 ) p exp.comments
実行 :
omo:~/work/jcfl$ ruby hello.rb " #=begin
# JCFL object model
#=end
"
字句解析オブジェクトはコメントを保持しているようなので , パーサを適当にフックしてメソッド呼び出しのコメントを横取りできないか.
こんなかんじ :
class CallCommentedParser < RubyParser def new_call ( recv , meth , args = nil ) c = lexer .
comments c.empty ? ?
super : super << s(:comment , c ) end end p CallCommentedParser.new.parse( TEXT )
実行 :
omo@contentiss:~/work/jcfl$ ruby hello.rb s( :iter , s( : call , nil , : shop , s( :arglist , s( : str , " ethiopia " ) ) , s(:comment , " # \347\270 ....
" ) ) , nil , s( : block , s( : call , nil , : type , s( :arglist , s( :lit , :indian ) ) , s(:comment , " # \344\276\277\ ...
" ) , ... ) ) )
できた! エスケープが邪魔だけど..
e = CallCommentedParser.new.parse( TEXT ) print e [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 1 ]
nilomo@contentiss :~/work/jcfl$ ruby hello.rb # 縮めました .
メソッド呼び出しに紐づくコメントを取得できた.
AST -XML
一番面倒そうだった部分は ruby_parser がなんとかしてくれた .
けれど ruby_parser の出力は sexp.rb という Ruby 版 S 式になっている .
( 実際は配列の入れ子. ) これは扱いにくい .
Twitter で愚痴っていたら , scheme には SXPath があるから gauche を呼ぶといいんじゃないかと教わった .
あいにくの Scheme 力不足ににつきそれは難しいけれど , XPath を使うアイデアはよさそうだ . この S 式(? ) を XML に直そう .
class XMLTreeBuilder attr_reader : doc def initialize ( ) @doc = REXML ::Document.new ( " < tree /> " ) ; end def build ( exp ) traverse ( doc.root , exp ) doc end def traverse ( parent , exp ) with_element ( parent , exp [ 0 ] . to_s ) do |elem| exp [ 1..-1].each_with_index do |t , i| case t when Sexp traverse ( elem , t ) when Symbol , Fixnum elem.add_attribute ( " at " + i.to_s , t.to_s ) when String elem.add( REXML ::CData.new(t ) ) when nil elem.add_element ( " nil " ) else raise " Unexpected term : #{t} " end end end end def with_element ( parent , name , & block ) parent.add( REXML::Element.new(name ) ) block.call(parent.children.last ) end end exp = CallCommentedParser.new.parse( TEXT ) doc = XMLTreeBuilder.new.build(exp ) doc.write ( STDOUT , 1 )
やる気のないコードだけれど ruby_parser の AST 相手ならこんなもんでよかろう .
nilomo@contentiss:~/work/jcfl$ ruby hello.rb < tree > < iter > ... < nil /> < block > ... < iter > ... < iter > < call at1='curry '> < nil /> < arglist > < lit at0 = ' beef '/> </arglist > < comment > <![ CDATA [# @param limit 4 倍くらいがせいぜい # @param price まわりの店も似たようなもの . ] ]> </ comment > </ call > ... </iter > </iter > </ block > </iter > </ tree >
XML になった ! これで XPath が使える . めでたい .
やんごとなきまであとすこし
コメントつき構文木が XML になれば , それを DSL や文書の要件に応じて やんごと形式に変換するのは普段のスクリプティングの範疇に収まる.
続きはそのうち進めよう .
ただ構文木をトラバースしだすと , オブジェクトモデルさえ同じならミタメをあれこれ試せる
Ruby DSL の利点は いくらか失われてしまう .
AST - XML からのコンバータは木のレイアウトに依存せざるを得ないからだ.
だからコンバータを書くときはこの AST だけを頼らず実際のオブジェクトモデルも構築し , そのモデルにコメントをマージするようなスタイルが良い気がする.
それなら AST を使うのはコメントとモデルを関連づける部分に限られるから , なんとか保守していけるだろう .
そのほか ruby ( ruby_parser ) はツリーづくりで色々とトリッキーなことをしているらしく , DSL 側の書き方によってはパーサのコールバック順序が期待したもの ( ツリートラバースの順序 ) にならないことがある .
そのへんのやりくりは少し面倒だけれど , 場当たり的な対応も内部 DSL の面白さのうち , ということにしておこう ...
そんなわけで , Ruby DSL の文書化には ruby_parser が使えそうだよという話でした .

Pennsylvania is a big state , but it amazes me in this day , how some news does n’t make it over the mountain to the front page of our papers or the top of our news hours in Western Pennsylvania .
Some of you may not know that Vicki ’s dad makes Hershey ’s Kisses for a living , so this hits home for us .
Milton Hershey , this year , will be joining H.J. Heinz in rolling over in his grave .
Hershey Chocolate is moving to Mexico … whoopee !
They ’re even closing down Hershey Canada .
Do n’t buy any more Hercia Bars .
Reese ’s Peanut Butter Cups are my favorite and they are made by Hershey .
But , I will not purchase another one !
M.S. Hershey had a dream …
I will buy my OWN Sugar , Milk , Cocoa beans , ( all natural mind you ! ) and make candy … ( no tariffs etc.. ) EVEN during the depression … HE and the Company made money !….
NOW some Corporate big wigs are ruining the name … AND the product M.S. created …
Please pass it on …
What a bunch of college educated ‘ idiots ’ .
Thank you M.S. for all the things I have and all you have done for me and my family …
‘ I ’ do appreciate it … as for ‘ Dick ’ Lenny and Company … good luck you greedy , money loving mongrels … you are ruining the name , the company , and MANY lives in central Pennsylvania ….
read on …
Enough is Enough !
So Hershey executives are closing plants in the US , laying off over a thousand people , and destroying Mr. Hershey ’s dream , all to cut labor and material costs .
The company will save about $ 170 million a year , all on the backs of the American people .
The top executives will still make their mega bucks and the laid off workers will have to find other jobs , some probably at minimum wage due to their age .
All this to take their jobs to India , China and Mexico .
So WHAT part of the ‘ GREAT ’ American Chocolate Bar is left ?
… NOTHING !
These countries are no doubt laughing at the Americans , who they do n’t like anyway .
How long are the American people going to sit around and let big corporations do this to us ?
We must all band together and let them know we wo n’t take it any longer !
Please , do not buy any Hershey product !
I pulled EVERY dime of my stock , retirement and my HEART out of Hershey … ( it does hurt me to say that ) .
If the company wants to take the work to these countries , then let those countries buy the product .
We do n’t need it !
BLACKBALL HERSHEY !!
Please pass this to everyone on your email list so it gets all across the United States .

Of course , if you do n’t pay taxes to the government , chances are you will be arrested and thrown in the clinker .
Not so in the case of Rahm Emanuel , Obama ’s Chief of Staff .
Emanuel and other bureaucrats apparently do n’t have the time or desire to fill out and file the sort of paperwork you and I take for granted .
Emanuel ’s brazen tax evasion is nothing new , although the corporate media does not bother to cover it .
However , as we close in on tax day , the story is worth revisiting .
Millionaire Rahm created a handy - dandy charity in order to avoid paying property taxes on his Chicago residence .
“ According to the Cook County Assessor ’s website , the Chicago home of four - term Democrat Congressman and likely new White House Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , does n’t exist .
While the address of 4228 North Hermitage is listed as Emanuel ’s residence on the Illinois State Board of Elections ’ website , there seems to be no public record of Emanuel ever paying property taxes on this home , ” Right Soup reported last November , shortly after the election .
It is n’t a real charity , though — or at least not a serious one .
“ The Rahm Emanuel and Amy Rule Charitable Trust was formed in 2002 , when the Chicago lawmaker was first elected .
The former Clinton White House aide and his wife , Amy Rule , are its only donors . ”
Democrats are fond of this scam , as USA Today noted on January 7 , 2007 .
“ Rep. Rahm Emanuel made millions as an investment banker .
Sen .
Evan Bayh had leftover cash after two successful campaigns for Indiana governor .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s husband , Paul , became wealthy investing in real estate and technology firms …
Emanuel , Bayh and Nancy Pelosi are officers of the foundations that carry their names but failed to disclose the fact on their annual financial disclosure reports filed with Congress . ”
Do n’t try this at home unless you want heavily armed sheriffs to show up .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The Cook County Assessor ’s and Cook County Treasurer ’s online records indicate Emanuel ’s Chicago neighbors pay between $ 3,500 and $ 7,000 annually , ” explains the No Compromise When it Comes to Being Right ! blog .
“ However , Illinois Review has been unable to locate any evidence that the former Clinton advisor and investment banker is paying his fair share of Cook County ’s notoriously high tax burden . ”
In addition to not paying property taxes in Illinois , Emanuel has a nifty deal in the district of criminals .
“ White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel ’s Washington lodging arrangements , a rent - free basement room in a Capitol Hill home owned by Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn ) and her pollster husband , have inspired debate among tax experts and in Republican - leaning parts of the blogosphere , ” the Chicago Tribune reported recently .
“ One issue is whether Emanuel , who served in the House with DeLauro until early January , should have listed the room either as a gift or as income on his congressional financial disclosure forms .
Emanuel ’s disclosure filings contain no mention of his use of the room . ”
Emanuel and other bureaucrats apparently do n’t have the time or desire to fill out and file the sort of paperwork you and I take for granted — that is not unless you relish the idea of the IRS on your back .
Earlier this month , the media covered the “ tax problems ” of yet another Obama appointee , Labor Secretary - designate Hilda L. Solis .
Solis followed Treasury Secretary Thomas F. Geithner , Services Secretary - designate Thomas A. Daschle and Nancy Killefer , Obama ’s choice to be the first “ performance chief officer , ” all with similar “ tax problems . ”
Solis ’ tax evasion , however , is no big deal for the Democrats — on Tuesday , the Democrat - dominated Senate voted to confirm Rep. Hilda Solis as labor secretary , despite her husband paying overdue state taxes only after she was nominated by Obama more than two months ago .
“ The Senate voted 80 to 17 to confirm Solis , drawing praise from her allies in organized labor and the Latino community .
Her nomination was held up when it was learned that her husband , Sam Sayyad , had recently paid about $ 6,400 in back state taxes he owed from his auto repair business in California , ” the New York Daily News reports .
Rahm Emanuel and Obama ’s appointees are excused from paying taxes .
Meanwhile , speaking from the rostrum in the rogue ’s gallery that is the House chamber , Obama said last night that more money will be needed to fritter away on the so - called banker bailout , actually a banker giveaway .
Obama said trillions more will have to be “ set aside ” for the bankers .
In other words , your children and grandchildren will pay confiscatory taxes well into the future .
Do n’t expect Rahm Emanuel , Nancy Pelosi , Tim Geithner , Evan Bayh , and other minions of the elite to pay their “ fair share . ”
After all , taxes are for the little people .

The Second Amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms does not apply to override state firearms bans , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit declared Jan. 28 .
Under the incorporation doctrine , only certain provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states , and the Second Amendment is one of those that does not , the Second Circuit held ( Maloney v. Cuomo , 2d Cir. , No. 07-0581-cv , 1/28/09 ) .
The statute at the center of this case , N.Y. Penal Law § 265.01 ( 1 ) , provides criminal penalties for possession of a broad range of items , including weapons used in martial arts .
The plaintiff was charged under the statute after police found fighting sticks , or nunchaku , in his home .
He ended up pleading guilty to a different charge and then filed a lawsuit against the county prosecutor and others seeking a declaration that the law offends his Second Amendment right to bear arms .
Incorporation Doctrine
For the first half of its life , the U.S. Constitution 's Bill of Rights was interpreted as constraining only the federal government — not the states .
However , in the late 1800s and early 1900s , the U.S. Supreme Court began ruling that certain rights were incorporated into the limits on state governments imposed by the 14th Amendment 's due process clause .
The provisions selected for incorporation so far include most , but not all , of the rights that come into play in criminal cases .
For example , the right to indictment does not apply to the states .
Back before the incorporation doctrine took hold , the Supreme Court held , in United States v. Cruikshank , 92 U.S. 542 ( 1875 ) , and Presser v. Illinois , 116 U.S. 252 ( 1886 ) , that the Second Amendment is a limitation only on the power of the federal government and thus does not constrain state regulations .
The Supreme Court 's subsequent Second Amendment cases , United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 ( 1939 ) , and District of Columbia v. Heller , 76 U.S.L.W. 4631 ( U.S. 2008 ) , both involved federal regulations , so the incorporation issue was not really in play .
Nevertheless , in a footnote in Heller , the Supreme Court had this to say :
With respect to Cruikshank ‘s continuing validity on incorporation , a question not presented by this case , we note that Cruikshank also said that the First Amendment did not apply against the States and did not engage in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our later cases .
Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois , 116 U.S. 252 , 265 ( 1886 ) and Miller v. Texas , 153 U.S. 535 , 538 ( 1894 ) , reaffirmed that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government .
The Second Circuit , in contrast , has directly addressed the incorporation issue in recent years .
In Bach v. Pataki , 408 F.3d 75 , 73 U.S.L.W. 1677 ( 2d Cir. 2005 ) , the court rejected a challenge to a state gun-control law on the ground that the states ' power to regulate firearms is not limited by the Second Amendment right to bear arms .

Yet another one of those reposts I never seem to get tired of looking at ...
Django :
First impressions from a non-web developer
January 31 , 2009
I write in Java and I do n’t do “ web stuff ” .
If you have n’t left already , you might be wondering what a non -web developer is doing looking at Django ?
I ’m hardly their target audience and yet somehow they may have scored a convert .
I got wind of its existence from a talk Leah Culver gave at CUSEC 2009 and realized it could be suitable for a problem I was facing with a project at school .
We needed to develop a web frontend , mostly as proof of concept , for a database - backed system we ’ve been developing but had been dragging our heels about doing soon .
Between the three members of the group , none of us had much experience outside of PHP and we certainly had more important aspects of our system to focus on .
The trouble was that without a web frontend , it was going to be difficult to demo our system to our project supervisors .
Enter Django .
I ’m a self professed “ non -web guy ” .
I do n’t know much about “ web stuff ” ( and the use of the term “ web stuff ” should be telling on its own ) .
To give you some perspective : I hacked a bit with perl and cgi at the start of my undergrad in a fit of boredom at a desk job and the last time I made a website was when frames were in style .
So I figured diving into Django should be a good test of how it streamlines the little things for web developers .
Thankfully Python is not foreign to me , though my mindset is still partway between Java and C# and thus writing Good Python is still a conscious effort .
After following the tutorial , I had gotten a taste for some of the neat features Django had to offer .
I was particularly interested in the object - relational mapping , bullet point # 1 on Django ’s front page , as this had been a sore point for our project ’s development .
Paired with the flexible , shiny and virtually automatic admin interface , the solution we sought was staring us in the face .
The problem is that we had our model defined in Java and re-doing it in Python , while quite straightforward , was not an option due to time and project commitments .
Slightly dejected , since Django ’s admin interface would be sufficient for our demoing needs , I stumbled across Django ’s instructions for integrating with existing databases .
Jackpot .
First bump : the MySQLdb module does n’t work with Python > 2.5 .
Alright , no biggie .
After that , the
python manage .py inspectdb
command went swimmingly .
What followed was series of re-arrangements to the models .
py file that was generated in order to get the dependencies in line ( the table models are simply output alphabetically ) .
A bit tedious , but a breeze compared to some alternatives .
Running the server with the new model was initially unsuccessful .
Validation was failing on a field accessor “ clashing ” with a related field and instructed me to add a “ related_name ” for the definition .
Looking it up in the docs revealed its intended use for when a table needs to reference itself .
This , however , was n’t the case in my model .
We simply had two references from TableA to TableB .
A little further searching revealed that the prescribed remedy , giving each field a different related_name , was indeed the correct one .
I do n’t completely understand how this is not a bug , though perhaps there ’s simply a default value for related_name ( in which case I understand how the clash occurs and why it ’s invalid ) .
The next problem was … actually there was no next problem .
It ’s working .
I can barely believe it .
I ’m sure part of it is being so ridiculously out of sync with the web development world that even mundane features would impress me , but I ’m impressed .
A minor version requirement ( for a third - party db adaptor ) and some fiddling with a generated file and that was it .
I ’m off to play with Django admin options to get wrestle the forms into something a bit more useable , but it ’s all gravy from here .
Yes , there are alternatives , some of which might be better for what I ’m doing ( maybe in every way too ) .
But that ’s not the point .
Django has lowered the barrier for entry to enable clueless folk like myself to create some cool and useful things .
And that ’s really the important thing – it ’s gotten me to step into the web development realm to see what ’s possible .
Rails , for all its hype , ca n’t even claim that ( for me ) .
You want to protest - we will take your details
Last Monday
I was standing on my own at one side of the gates to an arms company .
I stood quietly , holding a non-provocative banner .
The picture shows what I had to tolerate for over an hour .
Is this not intimidating and harrassment ?
My only ' defence ' ( other than to give up protesting and go home ) was to get out my mobile phone and take this picture .

Why The Stimulus Package Is n't For Startups : The Gov't Does n't Want Creative Destruction

Earlier this week , I was on a fun panel put together by the Telecom Council of Silicon Valley , which was mainly focused on what the Obama Stimulus plan ( and the broadband allocation specifically ) would most likely mean for the industry .
At one point , an attendee in the audience said that he was from a startup , and questioned how he might partake of the stimulus funds -- and I responded , perhaps flippantly , that he was out of luck : the stimulus is n't for startups .
That 's not entirely true , of course .
There will be some token amounts of money handed out to startups , but pretty much everyone on the panel agreed , the administration has made clear that the stimulus package is about creating jobs as quickly as possible , and the administration has made it clear in so many words that this means handing it to incumbents .
They 've been pretty frank that the stimulus plan has a lot less to do with increasing broadband capabilities than with job creations -- and plans to get funds that show more job creation will get preference over those that actually increase broadband .
And that 's why the stimulus package is not for startups -- and is potentially dangerous in the long run .
Truly revolutionary startups do n't immediately create jobs -- they destroy them .
The process of creative destruction takes on those incumbent providers and wipes them out .
We 're seeing it with plenty of industries today that are challenged by new upstarts that have upset their old business models .
And , while most economists should recognize that this process isfor the overall economy , in that it leads to economic growth and more efficiency , it does upset the status quo , and causes many big companies to contract or disappear altogether .
So , think about it from a government bureaucrat 's perspective right now .
Go back a few decades , and assume someone came to you with a plan to create the internet -- and even accurately described how it would allow a great free exchange of information .
The reaction , if you were trying to deal with an economic crisis , would be to focus on all of the jobs it .
People can share music online ?
Think of all the job losses in the music industry !
People can read news for free ?
Think of all those newspapers shutting down !
But they would n't consider all of the economic activity created by the internet -- the billions of dollars and millions of new jobs created thanks to it .
If , today , you had a concept for a totally new technology that would greatly increase broadband access across the globe , in a revolutionary way .
It would allow anyone to have super high speed access anywhere .
It would n't be that costly to create or build or even maintain ... and it would n't even require making use of existing infrastructure .
From any normal calculation this would be fantastic .
It would spur enormous new economic growth opportunities and speed along our economy in massively useful ways .
Yet , it 's exactly the type of project the government would be against right now -- because it would make AT&T , Verizon and others obsolete ... and think of how many people that would put out of work , at the same time that the gov't wants to claim how many jobs it 's That 's an extreme hypothetical , but it 's useful in illustrating the point .
So , this focus on using the stimulus for short - term job creation is dangerous in that it will likely be used to prop up existing incumbent businesses , because they can create the most jobs most quickly -- by doing very inefficient things .
The startups that do things more efficiently end up doing short term job , even if the long - term results would be a much larger , more stable economy with larger job creation .

Clockwise from top right :
The dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound It has billionaires and big ambitions .
Now India wants something that no global economic powerhouse should be without : an international symbol for its currency .
The hope is that the rupee sign will become as ubiquitous as the US dollar ( $ ) , or that instant emblem of the digital age , the @ symbol .
But how easy is it to launch a symbol on the international stage and land a coveted place on keyboards the world over ?
It does n't happen very often .
One of the most recent symbols to make the leap , the  for euro , had a long and difficult birth .
Before that , in 1971 , the @ symbol was assigned an important international role , as the critical connector in e-mail addresses .
A 30 - year - old computer programmer named Ray Tomlinson , looking for coding to send the first ever e-mail , surveyed the keyboard on his Model - 33 Teletype and chose @ - which is apparently centuries old and has served various different functions - because it was unlikely to appear in a person 's name .
Cultural icon ?
The Indian government 's search for the perfectly formed sign is via an open competition , which stipulates that entries " should represent the historical and cultural ethos of India . "
It 's the same route that Russia went down in the 1990s , in its search , so far unsuccessful , for a symbol to represent the rouble .
Currency symbols get used in all sorts of ways Jasmine Montgomery , of design consultancy FutureBrand , London , says Delhi 's move shows it has realised the importance of country branding .
But she warns that it can be a tricky thing to manage .
" If the Indian Government is looking for something that symbolises its culture , it must equally bear in mind its business audience , " she says .
" When you look at it from a business point of view , different things come into play .
Monetary policy and the stability of the currency is very important .
" The currency symbol could be a powerful part of the country 's brand iconography , a signal of stability and the fact that it is a player on the world stage . "
However , she says while devising an international currency symbol is a " brilliant idea " , the competition has been set up in the wrong way .
" The idea that the symbol should have some cultural significance is a difficult one , " she says .
" The dollar , for example , does n't signify liberty and freedom - there is nothing recognisably American about it . "
The origins of the dollar sign have fallen into obscurity .
What is known is that the symbol is more recent than the name , which has references in Shakespeare 's Macbeth and The Tempest .
One explanation - the most widespread - is that the dollar sign was derived from the Spanish peso .
Another , is that the dollar sign has origins in a numeral " 8 " , denoting pieces of eight .
Rigorous testing Nowadays , designing new symbols involves rigorous testing , says Ms Montgomery .
" The Indian Government will have to consider very carefully how the symbol would be used in all its technical applications - how does it look on the web , blown up on posters , on mobile phones . "
India would not want a symbol that looked bad when it was turned upside down , she says - " like someone 's bottom , " for example .
The euro was originally designed as a logo The European Commission believes it got it right with the euro symbol .
Its website optimistically announces that the " success of the euro as a currency worldwide owes a small debt to the unique and memorable symbol supporting the euro notes and coins " .
The official version is that it the symbol is " a combination of the Greek epsilon , as a sign of the weight of European civilisation , an E for Europe , and the parallel lines crossing through stand for the stability of the euro " , and was designed by an anonymous team of four .
But a former chief graphic designer for the European Economic Community , Arthur Eisenmenger , has claimed that it was in fact he who created the symbol a quarter of a century before its unveiling in 1997 .
Mr Eisenmenger , the acknowledged creator of the European flag , said in an interview some years ago , he drew the symbol " without much consideration . "
" I was n't thinking of the euro at the time , but just something that symbolised Europe , " he said .
Complicated process
But while the European Commission takes satisfaction in the  symbol , typeface designers say the launch was not well managed .
" The European Central Bank presented it as a logo .
At the time , it had n't considered the technical consequences of it being incorporated into the everyday graphic language , and how it would translate to , say , computers or mobile phones , " says Jurgen Siebert , head of graphics software company FontShop in Berlin .
Getting a symbol onto the international scene can be a complicated and lengthy process , says Mr Siebert .
International currency symbols have similar attributes in their vertical and horizontal lines
There are the questions about where the new character should be placed in the character table and where it should be placed on the keyboard .
( Outside the country in question , it is most likely to be rendered through special coding with keyboard short - cuts . )
Then the operating systems of millions of computers would need to be upgraded , as would dozens and dozens of font sets .
When a computer stores a character , it stores it according to one of several different coding standards , ( for example Ascii or Unicode ) .
Any new character would need to be added to those standards , so that when a computer receives it , it knows how to render it to the screen .
Even after a decade , many people still do not use the euro sign .
The BBC , for example , writes out " euro " , partly because it may still be unfamiliar to some readers , and partly because many keyboards still do not feature the sign .
" When it 's all about ease of use and speed , it does n't make sense that the word euro is still being written out , " says Mr Siebert .
While the Indian government has set few conditions for the design of the Rupee the Russian competition , launched in 1999 by a group of journalists and designers and backed by the Russian Central Bank , issued a number of guidelines .
Simple graphics , strong and easy to write - a single symbol
Even weight - not overloaded with strokes or have any minor unnecessary lines
Width not exceeding that of a zero - so it can fit into columns for company reports and accounting
The favourites are reportedly designs based around the letter R , or its equivalent in Cyrillic script , P . One shows an R with two strokes across its spine , similar to the euro , and another has a P crossed by two diagonal lines .
Either would fit well into the existing suite of international currency symbols , but there is still no consensus on what Russia 's economic badge of honour should be .
Could India beat them to it ?
" It 's going to take a very long time before it translates into something , " says Sudeshna Sen , foreign editor of India 's Economic Times .
" But an open competition like this will be fun for the people . "

How about a zero ( 0 ) with a slash through it ?
After all , India gave the world the zero or shoonya , and the goal of every government is to make sure that its citizens have something more than zero in their pockets .
Shikari Shambu , Chicago
You have a few guesses about the origin of the $ symbol for the US Dollar .
It is just the two letters " U " and " S " superimposed , and then simplified over time .
Steve , London
Most currency symbols are a crossed letter .
The £ is a crossed L ( for Librum , the Latin word for weight or pound ) , the $ a crossed S ( for Spanish dollar ) , the ¥ a crossed Y ( for Yen ) and the  a crossed E ( for Euro ) .
The symbol for a rupee should , therefore , be a crossed R ( or whichever Indian character is equivalent to a letter R ) .
Arthur Adams , Warrington
To be honest , ten years after the introduction of the Euro I still struggle to make use of the "  " .
It is true , the symbol is perfect and has a great appearance and design , but it is not very feasible for those who do not have artistic skills .
I mean , when one does the "  " in handwriting , the " arch " is never properly made and the two lines end up having the same length , when one is shorter than the other .
Paulo Castro Garrido , Erfurt , Germany
How about just using a capital R ?
It 's already on the keyboard , in all the fonts , etc. easy to remember and draw and will be distinguishable as a currency symbol by its context .
It would work for roubles or rupees - first country to decide gets dibs .
Deborah , Amersham , Bucks
These days more keyboards in Europe do have the euro sign - maybe the BBC needs to update its hardware ?
Albeit I 've got to hold Alt Gr and then type 4 to get it (  , ooh ) .
Even without that , one could still hold Alt and they type 0128 on the number pad , _ aah .
James D , Derby India also needs to keep in mind that it is not the ONLY country that uses the Rupee currency .
Several other South Asian countries use the Rupee as well .
There are / were plans to introduce a single currency in the region .
So , they might want to keep this in mind when designing the symbol .
Bimal de Silva , London I echo Mr Shambu 's comment ( a zero with a slash through it ) but would add a second horizontal slash , simultaneously echoing the advent of " 0 " as well as creating an abstraction of the national flag .
Chirag , Chicago
The zero I believe was discovered by the Arabs , not Indians .
Nadeem Shah
For the origin of the dollar symbol , just Google an image of the old Spanish Dollars or Eight - Real Pieces ( pieces of eight ) that were used in America before independence .
On either side of the shield , you 'll see a pillar with a scroll wrapped around it - which , if you draw it out , is an " S " with two vertical lines through it
Warwick Cairns , Windsor
How silly is this ?
Economic strength is not determined by symbolism but with economic resilience .
India should spend its resources wisely in education and open up economic opportunities .
Rajeev Nair , Sioux Falls
The crossed R is already in use - in medicine as the symbol for prescription ( from the Latin radix ) .
Strangely the computer character gurus do n't seem to have ever implemented it .
But do n't let that stop us !
It would seem a consistent choice for Rupee .
But something from Sanskrit might be prettier .

Noodling is a southern US practice of fishing for catfish using only bare hands .
Many other names , such as catfisting , grabbling , graveling , hogging , dogging , gurgling , tickling and stumping , are used in different regions for the same activity .
Noodling is currently legal in eleven states . [ 1 ] .
The term " noodling " , although today used primarily towards the capture of flathead catfish , can and has been applied to all hand fishing methods , regardless of the method or species of fish sought .
Noodling as a term has also been applied to various unconventional methods of fishing , such as any which do not use bait , rod & reel , speargun , etc. , but this usage is much less common .

Get your dancing shoes on .
The text was from Brad 's younger brother , Seth , who coaches Virginia Tech .
Their schools are 18 miles apart geographically , light years metaphorically .
Radford is to Virginia Tech what Belarus is to Russia : smaller , lesser known — and aching to emerge from its neighbor 's oversized shadow .
Perhaps that 's what makes the Highlanders ( 21 - 11 ) such a nice fit for Belarusian center Artsiom Parakhouski ( art - SEE - um pair - uh - COW - ski ) , on whose broad shoulders Radford rides .
The Beast of Belarus , as a sign Saturday in the student section styled him , is a 6 - 11 , 260 - pound junior who has been learning basketball for only five years — and English for 2 ½ .
The measure of how far he has come in both may be found in what he says about next week 's first round .
" The little schools are losing nothing if they lose , " he says .
" Nobody knows them .
It 's just going in and playing free .
But big schools , they are under the big pressure .
And sometimes small schools are beating big schools . "
That 's a pretty fair summation of March Madness for a guy who never heard of it while growing up in Minsk .
" I knew about the NBA , of course , " he says , " but I did n't know anything about the NCAA tournament and how popular it is in the United States .
I did n't know until I got to America . "
That was 2 ½ years ago to play at the College of Southern Idaho , a junior college in Twin Falls where he faced twin challenges : new language , new game .
Parakhouski recalls the wonder of seeing the NCAA tournament on TV for the first time .
" I watched like crazy all the games , " he says .
" I would say , ' Once , I am going to be on this TV .
And I am going to play against some special team . '
And now , dreams are true . "
Greenberg 's dream was a longer time coming .
He is 55 , two years older than Seth , and a basketball lifer , yet last season was his first as a head coach .
" It 's a feel - good story about never losing sight of your dreams , " Seth says .
Greenberg was a young assistant at American University and Saint Joseph's in the late 1970s and early 1980s but then took a detour to the NBA as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Clippers and New York Knicks and as a player personnel executive with the Portland Trail Blazers .
Greenberg was general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers when they selected Allen Iverson first overall in the 1996 NBA draft but was let go after one season .
That still chafes his brother .
" I 'm the more outspoken Greenberg , " Seth says .
" Brad drafted the right guy but was never given a chance to continue .
That was n't right . "
Brad got back in the game as director of basketball operations for Seth 's team at South Florida and then as an assistant for him at Virginia Tech .
Brad applied for openings but says schools were n't much interested in a first - time head coach in his 50s .
" Some athletics directors , " he says , " would look at me and say , ' Wait a minute , this guy was an NBA GM .
What does he want coaching my team ?
He 's been dealing with agents and pros and flying on charter planes .
Is he really going to be happy in a little , tiny office and getting on a bus ? ' " Deliriously , as it turns out .
A nontraditional choice Radford 's spring break began a week ago .
Penelope W. Kyle , the university president , got word out that the dorms and cafeterias would remain open so students could stick around for Saturday 's Big South championship game against Virginia Military Institute .
Many stayed — and painted their faces and cheered themselves hoarse and , when Radford won 108 - 94 , stormed the court .
" The exuberance and joy was very satisfying for me to see , " Kyle says .
" I want them to feel proud .
A taste of winning breeds more winning , and I do n't mean just in athletics . "
Kyle hired Greenberg .
It did n't bother her that he was a nontraditional candidate .
" That 's why we hit it off , " she says .
" I was a nontraditional choice , too . "
She ran the state lottery in Virginia and , before that , was a business executive and a lawyer .
She liked his NBA credentials .
" I liked the idea that he knew about Radford from living across the hill " in Blacksburg , Kyle says .
" Years ago , Radford was the women 's division of Virginia Tech , so there is a strong connection in our history , even if we are n't formally related anymore . "
Brad and Seth are related by birth , never by schedule : Radford and Tech wo n't play while they 're coaching .
" Our mother would n't like it , " Brad says .
The brothers talk nearly every day , trading strategies and pep talks .
" There 's no better sounding board , " Seth says , " than one that comes with unconditional love . "
Virginia
Tech remains alive for an at - large or automatic berth after Thursday 's 65 - 47 win against Miami ( Fla. ) in the first round of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament .
Brad delayed Thursday 's practice so he could watch the game in his office , just as Seth watched Radford beat VMI last week from a Florida hotel room .
Parakhouski had 26 points and 18 rebounds against VMI .
His season averages of 16.3 points and 11.2 rebounds earned him the Big South player of the year award , but Parakhouski wo n't take the trophy .
He says it belongs to the team , not to him , and so it sits in Greenberg 's office .
" I think I disappoint him sometimes , because I do n't yell at him enough , " Greenberg says .
" He wants me to push him more .
But he 's such a nice kid , how can I yell at him ? "
Radford students yelled with him as they stormed the court Saturday .
Just then , Parakhouski spotted a man waving a Belarusian flag .
He waded into the stands , snatched the flag and returned to the frenzy , holding it high as the Highlanders cheered .
" I told myself , ' Why not ? '
I 'm going to grab this flag to celebrate , " Parakhouski says .
" I guess nobody from my country has done what I did , go to March Madness with Radford .
That 's just pretty cool feelings . "
Parakhouski had the flag draped around his neck in an interview room an hour after the game , sitting with guards Amir Johnson and Kenny Thomas .
What do they think of him ?
" Just beast , man , just monster , " Thomas says .
" Whenever we go on the court , Art tells me , ' I support you .
I got you . ' " " We needed one more piece , " Johnson says .
" He is the big piece that completed the puzzle . "
Basketball on a lark Parakhouski moves well for a man of his size , especially one with so little basketball experience .
Greenberg thinks he can play in the NBA some day .
But Parakhouski will tell you he is n't his family 's best athlete : " I will say my sister is best . "
Yana hopes to swim for Belarus in the 2012 Olympics , Parakhouski says .
His mother coaches swimming and his father heptathlon for national teams , he says .
His sport was soccer , from ages 6 to 16 .
By then , Parakhouski was 6 - 8 .
" In soccer , it 's better if you are smaller for tactics , " he says .
" All my friends around me said , ' You should be good in basketball . '
I said to myself , ' I can't live without sports , so I should try . '
And two years later I was in junior college in America .
For me , it was a surprise . "
Ali Ton is a Radford assistant who played at Davidson and hails from Turkey .
Ton saw Parakhouski at the under - 20 European Junior Championship in 2005 , when Parakhouski was 17 — and ineligible under NCAA academic guidelines .
It was n't just that he had not taken the SAT or ACT .
He spoke almost no English .
Ton suggested Southern Idaho , a top junior - college program .
When Greenberg was named coach at Radford before last season , he hired Ton .
And Ton suggested recruiting Parakhouski .
" We were fortunate , " Greenberg says , " because he was looking for a smaller school where he could play right away . "
Bigger programs made inquiries , but Parakhouski committed to Radford early .
Besides , when Parakhouski watched his first NCAA tournament games on TV he imagined himself with the underdogs , not the bluebloods .
That 's now a certainty .
The Big South entrant typically gets a No. 15 or No. 16 seed ; only Winthrop has done better over the years , including 2007 , when the No. 11 Eagles beat Notre Dame .
Some lesser - known school emerges as a darling in the first round each March , though never a No. 16 seed and rarely a 15 .
Perhaps that 's why one red-clad Radford fan at Saturday 's Big South final held up a sign that was more plea than rallying cry : " 14 Seed . "
Virginia Tech 's Greenberg thinks Radford will give some big - name school fits , thanks to Parakhouski and 6 - 8 forward Joey Lynch - Flohr .
" Most 15s or 16s , or whatever they 're going to be , do n't have Art and Joey , " Seth says .
" They have a legitimate D - I frontcourt .
And that gives them a chance . "
A chance is all Parakhouski asks .
" I like our chance , " he says , flag on shoulders , smile lingering .
" I feel shock .
In a couple days , maybe I will understand we 're going to March Madness .
Right now , I still can't believe . "

Of course , there are many elements that have to come together to make a joke truly funny - a risky subject matter and an unexpected punchline help no end - and personal taste plays as big a part as anything else , but we think there is something special about the combination of a slightly rude joke coming out of the mouth of an 81 - year - old gentleman .
University of Sydney associate professor Bjorn Landfeldt said the leaked list " constitutes a condensed encyclopedia of depravity and potentially very dangerous material " .
He said the leaked list would become " the concerned parent 's worst nightmare " as curious children would inevitably seek it out .
But about half of the sites on the list are not related to child porn and include a slew of online poker sites , YouTube links , regular gay and straight porn sites , Wikipedia entries , euthanasia sites , websites of fringe religions such as satanic sites , fetish sites , Christian sites , the website of a tour operator and even a Queensland dentist .
" It seems to me as if just about anything can potentially get on the list , " Landfelt said .
The blacklist is maintained by ACMA and provided to makers of internet filtering software that parents can opt to install on their PCs .
However , if the Government proceeds with its mandatory internet filtering scheme , sites on the blacklist will be blocked for all Australians .
The Government has flagged plans to expand the blacklist to 10,000 sites or more .
In a special report , written in conjunction with the Internet Industry Association and presented to the Government over a year ago , Landfeldt warned that " list leakage " was one of the main issues associated with maintaining a secret blacklist of prohibited sites .
Julian Assange , founder of Wikileaks , dug up the blacklist after ACMA added several Wikileaks pages to the list following the site 's publication of the Danish blacklist .
He said secret censorship systems were " invariably corrupted " , pointing to the Thailand censorship list , which was originally billed as a mechanism to prevent child pornography but contained more than 1200 sites classified as criticising the royal family .
" In January the Thai system was used to censor Australia reportage about the imprisoned Australian writer Harry Nicolaides , " he said .
" The Australian democracy must not be permitted to sleep with this loaded gun .
This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring Wikileaks . "
The leaked list , understood to have been obtained from an internet filtering software maker , contains 2395 sites .
ACMA said its blacklist , as at November last year , contained 1370 sites .
Assange said the disparity in the reported figure is most likely due to the fact that the list contains several duplicates and variations of the same URL that stem from a single complaint .
Alternatively , some sites may have been added to the list by the filter software maker .
ACMA said Australians caught distributing the list or accessing child pornography sites on the list could face criminal charges and up to 10 years in prison .
Opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin said the leaking of the list was irresponsible but highlighted how this type of information could surface despite the efforts of ACMA to protect it , and could be used by those with a perverse interest in its content .
" The regrettable and unfortunate reality is there will always be explicit and illegal material on the web and - regardless of blacklists , filters and the like - those with the means and know - how will find ways of accessing it , " he said .
" Adult supervision is the most effective way of keeping children safe online and people should n't be led into believing by Labor that expanded blacklists or mandatory filters are a substitute for that . "
Colin Jacobs , spokesman for the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia , said the leak was not surprising and would only get worse once the list was sent to hundreds of Australian ISPs as part of the Government 's mandatory internet filtering policy .
He said the Government could be considered a " promoter and disseminator of links to some pretty unsavoury material " .
" The list itself should concern every Australian - although plenty of the material is unsavoury or even illegal , the presence of sites like YouTube , MySpace , gambling or even Christian sites on the list raises a lot of questions , " he said .
" There is even a harmless tour operator on there , but there is no mechanism for a site operator to know they got on or request to be removed .
The prospect of mandatory nation - wide filtering of this secret list is pretty concerning from a democratic point of view . "
The Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , said the leak and publication of the ACMA blacklist would be " grossly irresponsible " and undermine efforts to improve cyber safety .
He said ACMA was investigating the matter and considering a range of possible actions including referral to the Australian Federal Police .
Australians involved in making the content available would be at " serious risk of criminal prosecution " .
" Under existing laws the ACMA blacklist includes URLs relating to child sexual abuse , rape , incest , bestiality , sexual violence and detailed instruction in crime , " Senator Conroy said .

Tienen en la mano la galletita " Pocky " que consiguieron en el Barrio Chino .
" Es nuestra hostia " , bromea Aiko , kinesióloga , de 22 años y de Belgrano .
En su grupo de amigos todos llevan mochilas con pins de sus dibujos animados preferidos , un mp3 o un iPod con música japonesa y a cada rato se les escapa -y sin querer - , un arigato ( gracias ) , daisuki ( te quiero mucho ) y kawaii ( qué tierno ) .
Se agregan " chan " al final de cada nombre ( así , Matías es " Matichan " ) , cantan canciones en japonés con voz aniñada y bailan la danza tipo electrónica - pop bautizada " Parapara " .
No se trata de un viaje a Oriente ni un cuento de fantasía nipón .
Esto pasa acá , frente al Palacio Pizzurno , en la galería Bond Street y en eventos donde compiten por el mejor disfraz y el mejor baile , después de pasar por el Paseo La Plaza .
No son emos ni floggers : se llaman otakus y lolitas , y son las nuevas tribus urbanas que agrupan a cientos de jóvenes de 13 a 30 años .
A diferencia de otras tribus que se importaron de Inglaterra y de Estados Unidos , los otakus nacieron del fanatismo casi obsesivo por los animé ( dibujos animados ) , el manga ( historietas ) , los videojuegos y la J - Music ( música japonesa ) .
Es una tendencia que se viene dando desde que los animé Dragon Ball Z y Sailor Moon pisaron la Argentina en los '90 y lograron que los chicos -y los no tan chicos - empezaran a indagar en la cultura oriental .
Las lolitas nacen de la moda japonesa .
Hay en toda Latinoamérica y ya arrasan Nueva York , París y Londres .
Pero acá , cuando unos y otros se juntan disfrazados en el Paseo La Plaza antes de armar un karaoke en japonés en alguna casa , los vecinos se los quedan mirando : " Nos miran mal .
Creen que somos raros , que lo único que hacemos es mirar dibujitos , que somos nerds " , dice " Matichan " , estudiante de abogacía , de Palermo .
" Algunos no nos entienden y si vamos al Pizzurno nos quieren linchar : creen que somos actores o huecos .
Pero tenemos valores " , afirma Aiko .
Los otakus hacen lo que llaman " cosplay " : difrazarse representando a un personaje de los dibujos animados .
" Los animé tratan sobre historias bastante reales con las que te sentís identificado " , explica Aiko .
El próximo evento , " Cosmofixión " , será hoy en la Escuela 19 , en Caballito .
La indumentaria es su coraza .
Para las lolitas también .
La confeccionan ellos o la compran por Internet .
Para Marcelo Urresti , sociólogo del Instituto Gino Germani , la cultura japonesa creó una sociedad dominada por gustos infantiles : " Los otakus y las lolitas son el efecto de un infantilismo de una nación traumatizada , nacido de la guerra y sustentado por una cultura consumidora " , asegura a Clarín .
Ellos , en cambio , dicen que no son una tribu sino una comunidad .
" Un otaku es estudioso , responsable " , dice Aiko .
Aunque admite , en broma , los dibujitos japoneses " te lavan el cerebro " .
También frente al Pizzurno se juntan cada vez más " foxes " , cuyo lema es " no a la violencia " .
Los sociólogos aseguran que las tribus tienden a reciclarse y que las lolitas y los otakus , por el fanatismo de los videojuegos y los animé , seguirán creciendo .
The charges relate to events in Falluja in 2004 A US marine has gone on trial accused of killing an unarmed captive in Iraq , in a case sparked by his own alleged confession during a lie - detector test .
The court - martial in California heard that when Sgt Ryan Weemer applied for a Secret Service job , he said he had killed someone in Iraq in 2004 .
That led to a criminal investigation and he was recalled to active duty to face military prosecution .
He denies the charge and his defence argues the case cannot be proved .
At the court - martial , being held at Camp Pendleton marine base near San Diego , his lawyer told the jury there was no evidence a crime had ever been committed .
He said prosecutors could not prove their case because they had no body , no forensic evidence and no relatives complaining of a lost loved one .
Recorded testimony
But prosecutors have at least one recording of Sgt Weemer saying he shot a man .
He is charged with unpremeditated murder and dereliction of duty stemming from a fierce fire - fight in Falluja in 2004 .
Sgt Weemer left the Marine Corps two years later and applied for a job in the Secret Service .
During a polygraph test as part of the application , he was asked about the most serious crime he had ever committed .
" We went into this house , there happened to be four or five guys in the house , " he said on the recording , which was played at the trial .
" We ended up shooting them , we had to . "
The US military had ordered all civilians out of Falluja ahead of an assault - Operation Phantom Fury - aimed at recapturing the city from insurgents .
Sgt Weemer said in the interview that the unarmed Iraqis were killed because the marines did not have time to take the men to jail .
His squadron leader , Jose Nazario , has already been tried and was found not guilty .
A third marine , who is also charged with murder , faces trial in a few weeks .

Do n't you think it is about time GLD and the other popular international gold exchange - traded gold funds told their owners exactly what kind of gold they claim to own ?
Can you imagine a situation where a person buys a gold ETF to own " non-gold " but finds out that he in reality owns OTC derivatives on gold ?
That would be an investment in the same type of financial instrument ( not gold ) that one owns gold bullion to protect oneself against .
The failure to unearth the Madoff scandal earlier becomes incredible when one understands that the returns from the market that were claimed on the size of the hedge fund were logically impossible .
The same reasoning screams bloody murder when applied to the many gold EFTs in terms of what it is they really own .
This raises a major question :
From where did all the gold claimed to be owned by all the gold ETFs come from ?
Where did funds such as GLD get their additional 45 tons in the last month ?
We certainly can forget about that gold coming from the Comex .
Twelve deliveries would stand out like a sore thumb .
Record keeping eliminates all exchanges around the globe as the source of bullion in any size to all the gold ETFs .
The physical market is so tight that coin minting has all but closed down compared to what it was one year ago .
It is hard to accept that the gold EFTs can buy what the mints can't .
A read of the original EFT prospectus removes any thought that the gold is leased but leaves one to invite probability .
That probability is that the claimed gold can be only OTC derivative long positions .
If that is so , then the financial reliability of the paper stands on the foundation of the balance sheet of the granting counterparty to the OTC derivative .
This is true regardless of whether the counterparty is a mine or a naked speculator .
I think people own an ETF of derivatives , not of gold .
If I am correct then there is no clearinghouse guarantee for the OTC derivative to function .
Like so many other surprises of the last two years , the gold ETF shareholder may actually have no gold at all .
A perfect Ponzi scheme would allow you to surrender shares for bullion .
You need only think about it .

Scientists sailed out to have a closer look at the eruptions of an undersea volcano off the coast of Tonga in the South Pacific Ocean today .
Tonga 's head geologist , Kelepi Mafi , said there was no apparent danger to residents of Nuku'alofa and others living on the main island of Tongatapu .
Officials also said it may be related to a quake with a magnitude of 4.4 which struck last March 13 around 35 kilometers from the capital at a depth of nearly 150 kilometres .

Yesterday several entertainment industry insiders explained how piracy was responsible for the downfall of their industries .
Today , Kristoffer Schollin from Gothenburg University explains that BitTorrent is not evil , while media professor Roger Wallis informs the court that the file - sharing is actually beneficial to the entertainment industry .
First up today was Kristoffer Schollin who spoke via telephone from Gothenburg University .
He explained he is a lecturer in IT law with a particular interest in file - sharing and has written a paper on Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) .
He has also made a special witness report for the court .
Answering questions from the defense , Schollin explained that . torrent files are a more sophisticated type of Internet link ( such as an http hyperlink ) and that The Pirate Bay is an “ open database ” of . torrent files .
Several large companies are using BitTorrent technology said Schollin , including Blizzard who use it for World of Warcraft .
When asked about TPB specifically , Schollin noted that the site is essentially a BBS ( Bulletin Board ) for . torrent files , attached to a forum for debate .
He was also asked , in his opinion , if TPB is illegal .
“ That ’s for the court to decide , ” he said , while noting that the technology behind the site is not illegal in any way .
Schollin told the court that The Pirate Bay may not be the world ’s largest tracker , but it is the most famous one , largely thanks to the media and thanks to the trial .
Right now there are maybe a dozen other big ones and maybe even a thousand others , he said .
Going on , he noted it is usually sites that are known to users , while trackers can operate behind the scenes , not seen by the regular users .
The day of the very big torrent site may be over , he added , and said he believes the future could lie in meta - searches , while explaining how client - based searches like Vuze ’s operate .
When asked about the type of content indexed on TPB , Schollin said , “ My God , everything , ” noting that both copyright and copyright - free material can be found .
When speaking with Carl Lundstom ’s lawyer Per E Samuelsson , Schollin admitted that while searching for . torrents via Google ( using Harry Potter as an example ) more results could be found than with TPB ’s search alone .
Indeed , said Schollin , EU law documents are easier for him to find via Google than they are on the EU ’s own website .
The so - called King Kong defense also resurfaced , with Samuelsson asking Schollin if it was possible to conclude that the torrent file uploaded by user ‘ KingKong ’ was first published on TPB .
Schollin said it was not possible .
Touching again on the issue of whose actual tracker is used when a torrent file is activated , Schollin said that just because a . torrent is available on TPB , it does n’t automatically follow that the file uses TPB ’s tracker .
Schollin went on to explain how to make a . torrent file which links to content .
He said that in the creation stage , it does n’t even require an Internet connection and everything is done on the user ’s PC with a torrent client , not on TPB .
Once created the .torrent file could be uploaded on to the Internet .
It would then be indexed by Google , which then allows anyone to access the .torrent via a Google search .
Then it was Prosecutor Håkan Roswall ’s turn to question Schollin .
He put it to Schollin that kudos could be achieved in file - sharing circles if an individual put pre-release material up on the Internet , a point with which Schollin agreed .
Roswall asked Schollin why he felt the TPB had grown so big and so popular .
Schollin said that many users may feel that participation might be considered ‘ cool ’ .
The discussion again moved back to DHT ( Distributed Hash Table ) and then the court took a break .
On return , IFPI lawyer Peter Danowsky stepped up to question Kristoffer Schollin .
He asked where Schollin ’s interest in TPB began and he replied it started when there was lots of discussion about them on the Internet .
Conversation moved to Schollin ’s knowledge of TPB ’s infamous ‘ legal ’ page and the ideology of some of its users .
Next up to question Schollin was Monique Wadsted , representing the movie companies .
She asked Schollin if he had heard the rumor that 40 % of the Internet ’s traffic is down to TPB .
Schollin said this was incorrect and it was more likely that they were responsible for 40 % of all BitTorrent traffic .
Wadsted then put it to Schollin that 50 % of all the world ’s . torrent files sit on TPB , and he denied this amount too , but recognized that there would be a significant number .
Schollin was then asked by the defense if he believed that TPB has a role in transmitting communications on the Internet .
Schollin agreed it did .
When asked if TPB might be considered a ‘ service provider ’ under the law , he said that was for the court to decide .
Up next as a witness was Roger Wallis .
Wallis is a media professor , composer and Chairman of the Swedish Composers of Popular Music and is involved in other outfits dedicated to the rights of musicians .
However , Wallis previously said that he did not see the difference between TPB and other search engines such as Google and has criticized the music industry for being too slow adopting technology .
Speaking with Peter Altin , ( Peter Sunde ’s lawyer ) , Wallis said he specializes in developing the music industry on the Internet and because of this some have incorrectly drawn the assumption that he works for the industry – he does n’t .
Wallis referred to a report he wrote which detailed the music industry ’s approach to digital technology .
He said there were elements who would do anything to smother it , referring to the backlash against cassette tapes in the 1970’s .
Altin asked Wallis if there is any connection between illicit downloads and lost sales in the music industry .
Contradicting the opinion of John Kennedy of the IFPI in his testimony yesterday , Wallis said that downloading caused an increase in sales of live event tickets and although there has been a reduction in CD sales , this wo n’t continue .
Wallis went on to explain that while some people download , these people also tend to buy more CDs than others that do n’t .
It ’s not just downloading causing competition for the industry , other things have an effect such as the growth of computer games , he said .
Wallis believes the music industry is shooting itself in the foot by going after file - sharers , for the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph .
He said that on the whole , file - sharing is beneficial to the music and movie industries , pointing out that the movie industry just had its most successful year ever .
But the music industry does n’t help itself he argues .
Anyone who has bought a Beatles single in the past , simply cannot buy the same single in the digital domain due to licensing issues .
“ This is madness , ” he said .
Next up to question Wallis was Peter Danowsky , who immediately started to annoy him by questioning his credentials .
Danowsky mused if Wallis was even a proper professor , while disputing the year when Wallis qualified as such , calling him into doubt and criticizing him .
“ Have you no better questions to ask ? ” Wallis replied , reportedly visibly annoyed .
With tempers starting to fray , the court took a break .
After the break media professor Roger Wallis was questioned by Henrik Pontén from Sweden ’s Anti-Piracy Office .
Pontén went on where Danowsky left off and asked the professor if he could elaborate a bit more on how he acquired his title .
“ Can you use Google ?
Wallis replied “ Then you could easily find my CV , ” he added , and the court agreed with his assessment that they have already been over this .
Pontén then showed some graphs from a study that showed that 18 % of those who download copyrighted music buy less , while only 8 % indicate to buy more .
These figures cause some confusion in court , and Wallis responded by saying that these figures do not correspond with his findings .
“ I believe that it has no relevance , ” Wallis added .
The prosecution asks some more questions about the contradicting results of the other study , but Wallis does n’t want to go into it .
When Wallis left the stand he was asked whether he wanted compensation for his appearance .
“ You are welcome to send some flowers to my wife , ” he responded .
Defendant Peter Sunde then asked the court if it ’s ok to show an 8 minute clip that explains how BitTorrent works .
The defense explains that the film will show that none of the alleged criminal offenses actually took place since torrent files can be shared in many ways .
Fredrik Neij , one of the other defendants , further said that the SLK investigation was flawed because not all the torrents that were presented as evidence are exclusively tracked by TPB .
After a short break the film was played ( available for download here ) and it showed how a torrent is created .
First a BitTorrent is downloaded .
To make the torrent a tracker has to be added , hundreds of trackers can be found through Google the film explained .
It further explained how these torrent files can be shared through MSN , Skype , through blogs like WordPress or a website such as The Pirate Bay .
The other party can then grab the torrent and start downloading .
The rest of the day the court will go over the personal charges against Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm .
These are seperate cases , not related to TPB , and we will therefore not cover these on TorrentFreak .
Our daily coverage on the proceedings in the TPB trial will continue on Monday .

Houston Texans Ryan Moats Misses Being At His Dying Mother - In - Law’s Side Due To Overzealous Cop
Last week , Houston Texans running back Ryan Moats rushed to Baylor Hospital in Plano , Texas after hearing that his mother - in - law was dying .
However , Moats & his wife were stopped before they could get into the building .
Dallas police officer Ryan Powell stopped him in the ER parking lot .
What ensued was recorded on video from his dashcam .
The complete video can be found here .
“ Get in there , ” Officer Powell yelled out to Tamishia Moats , Ryan ’s wife , as she exited the car .
“ Let me see your hands .
Get in there .
Put your hands on the car . ”
“ Excuse me , my mom is dying , ” Moats said .
Moats and the other woman ignored Officer Powell ’s commands and rushed inside the hospital to see her mother .
“ I ’ve got seconds before she ’s gone , man , ” Moats said to the officer .
Motes could n’t find his insurance paperwork and was desperate to leave .
“ Listen , if I ca n’t verify you have insurance … , ” Officer Powell said .
“ My mother - in - law is dying , ” Moats interrupted .
“ Listen to me , ” Officer Powell said .
“ Right now , ” Moats said .
“ You ’re wasting my time . ”
“ If you ca n’t verify you have insurance , I ’m going to tow your car , ” the officer said .
“ So , you either find it or I am going to tow the car . ”
At that point , a lot of people would have probably said , “ F — you , tow my damn car , ” so give Ryan Moats a lot of credit for not doing so .
While the Moats tried his best to get inside , nurses from the hospital twice came out to get him .
Not only did nurses try to help , other police officers even tried to get Powell to let Moats go .
“ Hey , that ’s the nurse , ” a Plano officer said .
“ She says the mom is dying right now and she wants to know if I can get him up there . ”
Now it ’s not easy being a cop .
But when you have fellow officers telling you to lighten up and let the man go be with a dying relative , maybe you should listen .
After 20 minutes , Moats was finally allowed to enter the hospital , but not until after he had been given a ticket for running a red light .
Moats said , “ I went up after she passed and held her hand , but she was already gone . ”
The Dallas Police Department is investigating the incident , but they have already dropped the ticket & apologized to Moats .
As for Officer Powell , he has been re-assigned for now , hopefully to some department where he does n’t have to interact with other human beings .

IN DECEMBER , with great fanfare , the Vatican released Dignitas Personae , its latest report on bioethics .
Sad to say , the document demonstrates once more that a morality rooted in outdated , pre-scientific understanding is not appropriate to modern realities .
I refer not to the hot - button issues of abortion or stem cell research but to the Catholic church ’s continued opposition to a decidedly pro-life medical intervention : in vitro fertilisation .
The moral basis of the Vatican ’s opposition seems to be twofold : that only conception achieved through the …
Getting a good night 's sleep might not cure the common cold , but new research hints it could prevent one .
People who averaged less than seven hours of sleep a night were about three times more likely to develop cold symptoms than study volunteers who got eight or more hours of sleep , Pittsburgh researchers reported yesterday in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
Participants who had a hard time falling asleep or woke up in the middle of the night fared even worse :
Their chances of coming down with a cold were up to five and a half times higher than people who were sound asleep - and stayed that way - almost as soon as their heads hit the pillow .
" This is a huge effect , " Dr. Charles Czeisler , chief of sleep medicine at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , said in an interview .
He was not involved in the study .
" These results really fit in very well with what has been becoming increasingly clear , which is that sleep has major effects not only on the brain in terms of alertness and performance , but also on the health of the body . "
Sheldon Cohen , a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , led the clinical trial in which 153 healthy men and women told researchers every day for two weeks how long and well they slept and how rested they felt .
The volunteers were then quarantined in a hotel , where cold - causing rhinoviruses were dropped into their noses .
For five days they were monitored for sneezing , coughing , stuffy noses , and other cold symptoms .
Among the 153 study subjects , 135 were infected , but only 54 developed a cold .
After taking into account a wide variety of factors - including age , weight , socioeconomic status , perceived stress , smoking , and alcohol consumption - how long and how well individuals slept were the strongest predictors of who would come down with a cold .
Of the two factors , sleep efficiency was a stronger predictor than sleep duration .
Even if eight hours of sleep was disturbed only 2 percent to 8 percent of the time - being awake 11 to 38 minutes - there was a four times greater likelihood of developing cold symptoms than among people who were asleep 99 percent or 100 percent of their time in bed , Cohen said in an interview .
These findings are consistent with what other studies have found .
In earlier research cited in the Archives article , researchers deprived people of sleep and then compared their response to a flu shot with the response of people who got their normal amount of sleep .
The sleep - deprived subjects developed half the number of antibodies from their flu vaccinations that the other subjects did , suggesting sleep helps the immune system mount a more robust defense against disease .
A biological mechanism that would explain the link between sleep and cold symptoms is not known , Cohen said , but previous research suggests it might involve the release of inflammatory chemicals , which cause some of the symptoms of colds .
Inflammation is implicated in not just infectious diseases but also in illnesses from autoimmune disorders to heart disease .
" It does have potential implications for a lot of inflammatory diseases , " Cohen said about the sleep and colds study .
" We do n't regulate our immune systems as well when we do n't get enough hours of sleep . "

Make Worldwide Hunger a Priority
by : Care2.com
recipient : President of the United States
More than 16,000 children die every day from hunger - related causes .
Yet , few of these deaths are due to outright starvation .
Instead , children who are " only " mildly or moderately undernourished suffer from immune systems that are unable to fight common illnesses that we could easily overcome .
What can you do when the causes of poverty are complex and the effects so daunting ?
One of the answers is to invest education and resources into women .
Women are the primary caretakers of children under the age of five -- the ones most vulnerable to the ravages of chronic hunger and malnutrition .
Also , research confirms that mothers tend to use new income and resources for the benefit of their children .
By giving women the powerful resources of credit and knowledge , you affect the nutrition , health and education of an entire household .
So send a message to the President of the United States -- make eradicating hunger a priority and invest in programs that help women help themselves and their families .
read petition letter ▾
The scope of the problem is immense with an estimated 815 million undernourished people in the developing world , consuming less than the minimum amount of calories essential for sound health and growth .
And with the surge in food prices over the past few years , the number of children and families living with serious food insecurity is dramatically rising .
It 's been said that the era of cheap food is over , and that high food prices will remain with us for at least another 15 years .
That makes it all the more imperative to deal with root causes of hunger .
Unlike famine , chronic hunger is a persistent and insidious condition that can affect generations of people in a geographic region .
To alleviate this condition , efforts must address root causes , be sustainable , and they must be implemented by local people for the long term .
One important strategy is to focus on women .

Therefore , given the above , I urge to make worldwide hunger a priority for your administration to prioritize development efforts towards women .
Every day , more than 16,000 children die from hunger - related causes .
Few of these deaths are due to outright starvation , but rather to common illnesses ( like diarrhea , acute respiratory illness , malaria and measles ) that move in on vulnerable children whose bodies have been weakened by hunger .

Git ’s rebase command is hard to understand for newcomers , and the manpage ’s description does n’t help at all :
git - rebase – Forward - port local commits to the updated upstream head
Um , what ?
This is helpful if you know how Git works , but not at all if you ’re just starting out .
Thanks to Travis Swicegood , we have a better metaphor :
A cleaver .
Rebase helps to cut up commits and slice them into any way that you want them served up , and placed exactly where you want them .
You can actually rewrite history with this command , be it reordering commits , squashing them into bigger ones , or completely ignoring them if you so desire .
Why is this helpful ?
One of the most common use cases is that you ’ve been working on your own features / fixes / etc in separate branches .
Instead of creating ugly merge commits for every change that is brought back into the master branch , you could create one big commit and let rebase handle attaching it .
Another frequent use of rebase is to pull in changes from a project and keep your own modifications in line .
Usually by doing merges , you ’ll end up with a history in which commits are interleaved between upstream and your own .
Doing a rebase prevents this and keeps the order in a more sane state .
For some examples of how this looks graphically , visit the end of Git for Computer Scientists or James Bowes ’ post on the subject .
So let ’s go through a simple example of using rebase .
I ’m going to check out a new branch for my feature , and hack on it for a bit , and commit my changes .
$ git checkout - b newfeature Switched to a new branch " newfeature " [.. changed some files , made a few commits ..] $ git checkout master Switched to branch " master " [.. changed one file , committed ..]
So right now , our history looks like this ( screenshots taken from gitx ) :
Now I want to bring the changes back into the master branch .
Now , from here I could merge my changes in with git merge newfeature .
If I did that , here ’s how the commit history would look :
If we did a git rebase newfeature instead , our commit history would look like :
So you can see how it ends up a lot cleaner and compact .
Since these changes were relatively simple , merging was really simple and did n’t require any work to do .

Talk about a toxic asset …
One of the people named this week to President Obama ’s new Task Force on Tax Reform is a member of the AIG board of directors .
Martin Feldstein , a professor of economics at Harvard University , has been on the board of American International Group since 1988 .
He also was a prominent economic adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush .
Asked about the AIG connection , a senior administration official said Friday that the White House declined to comment on the story .
Like the others named to the tax reform task force , Feldstein also serves on Obama ’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board , which is headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker .
Ubuntu & SoC 2009
After much internal discussion it has been decided that we are not going to participate in Summer Of Code 2009 .
The reason for this is that we do n't really have sufficient time and resources to ensure our participation in the program meets the expected needs .
As such , we would prefer to not take part as opposed to providing a sub -par standard of participation due to lack of time and resources .
We are hoping that we can participate in Summer Of Code 2010 and have the resources and time available to take part and have the program benefit the Ubuntu community .
Thanks , folks .

An atheist group which is to begin advising the BBC on religious programmes such as Thought for the Day is heralding the change as a “ great step ” .
Prominent atheists such as A C Grayling and Phillip Pullman have also welcomed the move to allow ‘ non- religious ’ groups to influence religious programming .
However , the move is likely to exacerbate concerns that the BBC is increasingly neglecting its Christian audience .
The British Humanist Association ( BHA ) includes in its list of aims “ an end to the privileged position of religion ” in areas of the public sphere including broadcasting .
The BBC will take advice on its religious programming from the new Standing Conference on Religion and Belief , an independent committee replacing the old Central Religious Advisory Committee .
Andrew Copson of the BHA will sit on the new committee .
He is expected to push for an increased contribution from humanists on Radio 4 ’s religious slot , Thought for the Day .
Mr Pullman , a well - known atheist author , said he was “ delighted ” by the news of Mr Copson ’s appointment .
Professor Grayling said : “ At long last , here is one token of acceptance that the traditional way of thinking about matters of the spirit and matters of the mind needs to be rethought . ”
However , Mike Judge of The Christian Institute warned that the move would simply lead to a further sidelining of Christians .
“ The BBC ’s decision to take advice on religious programming from a group that defines itself as anti-religious is astonishing .
“ This is like asking Jeremy Clarkson to sit on a committee responsible for making programmes about the environment . ”
The BBC has repeatedly come under fire for its treatment of religious issues .
Last year , Director General Mark Thompson admitted that he felt Christianity should be treated with less sensitivity than other religions .
There has been speculation that the BBC is planning to replace its head of religious programming , a Methodist lay preacher , with a Muslim .
Aaqil Ahmed has attracted criticism during his time at Channel 4 for producing programmes with a bias towards Islam .
Last month the Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , was reported to have met with BBC Director General Mark Thompson to express his concern that the corporation is ignoring its Christian audience .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - The New York Times
Co has threatened to shut The Boston Globe unless the newspaper ’s unions agree to $ 20 million in concessions , The Boston Globe reported , quoting union leaders .
The union officials said executives from the Times and the Globe made the demands on Thursday morning in a meeting with leaders of the newspaper ’s 13 unions , the Globe reported .
“ Management told union leaders Thursday that the Globe will lose $ 85 million in 2009 , unless serious cutbacks are made , according to a Globe employee briefed on the discussions , ” the Globe report said .
That compares with an estimated $ 50 million loss last year , the newspaper quoted the employee as saying .
What in the world is going on ?
The entire world economy is in turmoil .
International trade has slowed drastically .
Unemployment here and abroad is mounting day by day .
Small businesses and shops are closing everywhere we look .
The stock market is in the tank .
The Federal Reserve ( our own , homegrown banking cartel ) has more than doubled the monetary base since September 2008 .
They have introduced $ 800 billion of new money in a four - month period .
This is a hundred times as much as was printed to support WW2 and all the wars since and it is just the beginning of what will be needed to cover the Bush and Obama bailouts and stimulus plans .
There is no way that all these expenditures will ever be repaid through taxes ; serious inflation is in the offing .
And to top it off no one really believes these spending programs will actually correct the underlying economic problems .
So how did we get into this mess and what can we do to protect ourselves , much less get out of it ?
Well , back in 1913 , as Congressman Charles Lindbergh Sr. said , “ we put the fox in charge of the hen house . ”
We established the Federal Reserve System , which gave the bankers effective control of our money supply .
Since then , they have introduced so much new money that today 's dollar has been reduced in value to about four cents relative to the 1914 dollar .
Things , on average , now cost 25 times as much as they did then .
During the Greenspan era the recklessness increased markedly and new money ( which distorts the economy by leading people to believe they were wealthier than they actually were ) was made available year after year .
This led to the housing bubble , the credit bubble , the commodities and all the other bubbles and the house of cards based on the fractional reserve banking system is now in the process of disintegrating .
It almost collapsed last summer with the failure of Bear - Stearns and Lehman Brothers when banks began to refuse to lend to each other .
Why ?
Because they could n't trust each other , not knowing who would be next to fail .
Overnight lending between banks is a vital necessity when their reserves are only a fraction ( 8 - 10 % ) of their on - demand deposits .
They keep afloat because moneys drawn from one bank end up in other banks and those that are heavy in cash can then lend back to those in need of cash .
The whole scheme is dishonest at its core ( although highly profitable to banks ) because the total of money loaned - out is ten times as much as is held in reserve for depositors , who are told their money is in the bank .
The lifeblood of our economy , indeed the whole world 's economy , is based on money .
Without a currency that can be trusted , the entire structure of economics , the division of labor itself , falls apart .
Our wealth , our well being and our very lives are dependent on the continuation of this highly complex structure called the economy and it in turn is dependent on sound money .
We have placed our trust for the management of this money on a gang of thieves called the Federal Reserve .
They have now clearly demonstrated their inability to restrain themselves from the excesses that can be perpetrated within a paper money system .
If we want to survive as a nation , we need to eliminate both the Federal Reserve and paper money .
But , that 's not all , we need to go back and see why it is we let ourselves get caught in this net in the first place .
Why did our elected representatives and we as a people vote for the Federal Reserve to begin with ?
Basically , it is because we thought we could trust these men , we placed our faith in their integrity and good character .
We forgot that they were really no different from us .
We forgot that we are all basically sinful at heart , that none of us can be trusted , especially when the temptation is really large .
We have attempted to do what God has told us is impossible , that is , to govern ourselves and live without regard to His word .
He told us that we must always keep equal weights and measures , free enterprise economics and only weights of gold and silver as money .
We have decided that fractional reserve banking ( unequal weights and measures ) , a little bit of socialism and paper money is OK .
In fact , we felt it would be an improvement over what God commanded ; and there lies the beginning of our downfall .
Christians !
You need to understand that the Bible is not just a way to heaven , a way of salvation for the next life .
It is also a way of salvation from our sinful selves in this world .
It provides all the instructions we need to establish and maintain a godly order in this sin-filled world .
Christ told us that we are the salt and the light of the world but we have shaded our light , allowed our salt to become corrupted and hidden ourselves in our churches while the world around us grew more and more sinful and wicked .
How will you answer Him when He asks why you have ignored His commandments ?
Will
He say , “ I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity ” ?
It turns out that construction firms have been buying private data on employees , and using it to blacklist union activists .
I can only think that practises like this must be fairly widespread , even in those industries where unions are generally banished .
Informal spying on potential employees is understood to happen on a regular basis .
I do n't want to name any names , but temp agencies have been known to advise candidates to take care as to what information appears on their Facebook pages , Friends Reunited accounts , blogs or other potential sources of information .
Employers scrutinise these sites when reviewing candidates details to see if they are about to hand a contract over to a weirdo or some sort of inflexible , awkward miserabilist .
Your blog can get you fired , remember .
If you are going to have a Bebo or Hi5 page that is accessible to the public , then the best bet is apparently to project the image of a smiley , outgoing , success - driven , active , sporting , party - hard , go - getting sort of narcissistic dimwit : a miniature celebrity , with friends apparently growing out of every crevice .
Employers love that shit .
But this is a serious investment both in terms of the upfront costs and the risk of exposing the company to possibly steep fines .
Think about how much profit they must have anticipated conserving just by keeping out ' troublemakers ' .

' Copwatch ' activist catches Chicago officer roughing up bus passenger David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday February 19 , 2009
Print This Email This Chicago 's Independent Police Review Authority is investigating a confrontation between a police officer and bus passenger after video of the incident was posted on the Internet by the co-founder of the city 's chapter of ' Copwatch , ' an activist network that observes police activity and reports abuses of power .
The video , captured Feb. 13 at 10:14 p.m. , " shows Chicago police officer # 10677 apprehending a citizen and violating his rights , " wrote Spencer Thayer , who co-founded Chicago Copwatch .
" The citizen was displaying signs of intoxication and was accused of not paying his fare , but the officer neglected to follow CPD protocol during the encounter , which led to a violent altercation .
The code requires officers to wait for back - up before engaging in a physical struggle with a citizen during non-emergency situations . "
" The CTA said the driver of the bus called police for assistance after the passenger refused to pay his fare , " reported MSNBC .
" It seemed like the officer was escalating the situation more than the suspect , " Thayer told the network .
" On the video , the passenger appears to resist arrest by refusing to leave and later by appearing to physically rebuff the officer , " reported the Chicago Tribune .
" The officer can be heard using profanity as he orders the passenger from bus .
Their confrontation escalates into a physical struggle after the passenger , later identified as 49 - year - old Lorenzo Wiley of Chicago , refuses to get off .
" Wiley was charged with misdemeanor theft of services for not paying . "
In the video , after the man refuses to get off the bus , the officer confronting him appears to strike the man and begins swearing profusely .
Several people moved away from the confrontation before law enforcement backup arrived .
" The officer 's body was partly blocking the view from Thayer 's camera , but the cop started to repeat , ' You want to fight me ? ' as they struggled , " said the Tribune .
" ' Get off this [ expletive ] bus right now ! ' he shouted as he knocked the man against the window again . "
At the end of the clip , Thayer can be heard asking for the officer 's badge number .
" You got a problem ? " he 's asked as the video cuts out .
Thayer 's ' Copwatch ' chapter is one of a network across the United States .
Members of the organization observe police activity and report abuses to the group 's online public database .

[ Haskell - cafe ] Google Summer of Code student application deadline approaches
Hi , The Summer of Code student application deadline is April 3rd and we need more applications !
If you have an idea that you would like to hack on this summer hurry up and apply .
Here 's an idea that could be implemented in a summer : A Sawzal [ 1 ] l like library that processes large volumes of data using monoids to compute aggregate statistics .
Foldable makes this possible for smaller data sets than can fit in memory but many interesting data sets are tens or hundreds of gigabytes in size .
A simple API with a high performance implementation would make Haskell a nice data analysis tool .
Here 's a strawman interface for such a library : -- | Given a file of log records compute aggregate statistics by converting each record -- to a monoid @m@ and combine the resulting monoids using ' mappend ' .
fold :: ( Record r , Monoid m ) => ( r -> m ) -> FilePath -> IO m
There are lots of interesting optimizations that could be done .
Starting with an efficient single threaded implementation using ByteString you could add the ability to either process many files in parallel or splitting one file into many chunks and process each chunk in parallel .
The Wide Finder 2 [ 2 ] challenge has a fast Ocaml implementation of the latter strategy .
One could take the library further by running the processing on multiple machines like in the Google Sawzall implementation .

In this 2008 feature for Freedom , published shortly after the first major bank bailout as the recession began to bite , Iain McKay explains the cost of believing big business
With the financial markets in a panic , the calls for bailouts have increased – and the bank of England has responded with a huge rates cut , while Brown has underwritten banks to the tune of billions .
Yet this seems to directly contradict one of the key defences of capitalism and its tendency to produce profits for the few - namely that such inequality is the result of “ risk taking . ”
For capitalists , taking profit from others ’ labour is fair because as owners they took a gamble in providing startup cash .
According to capitalist theory , those who take the risks should pay the price .
Yet , when push comes to shove , the socialisation of risk – where society pays for failures either through state aid , consumer losses or through attacks on social institutions like pensions - is always there .
This is because , it is claimed , the impact of letting huge institutions – like banks - fail would harm everyone .
Strangely , though , during the good times the impact of inequality was ignored .
If the few benefit the many can go hang ; if the few are threatened , then the many must pay .
This is something capitalism is built on , not some kind of unusual event only applicable in bad times .
Most kinds of " risks " within capitalism do not contribute to production and , thanks to state aid , not that risky .
Appeals to “ risk ” to justify capitalism are somewhat misleading given the dominant organisational form within it – the corporation .
These firms are based on “ limited liability partnerships ” designed explicitly to reduce the risk faced by investors .
As Joel Bakan explains , before the introduction of LLPs : “ no matter how much , or how little , a person had invested in a company , he or she was personally liable , without limit , for the company 's debts .
Investors ' homes , savings , and other personal assess would be exposed to claims by creditors if a company failed , meaning that a person risked finance ruin simply by owning shares in a company .
“ Stockholding could not become a truly attractive option ... until that risk was removed , which it soon was .
By the middle of the nineteenth century , business leaders and politicians broadly advocated changing the law to limit the liability of shareholders to the amounts they had invested in a company .
If a person bought $ 100 worth of shares , they reasoned , he or she should be immune to liability for anything beyond that , regardless of what happened to the company . ”
“ Limited liability 's “ sole purpose ... is to shield them from legal responsibility for corporations ' actions ” as well as reducing the risks of investing ( unlike for small businesses ) .
( The Corporation , p. 11 and p. 79 )
This means stock holders ( investors ) in a corporation hold no liability for the corporation 's debts and obligations .
It is , in effect , a state granted privilege to trade with a limited chance of loss but with an unlimited chance of gain .
This is an interesting double - standard .
It suggests that corporations are not , in fact , owned by shareholders at all since they take on none of the responsibility of ownership , especially the responsibility to pay back debts .
Why should they have the privilege of getting profit during good times when they take none of the responsibility during bad times ?
Corporations are creatures of government , created with the social privileges of limited financial liability of shareholders .
Since their debts are ultimately public , why should their profits be private ?
This reducing of risk is not limited to individual states , it is applied internationally as well .
Big banks and corporations lend money to developing nations but “ the people who borrowed the money ( i.e. the local elite ) are n’t held responsible for it .
It ’s the people ... who have to pay ( the debts ) off ...
The lenders are protected from risk .
That 's one of the main functions of the IMF , to provide risk free insurance to people who lend and invest in risky loans .
They earn high yields because there 's a lot of risk , but they do n't have to take the risk , because it 's socialised . ”
( Noam Chomsky , Propaganda and the Public Mind , p. 125 )
Capitalism has developed precisely by externalising risk and placing the burden onto other parties - suppliers , creditors , workers and , ultimately , society as a whole .
To then turn round and justify corporate profits in terms of risk seems to be hypocritical in the extreme , particularly by appealing to examples of small business people whom usually face the burdens caused by corporate externalising of risk .
Doug Henwood further notes in this context that the “ signals emitted by the stock market are either irrelevant or harmful to real economic activity , and that the stock market itself counts for little or nothing as a source of finance ” , making the argument for risk as a defence of profits seem extremely weak .
( Wall Street , p. 293 and p. 292 )
As David Schweickart points out , “ [ i ] n the vast majority of cases , when you buy stock , you give your money not to the company but to another private individual .
You buy your share of stock from someone who is cashing in his share .
Not a nickel of your money goes to the company itself .
The company 's profits would have been exactly the same , with or without your stock purchase . ”
( After Capitalism , p. 37 )
“ In spite of the stock market 's large symbolic value , it is notorious that it has relatively little to do with the production of goods and services , ” notes David Ellerman .
“ The overwhelming bulk of stock transactions are in second - hand shares so the capital paid for shares usually goes to other stock traders , not to productive enterprises issuing new shares . ”
( The Democratic worker - owned firm , p. 199 )
In other words , most investment is simply the “ risk ” associated with buying a potential income stream in an uncertain world .
The buyer 's action has not contributed to producing that income stream in any way whatsoever yet it results in a claim on the labour of others .
New wealth flows from production , the use of labour on existing wealth to create new wealth .
In fact , the stock market ( and the risk it is based on ) harms this process .
The notion that dividends represent the return for “ risk ” may be faulted by looking at how the markets operate in reality , rather than in theory .
Stock markets react to recent movements in the price of stock markets , causing price movements to build upon price movements .
According to academic finance economist Bob Haugen , this results in inherently unstable finance markets , with such price - driven volatility accounting for over three - quarters of the spikes and dips reported .
This leads to the market directing investments very badly as some investment is wasted in over - valued companies and under - valued firms cannot get finance to produce useful goods .
The market 's volatility reduces the overall level of investment as investors will only fund projects with a sufficiently high level of return .
This results in a serious drag on economic growth .
As such , “ risk ” has a large and negative impact on the real economy and it seems ironic to reward such behaviour .
Given that the capitalists ( or their hired managers ) have a monopoly of decision both as buyers on the market through their superior information and buying power , and within firms , any risks made by a company reflects that hierarchy .
As such , risk and the ability to take risks are monopolised in a few hands .
If profit is the product of risk then , ultimately , it is the product of a hierarchical company structure and , consequently , capitalists are simply rewarding themselves because they have power within the workplace .
In other words , because managers monopolise decision making ( “ risk ” ) they also monopolise the surplus value produced by workers .
However , the former in no way justifies this appropriation nor does it create it .
As production is inherently collective under capitalism , so must be the risk .
As Proudhon put it , it may be argued that the capitalist “ alone runs the risk of the enterprise ” but this ignores the fact that capitalist cannot “ alone work a mine or run a railroad ” nor “ alone carry on a factory , sail a ship , play a tragedy , build the Pantheon . ”
As production is collective , so is the risk faced and , consequently , risk cannot be used to justify excluding people from controlling their own working lives or the fruit of their labour .
The most serious consequences of “ risk ” are usually suffered by working people who can lose their jobs , health and even lives all depending on how the risks of the wealthy turn out in an uncertain world .
As such , it is one thing to gamble your own income on a risky decision but quite another when that decision can ruin the lives of others .
With the panics in the finance markets , now is an ideal time for anarchists to argue that running an economy based on allowing the few to control , gamble and profit from the labour of the many is not only immoral , it does not work .
We need a society which is not based on bribing the rich to ensure investment and economic development .
We need , as anarchists have long argued , an economy in which those who do the work control both it and its product .
Citing a “ plugged - in industry executive ” , Business Insider is reporting that Hulu is working on a “ badass ” iPhone app that will work on both 3G and WiFi networks .
If true , a Hulu app would certainly be a huge hit on the iTunes App Store .
Interestingly , Hulu competes directly with iTunes as it offers an impressive number of TV Shows , and to a lesser extent movies , that would otherwise cost a few bucks to obtain via iTunes .
A Hulu app on the iPhone would therefore almost certainly eat into some of Apple ’s iTunes sales , but it ’s important to remember that Apple barely breaks above even when it comes to iTunes .
It ’s real money maker comes via hardware sales .
In that regard , if a Hulu app can make the iPhone and iPod Touch that much more appealing for interested consumers , I ’m sure Apple would gladly sell you a $ 399 iPod Touch in exchange for a little less of your money on iTunes .
This mythical Hulu app is rumored to be coming soon .
And so the wait begins …
The Conficker worm , which was set to run riot on 1 April , has begun stirring .
According to antivirus and internet content security firm Trend Micro , the worm , which is said to have infected millions of computers worldwide and could cause havoc on the internet if activated , has started to download a data package .
Trend Micro believes the data , downloaded via P2P , may contain information for a widespread attack .
Spam , spam , spam
" Last night we saw a new file in the Windows Temp folder .
Checking on the file properties reveals that the file was created exactly on 7 April , 2009 at 07:41:21 , " said Trend Micro 's Ivan Macalintal .
If the Conficker worm does become active and your computer is infected , then it could steal sensitive data from your machine , remotely control your PC and effectively turn your computer into a spam - bot .
Microsoft is keeping its Windows website updated with information about Conficker , and has posted information on how to rid your machine of the worm .

After spending a lot of time in Scheme , it ’s hard not to think in recursion from time to time .
When I recently started to improve my Python skills , I missed having Scheme optimize my tail recursive calls .
For example , consider the mutually recursive functions even and odd .
You know a number , n , is even if it is 0 , or if n – 1 is odd .
Similarly , you know a number is not odd if it is 0 , and that it is odd if n – 1 is even .
This translates to the python code :
def even ( x ) : if x == 0 : return True else : return odd(x - 1 ) def odd( x ) : if x == 0 : return False else : return even( x - 1 )
This code works , but only for x < 1000 , because Python limits the recursion depth to 1000 .
As it turns out , it is easy to get around this limitation .
Included below is a generic tail_rec function that could be used for most cases where you need tail recursion , and an example of it used for the odd / even problem .
def tail_rec ( fun ) : def tail ( fun ) : a = fun while callable ( a ) : a = a ( ) return a return ( lambda x : tail ( fun ( x ) ) ) def tail_even ( x ) : if x == 0 : return True else : return ( lambda : tail_odd ( x - 1 ) ) def tail_odd ( x ) : if x == 0 : return False else : return ( lambda : tail_even ( x - 1 ) ) even = tail_rec( tail_even ) odd = tail_rec( tail_odd )
It ’s not as pretty as the Scheme version , but it does the trick .
Of course , the odd / even functions are just for the sake of a simple example and have no real - world use , but the tail_rec function could be used in practice .

Google Tasks , a Standalone App
Google Tasks is a standalone application by Google that is similar to the Gmail tasks widget .
However , I ’m not sure it ’s ever intended to be officially released ; right now , when you open the app ’s FAQ , you ’ll see the note :
CONFIDENTIAL :
This document is confidential .
It contains sensitive information and is protected by the terms of your Trusted Tester NDA .
Trusted Tester ’s check Google ’s products before they officially appear , but Google Tasks is public when I try and I ’m not a Trusted Tester .
As it is , be aware that if it ’s not official yet , it may disappear and so may certain data you enter into it .
Tips pop up and can be browsed through in Google Tasks
What does Google Tasks do ?
According to the FAQ , which was “ Last updated : May 13 , 2008 ” and predates the Gmail widget , Tasks “ is a brand new Google product designed to help you keep track of the things you need to do . ”
Similar to the widget , which you can opt- in in Gmail by choosing Settings -> Labs ->
Tasks , you can add new todo list items like “ buy oranges ” or “ repair computer ” , or anything else you want .
Tasks can be nested .
Once a task is done , you can add a check mark and it will appear with a strike - through .
You can also delete a task by repeatedly hitting the back button ( not the most optimal interface design if no other ways are offered , as that functionality can be easy to miss ) .
A deadline for a task can be picked via a calendar widget .
The FAQ
Note in this standalone app , multiple lists can be added and then managed via a select box at the top .
The default list is the only one that ca n’t be deleted , and it will also be the single one shared in your Gmail account or the iGoogle gadget .
As far as I can tell , multiple lists are only available in the standalone app .
Some more details from Google ’s FAQ :
Q : How many lists should I have ?
A : You can create as many lists as you need to organize your information .
( Of course , if you create too many , you may need another just to keep track of them . )
Q : Will Tasks perform the actions on my lists ?
A : Unfortunately , no .
Tasks will help track things that you need to do , but ca n’t accomplish corporeal tasks on its own .
Yet .

POWER PACHYDERMS
Membership : Electralux , Mammoth , Rumbo , Trunklops
Purpose : " To oppose evil wherever ( they ) may find it "
Affiliations : ( formerly ) The Perfect Masters
Enemies : Clarinetto ; The New Musicians ; The Perfect Masters
Base of Operations : Power Pachyderms Headquarters ( aka HMS Peanut IV ) , New York harbor , Earth - Power Pachyderms
First Appearance : Power Pachyderms #1 ( September 1989 )
History : ( Power Pachyderms # 1 ( fb ) ) -
While a circus train traveled through the southwestern desert , an ape disengaged the last car , containing a group of elephants , and it took another course on the tracks .
The train car then glided through an area where a gamma bomb was set to explode .
The now - irradiated train car , with elephants in tow , continued to glide until it met back up with the rest of train and bumped into it , reattaching itself .
Several months later , the four elephants on board all gave birth to anthropomorphic elephants .
After the circus went out of business , the four children elephants went their separate ways .
Mammoth traveled to Asia , where he was robbed , Electrolux went to live with a Greek family and worked in their café , Trunklops ended up in an orphanage , and Rumbo found his way to Canada , where he was attacked and left with retractable adamantium tusks by " a friend . "
( Power Pachyderms # 1 ) - Rumbo and Electralux met again years later when she was searching for the Perfect Masters , who she believed offered enlightenment .
The Masters told the two that there were still two more like them in the world , and that it was their mission as a team to fight evil .
They traveled to Hong Kong , where they found Mammoth living on the ship HMS Peanut IV , and then recruited Trunklops .
Using the wealth Mammoth had found in a treasure chest , they relocated the boat to New York and converted it into a state - of - the - art headquarters .
Using their computer system , Cerebella , they tracked down their first adversary , Clarinetto , and battled him and his students , the New Musicians .
During the fight , Electralux was dumped into a vat of radioactive material , where she mutated into Rogue Elephant .
She was returned to normal after Trunklops blasted her with his powers .
Realizing that fighting evil was a stupid thing that could have got them killed , the Pachyderms went back to the Perfect Masters and disposed of them , taking their place as the new Perfect Masters .
Comments : Created by Tom Defalco , Adam Blaustein and Jon Dagostino
The Pachyderms were as much a parody of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they were of the X - Men , showing how things come full circle ( The Turtles themselves were parodies of the X - Men ) .
Their origin is a spoof on the Hulk , including evil Russians setting off the bomb , and a Banner - like figure trying to save the elephants , but getting flash - fried instead of gaining super - powers .
Why an Elektra parody was included instead of Jean Grey is a mystery to me , maybe they just liked the outfit .
It s also interesting to note she felt an attraction to Mammoth , instead of Rumbo or Trunklops , the Wolverine and Cyclops parodies .

Artist 's impression of how HMS Victory may have looked
The wreck of a ship which has been found off the Channel Islands has been confirmed as the warship HMS Victory , which sank in 1744 .
More than 1,000 sailors drowned when the British warship , the predecessor to Lord Nelson 's Victory , sank in a storm .
The wreck , which could contain more than $ 1bn of gold , was discovered at the bottom of the English Channel by Odyssey Marine Exploration in May .
It was found 100 km from where it was thought to have sunk near Alderney .
Although the remains of HMS Victory were found in international waters , as a military wreck , any gold recovered will be the property of the UK government .
A piece of my family history and of national history has come alive
Sir Robert Balchin
Greg Stemm , chief executive officer of Florida - based Odyssey Marine Exploration , said the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) had given the company permission to go back down to the wreck to try to find the treasure .
He said he was in negotiations and would expect to be rewarded for the find .
" The money is not as important as the cultural and historical significance of the discovery , " Mr Stemm said .
" It is a monumental event , not only for Odyssey but for the world .
It is probably the most significant shipwreck find to date .
" HMS Victory was the mightiest vessel of the 18th Century and the eclectic mix of guns we found on the site will prove essential in further refining our understanding of naval weaponry used during the era . "
The cannons are being guarded at a secret location Speaking at a press conference in London , Mr Stemm said the wreck had been identified as HMS Victory when he raised two extremely rare bronze cannon , measuring 12ft ( 3.6 m ) and weighing four tonnes , which could only have belonged to the British man - of - war .
The MoD is guarding the cannons at a secret location , and 39 more guns have been identified on the sea bed , making it the largest collection in the world .
The discovery of HMS Victory exonerates Admiral Sir John Balchin , who came out of retirement to command the ship , on what was meant to be his final voyage .
Historians believed the ship was lost due to poor navigation on the Casquets , a group of rocks north - west of Alderney .
But the wreck 's location , 62 miles ( 100 km ) away from the rocks , suggests the 74 - year - old admiral was not to blame .
His descendant Sir Robert Balchin said : " A piece of my family history and of national history has come alive .
" As a family we have always been proud of Sir John but this confirms what a fantastic admiral he was . "
Georgian artefacts
Part of a skeleton , including a skull , a wooden rudder , remains of the ship 's hull , an iron ballast , two anchors , a copper kettle and rigging have been spotted on the sea bed .
Only the cannon , marked with the crest of King George I , have been recovered so far , but millions of artefacts are expected to be found , shedding light on what life was like in the Georgian Navy .
Mr Stemm said he hoped to return to the site as soon as possible , because marine life and trawler movements are slowly destroying it .
Odyssey Marine Exploration 's find was filmed for the Discovery Channel .
Treasure Quest ; Victory Special will be shown at 2100 GMT on 8 February .

I 'm going to say a little critique and I hope you know I 'm not hating on you < 3 .
I know this is unwarranted , but you got so much potential and so I wanted to share my thoughts :
Coloring is a very specific kind of artform within comics because you are n't just filling in blank areas , you are intentionally bringing attention to a specific area or areas .
In your colors the glare off of the claws detract from the focus of the character itself and the " rage " or " anger " in the eyes / face .
While the technique side of your coloring is good ( cast shadows and what not ) , the color choices / values have flattened the image out .
There is n't enough contrast in color choices or values and that 's how the image has been flattened .
I disagree with some of the earlier people in your comments in that you have created depth ( which I see that you blurred the background ) .
But lightsourcing and value changes in color pallette can accomplish this better without losing the linework .
However , like I said , the modeling it kickass .
I say the critique above with hopes that you will take it well , and that you can improve your craft .
( CNN ) --
Here 's yet another reason to stay in shape :
Thinner people contribute less to global warming , according to a new study .
More than 1 billion adults worldwide are overweight , and about 300 million are obese .
Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published a study showing that , because of food production and transportation factors , a population of heavier people contributes more harmful gases to the planet than a population of thin people .
Given that it takes more energy to move heavier people , transportation of heavier people requires more fuel , which creates more greenhouse gas emissions , the authors write .
" The main message is staying thin .
It 's good for you , and it 's good for the planet , " said Phil Edwards , senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
The study offers this novel approach to the global warming problem as U.S. lawmakers discuss the future of climate change legislation .
This week , the the House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin on a comprehensive energy and climate bill .
On Friday , the Environmental Protection Agency announced that six greenhouse gases pose potential health hazards , an announcement that could prompt the regulation of the gases .
More than 1 billion adults worldwide are overweight , and about 300 million are obese , the study said .
Generally , the body mass index , a measure of obesity , is increasing in most countries worldwide , from China to European countries to the United States .
BMI is going up because of the availability of food and motorized transportation , Edwards said .
People are less active now than they were 30 years ago , and the prevalence of fast food has given people less healthy , more energy - dense options .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Obesity
Using statistical models , the authors compared the distribution of BMI in the United Kingdom in the 1970s -- when 3.5 percent of the population was obese -- with a prediction for the country 's BMI distribution in 2010 , reflecting 40 percent obesity .
" In terms of environmental impact , the lean population has a much smaller carbon footprint , " Edwards said .
The population with 40 percent obese people requires 19 percent more food energy for its total energy expenditure than the population with 3.5 percent obese people , the study showed .
This 19 percent increase in food consumption translates into an increase of 270 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions , the study said .
" The findings make sense and highlight an important global co-benefit of losing weight , along with the significant personal health benefits , " said Patrick Kinney , associate professor at Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health , who was not involved in the study .
In terms of obesity rate , the U.S. population is not far off from the overweight population model in this study .
The country has 33.3 percent obese people , according to the Mayo Clinic .
The study suggests that governments have a responsibility to encourage people to be more physically active , Edwards said .
Active transportation , such as cycling and walking , helps maintain a healthy weight but requires safe streets , he said .
" If the government wants to promote active transport , which would be good for the environment and for individual health , it needs to make the environment safe to do that , " he said .
Although climate change has come into the forefront as a major world problem recently , this is not the first time scholars have thought about the connection between fossil fuel and body fat .
In 1978 , a year the United States experienced an oil shock , a study in the American Journal of Public Health showed that if all overweight people in the country aged 18 to 79 reached their optimal weight , the resulting energy savings would equal 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline .
After the dieting period , about 750 million gallons of gasoline would be saved every year , said the authors , Bruce Hannon , professor at the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , and Timothy Lohman , now professor emeritus at the University of Arizona .
Today , research has shown that the obesity epidemic costs the United States about $ 100 billion a year , said Dr. Martin Donohoe of Portland State University , who runs the Web site Public Health and Social Justice .
In terms of energy expenditure , the average food product travels 1,500 miles to get to your table , he said .
Some measures to curb obesity include making healthier meals available in schools , putting nutritional information on food packages and menus , and banning trans fats , he said .

With a 312 vote victory for the Democrat , and nothing left to count , the corporate media continue to misreport the facts of the U.S. Senate election in Minnesota ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 4/9/2009 , 5:45 pm PT
Guest Blogged by Ernest A. Canning , with Brad Friedman
In his March 31st article at Media Matters , Eric Boehlert contrasted the difference in corporate media coverage between Florida 's 2000 Presidential election contest and Minnesota 's 2008 U.S. Senate election contest .
" Norm Coleman 's a sore loser , " Boehlert argued , and asked " Why wo n't the press say so ? "
He details the striking difference in the corporate media coverage of the two races , where Florida 2000 was both much closer and , as it would determine the Presidency of the United States , arguably more ' important ' to get right , and yet the constant media framing continuously painted Al Gore as a " sore loser " for not bowing out ' gracefully ' or ' admitting defeat ' in the days following the razor - thin election ( which , as we would learn later , Gore had actually won , having received more votes across the state of Florida [ PDF ] than George W. Bush , had the U.S. Supreme Court not kept the ballots from actually being counted ) .
But to go one further than Boehlert , we 'd ask not why the media fail to describe Coleman as a " sore loser , " but rather , why it is that --- particularly since Tuesday 's final count of any remaining , lawfully cast , previously uncounted absentee ballots --- the media fail to describe Coleman as the loser at all , much less a sore one .
From the New York Times to AP to MSNBC , and even Democracy Now !
et al , despite all countable ballots having now been counted , and clear rulings having been issued by both the MN Supreme Court and the bipartisan three - judge panel overseeing the contest , the media seem to have developed an aversion to using the " L " word --- loser --- in their coverage of the MN contest .
Perhaps it 's because they 're listening to only one side of the argument ( Coleman's ) , but the facts of the case , and the many clear court decisions , leave no question that Franken is the winner , and Coleman is the loser .
So why wo n't they say so ?...
It 's Not a ' Lead ' , It 's a ' Win '
Yesterday , The New Times reported " On Tuesday , after a seven - week case brought by Mr. Coleman and the counting of 351 absentee ballots that had been wrongly rejected , Mr. Franken 's lead grew by 87 votes , to 312 votes . "
They also reported that " some issues remain to be decided " by the three - judge panel overseeing Coleman 's Election Contest against Franken .
During her Apr. 8 , 2009 interview of Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , Rachel Maddow compounded the Times ' misreporting , by declaring that votes are " still being added , " and that Al Franken was " ahead by 312 votes . "
Both the Times and MSNBC got it wrong .
Votes are not " still being added " and there are no issues still remaining before the three - judge panel .
In both the March 31 , 2009 , order [ PDF ] , directing that 400 unopened absentee ballots be delivered to the court by Apr. 6 , 2009 , and in its Apr. 7 , 2009 , order [ PDF ] directing that 351 ballots be opened and counted , the three - judge panel stated that " any relief not fully set forth herein is denied . "
Other such " relief " would include Coleman 's dubious double - count claim , which had been based on the speculative testimony of a single , thoroughly discredited , partisan witness .
It is probable that the three - judge panel will provide a written explanation of its denial of any other relief , as already stated , when it enters a final judgment .
That could come any day now .
Coleman 's time to file an appeal will not commence until the final judgment is entered .
But make no mistake .
There are no more votes to be counted .
312 votes is the margin of victory for Al Franken over Norm Coleman .
No More Ballots Still to be Counted
Another misconception should be dispelled .
As Pawlenty noted during the Apr. 8th interview with Maddow , the Governor cannot sign a certification until after Coleman either fails to timely appeal or the MN Supreme Court denies the appeal .
In the interview , Pawlenty alluded to Coleman attorney Ben Ginsberg 's equal protection argument , and was evasive on whether he would delay certification if Coleman filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court .
Pawlenty also questioned the validity of a decision issued last December , in which the MN Supreme Court refused to permit the opening and counting of erroneously rejected absentee ballots unless local officials , the Sec. of State and both candidates agreed .
Pawlenty expressed the view that the U.S. Supreme Court might want to look at the question of whether the rights of voters to have their ballots counted is denied when it is dependent on the agreement of the candidates .
While the MN Supremes decision may have been a dubious one , Pawlenty 's erroneous observations underscore why accurate media coverage is so vital .
Any of those lawfully cast ballots not counted last December have now , finally , been counted .
That 's a point that Pawlenty might not have been able to mislead viewers about , had the corporate media done its job in accurately explaining what has gone on , rather than relying on one side 's partisan --- and misleading --- talking points to drive their coverage .
The press has focused on that expedited December 2008 MN Supreme Court decision , which , while rejecting Coleman 's effort ( back when he felt he was winning ) to keep erroneously rejected absentee ballots from being opened and counted , permitted officials to do so only where officials and the candidates agreed .
The press has also focused on the state Supreme Court 's rejection of Franken 's request for immediate certification in Franken v Pawlenty .
But the Court's Mar. 6 , 2009 , opinion [ PDF ] in Coleman v. Ritchie has received scant attention .
In that ruling , the state Supreme Court , over a single dissenter , explained its December 2008 ruling .
MN statutes , the Court ruled , prevent the local canvassing boards from opening erroneously rejected absentee ballots during a post election hand - count unless both candidates agree .
However , those ballots may be examined for possible opening and counting after evidence is examined by a three - judge electon contest panel charged with correcting any such errors .
That has already happened .
Assuming Pawlenty 's insinuation --- that the MN Supremes erred in their ruling specifying the conditions under which such incorrectly rejected absentee ballots could be opened and counted during a post-election hand - count --- that error was remedied when both sides were provided a full and fair opportunity to request the opening and counting of any such unopened ballots during the seven week contest trial .
Tuesday 's ruling by the three - judge panel amounted to a judicial determination that there were precisely 351 previously unopened , lawfully cast absentee ballots that were erroneously rejected .
They were opened , counted , added to the results .
End of story .
Or at least it should be , if the corporate media were bothering to pay attention .
Equal Protection Argument Similarly ' Dead in its Tracks '
And while there are no more ballots to be opened and counted , there are similarly no " equal protection " arguments with a legal leg to stand on --- a fact which is apparent , again , if one bothers to examine the legal decisions that have been made in the several MN cases over the last few months .
In the Coleman v Ritchie decision , the Court recited the four , clear conditions , under MN law , which must be satisfied before an absentee ballot envelope can be opened and the ballot counted :
(1 ) the voter 's name and address on the return envelope are the same as the information provided on the absentee ballot application ;
( 2 ) the voter 's signature on the return envelope is the genuine signature of the individual who made the application for the absentee ballot , and the certificate of eligibility to vote by absentee ballot has been completed as prescribed in the directions for casting an absentee ballot ;
(3 ) the voter is registered and eligible to vote in the precinct or has included a properly completed voter registration application in the return envelope ; and
( 4 ) the voter has not already voted , either in person or by absentee ballot .
On Feb. 13 , 2009 , the three - judge contest court rejected [ PDF ]
Coleman 's argument that unopened absentee ballots could be reviewed en masse simply by placing them under the various categories of erroneous rejection .
The only method for a correct application of the above - listed , very specific standards , the court determined , is by examining each ballot and voter registration status individually .
It was this key ruling that led Coleman attorney Ben Ginsberg to claim that Minnesota 's electoral system was " fatally flawed " because , he argued to the media , the standards had not been uniformly applied at the local level ; that this lack of uniformity deprived Coleman of equal protection under the law .
But because absentee ballots already counted have long since been separated from the return envelopes , Ginsberg 's " fatally flawed " argument , if it were otherwise valid , would nullify the November 2008 election , forcing a second election .
It also might nullify every other contest on the ballot , and just about every other race in the nation , for that matter .
We previously referenced Franken 's argument that imperfect application of these clearly delineated standards by local election officials does not amount to a " constitutional violation . "
In Coleman v Ritchie the Minnesota Supreme Court , quoting a prior decision , agreed .
They stated :
" As long as there is substantial compliance with our laws and no showing of fraud or bad faith , the true result of an election , once ascertained , ought not be defeated by an innocent failure to comply strictly with the statute . "
In The BRAD BLOG's Feb. 22 , 2009 , coverage , the claim was made that Coleman 's election contest was " dead in its tracks " and the view was expressed that team Coleman simply " plods on , delaying the seating of a U.S. Senator at a time when every vote has become essential to the new administration 's efforts to bring this nation back from the edge of an economic abyss . "
Nothing that has transpired since the publication of that article warrants an alteration of that opinion ... no matter what the corporate media may report --- or , in this case , fail to report .

March 21 , 2009 --
“ This government is here to protect the people , not the bourgeoisie or the rich ” , proclaimed Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on February 28 , as he ordered soldiers to take over two rice - processing plants owned by Venezuelan food and drink giant Empresas Polar .
The move was made in order to ensure that the company was producing products subjected to the government - imposed price controls that aim to protect the poor from the affects of global price rises and inflation .
Under Venezuelan law , companies that can produce basic goods regulated by price controls must guarantee that 70 - 95 % of their products are of the regulated type .
“ They ’ve refused 100 times to process the typical rice that Venezuelans eat ” , said Chavez .
“ If they do n’t take me seriously , I ’ll expropriate the plants and turn them into social property . ”
Four days later , Chavez announced the expropriation of a rice - processing plant owned by US food giant Cargill after it was revealed the company was attempting to subvert the price controls .
Moving against capital
In the following period , “ Venezuela ’s National Institute of Lands ( INTI ) [ took ] public ownership of more than 5000 hectares of land claimed by wealthy families and multi-national corporations and is reviewing tens of thousands more hectares across the nation ” , Venezuelanalysis.com reported on March 11 .
This includes the March 5 expropriation of 1500 hectares of a tree farm owned by Ireland ’s Smurfit Kappa .
The government has pledged to move away from eucalyptus trees , which were drying up the land , and turn the land over to cooperatives for sustainable agriculture .
On March 14 , Chavez decreed a new fishing law , banning industrial trawl - fishing within Venezuela ’s territorial waters .
“ Trawling fishing destroys the sea , destroys marine species and benefits a minority .
This is destructive capitalism ” , explained Chavez on his weekly TV show , Alo Presidente the following day .
Venezuelanalysis.com reported on March 17 that the government will invest US $ 32 million to convert or decommission trawling boats , as well as to development fish - processing plants .
“ Thirty trawling ships will be expropriated , Chavez said , due to the refusal of their owners to cooperate with the plans to adapt the boats to uses compliant with the new fishing regulations . ”
Small - scale fisherpeople will have access to the converted boats .
Anti-crisis measures
This latest wave of radical measures by the Chavez government should be seen in the context of the ongoing process of nationalisations since early 2006 , the onset of the global economic and food crises and the February 15 referendum victory .
The government has re-nationalised privatised industries such as electricity , telecommunications and steel .
Cement companies , milk producing factories and one of Venezuela ’s major banks have either been , ore are in negotiations to be , nationalised .
Unlike the state interventions currently being undertaken in the imperialist centres , the aim of these moves is not to bail out bankrupt capitalists , but to help shift production towards meeting people ’s needs — in service provisions ( phone lines , electricity , banking ) and production of essential goods ( concrete , steel for housing and factories , and food ) .
Last July , the government made strong signals that its next targets would be two strategic sectors previously barely touched — food and finance .
The day after announcing the planned government buyout of Banco de Venezuela ( which , once completed , will give the government control over close to 20 % of the banking sector ) , Chavez issued 26 decrees , a number of which increase government and community control over food storage and distribution — and allow the state to jail company owners for hoarding .
Moves aimed at increasing government control over food production come amid soaring world food prices and 30 % inflation within Venezuela — which is still dependent on imports for 70 % of its food supply .
The government also faces an ongoing campaign of food speculation and hoarding carried out by the capitalist food producers and distributors in order to destabilise the anti-capitalist government .
With oil prices plummeting by almost $ 100 per barrel from a high of more than US $ 140 last year , the government is tightening the screws .
Oil accounts for 93 % of the government ’s export revenue and around half of its national budget .
The government has already announced the restructuring of its ministries , merging a number of them in order to cut down on bureaucracy .
The Chavez government is making it very clear that it will be the capitalists , not the people , who will pay for the mess that the capitalist system has created .
“ I have entrusted myself with putting the foot down on the accelerator of the revolution , of the social and economic transformation of Venezuela ” , Chavez explained on March 8 .
Mandate for socialism
These latest moves follow the government ’s victory in the February 15 referendum .
Officially , the referendum concerned whether to amend the constitution and remove limits on the number of times elected officials could stand for re-election .
At stake was the possibility of Chavez standing for re-election in 2012 .
In the context of the intense class struggle , it became a referendum on the socialist project pushed by Chavez .
Addressing tens of thousands of supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace after the victory , Chavez noted that those that had voted “ yes ” had “ voted for socialism , voted for the revolution ” .
The referendum was proposed by Chavez as a “ counter - offensive ” against the opposition following the November 23 regional elections .
Candidates from Chavez ’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) won the overwhelming majority of governorships and mayoralties .
However , opposition victories in key states on the Colombian border ( where there is growing right - wing paramilitary activity ) and the Greater Caracas mayoralty were viewed as important gains for the counter - revolution .
Opposition governors and mayors began to use their new positions to attack community organisations and the pro-poor social missions .
The rapid mobilisation to defeat these attacks by the poor and working people was converted into the formation of 100,000 “ Yes committees ” to campaign in the referendum , in poor communities , workplaces and universities across the country .
These committees were the backbone of the successful referendum campaign .
Organising for revolution
The latest measures will undoubtedly intensify the class conflict in Venezuela .
An example of this conflict has resulted from the government ’s program of land reform , aimed at ending the domination over agriculture by a small minority of large landowners .
Previous attempts by the government to redistribute land have resulted in a violent counter - offensive by large landowners that has resulted in the murder of more than 200 peasants since the land reform law of 2001 .
On March 9 , land reform activist Mauricio Sanchez was murdered in Zulia , two weeks after campesino activist Nelson Lopez was shot dead in Yaracuy .
Increasingly , trade unionists have also been the target of violent repression when struggling for their rights .
On January 29 , two workers at Mitsubishi plant were killed by police during an industrial dispute — sparking protests and the arrest of a number of police .
Several peasant organisations are seeking to unite their forces in support of government measures and against repression .
The PSUV leadership has also called for a restructuring of the party to better organise the masses for the coming battles .
Launched after Chavez ’s 2006 re-election to help accelerate the revolutionary process , the PSUV brought together a range of revolutionary forces as well as opportunist and corrupt layers .
On March 6 , the national leadership of the PSUV made public a series of decisions aimed at deepening participation and democracy in the party .
This includes a recruitment drive to sign up new militants , a clean out of the current membership lists , the reactivation of the grassroots socialist battalions and the organisation of an extraordinary congress for August to deepen discussion over the party ’s program and principles .
Building on the success of the “ yes ” campaign , the PSUV will move to consolidate national mass fronts of workers , peasants , women and students — along with converting the “ yes committees ” into ongoing “ socialist committees ” .

He did it while he was only Senator Obama , but will President Obama openly condemn Canada ’s annual baby seal slaughter ?
Now that it is once again time for the annual seal hunt slaughter in Canada , the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society wants to hold President Obama to Senator Obama ’s words .
In a 2006 letter just published by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , Senator Obama wrote to a concerned family telling them he believed the United States should not condone the annual baby seal slaughter in Canada , and that he would work with his colleagues in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee “ to take the necessary steps to express our outrage with this inhumane measure . ”
Along with the letter , the Sea Shepherds published this today on their website : “ The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is very hopeful that President Barack Obama will act strongly as President to oppose and condemn the annual slaughter of baby seals by Canadian sealers . ”
The Canadian government has set a quota of 338,000 baby seals for the country ’s annual hunt slaughter , an increase of 55,000 from last year .
Hyrulian Crest Tattoo
I finally got my gamer - ness permanently etched into my body .
I was reluctant to call it anything by my " Triforce " tattoo , but after making sure to seek the Reddits for accuracy , I 'm comfortable enough calling it the Hyrulian Crest .
I got this tattoo done at Diablo Rojo , in Austin TX while I was attending SXSW interactive ( more pictures to come ) .
This is my fourth tattoo and I 'm rather fond of it if I do n't say so myself :)
Most of you that read my blog regularly , also know that I 'm the Community Director over at Justin.tv , so I could n't resist getting the entire tattoo broadcasted over Live video .
So below is a clip from my tattooing .
The audio is n't the greatest of quality , but you can pick up some of the conversations ( mostly the tattoo gun ) .

The soldier testified that the " clear " message of literature distributed to troops by the rabbinate was : " We are the Jewish people , we came to this land by a miracle , God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the Gentiles who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land . "
The claim comes in the detailed transcript of a post - war discussion by soldiers , publication of which has triggered a military police inquiry into allegations about the use of lethal firepower against unarmed civilians .
The investigation was ordered by the military 's advocate general Avichai Mandleblit on Thursday after the liberal daily newspaper Haaretz published extracts from the transcript describing incidents in which Palestinian civilians were killed and property wantonly damaged .
In the fuller version of the transcript published yesterday , the soldier , a unit commander from the Givati brigade , says : " This was the main message and the whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war . "
He recalled that his own sergeant was from a hesder yeshiva , a college combining religious study and military service , who led the whole platoon in prayer before going into battle .
The commander added that he had sought to talk to the men about Palestinian politics and society and , " about how not everyone in Gaza is Hamas and not every inhabitant wants to vanquish us " .
After the offensive , Yesh Din , an Israeli human rights group called for the dismissal of the military 's head chaplain , Rabbi Avichai Rontzki , a brigadier general .
It said that he had distributed to troops a booklet saying that it was " terribly immoral " to show mercy to a " cruel enemy " and that the soldiers were fighting " murderers " .
The longer transcript conveys a fuller sense of the debate involving graduates from the Yitzhak Rabin military preparatory course .
At one point Danny Zamir , the head of the course , says he would have questioned the killing of 180 traffic policemen during bombing on the first day of the operation .
One pilot replies : " Tactically speaking you call them police .
In any case they are armed and belong to Hamas ... during better times they take Fatah people and throw them off the roofs and see what happens . "
The latest casualty figures published by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights list the names of 1,434 dead of whom they say 926 were civilians , 236 fighters and 255 police officers .

Advertisement Ireland claimed their first Grand Slam in 61 years in a sensational climax to this year 's Six Nations Championship .
The Irish overturned a 6 - 0 interval deficit with early second - half tries from Brian O'Driscoll and Tommy Bowe .
Stephen Jones kicked his third and fourth penalties and appeared to have won the Triple Crown for Wales with a drop - goal with five minutes remaining .
But Ronan O'Gara 's drop - goal regained the lead with two minutes left , and Jones 's last - gasp penalty fell short .
Wales , from being within two minutes of denying Ireland a Grand Slam , but not their first - ever Six Nations title , suddenly had to come to terms with finishing fourth in the championship .
The hosts , needing to win by 13 points to retain their title , planned to target O'Gara from the off , but skipper Ryan Jones set a bad example with a trip on the fly - half in the first minute .

Ireland lock Donncha O'Callaghan objected to Jones 's actions and a minor tussle between the players earned an early warning from English referee Wayne Barnes , but O'Gara failed with the long - range penalty attempt .
Ireland responded with a Gordon D'Arcy break only for Gavin Henson 's tackle to thwart Luke Fitzgerald , and a testing O'Gara cross - kick that Shane Williams and Lee Byrne failed to deal with .
The immediate pressure on Wales was relieved when Ian Gough 's challenge knocked the ball out of Jerry Flannery 's hands and Henson sent a huge clearance kick downfield .
But when Wales had their first defensive line - out , the hosts were in danger of cracking as Matthew Rees 's throw could not be cleanly gathered and Shane Williams rescued his side , but was forced to concede a five - metre scrum .
Wales held firm in defence , Mark Jones 's tackle on Ireland captain O'Driscoll forcing him to knock - on in a passage of play that led referee Barnes to warn both captains about off - the - ball incidents .
O'Gara kicked the ball out on the full twice , perhaps indicating the early attention Wales paid to him was paying dividends .

After 61 years of waiting , it came down to the last two seconds and the last two metres of the final match of the season
Lock Paul O'Connell led the way as Ireland stole home line - out ball on successive occasions and as both sides belied the occasion to vary their attacking play , that advantage boosted the visitors ' confidence .
The Grand Slam chasers were happy to kick for touch in the belief they could successfully attack Wales ' line - out .
But after Lee Byrne departed with an ankle injury , Henson switching to full - back to accommodate Jamie Roberts , Denis Leamy held on too long in a tackle on Martyn Williams at the back of a line - out and Stephen Jones kicked the 33rd - minute penalty .
Another throw to Williams at the back spelled danger for Wales as the veteran flanker was unable to gather , but Fitzgerald blocked the defence from tackling O'Gara and Jones struck from 49 metres to give Wales a 6 - 0 lead going into the break .
Ireland began the second half with a Bowe burst down the right from O'Driscoll 's pass and an O'Gara cross - kick that Mark Jones made safe , but failed to mark before he stepped into touch .
Ireland celebrate in Cardiff as they win a historic Grand Slam That gave Ireland the platform and territory their forwards craved and after a series of close - quarter drives , O'Driscoll 's good leg strength and body angle was enough for him to claim the score .
French television match official Romain Poite had to make that decision in the 44th minute , but two minutes later Bowe claimed O'Gara 's chip and raced away from the pursuing Shane Williams to score under the posts .
O'Gara converted both tries for a 14 - 6 lead , but Wales were soon back in the hunt .
O'Callaghan 's petulant push on Mike Phillips after the scrum - half had knocked on gave fly - half Jones the chance to hit the mark , which he did via an upright .
A timely O'Driscoll tackle on Tom Shanklin helped thwart a Wales attack and Bowe was denied by a knock - on as he won an aerial joust with Ospreys team - mate Williams .
The other aerial battle , at the line - outs , was also going in Ireland 's direction .
But Irish composure again failed them to allow Jones to kick a fourth penalty .
Wales coach Warren Gatland attempted to solve his side 's line - out issues by sending Luke Charteris on for Gough and Huw Bennett for hooker Matthew Rees ahead of the final quarter .
A rare long - range Gavin Henson penalty attempt fell short after 68 minutes and Ireland brought on Peter Stringer at scrum - half for O'Leary for the final 10 minutes .
And that is when the drama truly unfolded .
For the first time in the game , Wales ' strike runners began to make their mark .
Wing Williams slipped to end one attack , but after Phillips 's thunderous charge through the Welsh defence , Jones dropped the goal that put his side back into the lead .
O'Gara replied moments later after his opposite number kicked out on the full to give Ireland the attacking platform .
Jones had one last chance to redeem the season for Wales , but his effort from just inside the Ireland half fell short and Ireland were at last able to taste Grand Slam champagne .

A man came into my office looking gloomy , exhausted and stressed .
I asked the usual questions about his lifestyle and diet .
He said he slept four to five hours .
His breakfast was bottled orange juice , frozen pancakes with syrup , sometimes eggs if he had the time , and two cups of coffee .
For lunch he usually had a sandwich or a Caesar salad “ with a lot of dressing . ”
A croissant or doughnut with coffee in the afternoon .
He loved pasta for dinner or a juicy steak with potatoes , and then some Oreo cookies and milk while watching TV .
He did not like vegetables other than potatoes , and , as for fruits , only if they had cream and sugar , or were canned with syrup .
Exercise ?
no… there ’s no time for that .
Stress management ?
Relaxation ?
that ’s for wimps .
Last checkup ?
ca n’t remember .
“ Now let me ask some questions about your car , ” I said .
He looked at me like I had just landed from Mars .
“ Let ’s suppose you decide to go on a road trip .
Four hours after you start , you see a red light in your panel saying “ check engine . ”
Would you continue driving for the rest of the trip ? ”
“ Of course not , ” he said , “ I ’d get off the road and look for a mechanic as soon as possible . ”
“ Now imagine that in this town there is a very fancy gas station right across from the mechanic , ” I continued .
” They sell a new gasoline that comes in different colors and smells – designer perfume gas .
You can choose from Armani , Burberry , Fendi , Hugo Voss , etc .
They advertise on TV , in magazines , everywhere , so you ’ve seen the brand many times . ”
He nodded to let me know that he was following so far .
“ You ask the mechanic about it and he tells you that it ’s really poor quality fuel .
Your car will drive , but after a while it will damage the engine .
Would you put that fuel in your car ? ”
“ Of course not , ” he said , a note of indignation in his voice , as if the mere thought of doing that to his car was unacceptable .
Then , after a few seconds , he realized .
“ Yes , ” I said .
“ You will not force your car to drive when something is wrong .
You will stop to fix it even if that causes a small delay in your road trip .
You will only give it quality fuel regardless of the smell , appearance or advertising . ”
He started nodding again .
“ Then why do you put any sort of adulterated , low - quality fuel in your body ?
Is it just because it ’s easy and tastes good ?
Why do you force your body to keep going when it is telling you something needs attention ? ”
All my questions he left unanswered .
I needed to be explicit .
“ If your car breaks down , ” I said , “ you can always get a replacement .
Unfortunately , your body is the only vehicle you get for the journey in this lifetime .
If you want a long and pleasurable ride , you ’d better start taking care of it .
Do unto your body as you do unto your car . ”

When Paula Newland fell behind on her payments in early January on her 2005 Chevy Impala , the last thing she wanted to do is share that information on her Myspace profile .
But that 's exactly what her debt collectors did , the Edwardsburg , Michigan resident charges in a civil lawsuit accusing Assets Recovered and Advanced Equity of violating collections law by harassing her online , on the phone and in person .
And she wants a minimum of $ 25,000 for the alleged violations of Michigan law .
Thanks in part to the post on her Myspace page , Newland suffered " damage to her business and community reputation , extreme mental distress , aggravation , humiliation and embarrassment , " according to her complaint ( .pdf ) filed in Michigan state court on March 23 .
Under most state laws , debt collectors may not publicize a debt or even tell a debtor 's friends , family members or work associates about a debt in order to shame a person into paying .
They also must refrain from using abusive or oppressing methods , and generally have to stop calling one 's home or work after being asked to communicate in writing .

Arsene Wenger claimed yesterday that the state of the Wembley pitch was so bad it could potentially damage the prospects of the England team and asked why the Football Association had spent £ 757 m on a stadium without getting the most basic component right .
In an outspoken attack that echoed Sir Alex Ferguson 's on Sunday , Wenger , whose Arsenal team play Liverpool at Anfield tonight , said that the Wembley pitch was the " worst " in the country and demonstrated a lack of " respect " to the supporters who paid to watch the FA Cup semi-finals .
Wenger said : " If you go to a dentist and he says , ' Listen , I have a tool but it's from the 1950s ' then you go to a dentist with a modern instrument .
Football is the same .
If they try to make you play on a pitch of 20 or 30 years ago then anyone would prefer to play on a new , modern pitch .
If the pitch is not right nothing else matters . "

The dispute over the state of the Wembley pitch has reached the stage where it threatens to overshadow the FA Cup final on 30 May , with the FA having admitted that there is nothing it can do about the state of the surface before then .
The FA said yesterday that it plans to relay the pitch – the fifth new surface it has used since the original was first played upon almost two years ago – before the Community Shield game in August .
The new pitch will not come in time for England 's World Cup qualifier against Andorra on 10 June and Wenger warned that it could have a negative impact on the team .
" Everybody will come to England with their national team and it will handicap the national team , " Wenger said .
" Of course it 's handicapping the national team , because do you think Steven Gerrard , Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney do n't want to play on a good pitch ?
Of course they want to play on a good pitch .
" It 's the worst pitch .
In the Premier League , it 's 21st position , " he added .
" Did you see a good game at Wembley on Sunday ?
You saw a game with very little chances .
Have you seen the Carling Cup final ?
You saw a game with very little chances .
It [ the pitch ] slows the game down and everyone has a chance to come back in the right position because you have to control the ball instead of playing it one - touch and the whole game becomes slower . "
The FA explained yesterday that it has been unable to use the turf favoured by the majority of Premier League clubs including Arsenal – designed by Desso Sports Systems – because the concerts and events staged at Wembley make it incompatible with the stadium .
Desso pitches have a higher artificial content than Wembley 's seeded pitch , but the former take three months to bed in .
With Wembley staging everything from AC / DC concerts to rally car races , there would be no time for a Desso pitch to settle .
Wenger said it was too late now for the FA to alter the design of Wembley to accommodate a better pitch .
" We got it right at the Emirates because we sat down with the architect when we built the stadium and said the first priority was to get the pitch right and the whole design of the stadium was made so the pitch was perfect .
" Before everybody wanted to play at Wembley because the pitch was so special .
Now , nobody wants to play at Wembley because the pitch is bad .
When you spend £ 757 m , I do n't think it 's unreasonable to ask for a good pitch . "
The FA has indicated that the five pitches the stadium has been through so far have been a process of trial and error and that the next one – to be laid after an Oasis concert in July – should be the best yet .
The cost of the stadium means that the business plan involves extra events to fund the borrowing to rebuild it .
However , using Wembley for the " Race of Champions " event in December , which involved laying an asphalt track , was questioned by Ferguson yesterday .
The United manager said : " Someone told me on Saturday that they had had speedway or some form of motorcycling on it .
So , if they are changing the pitch all the time , then it is going to be difficult to bed it down and make it a true pitch .
It looked to me on Saturday heavy and slow and that was the feeling all my players had in yesterday 's game – spongy , dead . "
Ferguson will be less pleased by Wenger 's announcement that Emmanuel Adebayor will be rested for tonight 's Premier League game because he is suffering pain from an old hamstring injury but should be fit to play against United in the Champions League next week .
Adebayor , as well as Robin van Persie , will miss the match because of a recurrence of pain in the tendon .
Turf war Roots of Wembley 's problem surface
The new Wembley Stadium opened on 24 March 2007 and it was not long before the state of the pitch was criticised by players and managers .
The turgid 2007 FA Cup final between Chelsea and Manchester United was blamed on the pitch , while the then England goalkeeper Paul Robinson expressed misgivings over the surface after a friendly with Brazil the following month .
The American football match the stadium hosted that October was notable for the pitch cutting up , leading the Croatia manager , Slaven Bilic , to voice concerns ahead of the European Championship qualifier a month later .
" The pitch is not in the condition that Wembley used to be known for , " he said .
" The top looks soft , but underneath it is hard , so it is very slippery , like ice . "
The high stands of the new stadium do not allow much sunlight on to a pitch which has been relaid five times , most recently in January following December 's " Race of Champions " – an asphalt track was constructed – and a rugby match between Australia and the Barbarians , in which a number of players picked up injuries .
Last weekend 's FA Cup semi-finals followed two England matches and two cup finals in recent weeks , and the stadium 's immediate schedule includes nine football matches – including next month 's FA Cup final – and eight concert dates , before the pitch is relaid on 9 August for the Community Shield .
The Football Association said yesterday : " The grounds team has made continual improvements to the pitch .
Whilst recent changes have seen improvements , we accept further improvements [ need ] to be made . "
The best league in the world is back .

( Reuters ) - IBM is teaming up with Google Inc on a new software to move data from remote personal medical devices into Google Health and other personal health records ( PHRs ) .
Patients will be able to exchange vital health information with their doctors and other health services professionals more easily , and in real - time , by using the IBM software .
“ Once stored in a PHR , the data can also be shared with physicians and other members of the extended care network at a user ’s discretion , ” IBM said in a statement .
Google Health , which was officially launched in May 2008 , allows users to store , manage , and share their medical records and personal health information securely online .
“ Our partnership with IBM will help both providers and users gain access to their device data in a highly simplified and automated fashion , ” Sameer Samat , director for Google Health , said in a statement .
IBM , which competes with the likes of Hewlett - Packard Co , Microsoft Corp and Oracle Corp , developed the software based on guidelines from Continua Health Alliance , an organization dedicated to enabling interoperable personal healthcare products and solutions .
It ’s really too bad that the coffee cartels are causing mayhem in Mexico and even on the streets of American cities .
Those bloodthirsty profiteers in the illegal market for coffee who are killing their competitors must be stopped .
What ?
You have n’t heard about the coffee cartels ?
Actually , neither have I .
Why do you think that is , whereas there is a violent war between sellers of illegal drugs .
Is it that coffee is n’t addictive ?
For many people , it is .
So what is the difference ?
The key difference is that coffee is n’t illegal ( yet ) , whereas marijuana , cocaine , and heroin are .
And what ’s happening in the illegal drug markets is happening not because the goods exchanged are drugs , but because they ’re illegal .
Because drugs are illegal and the penalties for being in the " industry " are very high , the illegal - drug industry attracts criminals .
In the wars between rival drug " firms , " competition is often cutthroat – literally – and many innocent people are killed .
If drugs were legal , competition would be just as it is on legal goods – based on price , quality , and convenience .
When Prohibition ended in 1933 , organized crime left the liquor industry – and so did violence .
Notice that I use the term " firm , " not " cartel , " to refer to organizations that produce drugs .
The reason is that they are not cartels .
A cartel is an organization of firms that colludes to keep prices high and output low .
It is unlikely that the drug firms are cartels .
The very fact that they are engaged in violent conflict means that they are unlikely to have a collusive agreement .
Calling them cartels reflects the same kind of sloppy thinking that favors the drug war .
Whenever you hear politicians like Hillary Clinton express their concern about the violence , keep in mind that the government created this crime problem .
Those expressions of concern you see from politicians are , in many cases , crocodile tears .
Mrs. Clinton does n’t feel the pain ; she , and the many politicians who have supported the drug war for most of the 20th century and all of the 21st so far , have caused and are causing the pain .
The drug war has caused many ironies .
Take the high price .
It ’s due to the fact that the drugs are illegal and , therefore , suppliers , to be willing to supply , charge a risk premium .
In an unpublished article I wrote a few years ago , " The U.S. Drug War on Latin America , " I compared two exports from Colombia , both of which are drugs or contain drugs , and both of which begin with the letter " c. " I refer to cocaine and coffee .
I estimated that if the same markups applied to cocaine as to coffee , which would occur with cocaine legalization , then cocaine ’s price in the United States would fall by about 97 percent .
No one would need to steal to support a cocaine habit .
That would not mean , of course , that no one would steal to support a habit .
People steal to get the wherewithal to buy even items that are cheap and legal .
But virtually no one would need to steal to afford cocaine .
Consider the legitimate concern many people have that drug users would die from overdoses or from foreign substances used to " cut " the drugs .
Even this problem is due to the fact that drugs are illegal .
Because the drugs are illegal , no one in the business can use advertising to establish a reputation and brand name .
You ca n’t have a brand name for , say , cocaine , that is at all comparable to the brand name for Coca - Cola .
Therefore , there is much less incentive to provide a known - quality product .
It may be a hard pill to swallow , so to speak , but it is true , nevertheless , that the vast majority of harm attributed to drugs is , in fact , due to the drug war .
End the drug war , and it ’s true that some people will consume things that others do n’t want them to ; but it ’s also true that the amount of violence in that market would decline to the amount seen in the legal alcohol market .
That is , there would be almost no violence .
Keep that in mind when you see politicians advocating stemming the violence by escalating violence against sellers of illegal drugs .

DUBAI , March 11 ( Reuters ) - Human rights activists in the Middle East and North Africa need protection from governments , which often consider them subversives and harass , threaten and jail them after unfair trials , the rights group Amnesty International said on Wednesday .
" Human rights activists in the Middle East and North Africa still face imprisonment , torture , persecution and repression for seeking to uphold the rights of others , " the London - based group said in a statement accompanying a new report .
Amnesty International cited trials in Egypt and Syria and " anti-terror " laws in Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates that use broad language to penalise peaceful activity defined as , for example , disturbing " public order " .
" Some are forced to sign confessions to crimes they say they have not committed , or pledges to stop their human rights activities ...
National laws are routinely used to silence them and penalise their activities , " the statement said .
It said rights activists who persevere against authorities have made a difference , citing the role of bloggers in exposing police torture in Egypt and legal action raised by Israeli and Palestinian rights groups over the use of torture .

As you may have heard in the news , the Internet will be rebooted today and is expected to be down for around one minute .
A global consortium of ISPs and technology companies has called for the action following several periods of instability over the past few years .
A spokesman for the group commented :
People forget that the Internet has been running continuously since the 1970s .
This reboot will provide greater stability for years to come .
We ’re also hoping it will result in fewer viagra and scam messages .
The plans have been meticulous and all information will be backed up to CD and tape drives .
No one should lose data as a result of the reboot , but everyone is advised to :
Convert 1 April 11.59 am UTC to their local time using a tool such as The World Clock Time Zone Converter .
Shut down all Internet applications such as web browsers , email clients , and instant messengers shortly before the reboot .
Wait at least a minute before restarting any applications .
The process is especially hazardous for the Internet technicians handling the restart .
One specialist – who wished to remain anonymous – told us :
Some of the equipment down there is nearly 40 years old .
There are missing fuses , exposed wires and unterminated cables : it will be dangerous .
Anyone surfing the net or sending a large email attachment at 11.59 could easily electrocute one of my team .
How will your company handle the reboot downtime ?
Is the reboot necessary ?
Do you think it should have been done sooner ?
Let us know your opinions , but please be careful when you send them .
Spiritual Change or a Complete Revolution ?
J. Krishnamurti - Book of Life - October 25
Emptiness itself brings about a complete revolution in consciousness ...
For the complete mutation in consciousness to take place you must deny analysis and search , and no longer be under any influence - which is immensely difficult .
The mind , seeing what is false , has put the false aside completely , not knowing what is true .
f you already know what is true , then you are merely exchanging what you consider is false for what you imagine is true .
There is no renunciation if you know what you are going to get in return .
There is only renunciation when you drop something not knowing what is going to happen .
That state of negation is completely necessary .
Please follow this carefully , because if you have gone so far you will see that in that state of negation you discover what is true ; because , negation is the emptying of consciousness of the known .
After all , consciousness is based on knowledge , on experience , on racial inheritance , on memory , on the things one has experienced .
Experiences are always of the past , operating on the present , being modified by the present and continuing into the future .
All that is consciousness , the vast storehouse of centuries .
It has its usefulness in mechanical living only .
It would be absurd to deny all the scientific knowledge acquired through the long past .
But to bring about a mutation in consciousness , a revolution in this whole structure , there must be complete emptiness .
And that emptiness is possible only when there is the discovery , the actual seeing of what is false .
Then you will see , if you have gone so far , that emptiness itself brings about a complete revolution in consciousness : it has taken place .

... A deliberate change ... is no change at all ...
In the very action of the individual changing , surely , the collective will also change .
They are not two separate things opposed to each other , the individual and the collective , though certain political groups try to separate the two and to force the individual to conform to the so - called collective .
If we could unravel together the whole problem of change , how to bring about a change in the individual and what that change implies , then perhaps , in the very act of listening , participating in the inquiry , there might come about a change which is without your volition .
For me , a deliberate change , a change which is compulsory , disciplinary , conformative , is no change at all .
Force , influence , some new invention , propaganda , a fear , a motive compels you to change , - that is no change at all .
And though intellectually you may agree very easily with this , I assure you that to fathom the actual nature of change without a motive is quite extraordinary .
J. Krishnamurti - Book of Life - October 27
Change outside of the field of thought ...
You have changed your ideas , you have changed your thought , but thought is always conditioned .
Whether it is the thought of Jesus , Buddha , X , Y , or Z , it is still thought , and therefore one thought can be in opposition to another thought ; and when there is opposition , a conflict between two thoughts , the result is a modified continuity of thought .
In other words , the change is still within the field of thought , and change within the field of thought is no change at all .
One idea or set of ideas has merely been substituted for another .
Seeing this whole process , is it possible to leave thought and bring about a change outside the field of thought ?
All consciousness , surely , whether it is of the past , the present , or the future , is within the field of thought ; and any change within that field , which sets the boundaries of the mind , is no real change .
A radical change can take place only outside the field of thought , not within it , and the mind can leave the field only when it sees the confines , the boundaries of the field , and realizes that any change within the field is no change at all .
This is real meditation .
Maintaining the pretense of authority : “ Nothing to see here !
Please disperse ! ” commands Frank Drebin , Lt. Detective , Police Squad — a special division of the police force .
Sometimes the truth is best told through fictional allegory , especially when a dash of comedy is used to make the parables more palatable .
Witness , for example , the variation on the familiar “ I ’ll need your badge and gun ” scene from the action farce The Naked Gun .
Countless police films present exactly the same scene , in which the forlorn hero , after being led by his zeal to commit some grave breach of protocol or some ( apparent ) lapse of judgment , is put on administrative leave and forced to surrender his insignia of office and his government - issued firearm .
The conventions of movie melodrama dictate that as he turns over his shield the disgraced police officer take generous pause to look pensively at the token of official authority , wordlessly conveying a deep sense of inconsolable loss .
And the balance of the story consists of the cashiered officer working through back - channels and other unsanctioned avenues to vindicate himself and take down whatever criminal mastermind was responsible for his humiliation .
As I said , we ’ve witnessed that scene in scores , perhaps hundreds , of cinematic and television variations .
However , to my knowledge , only Frank Drebin ( Leslie Nielsen ) of The Naked Gun has actually articulated the otherwise unspoken thoughts of the police officer forced to turn in his gun and badge .
“ Just think , ” a dejected Drebin comments to his anguished partner , “ the next time I shoot someone , I could go to jail . ”
A more pointed version of the same sentiment , delivered without a particle of comic irony , was expressed by both Tom “ Turk ” Cowan ( Robert DeNiro ) and his long - time partner David “ Rooster ” Fisk ( Al Pacino ) in Righteous Kill , a formulaic cop thriller released last year .
“ You do n’t become a cop because you want to ` Serve and protect ’ ; you do it because you want respect , ” explains Cowan .
“ Most people respect the badge .
Everybody respects the gun . ”
Fisk , who by all appearances plays Damon to Cowan ’s Pythias , is even more direct : “ The badge is nice , as long as it comes with a gun . ”
Embedded in such scenes is the assumption that the state - issued badge is , quite literally , a shield :
Not only does it symbolize a specific professional function , it also confers official permission to kill other human beings .
Those who receive this officially consecrated jewelry are thus elevated above the common mass of undifferentiated humanity , and few things are more poignantly painful than being relieved of that token of exalted status , and deprived of the sense of impunity it offers .
A recent essay describing some of the challenges experienced by female police officers briefly noted one social challenge faced by distaff members of the Killer Elite : “ It can be very intimidating for the person who is dating a female cop who carries a badge and has a constitutional authority to take a life . ”
( Emphasis added . )
That “ constitutional authority ” thus makes the female police officer intrinsically different from members of her potential dating pool ( which the author , in dutiful PC fashion , implicitly expands to include both sexes ) .
The officer has it , and unless her would - be suitor is part of the same privileged caste , he or she does not .
But all of this begs the following question :
Where , exactly , does the “ constitutional authority to take a life ” come from , if it does n’t inhere in each individual , and the people at large ?
What mystical property of the state permits it to summon that “ right ” into existence , and by what principle of justice does the state confer it exclusively on its own armed enforcers ?
If the people , both individually and in the aggregate , do not have the moral authority to take a life when necessary , how could they confer that authority on their servants in government ?
Or are we to understand that the powers of government are innate and unqualified , rather than derivative and contingent , as the Declaration of Independence asserts ?
Portrait of a murderer as young West Point graduate : Future FBI - employed serial killer Lon Horiuchi , who murdered Vicky Weaver at Ruby Ridge and played a still - unknown role in the massacre of the Branch Davidians at Mt. Carmel , outside Waco .
The answer to that question is made obvious in the behavior of our supposed protectors on those occasions when an otherwise inoffensive civilian asserts his right to be treated with the dignity and the deference due to a human being .
With rare and priceless exceptions , theirs is hardly the conduct of servants .
Furthermore , the “ constitutional authority to take a life ” that is supposedly the unique possession of the state ’s armed enforcers is not restricted to self - defense or the use of lethal violence to carry out the apprehension and punishment of criminals .
It also encompasses the supposed right to kill innocent bystanders , victims of mistaken identity , or even those who merely prove to be inconvenient .
About ten years ago , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals brushed up against this notion when it ruled that FBI assassin Lon Horiuchi could n’t be prosecuted for manslaughter in killing of Vicky Weaver during the 1992 federal siege of her family at Ruby Ridge , Idaho .
From the spurious concept of “ supremacy clause immunity , ” the court fashioned an even more fanciful principle called the “ discretionary function exemption . ”
Under that standard , the only significant questions were these : Was Horiuchi acting under orders from his superiors , and was the kill - shot justified by “ his subjective belief that his actions were necessary and proper ” ?
The former question essentially permits Horiuchi ( and others in his position ) the luxury of the notorious “ Nuremberg Defense ” ; the latter question reverses centuries worth of common law wisdom by arguing that armed enforcers for the state are exceptions to the principle that “ no man can be a judge in his own cause . ”
On the basis of such assumptions , the court ruled that it would be impermissible for a federal law enforcement officer to face civil or criminal prosecution for official acts that would otherwise be criminal in nature — including , in this case , gunning down an unarmed mother while she was holding as small infant .
( In sworn testimony Horiuchi admitted that he knew it was Vicky Weaver in his sights when he pulled the trigger . )
In a dissent seasoned liberally with incredulous outrage , Judge Alex Kozinski condemned the majority for creating what he called a “ 007 standard ” — that is , a license to kill .
By exempting Horiuchi from prosecution , wrote Kozinski , the Ninth Circuit Court was granting that lethal license “ to all law enforcement agencies in our circuit — federal , state , and local . ”
Victim of the “ 007 Standard ” : Vicky Weaver , before she was murdered by Horiuchi .
Just months later , the Ninth Court partially reversed that decision in order to permit Idaho ( the plaintiff in the original case ) to prosecute Horiuchi under state laws .
Denise Woodbury , an assistant prosecutor from Boundary County , was prepared to prosecute the FBI sniper , but incoming county attorney Brett Benson had no appetite for taking on the case .
So Horiuchi remained at large without prosecution , and the “ 007 standard ” remains in force by default .
It is by no means incidental to this discussion that Horiuchi ’s lethal services came in the course of federal sieges of socially isolated people ( the “ white separatist ” Weaver family and the Branch Davidian community , a breakaway sect of the Adventist faith ) arising from technical violations of federal firearms laws .
Randy Weaver was initially approached by an undercover agent for the criminal syndicate called the ATF .
The federal snitch offered to pay Weaver a substantial sum to buy shotguns that had undergone “ illegal ” modifications specified by the snitch himself .
Once entrapped , Weaver was told the only way he could avoid prosecution was to act as a federal snitch within the neo - Nazi Aryan Nation , a sect with which he had a trivial and distant connection .
To his immense credit , Weaver deflected this blackmail attempt — and the Feds punished his principled defiance by carrying out the murderous assault on his family .
The initial “ Showtime ” raid in Waco by the ATF was carried out on the pretext that Branch Davidian religious leader David Koresh , a federally licensed firearms dealer , was illegally converting semi-automatic rifles to full - autos .
Told of the agency ’s concerns by a Waco - area gun dealer , Koresh invited the ATF to inspect his inventory weeks prior to the raid .
That offer was turned down in order to preserve the pretext for a PR - friendly raid on an eccentric but harmless religious community .
Several Davidians were shot during the ATF ’s unnecessary ( and , therefore , illegal ) raid on February 28 , 1993 .
Four ATF agents were killed by the Davidians in an act of entirely legal self - defense .
Scores of people were later immolated by the FBI ( and Special Forces operators ) during the final siege on April 19 .
Nobody in a position of authority has ever been punished in any way for the needless ATF raid or the avoidable deaths ( including those of the four federal agents ) that resulted .
Four of the Davidian survivors , on the other hand , were convicted of voluntary manslaughter and the use of a firearm in committing a violent crime .
The “ crime ” in question was defending their home and place of worship when it was besieged by an armed mob .
The Waco episode fleshes out the “ constitutional authority to take a life ” even further by adding this critical codicil :
Those on the receiving end of criminal violence by the state ’s armed agents have no right to defend themselves in kind .
In other words , if someone invested with the “ right ” to take a life wrongly targets you , either as a result of error or of malice , you have a duty to die .
Another very important legal principle must be taken into account as well :
Not only can the state ’s enforcement agents more or less kill at their discretion , they also enjoy the privilege of deciding whether or not to come to the aid of a given individual citizen .
A long string of legal precedents dictates that individual citizens have no legal or civic recourse against police who fail to protect or defend them when they are threatened by violent criminals .
The duty of the police is to “ society , ” not to an individual finding himself in need of specific assistance .
What this means , of course , is that the state ’s armed agents can kill you at their discretion , but have no responsibility to save you from the criminal violence of others .
All of this could be considered the inevitable outcome of alienating to the state the individual responsibility for self - defense against violent crime .
Given the tendency of the state to aggrandize itself in any role assigned to it , and to pervert delegated authority into unaccountable power , why should we be surprised that the police are acquiring the customs and demeanor of a militarized killer elite ?
In 1993 , more than a decade and a half before Eric Holder would denigrate Americans as “ A Nation of Cowards ” because of our lack of enthusiasm for ethnic collectivism , constitutional attorney Jeffrey Snyder made much more appropriate use of that phrase as the title of an essay published in the late ( and otherwise unlamented ) neo-con quarterly , The Public Interest .
With the unflinching determination of a surgeon attacking a gangrenous limb , Snyder applies the scalpel of logic to the putrescent logic of “ gun control ” ( or , as honest people prefer to call it , civilian disarmament ) .
Layer after layer of rotten pretense surrenders to his blade before Snyder uncovers the core of the issue :
“ To own firearms is to affirm that freedom and liberty are not gifts from the state .
It is to reserve final judgment about whether the state is encroaching on freedom and liberty , to stand ready to defend that freedom with more than mere words , and to stand outside the state ’s totalitarian reach … .
Laws disarming honest citizens proclaim that the government is the master , not the servant , of the people . ”
In a phrase : The Second Amendment certifies that the state does not possess a monopoly on the use of force .
Yet we have abdicated the role of self - defense to the same state that is now overtly taking on the characteristics of a brazen kleptocracy .
How on earth could rational people believe that the same state responsible for plundering us through taxation , stealing the value of our earnings and savings through inflation , and subsidizing Wall Street ’s multi-trillion - dollar crime spree , will actually protect us from the violence of common criminals when our ongoing economic collapse begets widespread social turmoil ?
One of the ironic blessings of a cataclysmic economic “ correction ” may be the widespread dismantling of state and local police departments — assuming , of course , that the vacuum can be filled with informal “ citizen ’s posses ” and “ home guards ” composed of armed , responsible property owners .
As a homework assignment for those skeptical that such arrangements can work , at least in modest - sized communities , I recommend the wonderful book Tough Towns : True Tales from the Gritty Streets of the Old West , by Oklahoma attorney Robert Barr Smith .
The title is slightly misleading , since some of the best accounts of spontaneous law enforcement by the citizenry ( such as the battles against bank robbers in Miller Creek , Oklahoma , Menomonie , Wisconsin , and especially the small black enclave of Boley , Oklahoma ) occurred during the ( last ) Great Depression .
With wit and insight Smith describes eighteen small battles between vicious gangs of armed professional criminals and armed citizens determined to protect their property and their neighbors .
In each episode , the criminals come out a poor second , often leaving this world in agony as their bodies are perforated by gunfire coming from every direction .
And in nearly all of these accounts , government law enforcement — usually represented by the local sheriff or a territorial marshal — plays a role best described as peripheral .
That ’s how it once was when our country was relatively free .
That ’s how it could be , and should be , once again .
The Best of William Norman Grigg
The number of western meadowlarks has declined sharply in recent years Almost one third of the 800 species of birds found in the US are " endangered , threatened or in significant decline " , a report has concluded .
Described as the most comprehensive assessment of its kind , the study listed habitat loss and invasive species as being the main threats .
But where conservation measures had been taken , some bird populations had shown signs of recovery , it added .
The US State of Birds report was commissioned by President Bush in 2007 .
It was compiled by a partnership of organisations , including the US Geological Survey and the American Bird Conservancy , from three long - running bird censuses stretching back 40 years .
Habitat concerns
One of the key findings was that more birds were at risk in Hawaii than anywhere else in the US .
Bald eagles have benefited from shooting bans and pesticide restrictions " Habitats such as those in Hawaii are on the verge of losing entire suites of unique bird species , " warned David Pashley , American Bird Conservancy 's vice president .
As a result of the encroachment of human activities , nearly all of the bird species on the Hawaiian Islands were in danger of extinction unless urgent conservation measures were implemented .
" In addition to habitat loss , birds also face many other man-made threats , such as pesticides , predation by cats , and collisions with windows , towers and buildings , " Dr Pashley added .
The report also found that at least 39 % of ocean bird species were declining , and about half were of " conservation concern " .
It also highlighted that half of coastal migrating shorebirds had declined , " indicating stress in coastal habitats besieged by development , disturbance and dwindling food supplies " .
The researchers said it indicated deteriorating conditions and that effective " management policies and sustainable fishing regulations were essential " .
But the report also presented evidence that populations of birds recovered quickly when conservation measures were taken .
The data revealed " dramatic increases " in wetlands species , such as pelicans , herons , egrets , ospreys and ducks .
" These results emphasise that investment in wetlands conservation has paid huge dividends , " observed Kenneth Rosenberg , director of conservation science at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology .
" Now we need to invest similarly in other neglected habitats where birds are undergoing the steepest declines . "

We 're gathering more information about Richard Polawski , the 23 - year - old man who decided to kill three Pittsburgh police officers and wound three others because it appears he was afraid they -- at the behest of the Obama administration -- were going to take his guns away .
( Dude , they definitely are now . )
Seems he was laying in wait in a carefully planned ambush :
Richard Poplawski , 23 , met officers at the doorway and shot two of them in the head immediately , Harper said .
An officer who tried to help the two also was killed .
Poplawski , armed with an assault rifle and two other guns , then held police at bay for four hours as the fallen officers were left bleeding nearby , their colleagues unable to reach them , according to police and witnesses .
More than 100 rounds were fired by the SWAT teams and Poplawski , Harper said .
And he was paranoid about the Obama administration taking people 's guns away -- even though , of course , there have been no indications of any such plans beyond NRA rantings :
Poplawski feared " the Obama gun ban that 's on the way " and " did n't like our rights being infringed upon , " said Edward Perkovic , his best friend .
Perkovic , 22 , said he got a call at work from him in which he said , " Eddie , I am going to die today .
...
Tell your family I love them and I love you . "
Perkovic said : " I heard gunshots and he hung up .
...
He sounded like he was in pain , like he got shot . "
Poplawski had once tried to join the Marines , but was kicked out of boot camp after throwing a food tray at a drill sergeant , Perkovic said .
Dennis Roddy at the Post - Gazette has more :
Friends described a Richard Poplawski far different from the 22 - year - old man accused of gunning down three police officers today -- a partier sometimes , a guy in search of an understanding of politics , even a walking comedian .
He was also convinced that the government wanted to take away his guns and his freedom .
There are bits about him out on the Internet .
There are the MySpace photos , like the one above .
He also seems to have co-created an " Insane Ownage " video for You Tube .
Perhaps just as interesting are the views of Poplowski's much - quoted " best friend , " Edd Perkovic , whose MySpace page , as Troll Report notices , is rich anti-Semitic hate talk like this :
DOCUMENTS I RECCOMEND YOU READ BY GOOGLE : " Civil War II " by Tom Chittum " The Protocols of the Elders of Zion " " The Turner Diaries " by Dr. William Pierce " Jewish Supremacy " by Dr. David Duke It Has Even Been Documented In The Communist Manifesto : " “ We must realize that our party ’s most powerful weapon is racial tension .
" By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites , we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party .
" In America we will aim for subtle victory .
While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites , we will endeavour to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negros .
" We will aid the Negros to rise to prominence in every walk of life , in the professions , and in the world of sports and entertainment .
Meanwhile , Fox also interviewed Tom Moffit , who was a neighbor of Poplawski's .
He apparently believed that Poplawski was acting out of gun paranoia as well .
Members of the highest - ranking American delegation to tour Gaza were shocked to discover that the Israeli blockade against the Hamas - ruled territory included such food staples as lentils , macaroni and tomato paste .
" When have lentil bombs been going off lately ?
Is someone going to kill you with a piece of macaroni ? " asked Congressman Brian Laird .
It was only after Senator John Kerry , the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , raised the issue with Defence Minister Ehud Barak after their trip last month that Israel allowed the pasta in .
Macaroni was considered a luxury item , not a humanitarian necessity , they were told .
The total number of products blacklisted by Israel remains a mystery for UN officials and the relief agencies which face long delays in bringing in supplies .
For security reasons such items as cement and steel rods are banned as they could be used by Hamas to build bunkers or the rockets used to target Israeli civilians .
Hearing aids have been banned in case the mercury in their batteries could be used to produce chemical weapons .
Yet since the end of the war in January , according to non-government organisations , five truckloads of school notebooks were turned back at the crossing at Kerem Shalom where goods are subject to a $ 1,000 ( £ 700 ) per truck " handling fee " .

Paper to print new textbooks for Palestinian schools was stopped , as were freezer appliances , generators and water pumps , cooking gas and chickpeas .
And the French government was incensed when an entire water purification system was denied entry .
Christopher Gunness , the spokesman for the UN agency UNRWA responsible for Palestinian refugees , said : " One of the big problems is that the ' banned list ' is a moving target so we discover things are banned on a ' case by case ' , ' day by day ' basis . "
Human Rights
Watch executive director Kenneth Roth said : " Israel 's blockade policy can be summed up in one word and it is punishment , not security . "

Sometime early in this century the intelligence of machines will exceed that of humans .
Within a quarter of a century , machines will exhibit the full range of human intellect , emotions and skills , ranging from musical and other creative aptitudes to physical movement .
They will claim to have feelings and , unlike today ’s virtual personalities , will be very convincing when they tell us so .
By around 2020 a $ 1,000 computer will at least match the processing power of the human brain .
By 2029 the software for intelligence will have been largely mastered , and the average personal computer will be equivalent to 1,000 brains .
Once computers achieve a level of intelligence comparable to that of humans , they will necessarily soar past it .
For example , if I learn French , I ca n’t readily download that learning to you .
The reason is that for us , learning involves successions of stunningly complex patterns of interconnections among brain cells ( neurons ) and among the concentrations of biochemicals known as neurotransmitters that enable impulses to travel from neuron to neuron .
We have no way of quickly downloading these patterns .
But quick downloading will allow our nonbiological creations to share immediately what they learn with billions of other machines .
Ultimately , nonbiological entities will master not only the sum total of their own knowledge but all of ours as well .
As this happens , there will no longer be a clear distinction between human and machine .
We are already putting computers — neural implants — directly into people ’s brains to counteract Par­kinson ’s disease and tremors from multiple scle­rosis .
We have cochlear implants that restore hear­ing .
A retinal implant is being de­veloped in the U.S. that is intended to provide
at least some visual perception for some blind individuals , basically by replacing certain visual - processing circuits of the brain .
A team of scientists at Emory University implanted a chip in the brain of a paralyzed stroke victim that allowed him to use his brainpower to move a cursor across a computer screen .
In the 2020s neural implants will improve our sensory experiences , memory and thinking .
By 2030 , instead of just phoning a friend , you will be able to meet in , say , a virtual Mozam­bican game preserve that will seem compellingly real .
You will be able to have any type of ex­perience — business , social , sexual — with anyone , real or simulated , regardless of physical proximity .
How Life and Technology Evolve
To gain insight into the kinds of forecasts I have just made , it is important to recognize that information technology is advancing exponentially .
An exponential process starts slowly , but eventually its pace increases extremely rapidly .
( A fuller documentation of my argument is contained in my recent book The Singularity Is Near . )
The evolution of biological life and the evolution of technology have both followed the same pattern : they take a long time to get going , but advances build on one another , and progress erupts at an increasingly furious pace .
We are entering that explosive part of the technological evolution curve right now .
Consider :
It took billions of years for Earth to form .
It took two billion more for life to begin and almost as long for molecules to organize into the first multicellular plants and animals about 700 million years ago .
The pace of evolution quickened as mammals inherited Earth some 65 million years ago .
With the emergence of primates , evolutionary progress was measured in mere millions of years , leading to Homo sapiens perhaps 500,000 years ago .
The evolution of technology has been a continuation of the evolutionary process that gave rise to us — the technology - creating species — in the first place .
It took tens of thousands of years for our ancestors to figure out that sharpening both sides of a stone created useful tools .
Then , earlier in this past millennium , the time required for a major paradigm shift in technology had shrunk to hundreds of years .
The pace continued to accelerate during the 19th century , during which technological progress was equal to that of the 10 centuries that came before it .
Advancement in the first two decades of the 20th century matched that of the entire 19th century .
Today significant technological transformations take just a few years ; for example , the World Wide Web , already a ubiquitous form of communication and commerce , did not exist just 20 years ago .
One decade ago almost no one used search engines .
Computing technology is experiencing the same exponential growth .
Over the past several decades a key factor in this expansion has been described by Moore ’s Law .
Gordon Moore , a co-founder of Intel , noted in the mid-1960s that technologists had been doubling the density of transistors on integrated circuits every 12 months .
This meant computers were periodically doubling both in capacity and in speed per unit cost .
In the mid-1970s Moore revised his observation of the doubling time to a more accurate estimate of about 24 months , and that trend has persisted through the years .
After decades of devoted service , Moore ’s Law will have run its course around 2019 .
By that time , transistor features will be just a few atoms in width .
But new computer architectures will continue the exponential growth of computing .
For example , computing cubes are already being designed that will provide thousands of layers of circuits , not just one as in today ’s computer chips .
Other technologies that promise orders - of - magnitude increases in computing density include nanotube circuits built from carbon atoms , optical computing , crystalline computing and molecular computing .
We can readily see the march of computing by plotting the speed ( in instructions per second ) per $ 1,000 ( in constant dollars ) of 49 famous calculating machines spanning the 20th century [ see illustration on opposite page ] .
The graph is a study in exponential growth : computer speed per unit cost doubled every three years between 1910 and 1950 and every two years between 1950 and 1966 and is now doubling every year .
It took 90 years to achieve the first $ 1,000 computer capable of executing one million instructions per second ( MIPS ) .
Now we add an additional MIPS to a $ 1,000 computer every day .
Why Returns Accelerate
Why do we see exponential progress occurring in biological life , technology and computing ?
It is the result of a fundamental attribute of any evolutionary process , a phenomenon I call the Law of Accelerating Returns .
As order exponentially increases ( which reflects the essence of evolution ) , the time between salient events grows shorter .
Advancement speeds up .
The returns — the valuable products of the process — accelerate at a nonlinear rate .
The escalating growth in the price performance of computing is one important example of such accelerating returns .
A frequent criticism of predictions is that they rely on an unjustified extrapolation of current trends , without considering the forces that may alter those trends .
But an evolutionary process accelerates because it builds on past achievements , including improvements in its own means for further evolution .
The resources it needs to continue exponential growth are its own increasing order and the chaos in the environment in which the evolutionary process takes place , which provides the options for further diversity .
These two resources are essentially without limit .
The Law of Accelerating Returns shows that by around 2020 a $ 1,000 personal computer will have the processing power of the human brain — 20 million billion calculations per second .
The estimates are based on regions of the brain that have already been successfully simulated .
By 2055 , $ 1,000 worth of computing will equal the processing power of all human brains on Earth ( of course , I may be off by a year or two ) .
Programming Intelligence
That ’s the prediction for processing power , which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving human - level intelligence in machines .
Of greater importance is the software of intelligence .
One approach to creating this software is to painstakingly program the rules of complex processes .
Another approach is “ complexity theory ” ( also known as chaos theory ) computing , in which self - organizing algorithms gradually learn patterns of information in a manner analogous to human learning .
One such method , neural nets , is based on simplified mathematical models of mammalian neurons .
Another method , called genetic ( or evolutionary ) algorithms , is based on allowing intelligent solutions to develop gradually in a simulated process of evolution .
Ultimately , however , we will learn to program intelligence by copying the best intelligent entity we can get our hands on : the human brain itself .
We will reverse - engineer the human brain , and fortunately for us it ’s not even copyrighted !
The most immediate way to reach this goal is by destructive scanning : take a brain frozen just before it was about to expire and examine one very thin slice at a time to reveal every neuron , inter­neuronal connection and concentration of neurotransmitters across each gap between neurons ( these gaps are called synapses ) .
One condemned killer has already allowed his brain and body to be scanned , and all 15 billion bytes of him can be accessed on the National Library of Medicine ’s Web site ( www.nlm.nih.gov/research/ visible/visible_gallery.html ) .
The resolution of these scans is not nearly high enough for our purposes , but the data at least enable us to start thinking about these issues .
We also have noninvasive scanning techniques , including high - resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and others .
Recent scanning methods can image individual interneuronal connections in a living brain and show them firing in real time .
The increasing resolution and speed of these techniques will eventually enable us to resolve the connections among neurons .
The rapid improvement is again a result of the Law of Accelerating Returns , because massive computation is the main element in higher - resolution imaging .
Another approach would be to send microscopic robots ( or “ nanobots ” ) into the bloodstream and program them to explore every capillary , monitoring the brain ’s connections and neurotransmitter concentrations .
Fantastic Voyage
Although sophisticated robots that small are still a couple of de­cades away at least , their utility for probing the innermost recesses of our bodies would be far - reaching .
They would communicate wirelessly with one another and report their findings to other computers .
The result would be a noninvasive scan of the brain taken from within .
Most of the technologies required for this scenario already exist , though not in the microscopic size required .
Miniaturizing them to the tiny sizes needed , however , would reflect the essence of the Law of Accelerating Returns .
For example , the transistors on an integrated circuit have been shrinking by a factor of approximately five in each linear dimension every 10 years .
The capabilities of these embedded nanobots would not be limited to passive roles such as monitoring .
Eventually they could be built to communicate directly with the neuronal circuits in our brains , enhancing or extending our mental capabilities .
We already have electronic devices that can communicate with neurons by detecting their activity and either triggering nearby neurons to fire or suppressing them from firing .
The embedded nano­bots will be capable of reprogramming neural connections to provide virtual - reality experiences and to enhance our pattern recognition and other cognitive faculties .
To decode and understand the brain ’s information - processing methods ( which , incidentally , combine both digital and analog methods ) , it is not necessary to see every connection , because there is a great deal of redundancy within each region .
We are already applying insights from early stages of this reverse - engineering process .
For example , in speech recognition , we have decoded and copied the brain ’s early stages of sound processing .
Perhaps more interesting than this scanning - the - brain - to - understand - it approach would be scanning the brain for the purpose of downloading it .
We would map the locations , interconnections and contents of all the neurons , synapses and neurotransmitter concentrations .
The entire organization , including the brain ’s memory , would then be re-created on a digital - analog computer .
To do this , we would need to understand local brain processes , and progress is already under way .
Theodore W. Berger and his co-workers at the University of Southern California have built integrated circuits that precisely match the processing characteristics of substantial clusters of neurons .
Carver A. Mead and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology have built a variety of integrated circuits that emulate the digital - analog characteristics of mammalian neural circuits .
There are simulations of the visual - processing regions of the brain , as well as the cerebellum , the region responsible for skill formation .
Developing complete maps of the human brain is not as daunting as it may sound .
The Human Genome Project seemed impractical when it was first proposed .
At the rate at which it was possible to scan genetic codes 20 years ago , it would have taken thousands of years to complete the genome .
But in accordance with the Law of Accelerating Returns , the ability to sequence DNA has doubled every year , and the project was completed on time in 2003 .
By the third decade of this century , we will be in a position to create complete , detailed maps of the computationally relevant features of the human brain and to re-create these designs in advanced neural computers .
We will provide a variety of bodies for our machines , too , from virtual bodies in virtual reality to bodies comprising swarms of nanobots , as well as humanoid robots .
Will It Be Conscious ?
Such possibilities prompt a host of intriguing issues and questions .
Suppose we scan someone ’s brain and reinstate the resulting “ mind file ” into a suitable computing medium .
Will the entity that emerges from such an operation be conscious ?
This being would appear to others to have very much the same personality , history and memory .
For some , that is enough to define consciousness .
For others , such as physicist and author James Trefil , no logical reconstruction can attain human consciousness , although Trefil concedes that computers may become conscious in some new way .
At what point do we consider an entity to be conscious , to be self - aware , to have free will ?
How do we distinguish a process that is conscious from one that just acts as if it is conscious ?
If the entity is very convincing when it says , “ I ’m lonely , please keep me company , ” does that settle the issue ?
If you ask the “ person ” in the machine , it will strenuously claim to be the original person .
If we scan , let ’s say , me and reinstate that information into a neural computer , the person who emerges will think he is ( and has been ) me ( or at least he will act that way ) .
He will say , “ I grew up in Queens , New York , went to college at M.I.T. , stayed in the Boston area , walked into a scanner there and woke up in the machine here .
Hey , this technology really works . ”
But wait , is this really me ?
For one thing , old Ray ( that ’s me ) still exists in my carbon - cell - based brain .
Will the new entity be capable of spiritual experiences ?
Because its brain processes are effectively identical , its behavior will be comparable to that of the person it is based on .
So it will certainly claim to have the full range of emotional and spiritual experiences that a person claims to have .
No objective test can absolutely determine consciousness .
We cannot objectively measure subjective experience ( this has to do with the very nature of the concepts “ objective ” and “ subjective ” ) .
We can measure only correlates of it , such as behavior .
The new entities will ap­pear to be conscious , and wheth­er or not they actually are will not affect their behavior .
Just as we debate today the consciousness of nonhuman entities such as animals , we will surely debate the potential consciousness of nonbiological intelligent entities .
From a practical perspective , we will accept their claims .
They ’ll get mad if we do n’t .
Before this century is over , the Law of Accelerating Re­turns tells us , Earth ’s tech­­nology - creating species — us — will merge with our own technology .
And when that hap­­pens , we might ask :
What is the difference between a human brain enhanced a millionfold by neural implants and a nonbiological intelligence based on the reverse - engineering of the human brain that is subsequently ­enhanced and expanded ?
The engine of evolution used its innovation from one period ( humans ) to create the next ( intelligent machines ) .
The subsequent milestone will be for the machines to create their own next generation without human intervention .
An evolutionary process accelerates because it builds on its own means for further evolution .
Humans have beaten evolution .
We are creating intelligent entities in considerably less time than it took the evolutionary process that created us .
Human intelli­gence — a product of evolution — has transcended it .
So , too , the intelligence that we are now creating in computers will soon exceed the intelligence of its creators .
From breaking scientific studies , surveys , and special promotional events , to the latest and greatest creations in fast food , drinks , and snacks , we ’ve skimmed off the cream of the crop and are serving it up in fun and informative bite - sized pieces that are still enough to chew on .
About a month ago , Free Software Magazine published an article that looks into the reasons behind the dearth of women joining free software communities , and makes concrete suggestions about what to change to improve the situation .
While I think the article was well - intentioned , I also think it was confused , and promotes recommendations that buy into many of the sexist stereotypes that we should be trying to combat .
I have n’t noticed any negative responses to the article , so I decided I should write one .
It ’s an odd situation for me to challenging another man ’s writing as sexist .
It can be hard for women to challenge sexism owing to accusations of overreaction , and on the other hand it can be hard for men to do the same owing to a perceived lack of standing in saying what ’s offensive to women ; I do n’t have a defence for this , other than that I showed drafts of this post to a few women in technology and will invite more to leave comments with their own thoughts after I post .
Here ’s what I found objectionable about the article , going through some of its bullet point list of recommendations :
Use forums instead of mailing lists
This suggestion does n’t make sense to me .
I agree with the author ( and the many people who have said this before him ) that women are turned off by an ultra- aggressive alpha geek style of conversation , but the solution is n’t to “ use forums ” , it ’s to stop using and encouraging these destructive behaviors .
We might retitle the suggestion to “ When considering flaming someone , do n’t . ”
If you need an example of how moving to a web forum does n’t make the slightest bit of difference to how respectful a conversation is , consider the average comments in a Slashdot thread .
A point the author does n’t make — but which I find compelling — is that it ’s not just women who are turned off by aggressive conversation modes , it ’s anyone who does n’t want to take part in the alpha geek mentality .
By making an environment that is more welcoming to women , we make an environment that is more welcoming to everyone except a loud subset that we ’re currently optimizing for .
Avatars create a face - to - face - like feeling that encourages “ more human ” behavior
Advocating avatars because they ’re “ more human ” ?
Are we talking about women or children here ?
Women read more books than men .
Women are perfectly capable of and comfortable with engaging in purely written communication , most likely moreso than men .
This insinuation of a childish need for needing cartoons to create a “ face - to - face - like feeling ” seems extremely insulting .
When possible , wikis instead of version control archives
I ’d love it if I could find more solid reasoning behind this than “ wikis are friendly and version control is complicated and women like friendly things and do n’t know how to do complicated things so we should use a wiki for version control even though that does n’t make any sense ” , but I ’m not seeing it in the article .
Ugh .
When possible , high level languages
Ditto .
For example , the FLOSSPOLS report contains a study that compares the programming ability of men and women taking college programming courses .
It finds that women perceived their programming ability to be far lower than men perceived their ability , yet programming examinations showed ability levels to be equal between men and women at the end of the course .
The problem is n’t that women are n’t smart enough for low - level languages , it ’s that we boast about how great we are at coding so much that we manage to convince women that they must not be as smart as us .
Replace pecking - orders with affirmation processes ( thank you ’s )
“ Women are more likely to want to discuss or seek approval for their changes , owing largely to confidence issues ” is not a respectful thing to say .
Who does n’t have confidence issues when joining a new group of people and submitting their first proposal or patch ?
We ’d do well to thank our volunteers better regardless of their gender .
Oh , wow , I just noticed the photo of the sewing machine :
“ Programming , like sewing , is largely a “ tacit ” skill , which is best learned by doing and by watching others . ”
Yes , because a comparison to sewing , which is apparently something the author thinks women seem to learn how to do really well , is totally appropriate .
Good job .
Full marks .
I think I just ran out of words .
Please do n’t listen to the recommendations in this document .
It actually uses good sources , even while it draws insulting conclusions from them , and the sources are worth reading .
If you had to choose one thing to read about the ( very real ) reasons behind there being fewer women in free software , I ’d recommend the FLOSSPOLS report , which is a large - scale academic study of the reasons women do n’t contribute more to free software projects , and is truly enlightening .
So , now that I ’ve complained about the recommendations given , what would a replacement set of recommendations be ?
As well as the formal recommendations given in FLOSSPOLS , Val Henson ’s HOWTO Encourage Women in Linux contains a perfectly good set of advice .
Note that one of the recommendations is ( 3.13 ) “ Do n’t assume that all women like cooking , sewing , and babies ” .
Note that this article attempts to make learning how to participate in a free software project more like learning how to sew .
■ ソースコードを快適に読むための GNU GLOBAL 入門 ( 前編 )
ソースコードを読むときは、複数のファイルから目的の関数を探してエディタで開くという作業をすることが多い。
Eclipse や NetBeans などの統合開発環境上で Java を読む場合は、クラスやメソッドの一覧からソースコードへ簡単にジャンプすることができる。 ターミナル上 で
C を読む場合は、 grep コマンドで関数を探してエディタ ( vim ) で開いていたんだけど、ファイル数が多くなると目的の関数に辿り着くのが大変になってくる。 そこで GNU GLOBAL というソースコード解析ツールを試してみたら、ソースコードを読む作業がとても快適になった。
このツールの存在は前から知っていたんだけど、ネット上では「ソースコードタグシステム」、「ctagsのようなもの」という説明が多く、 ctags が何なのかを分かっていない僕には、便利だけど難しそうなものだと勝手に思い込んでいた。
でも、試してみたら簡単に使えて、すごく便利。もっと早く使っておけばよかった。
なので、 GNU GLOBAL を知らない人向けに、導入から使い方をまとめてみるよ。
GNU GLOBAL でできるこ と
GNU GLOBAL のサイトから引用 。
GNU GLOBAL は、ソースコードに索引付けを行うことで、大規模システムのハックやレビューを効率化するソフトウエアです。 ソースファイル中の指定したシンボルを高速に見つけ出し、素早くその場所に移動することができます。多くのサブディレクトリからなり、#ifdef や main ( )
関数を沢山含んでいるような、いわゆる巨大なプロジェクトをハックするのに役立ちます。ctags やetags に似た働きをしますが、エディタには依存せず様々な環境でご利用になれます。
GNU GLOBAL を使えば、ソースコードを読んでいて 「 この関数はどこで宣言されているんだろう」と思ったときに、その箇所をすぐに開くことができる。
Eclipse で F3 キーを押すと宣言部分へジャンプできるんだけど、同じようなことが vim や Emacs などのエディタでもできるようになる。
関数が宣言されている箇所を調べられる
その関数が使われている場所も調べられる
あるファイルに含まれる関数の一覧を見ることができる
対応している言語は C , C++ , Yacc , Java , PHP4 。
GNU GLOBAL のメリッ ト
GNU GLOBAL はエディタに依存せずに使えることが特徴。 vim と
Emacs のどちらでも使うことができる。 統合開発環境を使わずにターミナル上でソースコードを読み書きする人にオススメ。
解析結果を HTML で出力することで 、
Web ブラウザでソースを読むこともできる。 ふと思ったけど、突然知らないソースコードを渡されて、「
これを明日までに読んでおいて」って言われた人にもオススメかもしれない。
その場でサッと HTML に変換して 、
Web ブラウザで読んでると格好良く見えるかもね（半分冗談です）。
インストール方 法
主要なディストリビューションならパッケージで簡単にインストールできるはず。
Mac でも MacPorts を使ってインストールできた。
$ port install global
root 権限が無い場合でも、ソースコードからコンパイルして、自分のホームディレクトリにインストールできる。 依存関係が無く、簡単にコンパイルできるのが嬉しい。
$ ./configure -- prefix=$HOME
$ make $ make install
bin ディレクトリには、主に以下のコマンドがインストールされる。
gtags … 前準備で使う。ソースコードを解析して、解析結果をタグファイルと呼ばれるデータベースに格納する。
global … タグファイルを使ってソースコードから関数の箇所を検索する。
htags … ソースコードを HTML に変換し て Web ブラウザで読めるようにする 。
share / gtags ディレクトリには、他のエディタと連携するためのスクリプトがインストールされる。
使い方
Ruby1.9のソースコードで試してみる。
公式サイトからソースを取得して展開しておく。
$ wget ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-p0.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf ruby - 1.9.1-p0.tar.gz $ cd ruby - 1.9.1-p0
使い方 ( 1 ) - 準備
はじめに、 gtags コマンドを使ってソースコードを解析する。 これは（ソースが変更されない限りは）一回だけ実行すればいい。 先ほど展開した ruby - 1.9.1 のソースディレクトリ上で gtags -v コマンドを実行する 。
-vは進行状況を解析するためのオプションなので、指定しなくても
OK 。
$ gtags -v [ Sat Mar 07 18:38:17 JST 2009 ]
Gtags started .
Using default configuration .
[ Sat Mar 07 18:38:17 JST 2009 ] Creating ' GTAGS '. [ 1 ] extracting tags of array .c [ 2 ] extracting tags of bignum .c [ 3 ] extracting tags of blockinlining .c （中略） [ 341/343 ] extracting tags of win32/ dir.h [ 342/343 ] extracting tags of win32 / win32.c [ 343/343 ] extracting tags of win32/ winmain .c [ Sat Mar 07 18:38:22 JST 2009 ]
Done .
手元の Mac では 、5 秒くらいで解析が終わった。 解析が終わると 、
GPATH , GRTAGS , GSYMS , GTAGS という4つのファイルが生成される。 それぞれのファイルサイズは数MB。 中身は Berkeley DB のファイルみたい 。
$ file G* GPATH : Berkeley DB 1.85/1.86 ( Btree , version 3 , little - endian ) GRTAGS : Berkeley DB 1.85/1.86 ( Btree , version 3 , little - endian ) GSYMS : Berkeley DB 1.85/1.86 ( Btree , version 3 , little - endian ) GTAGS : Berkeley DB 1.85/1.86 ( Btree , version 3 , little - endian )
準備はこれだけ。 これでいつでもソースコードから好きな関数を調べられる。
使い方 ( 2 ) - コマンドラインから使う
いきなりエディタと連携する前に、まずはコマンドラインで
GNU GLOBAL を使ってみて機能を把握した方が分かりやすい。 コマンドラインから関数を調べるには、 global コマンドを使う 。
以下に使い方の例を書いていくけど、読むのが面倒な人はとりあえず最後の「global コマンドのまとめ」だけを読めば
OK 。
ソースコード → 関数一覧
Ruby のソースコードにどんな関数が存在するかが分からないので、試しに string .c で定義されている関数の一覧を出力してみる。 「 global -f ファイル名」を実行すれば、そのファイルに含まれる関数の一覧が表示される。
$ global -f string .c BEG 18 string .c # define BEG ( no ) regs -> beg [ no ] END 19 string .c # define END ( no ) regs ->end[no ] rb_str_new_cstr 28 string .c #undef rb_str_new_cstr （略） rb_str_length 1000 string.c rb_str_length( VALUE str ) rb_str_bytesize 1016 string.c rb_str_bytesize( VALUE str ) rb_str_empty 1032 string.c rb_str_empty ( VALUE str )
関数だけじゃなくて、 define されたシンボルも出力してくれている。 便利 。
関数名 → ソースコード（定義 ）
逆に、 「 global 関数名」を実行すれば、関数名からその関数が定義されているソースコードを調べられる。 rb_str_length 関数が定義されている場所を調べてみる。
$ global rb_str_length string . c
-x オプションを付ければ、より詳細な情報（行数とその行の内容）も出力される。
$ global -x rb_str_length rb_str_length 1000 string .c rb_str_length ( VALUE str )
関数名の指定では正規表現を使うこともできる。 「 rb_str_」で始まる関数が定義されている箇所を調べてみる。 もちろん、 -x オプションとの併用もできる。
$ global ' ^rb_str_ ' bignum .c ext/iconv/iconv.c ext/openssl/ruby_missing.h include/ruby/intern.h object.c sprintf.c string .c transcode.c
関数名 → ソースコード（参照 ）
「 global -r 関数名」を実行すれば、その関数が呼び出されている箇所を調べることができる。 rb_str_length 関数が参照されている箇所を調べてみる。
$ global -r rb_str_length ext/iconv/iconv.c include / ruby / intern.h re.c string .c
先ほどと同じように -x オプションを指定することで、行数とその行の内容を見ることができる。
$ global - rx rb_str_length rb_str_length 894 ext/iconv/iconv.c VALUE n = rb_str_length ( StringValue( str ) ) ; rb_str_length 624 include/ruby/intern.h VALUE rb_str_length( VALUE ) ; rb_str_length 2543 re.c VALUE l = rb_str_length ( str ) ; rb_str_length 6985 string .c return rb_str_length( rb_id2str( SYM2ID(sym ) ) ) ; rb_str_length 7085 string.c rb_define_method( rb_cString , " length " , rb_str_length , 0 ) ; rb_str_length 7086 string.c rb_define_method( rb_cString , " size " , rb_str_length , 0 ) ;
関数名の一部 → 関数名
-c オプションを使うと、関数名の一部から関数名を調べられる。 「 rb_str_l」で始まる関数の一覧を調べてみる。
$ global -c rb_str_l rb_str_length rb_str_ljust rb_str_lstrip rb_str_lstrip_bang
先ほどの正規表現を使った 「 global ' ^rb_str ' 」 は「 関数名の一部 → ファイル名 」 だったけど、 -c オプションの場合は 「 関数名の一部 → 関数名 」になっているところが異なる。
このオプションは単独で使うよりも、シェルの補完として使った方が便利。
例えば、 zsh の場合 は
$ global rb_str_e
と入力した状態で Tab キーを押すと以下のように補完候補が表示される。
bash の設定方法もマニュアル - 2.3 Applied usageに書かれている。
$ funcs ( ) { local cur cur=$ {COMP_WORDS [COMP_CWORD ]} COMPREPLY =( `global -c $ cur` ) } $ complete -F funcs global
ソースコードを grep する
関数名だけじゃなくて、ソースコード全体を grep することもできる。 試しに openssl という文字が含まれているソースを検索してみる 。
global -g openssl ext / digest/md5/md5ossl.h ext/digest/rmd160/rmd160ossl.h ext/digest/sha1/sha1ossl.h ext/openssl/openssl_missing.c ext/openssl/openssl_missing.h ext/openssl/ossl.c ext/openssl/ossl.h ext/openssl/ossl_digest.c ext/openssl/ossl_engine.c ext/openssl/ossl_pkey_ec.c ext/openssl/ruby_missing.h
他のコマンドと同じように、 -x オプションを付ければ詳細情報が出力される。
$ global - gx openssl openssl 7 ext / digest/md5/md5ossl.h # include < openssl/ md5.h > openssl 7 ext/digest/rmd160/rmd160ossl.h # include < openssl/ripemd.h > openssl 7 ext/digest/sha1/sha1ossl.h # include < openssl / sha.h > ( 以下略 )
global コマンドのまと め
global コマンドのうち、ここで紹介したよく使いそうなものをまとめておく。 これだけ覚えておけば、とりあえず役に立つんじゃないかな。
global 関数名 関数名 → ソースコード ( 定義 ) global -r 関数名 関数名 → ソースコード ( 参照 ) global -f ファイル名 ソースコード → 関数一覧 global - c 関数名の一部 関数名の一部 → 関数一覧 global - g 検索文字列 ソースコードの grep
また、これらのコマンドに -x オプションを付ければ、詳細情報 ( 行番号と内容 ) が出力される 。
エディタとの連 携
global コマンドを使うだけでも、 grep 検索に頼っていた時よりもすごく便利になった。 でも、 global が本領を発揮するのは、 vim や
Emacs などのエディタと連携させた時。 長くなってきたので、続きは次の日記に書くよ。
続き : ソースコードを快適に読むための GNU GLOBAL 入門 ( 中編 )
The Orange County Water District is purifying wastewater into drinking water at a $ 481 million recycling plant .
The plant uses microfiltration , reverse osmosis , ultraviolet light , and hydrogen peroxide disinfection .
Â 70 million gallons of sewer water is treated a day in Orange County , California meeting the drinking needs of over 500,000 people , including visitors to Disneyland .
Some call the process “ toilet to tap ” , but county officials prefer the term “ Groundwater Replenishment System ” .
Â
Wastewater treatment is more economical than desalination , but there is definitely a negative public perception to consider with treated sewage water .
Steve Gorman explains the process :
The plant takes pre-treated sewer water that otherwise would be discharged to the ocean and runs it through a three - step cleansing processâ€ ” essentially the same technology used to purify baby food and bottled water .
Thousands of microfilters , hollow fibers covered in holes one - three - hundredth the width of a human hair , strain out suspended solids , bacteria and other materials .
The water then passes to a reverse osmosis system , where it is forced through semi-permeable membranes that filter out smaller contaminants , including salts , viruses and pesticides .
Reverse osmosis also is the main process used in desalination .
Finally , the water is disinfected with a mix of ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide .
The resulting product exceeds all U.S. drinking standards but gets additional filtration when it is allowed to percolate back into the ground to replenish the aquifer .
Trying to build public support , waste managers have launched a campaign to inform residents of Southern California that they are already drinking treated wastewater .
Â
Large amounts of heavily treated waste is discharged from cities upstream that also tap into the Colorado River , like Las Vegas .
Orange County ’s wastewater recycling system currently produces water for $ 600 an acre foot , and experts predict the price of imported water will rise to $ 800 an acre foot in just three years .
An acre foot provides a year supply of water to two families .
Â Southern Californians are going to have to accept wastewater recycling if they are going to continue to provide water for all residents in times of drought .
America faces one of its greatest challenges in putting its economy back together .
But first , we must identify what really caused our economic breakdown .
I grew up during the great depression and have now taught kids for 58 years .
This vantage point convinces me our breakdown is rooted in how we have been preparing American youth for leadership and life .
We were somewhat lucky in our recovery from the 1929 - 1939 breakdown .
World War II transformed us into a nation of character , and beginning with the “ greatest generation , ” our economy was being led by leaders who , whatever their faults , had character .
Their leadership built the most powerful economy the world had ever seen .
With the launching of Sputnik in 1957 , the educational system that had nurtured these leaders introduced a new focus away from character and toward a rigid test - proven academic achievement .
That focus remains so powerful that today our goal is to make 100 % of American students “ academically proficient ” by the year 2014 .
This has now completely overwhelmed any meaningful development of character in our schools .
In a recent annual survey by the Josephson Institute of 29,760 students of randomly selected American public and private schools , 64 % admitted during the past year to cheating on a test and 30 % admitted to stealing from a store .
Even more disturbing , 93 % said they were satisfied with their personal ethics and character .
To them , these have become qualities to be determined by the individual .
So today , we have too many leaders whose decisions serve themselves , not their broader communities .
Our leaders used to take pride in building institutions that stand the test of time .
Now we have too many leaders who view those institutions simply as vehicles for success in the present .
For example , Lehman Brothers was founded in 1850 , grew to America ’s fourth largest investment bank , and disappeared in a flash in 2008 .
Regarding our economic breakdown , our national leaders did n’t lack the necessary intelligence .
They lacked the necessary character .
This becomes very clear by examining the forerunner to our collapse : Enron , a company Fortune Magazine named “ America ’s most innovative ” for six consecutive years .
Enron ’s God was their intelligence .
As the documentary Enron : “ The Smartest Guys in the Room ” depicted , Enron ’s leaders simply drew up a business plan built on their creative ideas that plotted at least 15 % yearly growth , and then arrogantly directed their organization and financial statements to honor their plan , regardless .
The fact that Enron was able to enlist government agencies , banks and other organizations into their Ponzi - like pyramid as long as they did speaks to the lack of character that had developed in America .
Greed , a lack of concern ( eg : a tape of Enron traders gleefully celebrating how they screwed widows in California out of their pensions , ) integrity and the courage to pursue the truth or do the right thing had become the norm .
This lack of character had been reaffirmed by our schools .
As just one example , by focusing our schools almost solely on achievement , while virtually ignoring that most students were cheating to get the results , we unwittingly made a powerful statement to them that the end can justify the means in life .
Enron business moralities became inevitable .
I saw this lack of character development in our schools in 1962 , and set out to find a better way to prepare American kids for life .
I founded the Hyde School in Bath , Maine to develop Courage , Integrity , Concern , Curiosity and Leadership in students .
Today , there is a network of five Hyde Schools : another private boarding school in Woodstock , CT ; K - 12 public charter schools in Washington , DC and South Bronx , NY and a public high school in New Haven , CT .
Character development has permanence because it reaches students at a deeper level .
Once students truly internalize qualities like courage , integrity , concern and curiosity , they become motivated to pursue further experiences .
And as they internalize these qualities , they develop both a conscience and the self - confidence to become a leader .
The focus on character moves the achievement emphasis away from comparisons with others more to comparisons with the best in oneself .
This new emphasis on attitude and effort draws out the deeper potentials of each individual student .
Transforming American schools to develop character will in the long run actually produce stronger academic students .
Home - schooled students are motivated by the character quality of curiosity instead of the school motivation of competition .
A University of Maryland study of 24,000 home - schooled students found them scoring by 8th grade , roughly four grade levels above both public and private school students on national proficiency tests .
When we become committed to making character development America ’s highest educational priority , students will willingly follow our lead .
At a deeper level , they know that is the way it should be .

A woman who gave birth to a baby on an international flight from Samoa to Auckland was remanded in custody after she appeared in court today - charged with abandoning the baby girl and assaulting her .
The 29 - year - old Samoan woman 's baby , named Grace , is now in the care of Child Youth and Family ( CYF ) .
During her brief appearance at Manukau District Court today , the woman was granted name suppression , and was remanded in custody without plea until April 9 .
The woman was charged six days after cleaners found the baby in a toilet rubbish bin on a Pacific Blue flight from Samoa to Auckland .
She was on her way to New Zealand with 72 other passengers to work as a kiwifruit picker when her daughter , was born .
She also has one other child living in Samoa .
The infant was found after the woman had left the aircraft .
The mother and baby were both taken to Middlemore Hospital in South Auckland .
Detective Inspector Mark Gutry said abandoning a child was a serious matter .
But whether or not the woman was sent back to Samoa would be a matter for the court and Immigration to decide , Mr Gutry added .
'' We 're working with Samoan authorities and authorities in New Zealand to ensure the best outcome .
'' We have spoken to people on the plane , and certainly they 've been able to provide us with information in relation to this matter .
'' It 's not certain when the mother went into labour , and nobody else was aware that she was in labour prior to the flight .
'' What they 've said and what they 've told us is before the courts now , '' Mr Gutry said .
He added the baby was well and had not suffered " significant injuries or long - term effects " .
'' We are asking that the mother stays in custody until her medical treatment is completed and her immigration issues are resolved .
'' At this stage we do n't expect there will be any further charges , '' Mr Gutry said .
Part of the police inquiry looked at where the child was born .
It was discovered by staff after the plane had landed , and passengers had left .
Whether the child was treated as a New Zealand or a Samoan citizen had yet to be finally determined but she may be treated as Samoan , he said .
However , that did not indicate she was born over Samoan airspace or in Samoan territory , he said .
'' There are a whole lot of issues around that - the aircraft and where that is from , where they have come from , where exactly she was born .
So there are a whole lot of issues around that to be addressed . ''
That issue was not necessarily one the police would take up .
'' The police concern is the welfare of the child and the offences that have been committed around the birth and the abandonment , '' he said .
Marion Heeney , regional director of Child , Youth and Family , told NZPA the mother has agreed to place the child temporarily in their care .
'' The child will be placed with family in Auckland and we will continue to work closely with those involved to determine what long term arrangements are best for this baby , '' Ms Heeney said
A spokeswoman from New Zealand Immigration said they would not comment on individual cases .

In my previous post I was talking about steps one needs to undertake and data they get when profiling an application .
Now let ’s use this knowledge in practice .
I will be profiling Blaze , a 2D physics engine based on Box2D .
It was actually Mason ’s newsgroup post which inspired me to blog about profiling .
Prerequisites
To repeat my experiments you will need :
DMD compiler with Tango .
The simplest is to get it from the Tango official download site .
The “ current release ( including DMD 1.033 ) ” is what I ’m actually using .
Here is a direct link to download it .
Blaze source code .
In this article I ’m hacking trunk revision 409 so I encourage you to get the same version .
You can do so using either a Subversion client : svn checkout -r 409 http://svn.dsource.org/projects/blaze/trunk blaze or the Blaze repository browser , the “ Download in other formats : Zip Archive ” link at the bottom of the page .
Here ’s a direct link if you wish to save some browsing .
Derelict .
I ’m using trunk revision 336 , but I think any latest version will suffice .
Get it either via SVN svn checkout http://svn.dsource.org/projects/derelict/trunk derelict or from the repository browser , direct link included .
SDL.dll .
You can get a pre-built Windows version from the official downloads page .
That ’s it .
You wo n’t be needing anything else .
Make sure you put DMD ’s bin on the path , the rest of this article assumes that .
Build
Blaze comes with a testbed application and a set of DSSS configuration files .
I wo n’t use DSSS though .
I ’ll use Jake instead — a minimalistic , one - step build utility similar to Bud and Rebuild but more robust because it relies upon DMD ’s built - in dependency resolution system .
And it ’s simple .
And it ’s bundled with the Tango distribution mentioned above so you should already have it .
In fact I ’m using a similar tool of my own which works not only with Tango but with Phobos as well , but that ’s another story .
Jake is perfectly sufficient in the scope of this article .
I use the following command to build the testbed application :
jake blazeDemos.d - O -release - inline - profile - I..\ blaze - I\home\snake\src\derelict\DerelictGL -I\home\snake\src\derelict\DerelictUtil - I\home\snake\src\derelict\DerelictGLU -I\home\snake\src\derelict\DerelictSDL
Of course you should change path to Derelict according to your setup .
The build takes around 12 seconds on my 1.8 GHz Core2 Duo laptop .
Do n’t forget to copy the sdl.dll into the same directory where you build the testbed app .
Now we are ready to
Profile !
Run the blazeDemos.exe .
The app starts with the default domino demo .
It runs slowly , much slower than without profiling enabled .
The profiling process only measures performance of code actually executed , so it is essential to let the application run for some time .
I suggest you wait for everything stops moving except for the pendulum , then close the application .
This way many code paths are executed and therefore measured , and the results are easy to reproduce .
It takes around 30 seconds on my laptop for the scene to completely stabilize .
Let ’s see what we ’ve got .
I want generic performance information now so I skip right to the overal timings section of trace .log starting with a row of equal signs .
Here ’s what I ’ve got in several first lines :
======== Timer

Let ’s see .
First comes __Dmain , that is , main ( ) .
It ’s Tree Time is 9718996 microseconds which is almost 10 seconds . main ( ) is the application starting point , so everything else is called from it — the testbed application is single - threaded .
The main ‘s tree time must be the total program execution time .
But the measured program run time was 30 seconds .
Why ’s the difference ?
This is because profiling comes with huge overhead .
That ’s profiling code which runs 2/3 of the time .
Without profiling the app would run 3 times faster .
This is no surprise .
What actually surprises is the Func Time column .
Func time is the total time spent in the body of this function but not in any functions it calls .
As I explained earlier , this time is used to sort the function table to put most time consuming functions at the top of the list .
And the top one is main !
Even more , according to the measurements main consumes more than 20 % of execution time :
2.1 / 9.72 * 100 = 21.6 %
This is really unexpected .
main ( ) contains the most outer loop , body of which executes once per frame , and it only calls a small number of other functions .
It ’s easy to see the main loop activity looking at main ‘s fan out :

main ( ) only calls 9 other functions , less than 900 times each .
This should n’t take more than complicated collision detection .
But it does .
Here ’s why .
Profiler takes into account only functions compiled with - profile switch .
It is blind towards any other functions .
If an instrumented function calls a non-instrumented one , the call time is added to the caller ’s “ func time ” as if the called function were inlined .
Looking at main ( ) , it is easy to come with a list of potentially offending functions :
glClear ( ) A direct call to OpenGL dynamic library SDL_WM_SetCaption ( )
A direct call to SDL dynamic library SDL_GL_SwapBuffers ( )
Again , a direct call to SDL dynamic library
Let ’s wrap each into a separate D function , like mainClean , mainCaption , and mainSwap .
Do n’t forget to disable inlining for this trick to work .
Important !
Every run of an instrumented application updates trace.log and trace .
def to include new results .
But the application does n’t check whether trace.log and trace .
def are from the same application .
If they ’re not , or if they ’re from another build of the same application , they get corrupted .
I think there should be some sort of a check sum at the start of these files so that app can compare against its own check sum and overwrite incompatible files completely .
For now though , always erase trace.log and trace .
def after re-building your test application .
The trick works .
main ( ) takes 93rd place , consuming only modest 21 milliseconds .
And the first place is taken by mainCaption .
That ’s it .
Setting window caption takes more than 1/5 of execution time of an optimized application .
Finding out why setting caption is so slow is probably out of scope of this article .
I ’ll just assume there is a reason and hack around it .
There is a variable , frames , which is set to zero every time a frame rate counter , fps_ , is refreshed .
So I ’ll add a check and will only update caption when this happens .
Here ’s the final code fragment :
if ( frames == 0 ) { // Create fps caption char [ ] title = " Blaze Demo - Press Keys 0 - 9 , q-e To Switch Demos - FPS : " ; title ~= Integer . format ( new char [ 32 ] , fps_ ) ; void mainCaption ( ) { SDL_WM_SetCaption ( toStringz ( title ) , null ) ; } mainCaption ( ) ; }
Rebuild , erase trace .* , run .
Now mainCaption is at 28th place with only 1/4 second consumed .
The first place is rightly taken by solveVelocityConstraints which is probably computation - intensive .
Final test , with inlining .
Compile , erase , run :

Afterword
You ’ve probably heard of premature optimization .
It ’s when you waste time optimizing something just to find out later that it did n’t matter , but you could have had a 20 % speed gain by writing a simple if in a completely different place you could n’t even think of .
Or when you realize that you must optimize your heavily optimized algorithm differently , essentially re-implementing it .

Synchronizing UNIX files
Using cp , tar , and rsync
File synchronization is the process of adding , changing , or deleting a file in one location , and having the same file added to , changed , or deleted at another location .
This article covers three utilties , cp , tar , and rsync , that can aid with synchronization of UNIX files .
While cp and tar commands have limited synchronization abilities , rsync provides you with the full range of options ; however , all three have their place .
Bare copy with the cp command
Although the cp command is not a true synchronizing command , it is probably the easiest method of copying files from one location to another .
For single file copies , cp is obviously very efficient : $ cp source destination .
To copy an entire directory structure you can use the -r option to recursively copy an entire directory structure from one place to another : $ cp -r source destination .
Performing this type of copy only copies the files and directories recursively .
The permissions , ownership , and other meta- information about the file is not copied over to the destination .
You can use the -p option to preserve the ownership , permissions , and times for each file and directory you copy : $ cp - pr source destination .
Using cp is the easiest and most recognized method of copying files , but cp can be inefficient and , without the use of a remote filesystem solution like NFS , it is not possible to copy the directories to a remote system .
Using tar
The tar utility , short for tape archive , was originally created as an efficient method for turning a directory structure ( including the files , and file metadata ) into a binary stream that could be written to a tape during the course of a backup .
Typically you use tar to create a . tar file that contains the directories that you want : $ tar cf mydir.
tar ./ mydir .
The c option tells tar to create a new archive , and the f option to use the next argument as the name of the archive file to be created ( mydir.tar ) .
Any remaining arguments are used as the files or directories to be included in the archive .
The tar command automatically traverses a directory structure , so if you specify a directory as one of the files to be included , tar will include the directory , and all of the other files and directories that that directory contains .
One of the important aspects of tar to be aware of is that the pathname that you supply is treated as absolute .
That is , if you specify the full directory location to tar , for example the /etc directory : $ tar cf etc.tar /etc .
Then , by default , tar will extract the files to their absolute location .
For example , if the same archive was extracted : $ tar xf etc.tar .
Then the files and directory structure would be recreated within the /etc directory .
This could be destructive ( in that you may be overwriting files in /etc that you wanted to keep ) .
There are two ways round this .
The first is to use GNU tar , which supports the -- strip - path option to remove elements from the path that is extracted .
A simple alternative is to change to the parent directory and then use a relative path ( see Listing 1 ) .
Listing 1 . Changing the parent directory and using a relative path
$ cd / $ tar cf etc.tar ./etc
When the archive file is extracted , the files will be recreated in their relative location again .
You can use this trick to help with synchronizing directories .
Because tar creates a byte stream of the directory structure , you can combine tar with pipes to copy files from one location to another : $ tar cf - ./etc |( cd / backup ; tar xf - ) .
The " - " in each case specifies that tar should use the standard output ( when writing ) or standard input ( when reading ) .
The parentheses effectively execute the statements in a subshell .
In looking at the previous code before the pipe , a byte stream of the files is created on the standard output .
After the pipe , change to a different directory and then extract the byte stream again from the standard input .
To ensure that the ownership and permissions of a file are retained , you can use the p option to preserve the metadata for each file and directory : $ tar cfp - ./etc |( cd / backup ; tar xfp - ) .
Once you have this basic structure in place , you can perform more complex operations .
For example , you can copy only the files that have changed since a specific time : $ tar cf - -- newer 20090101 ./etc |( cd / backup ; tar xf - ) .
This code creates a copy of the files that have changed since 1st January 2009 .
Files can also be synchronized to a remote host by combining the operation with rsh or ssh : $ tar cfp - ./etc |( ssh user@host -- tar xfp -) .
Using ssh and tar in this way is a good way of creating a backup of your local machine on a remote host .
But there are more efficient methods of synchronizing the information .
Intelligent synchronization with rsync
The main problem with the previous alternatives for synchronizing files is that they copy every single file ( and the associated directory structure ) .
While this is fine if you are creating a new copy of the information , if you are synchronizing the information between one directory and another , then this is inefficient .
Consider that you could have a directory with 10,000 files using 100GB .
If you changed one file of about 10 MB in size using cp or tar , you would have to recopy the whole 100 GB of files all over again .
In a backup situation , copying that quantity of information is excessive .
You want the backup to complete as quickly and effectively as possible .
Obviously , if you know which file has changed you could only copy that , but you wo n't always know this information .
Even using the -- newer option with tar is limited because you must know exactly when the last modification was performed .
The rsync tool addresses this issue by comparing the directory structure and the individual files and determining where the differences between the source and destination directories are located .
Once it is clear which files and directories have changed , it then copies only those items to the destination .
Even further , rsync will use a similar algorithm on individual files and only copy the portions of the file that have changed .
In the simplest form , you can use rsync to synchronize from one directory to a new directory like this : $ rsync -r a b .
This will create a new directory , b , containing a copy of the directory structure in directory a .
The -r option tells rsync to recurse into the directories and copy the entire structure .
However , if the destination directory already exists , then a new directory , a , within the destination directory , b , will be created containing a copy of the files .
This can have some unfortunate side effects .
For example , if you are copying multiple directories to a backup directory , Listing 2 will do what you want .
Listing 2 . Copying multiple directories to a backup directory
$ mkdir backup $ rsync dira backup $ rsync dirb backup
Listing 2 creates a directory , backup / dira , containing a copy of the original dira .
It also creates a directory , backup / dirb , containing a copy of the original dirb .
The following does something different : $ rsync dira backup / dira .
The first time you use it , the script will do what you expect .
But the second time you use the option , rsync will create the destination directory within the specified destination directory , creating the directory backup / dira / dira .
Not only does this not create the structure you want , it also doubles up the contents ( one of which will never be synchronized ) .
There are some additional options you may want to specify when using rsync .
The default synchronization does not copy the file metadata , and treats certain special files ( like links ) as if they were normal files .
The main options you want to use are :
-- delete --
Delete files that do n't exist in the source anymore in the destination directory .
The default mode is to simply synchronize file changes and create new files .
By default , if a file has been deleted in the source , then it is just ignored .
With this option , you create an identical synchronization .
-- Delete files that do n't exist in the source anymore in the destination directory .
The default mode is to simply synchronize file changes and create new files .
By default , if a file has been deleted in the source , then it is just ignored .
With this option , you create an identical synchronization .
-- recursive --
Recursively copy directories and files .
-- Recursively copy directories and files .
-- times --
Synchronize the modification and creation times for each file and directory .
-- Synchronize the modification and creation times for each file and directory .
-- owner --
Preserve the file ownership , if possible .
-- Preserve the file ownership , if possible .
-- group --
Preserve the group ownership , if possible .
-- Preserve the group ownership , if possible .
-- links --
Copy symbolic links as symbolic links , instead of copying the file data and interpreting the source links .
-- Copy symbolic links as symbolic links , instead of copying the file data and interpreting the source links .
-- perms --
Preserve the file permissions .
-- Preserve the file permissions .
-- hard - links --
Preserve hard links ( by creating a hard link on the destination ) instead of copying the file content .
Some of these options are only valid and achievable if the two systems have identical configurations .
For example , the file ownership and group ownership settings can only be preserved if the source and destination machines use the same IDs for the same user .
In addition to the local copies , rsync also performs remote copies using ssh .
To use , you need to specify the username and remote host before the source or destination directory .
For example , to synchronize a directory to a remote system as user , do the following : $ rsync -- recursive dira user@remote : / backup / dirb .
If you have not set up password - less ssh connections , then you will be prompted for the remote password .
If you have , then this can be an effective way of performing an unattended overnight backup .
The same user / password combination can also be used for the source , allowing you to copy from a remote source to a local directory : $ rsync -- recursive user@remote : dira dirb .
When copying to a remote system over the Internet , the -- compress option will also compress the information before it is transferred over the network , which is much more efficient than a raw byte copy .
Of course , when copying to a remote system , you probably do n't want to copy the bare files if they contain sensitive information .
For this , you need to use encryption .
Encrypting files for synchronization
One of the more common reasons for using a file synchronization solution is to create an exact backup of the files so that you can copy or recreate elements of the directory structure in the event of a problem .
The rsync tool is ideally suited for this , since it can efficiently copy only the files that have changed between two directories .
More usefully , because rsync can synchronize to a remote system , you can use it to create an automatic and remote backup without having to separately copy the files to the remote system .
One limitation of this process is that the copy that you create will not be encrypted .
If you are copying the files to a remote system , it can be a remote system on a computer that may be accessible to others ( for example on a hosting service ) and you want to be sure that the files , even if they were reached , could not be read .
Using rsync only , it is not possible to encrypt the files .
Nor is it possible to take advantage of the algorithm used by rsync to encrypt only the files that have changed since the last synchronization .
However , by wrapping the execution of rsync into a script , it is possible to take advantage of the output from rsync to create a secondary copy of the files that are then also encrypted .
The basis of the script is to create two copies of the original directory structure .
The first copy is the reference copy , and contains an exact duplication of the directory structure .
This is needed so that when the directories are synchronized again , the source and destination files can be compared and the list of differences determined as usual .
Using the -- itemize - changes option to rsync , rsync will create a reference list of what is happening to each file during synchronization .
The output details whether the file has changed ( or is new ) or whether the file has been deleted .
You can see an example of this in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . Itemized changes from rsync
.d..t......
t1/a/ * deleting t1/a/3 .d..t......
t1/b/ >f.st......
t1/b/1 >f+++++++++
t1/b/6
The lines starting with .d. indicate a new directory or directory change .
The * deleting line indicates that a file has been deleted in the source .
The >f lines indicate that there has been a change in the file or a new file has been created ( with >f ++++++++ ) .
By parsing this output file , you can determine the changes between the source directory and destination reference directory .
Once the changes have been determined , an identical encrypted version of the original file can be created in a third directory .
The itemized changes are used to only encrypt ( or delete ) files that have changed since the last synchronization .
You cannot use the encrypted version of the directory to perform the synchronization directly , as the encrypted version of the file will always be different to the source .
The full script is shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 . Full script
#!/usr /bin/perl use warnings ; use strict ; use File : : Basename ; use File :: Path ; my $ source = shift ; my $ dest = shift ; my $ encdest = shift ; if ( ! defined ( $ source ) || ! defined ( $dest ) || ! defined ( $encdest ) ) { print " Error : Not enough arguments !
" ; print " Usage : $ 0 source destination encrypteddest
" ; exit ( 1 ) ; } print STDERR " Running rsync between $ source and $ dest ( $encdest )
" ; system ( " rsync -- delete --recursive -- times - og -- links -- perms " . " -- hard - links -- itemize - changes $ source $ dest " . " >/tmp/$$.rsynclog 2>&1 " ) ; open( DATA , " /tmp /$$.rsynclog " ) or die " Could n't open the rsynclog
" ; my @changedfiles ; my @delfiles ; while ( < DATA > ) { next if ( m/ sending incremental file list / ) ; chomp ; last if ( length ( $_ ) == 0 ) ; my ( $ changes , $ filename ) = split ; push @changedfiles , $ filename if ( $ changes =~ m/^> f/ ) ; push @delfiles , $ filename if ( $ changes =~ m/^\*del / ) ; } close ( DATA ) ; my $ counter = 0 ; foreach my $ file ( @changedfiles ) { if ( -f " $ dest / $ file " ) { my $ sourcename = encode_filename ( " $ dest / $ file " ) ; my $ destname = encode_filename ( " $ encdest / $ file " ) ; my $ dirname = dirname ( " $ encdest / $ file " ) ; mkpath ( $ dirname ) ; system ( sprintf ( ' cat " %s " |openssl enc - des3 ' . '- pass file :/ var/lib/ passphrase - a > " %s " ' , $ sourcename , $destname ) ) ; $ counter + + ; } } my $ delcounter = 0 ; foreach my $ file ( @delfiles ) { unlink ( " $ encdest / $ file " ) ; $ delcounter + + ; } print STDERR " Finished ( changed : $ counter , deleted : $ delcounter )
" ; unlink ( " / tmp /$$.rsynclog " ) ; sub encode_filename { my ( $ filename ) = @_ ; $ filename =~ s/ /\\ /g ; $ filename =~ s/'/\\'/g ; $ filename =~ s / " /\\ " /g ; $ filename =~ s/\(/\\(/g ; $ filename =~ s/\)/\\) /g ; $ filename =~ s/&/\\&/g ; $ filename =~ s/#/\\#/g ; return ( $ filename ) ; }
The script is relatively simple and very straightforward to use .
To run , you specify the source directory , the destination directory for the reference files , and the destination directory for the encrypted version of the files : $ rsyncrypt source destination destination.enc .
The first part of the script performs a basic rsync between the source and destination directories to determine the changes ( see Listing 5 ) .
That operation generates the itemized file ( in /tmp ) to document the changes .
Listing 5 . Performing a basic rsync between the source and destination directories
system ( " rsync -- delete -- recursive -- times - og -- links -- perms " . " -- hard - links -- itemize - changes $ source $ dest " . " >/tmp/$$.rsynclog 2 >&1 " ) ;
Next , the list of changes is parsed and a list of the files that have been changed and deleted is generated ( see Listing 6 ) .
Listing 6 . Parsing the list of changes
while ( < DATA >) { next if ( m/ sending incremental file list / ) ; chomp ; last if ( length ( $_ ) == 0 ) ; my ( $ changes , $ filename ) = split ; push @changedfiles , $ filename if ( $ changes =~ m/^>f/ ) ; push @delfiles , $ filename if ( $ changes =~ m/^\*del / ) ; }
For each file that has changed , the encrypted version is created by reading the reference version and creating the encrypted version within the encrypted destination directory ( see Listing 7 ) .
Listing 7 .
Creating the encrypted version of each file that has changed
foreach my $ file ( @changedfiles ) { if ( -f " $ dest / $ file " ) { my $ sourcename = encode_filename ( " $ dest / $ file " ) ; my $ destname = encode_filename ( " $ encdest / $ file " ) ; my $ dirname = dirname ( " $ encdest / $ file " ) ; mkpath ( $ dirname ) ; system ( sprintf ( ' cat " %s " |openssl enc - des3 ' . '- pass file :/ var/lib/ passphrase - a > " %s " ' , $ sourcename , $destname ) ) ; $ counter + + ; } }
The filename has to be encoded , because we are using a shell to perform the actual encryption .
Some special characters , which would otherwise be interpreted by the shell , need to be escaped .
For the actual encryption , openssl is used with a simple text file ( in / var / lib / passphrase ) containing the passphrase that will encode the information .
You could also create or use a specially generated key to perform the operation , or any other encryption command that you want to use .
Finally , because the source directory may have files that have been deleted from the original , any deleted files are also removed from the encrypted directory contents ( see Listing 8 ) .
Listing 8 .
Removing deleted files from the encrypted directory contents
foreach my $ file ( @delfiles ) { unlink ( " $ encdest / $ file " ) ; $ delcounter + + ; }
The script is very effective and the only downside is that it requires two copies of the information ( the reference directory and the encrypted version ) instead of just one .
Also , to simplify the process , the permissions , ownership , and timestamp information is not synchronized to the encrypted version , but this would be comparatively easy to add .
But the benefit is that because rsync is used is generate the list of changes the number of files that need to be encrypted is dramatically reduced , and the new encrypted version of the files can be synchronized to your remote host using the same optimized algorithm to only transfer encrypted files that have changed since the last synchronization .
Summary
This article looked at a number of different methods for synchronizing files .
The basic cp is not really synchronization , but it is useful for a direct copy .
It is comparatively too time - consuming and inefficient for a true sync operation .
With tar , you can take advantage of a time reference point to only copy files changed after a specified period , but this too has limitations if the changes are less obvious or not picked up by such a blanket comparison .
The rsync tool is a much better solution for proper synchronization .
It performs extensive checks and comparisons that truly compare the source and destination directories and allow for synchronizations efficiently , even over a network or public connection .
For security , you can combine this functionality with an encryption phase to ensure that the remote file is unreadable without the correct passphrase or cryptographic key .

She recently had another child , by the ex-husband who came into her hut one night , but the baby died of malaria .

Kenya , once a nation of so much promise , remains a land divided .
The country pulled apart in 2008 , when hundreds of thousands of people fled ethnically mixed areas for the safety of homogeneous zones .
This was the result of a disputed election in which the president , Mwai Kibaki , was widely believed to have rigged the results to stay in power .

Mrs. Macharia remembers her daughter screaming : “ Mommy , do n’t leave me here !
I do n’t want to die ! ”
But people inside the church panicked and Mrs. Macharia , 41 , was trampled at the door .
She spent the next six months in the hospital , getting skin grafts and other painful operations .
She wants plastic surgery , she said , “ because I do n’t like the way people look at me now . ”

“ Now , we ’re beggars . ”
He said he could never go back to Eldoret because his neighbors had turned on him and they were like “ snakes . ”
The Macharias are worried about their 12 - year - old son , James .
He , too , was trapped in the church that day , though he survived .
“ He wo n’t stop talking about killing , ” Haron said .
“ He wants to burn everything . ”
Over the summer , Kenyan children rioted in hundreds of schools , ransacking classrooms and burning down dorms .
Ostensibly , the children were upset about exams .
In truth , it may have been a collective outburst after all the violence they had witnessed .
Mrs. Awino ’s two children , Wycliffe and Cynthia , were victims of revenge .
Mrs. Awino , 24 , is a Luo , a large and historically marginalized ethnic group , and while she was at work on Jan. 27 , 2008 , packing roses for $ 2 a day , a Kikuyu mob burned the house where her children were staying .
Her losses do not seem to end .

“ I would , ” she said .

Mike Pollock says he has had cluster attacks since he was seven Every day for the past 20 years Mike Pollock has had at least two headaches , often three .
One day he had 15 separate headaches .
There is no cure and he has been in so much pain that he has considered suicide .
" I have been suffering from cluster headaches , also known as suicide headaches , since I was seven , " he said .
" Up until 20 years ago I was what is called episodic - the headaches would come for four to five months every couple of years and then they would go away .
Then I went permanent and have had attacks every single day .
" I did seriously contemplate suicide .
Cluster headache is often said to be the most severe pain that humans have
Professor Peter Goadsby
" The pain is unbearable - you go round with your hand to the pain and scream . "
He recalled how one morning at 4.30 , as he stood in his back garden having an attack , he seriously thought about taking his own life .
" I went into the garage because I knew there was some rope there , but my son had used the rope to tie all his toys up .
" At that time it was such a bad headache I would have done it .
The irony was that five minutes later the attack finished . "
Battery pack Mike , 63 , from Hertfordshire , said the only thing that can alleviate the excruciating pain are injectable drugs .
But , because he can take no more than two a day , he often has to endure untreated attacks .
He was among the first patients to try a technique called occipital nerve stimulation in which a nerve in the brain is connected to a battery pack in the body that can send electrical impulses to quell the pain .
CLUSTER HEADACHES
Cluster headaches come in clusters several times a day for a number of days , weeks or months .
They may not then occur for months or years , but for some people there 's no pain - free period .
Headaches can last from 15 minutes to three hours .
They affect men more than women .
" It did help a bit but I had it taken out after two years because the battery did not work for long and I did n't want to go into hospital every year for a battery change , " Mike said .
He has found other methods help to ease his condition , but nothing is completely effective .
" I have also found oxygen helps , but it is slow to work .
" The injections work every time , but you can only use twice a day .
I have boxes and boxes of the injections and have used them in cars , planes , trains . "
Mike , a company director , said his condition affected every aspect of his life .
" I have not had a drink for 20 years as you have to avoid alcohol , which makes life boring , but you will never find a cluster headache sufferer who is either in cycle or chronic who drinks , " he said .
" I always have an attack about an hour - and - a - half after going to sleep , one between 8.30 am and 9 am every morning and maybe one in the afternoon .
" It is depressing because driving to work every day I know I am going to get a headache .
" Every woman I have ever spoken to says the pain is worse than childbirth . "
Conference hope
In May a conference run by Ouch ( the Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headaches ) and the Migraine Trust is set to highlight the problems of rarer headaches and tell sufferers about new treatments and research .
Peter Goadsby , professor of neurology at the University of California , San Francisco , and the Institute of Neurology , London , will speak at the conference .
" Cluster headache is often said to be the most severe pain that humans have , " he said .
[ Patients ] often feel very isolated as they try to cope with the dramatic impact the condition has on their quality of life
Wendy Thomas , Migraine Trust " I have seen just over 1,000 patients and sadly that statement seems correct .
" Patients simply do not report pains that are worse .
So think of the worse thing that has ever happened pain - wise , childbirth included , and cluster headache is worse still . "
Professor Goadsby said the conference was vital to highlight an under - recognised condition .
" To put it in perspective , it is about as common as multiple sclerosis , " he said .
Wendy Thomas , chief executive of the Migraine Trust , said : " More than 120,000 people in the UK suffer from cluster headache and there are many others with rare types of headache .
" They often feel very isolated as they try to cope with the dramatic impact the condition has on their quality of life .
" It is a great breakthrough for us to be staging the world 's first conference on rare headaches along with Ouch - another member of Headache UK - at which health professionals and sufferers will hear new research about treatment options .
" The conference is of vital importance as it will stimulate global research to get more insight into these devastating conditions . "

State faces new budget shortfall , new tax ideas
Assembly minority leader Mike Villines ( R - Clovis ) leaves his office near the Assembly chamber in Sacramento , California , on Monday , September 15 , 2008 more than an hour before the expected vote on the state budget .
The state budget is more than two months overdue .

Less than a month after the Legislature approved more than $ 12 billion in tax increases to help bridge a $ 41 billion budget deficit , Democratic lawmakers have proposed more tax and fee measures they say would curb devastating cuts to state programs .
The proposals include a 25 - cent fee for shoppers who use plastic bags ; a tax on cigarettes to fund programs discouraging tobacco use ; a $ 50 per ounce tax on marijuana ; a higher income tax for the rich to help pay for schools ; a tax on oil produced in California ; and a tax on pornography .
Many of the tax ideas are not new , reappearing in the state 's legislative pipeline each year with little success because they lacked support from Republican lawmakers to clear the two - thirds majority required for approval .
But with Friday 's forecast of state finances by the nonpartisan legislative analyst , which showed California will face an additional $ 8 billion shortfall in the fiscal year that begins July 1 , new revenue ideas have to be considered , some lawmakers say .
" I think we 're in a period in time where everything 's on the table .
We 're going to be $ 8 billion down before the ink dries on the current budget , " said Assemblyman Curren Price , D - Inglewood ( Los Angeles County ) .
Price 's AB462 would increase the income tax by 1 percent for residents earning more than $ 1 million a year .
The state 's public university systems would receive 60 percent of the funds generated by the tax increase , while K - 12 schools would get 40 percent .
The bill also calls for a five - year tuition freeze at California 's public universities .
" Education should be our prime priority , " Price said .
" We frequently are shipping funds away from education .
My proposal is one way of ... trying to insulate education funds from those kinds of cuts . "
But getting Republican support will not be easy .
Assembly GOP leader Mike Villines of Clovis ( Fresno County ) , one of three Assembly Republicans who voted for taxes in the latest budget package , said taxes to close additional budget shortfalls can't be on the table .
Sen . Dennis Hollingsworth , R- Murietta ( Riverside County ) , who became the Senate minority leader last month after a coup during the marathon budget session , said passing any more taxes or fees " would add insult to injury to California taxpayers . "
Even Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , is skeptical that the Legislature would approve new tax measures because too few Republicans support them .
" Frankly , our focus ought to shift to tax reform , " he said .
" That means seriously addressing the volatility in our tax system .
That means realigning the relationship between state government , local government and school districts .
Whoever is providing the service ought to be able to raise revenue . "
Last month 's passage of the $ 12.5 billion tax package as part of the budget " was an exception to the rule because of the magnitude of the problem , " Steinberg said .
Still , the Senate leader said he will not discourage lawmakers from introducing tax bills .
" It does n't bother me that members are introducing their ideas .
That 's the messy democracy that we live in , " he said .
Sen .
Denise Ducheny , D - San Diego , chair of the Senate Budget Committee , said she introduced a bill to increase the income tax for the rich while lowering the rate for middle - income families to " start a public discussion " on changes to the state 's tax system .
" I think we do need to talk about tax reform , " she said .
Ducheny 's idea is to lower the top income tax rate , which is 9.3 percent , to 9 percent for those at the bottom of that bracket , while increasing wealthier taxpayers ' rates as high as 11 percent .
The bill would generate another $ 2 billion a year for the state , she said .
But not all ideas are about raising taxes at the state level .
AB1342 , by Assemblywoman Noreen Evans , D - Santa Rosa , would give local governments greater authority to increase taxes by allowing cities and counties to raise vehicle license fees and income taxes .
Evans , who also chairs the Assembly Budget Committee , said cities and counties need such flexibility , especially when the state is slashing spending .
" This is a tool that we can give them to return some level of accountability and responsiveness to cities and counties , " she said .
Es fängt damit an , dass die Pressestelle der Polizei Hamburg heute ( also kein Aprilscherz ) eine Pressemitteilung mit folgendem I nhalt herausgibt :
Während der Streifenfahrt fiel den Beamten in der Straße Eichwischen eine Drossel auf .
Lediglich der Kopf des Tieres ragte aus dem Sieldeckel hervor .
Die Beamten beobachteten das Tier und stellten fest , dass sich ein Drama abspielte .
Die Drossel befand sich in höchster Lebensgefahr .
Sie war vermutlich zu dick für das enge Sielloch .
Vom Erscheinen der Beamten beeindruckt , zog sich die Drossel in die Kanalisation zurück und gegenseitig observierte man sich .
Letztlich entschlossen sich die Beamten , den Sieldeckel mit einer ausgefeilten 4 - Fingertechnik herauszuheben .
Die gegenseitige Observation wurde fortgesetzt und nach 10 Minuten hatte die Drossel derart viel Mut gesammelt , dass sie in unbekannte Richtung davonflog .
Eine Vernehmung war nicht mehr möglich .
Die Beamten hätten gern erfahren , wie die Drossel in das Siel gekommen ist .
Auf Fahndungsmaßnahmen wurde verzichtet .
Soweit so gut .
Sehr schön geschrieben aber noch nicht wirklich ein Grund sich in Tüdelkram einzuschleichen .
Wenn dann allerdings eine Berichtigung zu o.A. Pressemitteilung nachgeschoben wird , hat sich die Polizei Hamburg so viel Mühe gegeben , dass sie es verdient haben , hier erwähnt zu werden :
Nach der Rettung eines Vogels in Hamburg - Rahlstedt prüft die Polizei derzeit , ob nicht doch noch Fahndungsmaßnahmen eingeleitet werden müssen .
Das
Tier verfügt vermutlich über eine hohe kriminelle Energie .
Gegenüber den Beamten hat sich der Vogel als Drossel ausgegeben .
Kriminaltechniker sind sich jedoch sicher , dass es sich um einen Star handelt und die Angabe Drossel nur eine Schutzbehauptung war .

A female cheetah cub is being hand raised at the San Diego Zoo 's Wild Animal Park .
The Cheetah is one of three cat species with semi-retractable claws .
Designed to aide them in high speed pursuits , the claws are always visible .
The unnamed cub was born as a single cub to first - time mother Kenya .
Because singletons are often rejected and Kenya does not have previous experience , animal keepers stepped in to assist .
The cub was born Feb. 18 , 2009 and can be seen at the Wild Animal Park 's Animal Care Center .

Fifteen people have been killed by a teenage gunman who went on a rampage in south - west Germany , officials say .
Among the dead were nine pupils , eight of them girls , and three teachers at the Albertville secondary school in the town of Winnenden , north of Stuttgart .
The gunman , a 17 - year - old former pupil named as Tim Kretschmer , entered the school at about 0930 ( 0830 GMT ) in black combat gear and began shooting .
He fled in a stolen car , but killed himself after being cornered by police .
TIM KRETSCHMER
Left Albertville school last year after passing exams Officials said he was an ordinary pupil who had received good reports from school German media reported he had begun an apprenticeship Lived in the village of Leutenbach A keen table - tennis player , who aspired to become professional
Attack raises gun law questions
Officers say he shot himself dead after being wounded by the police .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the shootings as " incomprehensible " .
" It is unimaginable that in just seconds , pupils and teachers were killed - it is an appalling crime , " she told reporters .
" This is a day of mourning for the whole of Germany . "
Officials earlier said a 10th pupil had died raising the death toll to 16 , but this was later revised down to nine pupils .
Baden - Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Heribert Rech said eight of the nine pupils who were killed were girls but he refused to speculate as to whether females in particular were targeted .
Three teachers and three passers - by were the others who died .
Police said the suspect was killed during a shoot - out with officers in the town of Wendlingen , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) away from the school .
He had fled there in a car he had hijacked after the school shooting - killing a passer - by as he made his escape , police said .
Spokeswoman Inka Buckmiller said the shoot - out took place at a car showroom , where two bystanders were killed and two police officers were injured .
" The suspect also died as a result of this shooting , " she said .
Baden - Wuerttemburg state governor Guenther Oettinger said police killed the suspect , but officers later said he had killed himself .
One woman said her daughter had been in the school at the time of the shooting , and she was now at home " trembling and crying " .
" She and her friend jumped out of the window .
Her friend is now in hospital ...
We hope that she 's all right , " the woman said .
" What can I say ?
I do n't understand the world any more . "
' Heart - breaking '
Regional police chief Erwin Hetger said the teenager " went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath " , according to the Associated Press .
" I 've never seen anything like this in my life , " he said .
Mr Hetger said informing the families of what had happened was a heart - breaking job .
" Our thoughts are concentrated on the parents .
I have looked some of them in the eye , and it 's damn hard to keep your composure , " he said .
Local media reported that police had raided the suspect 's house and recovered 16 weapons .
The teenager 's father , thought to be a prominent businessman in the area , was reported to be a member of a local shooting club .
Eckehard Weiss , who coached Tim Kretschmer at table - tennis , told the BBC that he had been a relatively normal boy .
Mr Weiss said he had wanted to be a professional table - tennis player and had even played a match last weekend .
Taiwan 's Buddhist Master Sheng - yen dies The Buddhist Channel , Feb 3 , 2009 TAIPEI , Taiwan -- Taipei - Sheng
Yen , one of Taiwan 's four most respected Zen Buddhist masters , died of natural causes at the National Taiwan University Hospital Tuesday at the age of 79 .
<< Venerable Master Sheng-yen
" He died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome at around 4 pm ( 0800 GMT ) , " said a spokesman of the Dharma Drum Mountain , a Zen Buddhist centre established by the eminent monk .
Rated as one of Taiwan 's 50 most influential people in 400 years , Sheng established the mountain retreat in Taipei County in 1989 to promote Zen Buddhism .
President Ma Ying - jeou said in a statement he was " saddened and shocked upon hearing the news " about the death of Sheng - yen , who the president said is " good at the use of language to touch people " .
" The concept of spiritual conservation he advocated is not only religion but philosophy and attitude of living , " Ma said , referring to the monk 's relentless efforts to press for peace and a simple way of living .
Jon Chait did a fine job dismantling the realist - run - amok Charles Freeman in the Washington Post yesterday , and highlights his most egregious belief , that the Communist regime in Beijing was within its rights to order the wholesale slaughter of students in Tiananmen Square .
These are Freeman 's words :
" [ T ] he truly unforgivable mistake of the Chinese authorities was the failure to intervene on a timely basis to nip the demonstrations in the bud , rather than -- as would have been both wise and efficacious -- to intervene with force when all other measures had failed to restore domestic tranquility to Beijing and other major urban centers in China .
In this optic , the Politburo 's response to the mob scene at ' Tian ' anmen ' stands as a monument to overly cautious behavior on the part of the leadership , not as an example of rash action .
. . .
" I do not believe it is acceptable for any country to allow the heart of its national capital to be occupied by dissidents intent on disrupting the normal functions of government , however appealing to foreigners their propaganda may be .
Such folk , whether they represent a veterans ' ' Bonus Army ' or a ' student uprising ' on behalf of ' the goddess of democracy ' should expect to be displaced with despatch [ sic ] from the ground they occupy . "

This week , engineer Adam Wilson made global headlines by updating Twitter using his brainwaves .
“ USING EEG TO SEND TWEET ” he explained .
Wilson ’s achievement was actually pretty trivial .
He used a system called BCI2000 , found in hundreds of laboratories across the globe , that can do the job of a keyboard for any software program .
But it was significant precisely because it was trivial : mind - reading tech is going to have a massive impact this year .
In the coming months , cheap headsets that let you control technology with the electrical signals generated by your firing neurons will go on sale to the general public .
Our relationship with technology – and our brains – will never be the same again .
Escaping the lab
Researchers have developed systems that read brainwaves – in the form of electroencephalogram ( EEG ) signals – in order to help people suffering from disabilities or paralysis control wheelchairs , play games , or type on a computer .
Now , two companies are preparing to market similar devices to mainstream consumers .
Australian outfit Emotiv will release a headset whose 16 sensors make it possible to direct 12 different movements in a computer game .
Emotiv says the helmet can also detect emotions .
Compatible with any PC running Windows , it will ship later this year for $ 299 ( see image ) .
They have shown off a game where the player moves stones to rebuild Stonehenge using mind power alone ( see video ) .
Californian company NeuroSky has also built a device that can detect emotions : the firm says it can tell whether you are focused , relaxed , afraid or anxious , for example .
Rather than selling it directly to the public , NeuroSky is licensing its set - up to other companies , including Mattel , Nokia and Sega .
Mattel , for example , will soon sell a game which involves players levitating a ball using thought alone ( see video ) .
Mind hacks
These devices are remarkably cheap , especially when compared to the price tags on research - grade EEGs , which can run to hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Emotiv ’s headset will retail for $ 299 , while Mattel ’s game will cost just $ 80 .
At such low prices , these dirt - cheap brain interfaces will likely be popular – and not just with people who want to play with them .
Consider what happened when the most revolutionary interface of recent years appeared – the wireless controller of Nintendo ’s Wii games console .
Legions of hackers started experimenting ; and millions of people have now seen how the interface can be repurposed to make an industrial robot play tennis ( with video ) , track a person ’s head movements and make a normal TV display 3D images ( video ) .
You can expect some similarly mind - blowing hacks to result once Emotiv and NeuroSky release their devices .
That ’ll certainly help make for some compelling viewing on YouTube and accelerate the development of brain controllers .
But the most interesting consequence of the coming flood of brainware is n’t technological at all .
Parents , and anyone else whose schooldays are fading into memory , will be acutely aware that today ’s youngsters have a facility with interactive technology that can be acutely disorienting .
There ’s already speculation about how the internet , gaming and other interactive technology is changing the brains of the next generation – albeit not necessarily well - founded .
But for the generation after that , it will be normal to control machines using thought alone .
Given the awesome adaptability and plasticity of the human brain , how will our biological hardware and software adapt ?

This is not a repeat of Circuit City yet , but Best Buy is starting to head down the same road with the job eliminations and wage slashes .
Thousands of Best Buy store employees will see their pay slashed or their positions eliminated .
Best Buy would not disclose the number of people affected , but New York investment firm Sanford Bernstein said in a research note Wednesday that as many as 1,000 assistant store managers would have their positions cut .
Up to another 8,000 senior sales associates would be demoted to regular sales positions that would pay 25 percent to 50 percent less than their previous jobs .
The severity of the job and wage cuts led some industry analysts to draw comparisons to Circuit City Stores Incorporated ’s ill - fated efforts nearly two years ago to slash costs by eliminating thousands of its higher - paid , but most experienced , salespeople .
Service levels suffered , hastening Circuit City ’s demise , some analysts argue .
The Richmond , Va. - based retailer went out of business earlier this year .
In the future , as long as they do n’t fire all their senior staff to save money , which results in horrible customer service , they should n’t suffer the same fate as Circuit City .
It ’s not just the economy that is hurting Best Buy .
Why get in your car and go to the store to buy a DVD ?
Just download a movie to your computer , you save time and money .
The same with music , why buy the CD when all you want is one or two songs .
Pay a few dollars and download the music , verses paying anywhere from $ 13.99 to $ 19.99 a CD , that is a huge savings for someone on a tight budget .
Nasty story .
Fortunately , the state handled it well .
Well , they apparently did n’t handle it well when they were first informed of the problem – it took a third person to tell them that they too were offended before the state felt they “ had ” to act .
Dunkley and his father , Daniel Reddy , who live in Tulsa , went to Broken Arrow on Tuesday night for a hunter safety course normally required to get an Oklahoma hunting license … .
But when father and son arrived at the lesson , the volunteer instructor , Kell Wolf , asked if any of the students voted for President Barack Obama .
Reddy , a transplanted Californian — and former Marine — raised his hand .
According to Reddy and others in the room , Wolf called Obama “ the next thing to the Antichrist ” and ordered Reddy and Dunkley from the room .
When Reddy refused , Wolf said he would not teach “ liberals ” and would cancel the course if Reddy did n’t leave .
So Reddy and Dunkley left , as did a few others .
In early February , President Obama was looking for a place to symbolize the recession .
He wanted to rally support for his proposed $ 800 billion bailout of the economy , a bailout that he admitted would send the Federal government ’s annual deficit to $ 1.7 trillion in fiscal 2010 .
He chose Elkhart , Indiana , which advertises itself as the recreation vehicle capital of America , and hence the world .
Elkhart ’s economy has collapsed .
There is 15 % unemployment and no hope in sight .
For years , the RV industry grew .
The scene in About Schmidt was representative .
The retired middle manager bought an RV for his retirement .
Then his wife died .
He went out on the open road by himself .
He went back to his home town .
Nothing remained of the places he remembered .
This industry is today representative of the profound economic breakdown we are experiencing .
This is not business as usual .
The industry is close to collapse .
In 2005 , the Indiana Business Magazine ran a story : “ On a roll ?
What ’s behind the dramatic growth of Indiana ’s RV industry ?
Baby Boomers buying vs. higher fuel costs . ”
It reflected the final year of Greenspan ’s decade - long bubble economy .
Like California housing , the RV industry seemed to levitate high above economic rationality .
It would seem like the past few years should have been tough on the recreation - vehicle business .
The economy was in recession for a time and sluggish even longer , and gas prices have been moving ever - upward , which would seem like a poor climate for selling expensive discretionary items that do n’t exactly sip gas .
Yet the RV industry — which is centered in Indiana — in recent years has enjoyed dramatic growth .
And as sales have grown , Indiana ’s share of the business has increased as well .
These words now seem as realistic as a real estate salesman ’s promise to some young couple that paying ten times annual income for a house was a good bet .
The home would appreciate .
The article reported that in 2004 , RV manufacturers shipped 370,000 units .
Of these , 236,000 were made in Indiana .
The article quoted Dennis Harney , executive director of the Recreation Vehicle Indiana Council and the Indiana Manufactured Housing Association .
“ The RV industry directly employs nearly 20,000 people and indirectly employs another 20,000 , ” he says , adding that most of the jobs pay well .
“ The RV industry enjoys a lack of competition from foreign producers — very few RVs are imported from competing nations .
Although we ’re a quiet industry and the business is distributed among a number of manufacturers , there are many states that would relish the opportunity to have an industry like this . ”
Not these days .
He went on to say , “ I think it ’s a critical industry for the state that ’s enjoying growth .
I think the future is very , very bright for the industry . ”
Fast forward to November 2008 .
The RV Dealers Association sent out a press release in the form of a letter to President - elect Obama .
It was a plea for a government bailout .
There are an estimated 12,332 RV - related businesses in the nation with combined revenues of $ 37.5 billion in 2006 , including a combined payroll of nearly $ 5 billion for American workers in the manufacturing , retail and service sectors — employment which , as with boating , totals some 150,000 .
One out of every 12 American households owns an RV — a category that ranges from inexpensive pop-up tent campers to large , self - propelled motorhomes .
Today , there are 8.5 million RVs in operation .
It noted that Elkhart , Indiana , had the highest unemployment rate in the nation .
It still does .
Banks had ceased lending on RVs , the letter said .
I wonder why .
Here is a product whose largest market share is people age 55 and older .
The recession is cutting into their income .
The falling stock market is cutting into their retirement portfolios .
Consider the economics of an RV .
Like any vehicle , RVs depreciate rapidly .
They are consumer goods .
They are not capital goods .
They cost a lot to operate .
Gasoline is only part of it .
There are maintenance expenses .
Also , they suffer from competition from the used RV market .
No one needs an RV .
Anyone can get into a car and drive to a vacation spot .
He can pay retail for a motel , eat fast food , and fish for two weeks .
Then he can go home .
The cost will be far less than the depreciation of an RV plus 6 miles per gallon .
The economics of the RV have little to do with efficiency .
It has to do with lifestyle .
There lies the rub .
A LOST LIFESTYLE
Over the last 18 months , Americans over age 55 have suffered a reversal in their capital that has not fully registered psychologically .
They will not be able to afford a comfortable retirement .
This was true 18 months ago , just less obvious .
Very few Americans enjoy a combination of private pensions , annuities , and Social Security payments sufficient to fund what Social Security says retirees need : at least 70 % of their pre-retirement income in the last year of employment .
They are oblivious to this assessment on the Social Security website .
Today , about half of all workers are covered under an employer - sponsored pension , and many people are not saving as much as they should .
While Social Security replaces about 40 percent of the average worker ’s pre-retirement earnings , most financial advisors say that you will need 70 percent or more of pre-retirement earnings to live comfortably .
Even with a pension , you will still need to save .
If you will not have a private pension , you will need to save more — and start saving sooner .
Yet throughout Greenspan ’s bubble economy , the savings rate of American households fell , going negative in 2005 .
The boom fooled Americans who owned stocks that they were getting richer .
They were n’t .
They were merely benefitting from the greater fool theory of investing .
That theory has brought down the real estate bubble .
There will be further declines .
It has ended the stock market mania .
And it has just about shut down Elkhart , Indiana .
Americans have not yet recognized what has been done to them by the Federal Reserve System and the highly leveraged banks and hedge funds that thought the good ship Effortless Wealth had come into port .
The hot - shots did not understand Ludwig von Mises ’ theory of the business cycle as the product of central bank monetary inflation .
They never saw it coming .
Now the investors who believe the same dream , but without multimillion dollar severance deals , have seen their dreams called into question .
They have not yet dumped their stocks .
They have just stopped buying as many .
The fall of 55 % by the Dow and the S&P 500 was not accompanied by a huge sell - off .
The decline has been one of dribbling away .
The dreams of would - be retirees have not yet been smashed .
They have merely dribbled away .
The crash has not yet come .
It will .
STAGES OF DECEPTION
First , there is a dream : easy prosperity .
This dream is funded by fiat money .
Next , there is a boom : easy prosperity .
This boom is funded by fiat money .
Next , there is reality : the stabilization of fiat money .
Next , there is recession : the end of the dream .
Then what ?
In the conventional scenario , there is recovery .
But recovery since Greenspan arrived as chairman in October 1987 has always been based in more fiat money .
That was his solution to the 22 % one - day fall in the stock market in 1987 .
That was his solution to Bush I ’s recession in 1991 .
That was his response to the recession of 2001 and 9 - 11 .
Again and again , fiat money solved the problem .
It brought back the recovery .
It is not working this time .
The federal funds rate is at 0 % .
The economy is still falling .
The Federal deficit is headed toward $ 2 trillion a year .
No recovery is visible .
When recovery comes , it will be accompanied by price inflation on a scale never seen in peacetime America .
Those who rely on pension payments and annuities will see their income shrink .
They will be the primary victims .
The target market of the RV industry will be the victims of the recovery ’s familiar solution : fiat money .
They will remain the victims for the foreseeable future .
The people at CNBC do not see this yet .
The high - paid hot shots on Wall Street who lost their jobs may suspect that the gravy train has gone off the rails , but what can they do about it ?
They are trained in high finance , and high finance is now an appendage of the Federal government .
The era of salaries has replaced the era of stock options and bonuses .
The Democrats have vowed that the old days will not return .
I do n’t think the Republicans are likely to run on a platform to bring back the world that ended in 2008 .
When they run on a platform to end Medicare , I will be impressed .
In 2016 or 2017 , and maybe earlier , Medicare goes into the red .
At that point , political reality will meet actuarial reality .
There will be an inter-generational pile - up .
The geezers will lose .
They wo n’t have the votes in Congress .
People over 55 today will spend their golden years in the equivalent of Elkhart , Indiana .
YUPPIE RESTAURANTS
Drive up Main Street in your town .
All over America , Main Street — where people drive at 4 p.m. — is the same : Lowe ’s , Home Depot , Office Max , Office Depot , Wal - Mart , McDonald ’s , Burger King , Taco Bell , Chili’s , and T.G.I. Friday .
Wal - Mart is doing well .
It is the place that sells what people really need , and it sells it cheap .
McDonald ’s stock price has held up .
Like Wal - Mart , it sells cheap .
Fast food saves time and is addictive : high fat .
People want it , and it does not cost much .
But yuppie restaurants that sell lifestyle are headed for trouble .
People do n’t have to go to them .
They offer atmosphere , but it ’s expensive .
It ’s not like the neighborhood tavern , which rests on friendship .
It ’s ersatz community .
Television screens with no sound are all over the walls , often tuned to different sports events .
Silent sports are ersatz sports .
If I were advising a fund manager on what to sell , it would be any company whose income relies on restaurants with silent TVs .
There are no TVs at McDonald ’s and Taco Bell .
Those places make it on volume .
There is no community .
They get you in and move you out .
Only the playgrounds for children keep anyone there for long .
Nobody takes his wife to a fast food restaurant for a romantic evening .
He may take her so that she can get a break from the day ’s routine .
That incentive will keep fast food restaurants solvent after the yuppie restaurants have closed .
Liquor sales keep yuppie restaurants going , but liquor by the drink is expensive .
If someone wants to drink , he can do it at home cheaper .
The crunch will come .
The yuppie restaurants have survived so far , but they will face the reality of discretionary income .
It ’s shrinking , and it ’s beginning to go into savings .
The more fearful Americans become , the higher the percentage of discretionary income they will save .
CONCLUSION
We have not yet seen real fear .
We will .
We have not yet seen Main Street in the condition that it has become in Elkhart , Indiana .
We will .
President Obama told Elkhart that he had not forgotten the city .
I suspect that by now , he has .
The photo op is over .
The bailout was passed .
The economy is falling .
The least of his concerns — and yours — is the fate of a city that bet its future on the RV industry .
In every recession , there are permanent victims .
The RV industry is the poster child as this recession ’s permanent victim .
The industry is finished .
Its target market — retirees and people who dream of becoming retirees — is also a permanent victim .
The dream of freedom , permanent income , no job , no kids at home , and the open road was nice while it lasted , but it ’s over for most people .
As they die or get shipped off to retirement homes , their children will sell the old folks ’
RVs for pennies on the dollar .
The supply of used RVs will be strong for the next decade .
Elkhart , Indiana is the symbol of the boom gone bust .
If life on the road has been your dream ever since Then Came Bronson , find a new dream .
As with Bronson , the show has been canceled .

ROME 
The rehabilitated bishop at the heart of a Vatican uproar for denying the Holocaust has been dismissed as the head of an Argentine seminary .
The seminary announced the dismissal on Sunday in a statement that said the bishop , Richard Williamson was no longer the director of the La Reja seminary on the outskirts of the Argentina capital .
He has said the “ historical evidence ” argues against Nazi gas chambers and said that only 200,000 to 300,000 people died in concentration camps in the Holocaust .
Bishop Williamson ’s views “ in no way reflect the position of our congregation , ” the Rev. Christian Bouchacourt , the director of the Latin America branch of the Catholic Society of St. Pius X , said in the statement .
He expressed “ sadness ” that the Bishop Williamson ’s statements had prompted accusations that “ discredited ” the congregation .
( CNN ) --
Thousands of villagers in rural Alaska are struggling to survive , forced to choose between keeping their families warm and keeping their stomachs full , residents say .
Villagers in Emmonak , Alaska , must travel to the store and to hunt using a snowmobile now that the river has frozen over .
Harvested nuts and berries , small game animals , and dried fish , are the only things keeping some from starving .
To get to the nearest store , Ann Strongheart and her husband , who live in Nunam Iqua , Alaska , take an hour - and - 15 - minute snowmobile ride to Emmonak , Alaska .
Their town does not have a store of its own .
Normally , they would each ride a snowmobile , in case one broke down .
But now , they can't afford to waste the fuel , so they just take one and hope for the best .
At the store , the Stronghearts buy groceries and supplies for the family for the week , which cost more than $ 400 .
They buy only as much as their snowmobile can carry .
In many stores , two pounds of cheese costs between $ 15 and $ 18 , milk costs $ 10 a gallon , a five - pound bag of apples costs $ 15 , and a dozen eggs costs $ 22 -- more than double the price in the area just two years ago .
Watch one resident tearfully describe the challenge for his family »
Many area residents do n't even bother with fruits and vegetables which can be damaged by freezing on the trip home .
After shopping , the Stronghearts pack their groceries into boxes , tie them to the snowmobile and begin the 25 - mile trek home , passing moose , rabbit and fox tracks along the way .
Watch how families are forced to travel in the villages »
The trip sets them back about $ 50 in fuel alone .
On top of high food prices , some residents are paying nearly $ 1,500 a month to heat their homes .
The Strongheart 's live in one of a group of Native American communities along the Yukon - Kuskokwim Delta .
Strongheart and other residents of these villages of 200 to 800 residents , are feeling the impact of a devastating perfect storm of events .

Commercial fishermen could n't make money from the seasonal king salmon harvest this year , because there was barely enough fish for subsistence .
In fact , most fishermen lost money .
Then a brutal early winter brought the longest cold snap in five years .
In September the temperature in many villages dropped as low as 20 degrees , a record low for many , according to the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy .
The 1,200 - mile Yukon River , which the villages use as a highway , froze completely in September , at least two months earlier than usual .
That left residents cut off from some basic necessities , and forced them to have pricey bulk fuel flown in .
These residents and their descendants have lived for hundreds of years in the Yukon Delta , which Emmonak resident Cindy Beans describes as something out of National Geographic .
Watch how rural Alaskans celebrate their culture »
Though they send their kids to school , many speak the native Yup 'ik , and live a much simpler life than even urban Alaskans .
They have always had the comfort of food around them -- whatever they can pick , catch and hunt .
" But in order to have access to all the subsistence food , you have to be able to get out there and hunt for it , " Beans said .
And that requires them to go out on their snowmobiles , which means using more fuel .
The community is always gathering food , Beans said .
" All summer long we are putting away fish for the winter , by fall working on moose , then setting nets under the ice for winter time .
But now , this food which used to supplement groceries , is all that people have since they can't afford to buy food at these prices . "
So residents have been forced to rely more on these subsistence methods .
Beans said her brother walks three miles in - 20 degree weather to check on nets under the ice for fish .
The fish is a staple they need to keep themselves fed .
" The life out here has always been hard , it 's just that its a lot harder now , " she said .
Emmonak resident Nicholas
Tucker wondered if others were feeling the impact , so he broadcast an inquiry via VHF radio , one of the common ways to communicate in the village .
Tucker said many of them sobbed as they radioed him back .
" His family has been out of food for quite some time now , " Tucker wrote about one resident in a letter sent to legislators and the media .
" Their 1 - year - old child is out of milk , [ he ] can't get it and he has no idea when he will be able to get the next can . "
" There are days without food in his house , " Tucker wrote .
A single father with five children choked back tears as he told Tucker of his struggle to help his kids .
" Right now , we can't eat during the day , only at supper time , " Tucker wrote of the man .
" If there had been no school lunch our kids would be starving . "
Many of the tribal leaders said they are begging the state and federal governments to do something to help .
George Lamont , tribal administrator in Tuluksak , Alaska , said because of the crisis and villagers ' inability to pay their utilities , he fears many may have their electricity shut off .
Alaska has given many residents $ 1,200 energy rebate checks , but residents say it barely helps them with one month 's heating costs .
The state says its doing what it can to help from food drops to extending the moose - hunting season and is encouraging residents to apply for grants and loans under existing programs .
Aid agencies , including the Red Cross , are n't an option right now -- the Alaska Red Cross said they could n't help until a disaster is declared .
Watch how families feel about what Gov. Plain and the state are doing »
But the state has n't declared an emergency yet , and it can't because of a state statute that requires the average income levels in the villages to drop below $ 26,500 -- whatever the cost of living .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's office said the state is trying to find a way to free up government help .
" Local government specialists in the state Department of Commerce , Community and Economic Development continue to crunch numbers and seek creative approaches to finding a statutorily acceptable way to justify a disaster declaration , which would open the door to federal aid , as well , " deputy press secretary Sharon Leighow said .
Leighow said Palin is sending her new rural advisor , John Moller , to the area next week , accompanied by representatives of the Alaska Food Bank .
Sen . Lisa Murkowski , R - Alaska , asked the Bureau of Indian Affairs to step in and help the towns most in need .
" I find it ironic , tragically ironic , that it takes an economic downturn in the rest of the country for this Congress to consider an economic stimulus for Indian Country , " she said during a Senate Committee on Indian Affairs economic stimulus hearing .
The villagers hold out hope that the state or federal governments can come through .
" People have really been looking forward to some emergency assistance , " Lamont said .
After hearing the stories from his neighbor , Tucker said it 's clear help is needed now .
" We have remained quiet , cried and suffered in silence , " he said .
" So now , this is our simple cry to others for help . "
It 's always a little frustrating when you 're trying to write the most beautiful code you can , but because of a limitation in the programming language you have to roll up your sleeves and brute force it .
As programming technologies mature , I find this to be rarer and rarer .
Sadly , Dan M. inherited a project in which some cutting - edge features were n't available .
For example , the cutting - edgiest feature conceivable : arrays !

In our attempt to make sense of the past , we often subdivide history into convenient decades , centuries , and millennia , only occasionally reflecting that these periods of time are fairly arbitrary , based on the number of fingers on two human hands and the Earth ’s revolution around the Sun .
Less arbitrarily — but under the assumption that historical eras are engraved with the influence of powerful leaders — we give periods the names of kings and queens ( Elizabethan , Georgian , Victorian ) or American Presidents ( the Age of Jackson , the Clinton Years ) .
If we ’re instead looking for deeper sweeps of ideas and trends , we might favor the Renaissance , the Enlightenment , or the Industrial Revolution .
Sometimes individual years are so laden with significant events that they seem like hinges in the otherwise continuous flow of history .
One such year in Continental Europe was 1848 ; another was 1968 with its uprisings in Paris , Prague , Chicago , and two American assassinations .
I think 1859 might be regarded as one of these unduly significant years .
At first it seems unpromising , being relatively free of screaming front - page headlines .
Perhaps the most famous event of 1859 was John Brown ’s raid on Harpers Ferry and his subsequent execution .
The 1859 event with the greatest long - term impact might very well be the beginning of the American petroleum industry with a commercial well in Pennsylvania .
But 1859 weighs heavy in history in quite a different way : with the publication of a number of profoundly influential books , mostly in England .
What number of profoundly influential books am I talking about precisely ?
Well , if you want to be picky about it , just two : On Liberty and Origin of Species , and I do n’t think anyone would deny how these books both heralded and shaped the modern age .
But if you assume that these two books are part of larger patterns and trends , very many other books published in 1859 can be viewed with the same perspective and revealed to have similar themes .
I believe it was in 1859 that Victorian Belief began losing its battle with Victorian Doubt , making the year a milestone in the transition from a religious perspective of the world to a secular perspective .
The year 1859 was 150 years ago , and while sesquicentennial celebrations are as arbitrary as anything else , the 150th anniversary of that momentous year provides me with a convenient excuse to examine several books published at that time .
The first of these books was published on January 15 , 1859 , but it was a tiny book , more like a pamphlet , just 36 pages with a title page that announced :
RUBÁIYÁT
OF
OMAR KHAYYÁM ,
THE ASTRONOMER -POET OF PERSIA .
Translated into English Verse .
LONDON :
BERNARD QUARITCH ,
CASTLE STREET , LEICESTER SQUARE
1859
Or maybe it was n’t published on January 15 .
Some sources indicate that the book was published on February 15 .
The British Museum received a copy on March 30 .
No translator was indicated on the cover of the book or inside its pages .
After an 11 - page Introduction was the first of 75 numbered four - line poems :
I .
AWAKE !
For Morning in the Bowl of Night
Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight :
And Lo !
The Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultán ’s Turret in a Noose of Light .
Omar Khayyám ( literally “ Omar the Tentmaker ” ) was born in Nishapur , Persia , in 1048 and died in 1131 .
At the time of Omar ’s birth , Persia had largely been converted to Islam , but some remnants of Zoroastrianism remained .
Omar was familiar with the mathematics and philosophy of Ancient Greece , and wrote works on algebra , geometry , astronomy , and philosophy .
He is believed to have been responsible for the Jaláli calendar , which significantly reformed the Islamic calendar in accordance with very accurate estimations of the length of the solar year .
Omar does not seem to have been a pious Muslim .
It is very likely that among the Greek philosophy he studied was that of Epicurus , which incorporated an agnosticism regarding the governance of the universe and the existence of an afterlife with recommendations for a happy and tranquil life through moderation and the friendly company of others .
His poetry is in a form called the rubái ( the plural is rubáiyát ) , which is roughly equivalent to a quatrain with a rhyming scheme of AAAA or AABA .
II .
Dreaming when Dawn ’s Left Hand was in the Sky
I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry ,
“ Awake , my Little ones , and fill the Cup
“ Before Life ’s Liquor in its Cup be dry . ”
In the year 1461 , someone created an exquisite little hand - written rubáiyát with 158 of Omar ’s poems .
Several centuries later it was purchased by Sir William Ouseley ( 1769 – 1842 ) , a collector of Persian manuscripts , who then left it along with many other items to the Bodleian Library at Oxford .
In 1856 , a scholar named Edward Cowell ( 1826 – 1903 ) encountered this book .
Cowell had taught himself Persian and other languages at a very young age .
He had recently been persuading his friend Edward FitzGerald ( 1809 – 1883 ) to learn Persian , and showed FitzGerald the book .
III .
And , as the Cock crew , those who stood before
The Tavern shouted — “ Open then the Door !
“ You know how little while we have to stay ,
“ And , once departed , may return no more . ”
Edward FitzGerald came from a well - to - do family and might have easily spent his years in a life of pure leisure .
Certainly he had many illustrious friends , including Thackeray , Tennyson , and Carlisle .
He wrote some poetry and prose but in his forties FitzGerald found his true calling in translation , beginning with six plays by the seventeenth - century Spanish dramatist Calderón .
FitzGerald ’s philosophy of translation was at the far end of the literal - to - free continuum .
He struggled to convey the overall spirit of the work .
I suppose very few People have taken such pains in Translation as I have , though certainly not to be literal .
But at all Cost , a Thing must live : with a transfusion of one ’s own worse Life if one ca n’t retain the Original ’s better .
Better a live sparrow than a stuffed Eagle . [ letter of April 27 , 1859 ]
In the poetry of Omar Khayyám , Edward FitzGerald seemed to discover a kindred spirit .
FitzGerald responded to Omar 's special mix of fatalism , skepticism , and carpe diem attitude , and strove to bring that out even if it were necessary to take such liberties as mashing two of Omar ’s quatrains together into one .
While the poems within a Persian rubáiyát are traditionally organized by by alphabetizing the last letter of the rhyming syllable , FitzGerald arranged them in a dramatic arc that begins with morning and ends with the setting Moon .
In the broader context of Persian poetry , Omar Khayyám is not considered first rate ; it is often said that FitzGerald ’s sympathetic translations actually improved the poems .
VII .
Come , fill the Cup , and in the Fire of Spring
The Winter Garment of Repentance fling :
The Bird of Time has but a little way
To fly — and Lo !
The Bird is on the Wing .
FitzGerald clearly recognized the subversive nature of these poems in the context of Victorian piety .
In January 1858 , he submitted 35 of the “ less wicked ” quatrains to Fraser ’s Magazine , but there was still some question whether the religiously skeptical poems were suitable material for a family publication .
Fraser ’s Magazine never published the poems so FitzGerald decided to have them published himself .
He added 40 more to bring the total to 75 , and arranged with the publisher Bernard Quaritch to print 250 copies .
The book did not indicate that he was the translator ; FitzGerald chose to remain anonymous .
That first edition of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám is obviously very rare now .
Scans of one copy can be viewed here .
( Quatrain XIV has what appears to be a hand correction of a known misprint . )
This provides a fine way to read the first edition as it was originally printed .
Over the 150 years since there have been zillions of other editions of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám , but unless you indulge in the Critical Edition edited by Christopher Decker and published by the University of Virginia Press in 1997 , you might unknowingly be missing something .
I have a St. Martin ’s Press edition of 1983 with lovely woodcuts by Edmund J. Sullivan that reproduces the first edition , but with a somewhat different Introduction and none of FitzGerald ’s Notes .
A Penguin Poetry Library edition of 1989 omits FitzGerald ’s Introduction as well as most of the Notes .
A 1990 Dover Thrift Edition claims to be “ an unabridged and unaltered republication of the first and fifth editions ” but omits FitzGerald ’s Introduction and abridges the Notes .
Of the 250 printed copies of the first edition , FitzGerald took 40 and left the other 210 for Bernard Quaritch to sell .
The price was 1 shilling and nobody was interested .
Apparently some copies where used for scrap paper .
In 1861 , the price was reduced to 1 pence and the books were put outside the store in a bin .
At that price , fortunately someone bought a copy and got it to Dante Gabriel Rossetti , who then bought copies for his friends Algernon Swinburne and Robert Browning , and from there copies landed in the laps of George Meredith , Edward Burne - Jones , William Morris , Richard Burton , John Ruskin , and others , and from there the popularity increased , eventually influencing Thomas Hardy , T.S. Eliot , and Ezra Pound , among many others .
XI .
Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough ,
A Flask of Wine , a Book of Verse — and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness —
And Wilderness is Paradise enow .
If that sounds a little “ off ” it is because FitzGerald constantly fiddled with his translations .
In the second edition ( 1868 ) he changed it to “ Here with a little Bread beneath the Bough / A Flask of Wine , a Book of Verse — and Thou… ” and for the third edition ( 1872 ) it became the more familiar “ A Book of Verses underneath the Bough , / A Jug of Wine , a Loaf of Bread — and Thou … ” Side - by - side comparisons can be found at TheRubaiyat.com , but many people prefer the first edition to later ones .
FitzGerald ’s identity as the translator was not publicly disclosed until 1875 .
XII .
“ How sweet is mortal Sovranty ! ” — think some :
Others —
“ How blest the Paradise to come ! ”
Ah , take the Cash in hand and wave the Rest ;
Oh , the brave Music of a distant Drum !
You can see how readers accustomed to finding strict Christian piety in their literature and poetry might be unnerved to see a recommendation to ignore any thoughts of the afterlife and live instead for today .
XXIII .
Ah , make the most of what we yet may spend ,
Before we too into the Dust descend ;
Dust into Dust , and under Dust , to lie ;
Sans Wine , sans Song , sans Singer , and — sans End !
In the years since FitzGerald ’s translation , other translators have attempted to bring Omar Khayyám into English and other languages .
Some of these translations are much closer to the literal sense of the original , but it was FitzGerald ’s genius to combine specifically English locutions while maintaining an aroma of the exotic :
XXIX .
Into this Universe , and why not knowing ,
Nor whence , like Water willy - nilly flowing :
And out of it , as Wind along the Waste ,
I know not whither , willy - nilly blowing .
While the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám is no longer nearly as popular as it was a hundred years ago , many phrases are still recognizable and the poems are quoted in special circumstances .
This one was recited by President Clinton to the Washington Press Corps in the midst of Monicagate :
LI .
The Moving Finger writes ; and , having writ ,
Moves on : nor all the Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line ,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it .
In FitzGerald ’s ordering , it is followed by another that portrays a universe indifferent to human needs or suffering :
LII .
And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky
Whereunder crawling coop’t we live and die ,
Lift not thy hands to It for help — for It
Rolls impotently on as Thou or I .
In an article “ The Failure of Omar Khayyam ” in the June 9 , 1912 New York Times , James J. Daly , S.J. disapprovingly quoted that quatrain as an example of the irreligion , skepticism , cynicism , materialism , and pessimism that Omar Khayyam and Edward FitzGerald had brought to the modern world .
He acknowledges , of course , that the Rubáiyát has its charms
There is nothing in it to shock elementary sensibilities ; its blasphemies are veiled ; its chirping staccato of agnosticism sounds harmless enough ; the sensualist and materialist in his singing wears an engaging air of sad mysticism ; the “ minstrel of smiling nihilism , ” as Lionel Johnson called him , is too pleasant and entertaining to be obviously dangerous .
And yet we doubt whether any poem of our times has wrought greater spiritual havoc .
In this essay we can get a little taste of the Culture Wars of the not - too - distant past , and perhaps understand better the nature of the subversive seeds Edward FitzGerald sowed in his Persian garden .
UN drops “ defamation of religion ” proposals – but offers no protection to non-believers or apostates
The proposals by Islamic countries for an international ban on “ defamation of religion ” , which were to be discussed at an anti-racism conference in Geneva called Durban II organised by the United Nations Human Rights Council , have been dropped from the meeting ’s draft declaration .
The defamation of religion text had been included after Islamic countries lobbied for them following a 2005 furore over Danish cartoons depicting Mohammed .
But alarm has spread through Western countries about the implications of the proposals and an increasing number of countries were threatening to boycott the meeting unless they were dropped .
The new draft proposals also dropped criticism of Israel and passages concerning reparation for slavery , which African countries had been seeking .
But some issues on which Western liberals were keen were also excluded : a proposal to challenge discrimination against homosexuals and protection for atheists or apostates .
The new draft , put together by Russian facilitator Yuri Boychenko with Belgian , Egyptian and Norwegian diplomats , has now to be examined by regional groups at the United Nations .
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said : “ We now have a good , solid basis for states to consider as we enter the final stretch leading up to the Review Conference .
I really hope that this marks the necessary breakthrough needed to achieve consensus on a text that must offer concrete help to hundreds of groups and millions of individuals who are subjected to racism and other forms of intolerance all across the world .
No continent , indeed no individual country , is free of these dangerous phenomena , and it would be inexcusable if states failed to reach consensus on such important issues . ”
But Roy Brown of the International Humanist and Ethical Union ( IHEU ) , who has done much to challenge and raise awareness of the draft document , said that although the new draft offers some protection to believers — paragraph 10 mentions only Christians , Muslims and Jews as being victims of “ phobias ” — it offers nothing to non-believers or apostates who are frequently under attack , especially in Muslim counties .
In a briefing paper for delegates , IHEU says :
We urge delegations to recognise that all are entitled to protection from discrimination , whatever their belief or lack of belief .
We therefore respectfully suggest either that the list of specific types of discrimination be deleted from paragraph 10 , or the list be expanded to include Atheists , unbelievers and apostates .
We are equally concerned that anti-Arabism is included in the list , while no mention is made of the anti-Westernism endemic in many parts of the world .
Again , we would respectfully suggest that either the reference to anti-Arabism be deleted or that the list should be extended to include anti-Westernism .
Last week Keith Porteous Wood , Executive Director of the NSS , had a meeting with top Foreign Office officials discussing IHEU ’s concerns about several aspects of the Durban II and wider concerns about the operation of the UNHRC .
These are issues on which he has worked with IHEU .
Following the Foreign Office meeting he said : “ Defamation of religion laws were top of the agenda and we were delighted to be assured of the determination to stand firm against them by the UK Government and its EU partners .
This is great news and the Government generously recognised the contribution we have made in drawing worldwide attention to the growing clamour of Islamic states for defamation proposals since they were first mooted . ”
More detail of the meeting will be circulated to members in the next quarterly Bulletin .
Roy Brown told Newsline from the UNHRC in Geneva that the revised document was “ close , but not close enough ” to being acceptable .
“ We ’ll keep plugging away , ” he said .
20 March 2009
In case you missed this weekend 's top story about Geithner 's much anticipated plan to save the financial world via smoke and mirrors , please consider Toxic Asset Plan Foresees Big Subsidies for Investors
The Treasury Department is expected to unveil early next week its long - delayed plan to buy as much as $ 1 trillion in troubled mortgages and related assets from financial institutions , according to people close to the talks .
Although the details of the F.D.I.C. part were still being completed on Friday , it is expected that the government will provide the overwhelming bulk of the money — possibly more than 95 percent — through loans or direct investments of taxpayer money .
The hope is that such a generous taxpayer subsidy will attract private investors into the market and accelerate the recovery of the country ’s banks .
The key protection for taxpayers , according to people briefed on the plan , is that the private investors will bid in auctions against each other for the assets .
As a result , administration officials contend , the government will be buying the troubled loans of the banks at a deep discount to their original face value .
Because the government can hold those mortgages as long as it wants , officials are betting the government will be repaid and that taxpayers may even earn a profit if the market value of the loans climbs in the years to come .
To entice private investors like hedge funds and private equity firms to take part , the F.D.I.C. will provide nonrecourse loans — that is , loans that are secured only by the value of the mortgage assets being bought — worth up to 85 percent of the value of a portfolio of troubled assets .
The remaining 15 percent will come from the government and the private investors .
The Treasury would put up as much as 80 percent of that , while private investors would put up as little as 20 percent of the money , according to industry officials .
Private investors , then , would be contributing as little as 3 percent of the equity , and the government as much as 97 percent .
Private Public Partnership Details Emerging
If this is n't Newspeak , I do n't know what is .
Since when is someone who puts 3 % of total funds and gets 20 % of the equity a " partner " ?
And notice the utter dishonesty : a competitive bidding process will protect taxpayers .
Huh ?
A competitive bidding process will elicit a higher price which is BAD for taxpayers !
Dear God , the Administration really thinks the public is full of idiots .
But there are so many components to the program , and a lot of moving parts in each , they no doubt expect everyone 's eyes to glaze over .
Zombies Win
The Geithner plan has now been leaked in detail .
It ’s exactly the plan that was widely analyzed — and found wanting — a couple of weeks ago .
The zombie ideas have won .
The Obama administration is now completely wedded to the idea that there ’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the financial system — that what we ’re facing is the equivalent of a run on an essentially sound bank .
As Tim Duy put it , there are no bad assets , only misunderstood assets .
And if we get investors to understand that toxic waste is really , truly worth much more than anyone is willing to pay for it , all our problems will be solved .
Krugman Followup
Why was I so quick to condemn the Geithner plan ?
Because it ’s not new ; it ’s just another version of an idea that keeps coming up and keeps being refuted .
It ’s basically a thinly disguised version of the same plan Henry Paulson announced way back in September .
Why am I so vehement about this ?
Because I ’m afraid that this will be the administration ’s only shot — that if the first bank plan is an abject failure , it wo n’t have the political capital for a second .
So it ’s just horrifying that Obama — and yes , the buck stops there — has decided to base his financial plan on the fantasy that a bit of financial hocus - pocus will turn the clock back to 2006 .
Brad DeLong ’s defense of Geithner
Brad gives it the old college try .
But he shies away , I think , from the central issue : the non-recourse loans financing 85 percent of the purchases .
Brad treats the prospect that assets purchased by public - private partnership will fall enough in value to wipe out the equity as unlikely .
But it is n’t : the whole point about toxic waste is that nobody knows what it ’s worth , so it ’s highly likely that it will turn out to be worth 15 percent less than the purchase price .
You might say that we know that the stuff is undervalued ; actually , I do n’t think we know that .
And anyway , the whole point of the program is to push prices up to the point where we do n’t know that it ’s undervalued .

All right , parents : these books may be beautifully decorated and fabulously imaginative and inspire creativity in your children — but BEWARE THE CONSEQUENCES .
Gwinna —
This book has incredibly beautiful illustrations , but has an unfortunate side effect of instilling in its readers an unshakable belief that they will , one day , sprout wings .
I myself have spent a rather large portion of time “ flapping ” my shoulder blades , but have never achieved lift - off .
Matilda —
If you have n’t read this , you have clearly been living under a rock .
And if you have n’t been living under a rock , you KNOW that this book will make you / your kid wander around wistfully asking mom if they qualify as a genius , and staring intently at glasses of water for hours .
The glass of water will never tip over , and your kid will forever have a slight , nagging inferiority complex .
Love You Forever —
This one is just terribly , terribly sad and you must be warned that your children will cry whenever they see the cover forever afterwards .
Including if they happen to look at it on Amazon during work .
Lord of the Flies — Ick , do you even have to ask ?
All I can think about is smashed heads and milky brains .
Where the Red Fern Grows —
More dying children — and this time , as an added bonus , dying dogs !
This book , predictably , gave me a lasting fear of all sharp objects — not just a fear of running with them , but a fear of standing in the same room as them .
Or even thinking about them in too detailed a manner .
Little Women —
Ever since Beth , dying , said “ I was never like the rest of you . . .
I never had plans for my life ” ( or something like that ) , my career indecision has weighed on me like a death sentence .
Doggies —
Yesss !
I was afraid I would n’t be able to find this one .
It starts out like this : “ One Dog — Woof ! ” .
The page reads , “ Two Dogs — Arf Arf ! ” ( or is it yip yip ?
I had it memorized , once upon a time ) .
IT IS AWESOME .
But your kid might bark a lot at inappropriate times .
For the rest of her life .
At the neighbors ’ dogs , for instance .
Or in the grocery store .

Okay , this is an obvious one , but it really got to me .
Now I feel guilty about hating spiders AND eating bacon .

Parents , if you leave your parenting books lying around , I PROMISE you that you will regret it .
I memorized this book when I was about 7 years old , and whenever my parents and I were in an argument , I would lecture them on how they were handling it wrong .
Sometimes I would direct them to the appropriate page in the book .
There is probably no better way to drive a parent crazy , and I ’ve gotta tell you — it felt goooooood .
How to develop a Firefox extension
Admit that you have always wanted to know how to develop a Firefox extension but never had the time to learn .
🙂
Here I will walk you through and at the end of the article we will have created a fully functional Firefox extension !
This article / topic is also available as a presentation on SlideShare
Our objective
We will create a Firefox extension to find all links in the current web page , highlight those which have a target attribute and alert you how many links it found .
The good part is that once you have done this , you have both an understanding of Firefox extension development as well as a blueprint for any extension you would want to develop in the future .
What you need – setting up the developing environment
First , let ’s start with setting up your development environment .
You need Firefox ( duh ) and basically whatever code editor you prefer .
Then , there are some recommended things to do to prepare Firefox :
Create a different development profile
The first step is to create a different profile in Firefox , since you will do some settings and changes that you probably do n’t want for your regular profile .
In my case , I ’ve created a new development profile named “ dev ” .
The steps to do this are :
Profile manager on Windows
Open the Windows Start menu and choose the Run option ( on Vista , it might not be there – just press Windows key + R in that case ) .
In the run dialog , write firefox - P and press enter / click OK .
Choose Create Profile in the dialog and follow the steps .
Profile manager on Mac
Open the Terminal ( located under / Applications / Utilities ) and type in / Applications / Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox - profilemanager .
Choose Create Profile in the dialog and follow the steps .
Profile manager on Linux
Open a terminal , use cd to navigate to your Firefox directory and then enter ./ firefox - profilemanager .
Choose Create Profile in the dialog and follow the steps .
Configuration settings for Firefox
Open Firefox through the Profile Manager ( process described above , or set the development profile as default during extension development ) .
Then enter about : config in the address bar .
It will warn you about changing settings , but it ’s ok since what you will do is only minor changes for development .
You can filter the existing settings , and if any of the below settings do n’t exist , you can just create them .
Recommended settings
These are good to enable extension errors in the Firefox Error Console ( Tools > Error Console ) , disable XUL caching and such .
javascript.options.showInConsole = true
nglayout.debug.disable_xul_cache = true
browser.dom.window.dump.enabled = true
Optional settings
These are n’t necessary , but they might help you out .
Personally , I do n’t use these .
javascript.options.strict = true
extensions.logging.enabled = true
Point your Firefox extensions directory to your extension
Instead of constantly preparing and reinstalling your extension , there ’s a simple way to add a pointer from your Firefox extensions directory to your code location .
To do this , you must first find your profile directory :
Find your profile directory
The profile directory is where you will find all the settings for your Firefox profiles , including extension information .
Find profile directory on Windows
In Windows 2000 and XP , open Explorer and go to C : \Documents and Settings \ [ your user name ] \Application Data\Mozilla \Firefox \Profiles and in Vista , go to C : \Users \ [ your user name ] \AppData \Roaming .
Find profile directory on Mac
Open the Terminal and type in cd ~/ Library / Application \ Support / Firefox / profiles / .
There you will find your Firefox profiles , and they will be named with letters and numbers , followed by a dot (. ) and then your profile name , e.g. 12a3bc4d.dev .
Find profile directory on Linux
Open a terminal and type in cd ~/.mozilla / .
In that location , you will find all your Firefox profiles , and they will be named with letters and numbers , followed by a dot (. ) and then your profile name , e.g. 12a3bc4d.dev .
Pointing to an extension
In your development profile folder , you will find a folder named extensions .
In it , you will have code for all your installed extensions .
Instead of placing your code there , you can create a pointer file .
Do that by creating a file with a unique name for you ( this will have to be the same as you chose for your em:id value in your install.rdf file – more on that below ) .
In the case of our example , create a file named linktargetfinder@robertnyman.com , without any extension , and in it just point it to where you will have your code , e.g. C:\extensions \ ( Windows ) or ~/ Sites / linktargetfinder / ( Mac ) .
Creating folder structure and files
What is needed to have a good base for your extension development , is to create the structure of the extension code .
Start by creating this hierarchy :
i nstall.rdf
We begin with the intimidating code of install.rdf .
This is where you will have all the meta information about your extension , which versions of Firefox it supports and other assorted information .
Our install.rdf will look like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> < RDF xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# " xmlns:em = " http://www.mozilla.org/2004/em-rdf# " >
< Description about=" urn:mozilla:install-manifest " > < em:id>linktargetfinder@robertnyman.com </em:id > < em:name > Link Target Finder</em:name > < em:version >1.0</em:version > < em:type>2</em:type > < em:creator > Robert Nyman</em:creator > < em:description >
Finds links that have a target attribute < / em:description > < em:homepageURL
>
http://www.robertnyman.com/</em:homepageURL>
<em:optionsURL>chrome://linktargetfinder/content/options.xul</em:optionsURL> < em:targetApplication > < Description > < em:id>{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}</em:id > < em:minVersion>2.0</em:minVersion > < em:maxVersion >3.1b2</em:maxVersion > </ Description > </em:targetApplication > </ Description > </ RDF >
Scary , right ?
Well , even if your not used to RDF it ’s not that bad at all .
Like most code , there ’s some mandatory information that you will never need to change , and then some of your own to sprinkle in .
The interesting parts for us are :
In the Description node
em:id
This is where you add your unique developer id , of your own choosing .
Note that this has to be the same as the pointer file you created above .
em:name
The name of your extension .
em:version Current version of your extension .
em:type
The type declares that is an extension , as opposed to , for instance , a theme .
em:creator
Well , you !
em:description Describes your extension functionality .
Will be shown in the Tools >
Add-ons window .
em:homepageURL
The URL of your extension ’s web site .
em:optionsURL
The URL to where you will have your file for editing options / preferences .
In the Description / em:targetApplication node
em:id
This value is the actual id of Firefox .
Change this if you want to develop for Thunderbird or something else .
em:minVersion
The minimum version of Firefox required to run the extension .
Valid Application Versions .
em:maxVersion
The maximum version of Firefox required to run the extension .
Valid Application Versions .
Read about more options in Install Manifests .
c hrome .
manifest
The chrome of Firefox is everything around the content window .
i.e. web browser toolbar , menus , statusbar etc .
The next file for our extension , which will probably feel a bit awkward to edit , is the chrome .
mainfest file .
This one , however , is in conjunction with install.rdf the key to how your extension will be added to Firefox , and how it will work .
Our chrome .
manifest file looks like this :
content linktargetfinder chrome / content / content linktargetfinder chrome / content / contentaccessible=yes overlay chrome://browser/content/browser.xul chrome://linktargetfinder/content/browser.xul locale linktargetfinder en-US locale / en-US / skin linktargetfinder classic / 1.0 skin / style chrome://global/content/customizeToolbar.xul chrome://linktargetfinder/skin/skin.css
So , what are all those options ?
Let ’s go through them :
content linktargetfinder chrome / content /
The path to where your extension content files will be found .
content linktargetfinder chrome / content / contentaccessible=yes
Same as the above , but when contentaccessible=yes is added , it allows Firefox 3 and later to access the extension ’s files and show them in the web browser ( like within a web page ) .
Found this excellent help through Web pages accessing chrome :// is forbidden .
overlay chrome:// browser/content/browser.xul chrome://linktargetfinder/content/browser.xul
The path to which file you will use to override web browser elements , and add items to the toolbar , menu and statusbar .
locale linktargetfinder en-US locale / en - US / Used for localization of content .
skin linktargetfinder classic / 1.0 skin / Skin reference .
style chrome://global/content/customizeToolbar.xul chrome://linktargetfinder/skin/skin.css
Style overlays for chrome pages .
More information can be found in Chrome Manifest .
c hrome folder
Ok , once the mandatory parts are out of the way , now things start to get interesting .
This is also when we start to look at XUL , which stands for XML User Interface Language .
It is developed by Mozilla to create interfaces in Firefox , Thunderbird etc .
First , within the chrome / content folder , create three files :
browser.xul
options.xul
linkTargetFinder.js
b rowser.xul
This is the file we will use to override some of the default look of the web browser , i.e. add a button to the toolbar , an item to the Tools menu and a statusbar icon .
Let ’s look at the complete browser.xul file and then break it down :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
<?xml-stylesheet href= " chrome://linktargetfinder/skin/skin.css " type =" text/css " ?>
<!
DOCTYPE linktargetfinder SYSTEM " chrome://linktargetfinder/locale/translations.dtd " > < overlay id =" sample " xmlns= " http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul " > < script src=" linkTargetFinder.js " /> < menupopup id=" menu_ToolsPopup " > < menuitem label= " &runlinktargetfinder ; " key = " link- target-finder-run-key " oncommand =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </ menupopup > < keyset > < key id =" link - target - finder - run- key " modifiers = " accel alt shift " key= " L " oncommand =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </keyset > < statusbar id =" status-bar " > < statusbarpanel id =" link-target-finder-status-bar-icon " class=" statusbarpanel-iconic " src=" chrome://linktargetfinder/skin/status-bar.png " tooltiptext= " &runlinktargetfinder ; " onclick =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </statusbar > < toolbarpalette id=" BrowserToolbarPalette " > < toolbarbutton id =" link-target-finder-toolbar-button " label= " Link Target Finder " tooltiptext= " &runlinktargetfinder ; " oncommand =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </toolbarpalette > </overlay >
First , there some general XML syntax , then you include your CSS code and set a DOCTYPE for localization .
It ’s followed by the overlay root element with its Ghostbuster - inspired namespace ( developers are truly geeks 🙂 ) .
After that you ’re free to write whatever XUL you want , and basically it ’s like HTML should ’ve been .
What I mean with that is that it is filled with basic interface options that ca n’t be found anywhere in HTML .
For a complete overview of what you can do , please read the XUL Reference .
In our code here , we start with adding a menu option to the Tools menu in Firefox , and connect it to a keyboard shortcut :
< menupopup id=" menu_ToolsPopup " > < menuitem label= " &runlinktargetfinder ; " key = " link- target-finder-run-key " oncommand =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </ menupopup > < keyset > < key id =" link - target - finder - run- key " modifiers = " accel alt shift " key= " L " oncommand =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </ keyset >
Followed by adding an icon to the Firefox statusbar :
< statusbar id =" status-bar " > < statusbarpanel id =" link-target-finder-status-bar-icon " class=" statusbarpanel-iconic " src=" chrome://linktargetfinder/skin/status-bar.png " tooltiptext= " &runlinktargetfinder ; " onclick =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </statusbar >
And at the end , we add a button to the Firefox toolbar :
< toolbarpalette id=" BrowserToolbarPalette " > < toolbarbutton id =" link-target-finder-toolbar-button " label= " Link Target Finder " tooltiptext= " &runlinktargetfinder ; " oncommand =" linkTargetFinder.run ( ) " /> </toolbarpalette >
Note that you need to go to View > Toolbars > Customize … to add your button to the visible toolbar .
In the above examples , you might have noticed the &runlinktargetfinder ; code .
That is used for localizing text , and its translation can be found in the locale folder .
More on that later .
Another thing to notice , which can be tricky at first , is that some ids and classes for XUL elements actually have meaning for its display , stemming from core Firefox code .
Make sure to read the XUL Reference thoroughly for the elements you ’re using .
If you want to use regular HTML elements instead of / together with XUL , you can include the XHTML definition in your root element , and then include any HTML element with the html : prefix .
Like this :
< overlay id =" sample " xmlns= " http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul " xmlns:html= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " >
< html :input type=" submit " value= " Send " />
o ptions.xul
This file is used for the options / preferences dialog for your extension , and its path is pointed out in the install.rdf file in the Description / em:optionsURL node .
The complete options file for our extension looks like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
<?xml-stylesheet href= " chrome://global/skin/ " type =" text/css " ?> < prefwindow title= " Link Target Finder Preferences " xmlns= " http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul " > < prefpane label= " Link Target Finder Preferences " > < preferences > < preference id =" link- target-finder-autorun " name =" extensions.linktargetfinder.autorun " type=" bool " /> </ preferences > < groupbox > < caption label= " Settings " /> < grid > < columns > < column flex= " 4 " /> < column flex= " 1 " /> </ columns > < rows > < row > < label control=" autorun " value= " Autorun " /> < checkbox id =" autorun " preference =" link - target-finder-autorun " / > </row > </rows > </grid> </ groupbox > </ prefpane > </ prefwindow >
Again , some regular XML information and styling of the content .
It then uses some XUL to layout the content of the preferences dialog .
The interesting part here , though , is connecting the user input to the actual settings for the extension ( those settings are to be found in the prefs.js file , mentioned in detail below ) .
To start with , you create a preferences group in the options.xul file with your desired preferences .
Then , give each preference an id and connect it to the extension ’s real preferences with the name attribute :
< preferences > < preference id =" link- target-finder-autorun " name =" extensions.linktargetfinder.autorun " type=" bool " /> </ preferences >
Then you create an element and add a preference attribute to it , pointing to the before - chosen id attribute for the preference in the preferences group .
It will then automatically connect its value to that specific preference .
< checkbox id =" autorun " preference =" link - target-finder-autorun " / >
Note that you do n’t need to add an OK button for the dialog – for instance , on Macs there wo n’t be one while it ’s automatically added for Windows users .
All about system compatibility , my friends .
l inkTargetFinder.js
If you ’re like me , this is where you will feel at home .
Good ol ’ JavaScript code . 🙂
What ’s nice here is that you can script any element in the XUL and any element in the HTML content window as well .
All you need to access the content window is to precede your document call with the content keyword , like this :
content.document.getElementsByTagName ( " a " ) ;
Here ’s the complete code of the linkTarget Finder .js file :
var linkTargetFinder = function ( ) { var prefManager = Components.classes ["@mozilla.org/preferences -service;1 " ].getService( Components.interfaces.nsIPrefBranch ) ; return { init : function ( ) { gBrowser.addEventListener ( " load " , function ( ) { var autoRun = prefManager.getBoolPref(" extensions.linktargetfinder.autorun " ) ; if ( autoRun ) { linkTargetFinder.run ( ) ; } } , false ) ; } , run : function ( ) { var head = content.document.getElementsByTagName( " head " ) [ 0 ] , style = content.document.getElementById(" link-target-finder-style " ) , allLinks = content.document.getElementsByTagName( " a " ) , foundLinks = 0 ; if ( ! style ) { style = content.document.createElement (" link " ) ; style.id = " link - target - finder- style " ; style.type = " text /css " ; style.rel = " stylesheet " ; style.href = " chrome://linktargetfinder/skin/skin.css " ; head.appendChild( style ) ; } for ( var i=0 , il=allLinks.length ; i< il ; i++) { elm = all Links [i ] ; if ( elm.getAttribute ( " target " ) ) { elm.className += (( elm.className.length > 0 ) ? " " : " " ) + " link - target - finder - selected " ; foundLinks ++ ; } } if ( foundLinks === 0 ) { alert ( " No links found with a target attribute " ) ; } else { alert ( " Found " + foundLinks + " links with a target attribute " ) ; } } } ; } ( ) ; window.addEventListener(" load " , linkTargetFinder.init , false ) ;
While it ’s a fair bit of code , it is also very basic .
When the window loads , it runs the init method of the linkTarget Finder object .
If the preference autorun is set to true , it calls its run method immediately .
Otherwise , it will only be called when the toolbar button , menu item or statusbar icon is clicked .
This happens through the oncommand attribute on the elements in the browser.xul file .
The code in the run method is pretty straight - forward .
It adds a CSS file from the extensions chrome folder to the current document , finds all links in it , loops through them and checks if they have a target attribute , counts those , highlights them and alerts you with the number of hits .
As you can see , there ’s a pointer in the code to something called gBrowser .
That is how to get a reference to the current web browser , and you could also use getBrowser ( ) as well .
Note that this sort of code is only available from within the XUL context of the web browser .
More information and options can be found in Tabbed Browser .
The only unusual part for a JavaScript is the variable prefManager , which connects to Firefox preference manager , and later gets the autorun preference with the help of this code :
var autoRun = prefManager.getBoolPref(" extensions.linktargetfinder.autorun " ) ;
The three types of extension preferences are string , integer and boolean , and the six methods to work with them are :
getBoolPref ()
setBoolPref ()
getCharPref ()
setCharPref ()
getIntPref ()
setIntPref ()
d efaults folder
Within the defaults folder , you create a preferences folder and in that one a file named pref.js .
This is used for the preferences you want to use for your extension , and looks like this :
pref ( " extensions.linktargetfinder.autorun " , false ) ;
l ocale folder
Used for localization .
In our case here , we just have one child folder for en-US content , but it can be easily extended .
That folder has a file named translations .
dtd , which contains translations for entities used in XUL files .
Our file looks like this :
<!ENTITY runlinktargetfinder " Run Link Target Finder " >
Remember &runlinktargetfinder ; in the browser.xul file ?
This is where it gets its translation .
s kin folder
Now when we have all functionality in place , let ’s make things a little more pretty ( just a little , ok ? ) .
In our skin folder , we have three files : skin.css , status - bar.png and toolbar - large.png .
The images are , naturally , used for the toolbar and statusbar respectively .
The CSS in skin.css is used for setting the image for the toolbar , the size and space for the statusbar icon and the highlight look of links with a target attribute .
The code looks like this :
# link - target - finder - toolbar - button { list - style - image : url ( " chrome://linktargetfinder/skin/toolbar-large.png " ) ; } # link - target - finder - status - bar - icon { width : 83 px ; margin : 0 5 px ; } .link - target - finder - selected { outline : 2 px solid red ! important ; }
Packaging and installing
Firefox extensions are delivered like XPI files , and those are basically just ZIP files with another extension .
Therefore , when you ’re finished with your extension , all you need to do is ZIP your files together and give it an XPI extension .
Note : do not ZIP the containing folder for your extension , just its contents ( chrome folder , chrome.
manifest and install.rdf files etc ) .
Once you have your XPI file , you can just drag and drop it into Firefox , and it will automatically install .
Packaging with Windows

Distribution of your extension
There are two options of distributing your extension .
Either use addons.mozilla.org or host it yourself .
If you do it yourself , you can specify an updateURL in your install.rdf file , but note that since Firefox 3 it has to be a secure location , e.g. through SSL or similar .
Personally , I ’d recommend addons.mozilla.org for greater reach , auto - update pushing and statistics .
The downside of it , though , is that the review process can take quite some time for your extension to get an approval .
Before that it can still be downloaded as an experimental add - on , but people need to have an addons.
mozilla account and log in to do so .
To make sure it does n’t take longer than necessary , I recommend reading

Downloads
All the code I ’ve created here is available both as a ZIP file of everything , so you can start experimenting , change stuff and see what happens .
It is also available as an XPI file , which you can install in your Firefox just to test the functionality ( drag and drop it into Firefox ) .
Happy extension developing !
I hope this has been a good , albeit long , introduction to Firefox extension development and that it has helped you to grasp concepts you had n’t gotten full control over yet .
Good luck , and do n’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions !
If activists , like Michael Petrelis and other Castro frequenters , really wanted to focus attention on a part of the world where gays are suffering , maybe they could take a look at Iraq .
Because this is , for lack of a better word , depressing .
It 's unreal but all too real .
Iraqi gays will be " executed in batches " this week , convicted of the crime of being queer .
UK Gay News has the details .
More than 100 prisoners in Iraq are facing execution - and many of them are believed to have been convicted of the ' crime ' of being gay , the UK - based Iraqi - LGBT group revealed this afternoon .
According to Ali Hili of Iraqi-LGBT , the Iraqi authorities plan to start executing them in batches of 20 from this week .
There is , said Mr. Hili , at least one member of Iraqi- LGBT who are among those to be put to death .

“ I wish to assure the safety of the leaders , ” said Mr. Panitan , who said that some leaders had been advised to stay in their hotel rooms .
Mr. Panitan also said several protesters were injured in clashes early Saturday between the protesters and pro-government demonstrators .
Protesters made their way past the gates of the convention center , and a small delegation of their leaders entered the meeting venue .
The police were trying to talk them into leaving , Mr. Panitan said .
“ If that does n’t work we will take other measures , ” he said .
The disturbance offered leaders a close - up look at the political discord that is wrenching Thailand , some of it fueled by the economic crisis .
Bangkok has been the scene of huge demonstrations against the prime minister in recent days .
Jerit activists arrive at Malaysia 's national parliament
By Oppressed People ’s Movement ( Jaringan Rakyat Tertindas , Jerit )
December 18 , 2008 -- Jerit , Suaram --
People 's power has spoken once again !
With the roars from a strong crowd of 500 people , the young militant cyclists , who from December 3 conducted their ``Cycle for Change ' ' campaign throughout Malaysia , pedalled bravely into the grounds of the parliment , which definitely belongs to them , ``THE PEOPLE " .
After almost 16 days ' journey through the states of Malaysia , they brought the people 's demands to the ears of their representitives !
The six demands were : 1 . Legislate a Minimum Wage Act ; 2 . Abolish draconian laws ; 3 . Adequate housing for the people ; 4 . Control prices ; 5 . Stop the privatisation of public services ; 6 . Revive local municipal council elections .
The was one of the Jerit 's ways of raising awareness about issues like food shortages , global food shortage , environmental problems , draconian laws and the financial crisis -- in an eco-friendly way to boot .
The cyclists , who had split into two teams travelling to different parts of Malaysia , faced constant harrassment and intimidation from police , including roadblocks , arrests , mistreatment and assault .
Defying the attacks , the mostly young people insisted on the right to freedom of expression .
Click here for an earlier Links report and video .
The attacks continued until the very end of the journey .
On December 15 , the chief police officer ( CPO ) of Selangor state , Khalid Abdul Bakar , announced he was launching a police mission to ``rescue '' the ``children '' particpating in the bike ride from the ``bad '' Jerit ( the Jaringan Rakyat Tertindas , Oppressed Peoples Movement , which organised the protest ride ) .
In his noble mission , he used a massive police force in Rawang and Kajang to arrest all the participants of the cycle for change campaign .
He declared that this was necessary to reunite the ``terrified children '' with their parents .
In Rawang , 56 people were arrested including 27 below the age of 18 .
The arrests did not result in 27 pairs of parents knocking on the police doors -- instead , more than 500 people demonstrated in the rain calling for everyone to be released .
The CPO was shouted at for his actions , which created more anger than relief from the young people 's parents .
In Bangi estate [ plantation ] near Kajang , there was a five - hour stand - off with the police .
Around two dozen plainclothes police , two police trucks and many uniformed police offciers waited at the entrance of the estate , intending to arrest all those who were cycled there , and to determine their ages .
A huge group of police also followed the team .
The commanding officer admitted that police wanted to arrest all those below the age of 18 under the Malaysia 's childrens act .
They wanted to put them in trucks and take them to the police station .
Later the deputy police commander made the more stupid confession that police would arrest them first and then only investigate .
This cowboy - style of policing means the police were acting unlawfully .
The cyclists ' leaders objected and offered to surrender the young people to the police .
The police were very reluctant to go into the privately owned planation to make the arrests , as a huge group of people were waiting to defend the participants .
The police were worried and agreed to our proposal that we surrender them ourselves .
We asked for lunch to be served first , and then we would get them to the station by bus .
More negotiations took place , the police were now very secretive but would have had a tough time making arrests .
There was a stand - off and the supporters were growing in numbers .
Finally , the police backed off and the people were allowed to move out of the estate .
We used the bus though the police wanted us to cycle .
They had their plan but we had ours .
By now , we had learned of the arrests in Rawang and were sure that this was a directive from the top .
We moved next to West Country Dewan .
Once again there was a huge police presence and once again it made a lot of people come out and observe what was happening .
The police truly gave us the publicity we needed !
That night , we followed closely the developments in Rawang .
The arrests in Rawang made us rethink our route because we still had another three days to go .
The police `mission ' fails
On December 16 , the police `rescue mission ' fell flat .
The parents who came nearly broke down the Rawang police station gate .
The were really upset with the police for arresting their children .
The police and the welfare officers all got a blasting from angry family members .
When the kids and their parents came out , they were very much intact .
They received huge applause .
The children and their parents agreed that they would cycle on .
They want to sue the CPO .
In Kajang , the team ended the day being greeted by huge numbers of supporters , while the parents of those below 18 lodged a complaint against the police and also furnished them with consent letterd to allow their kids to continue .
It was a slap on both cheeks for the CPO .
Both the northern and southern teams survived these ordeals and were determined to complete their mission .

Stop ongoing attacks by police on JERIT bicycle campaign now !
By Suara Rakyat Malaysia ( Suaram )
December 17 , 2008 -- Suaram condemns the ongoing attacks by police on the Oppressed People ’s Movement ( Jerit ) ``Ride for Change ' ' bicycle campaign .
To date , 120 individuals have been arrested on the Jerit bicycle campaign .
The Jerit bicycle campaign kicked off on December 3 , 2008 , at Wisma Darul Aman , Kedah , and is scheduled to end on December 18 , 2008 , at parliament where a memorandum demanding policy and institutional reforms will be submitted to the prime minister and the parliamentary opposition leader .
The campaign consisted of two teams , the first one cycling from the north and the second on from the south .
The teams have been harassed by the police at almost every step of their campaign .
On December 4 , a volunteer , Ruben s/o Loganathan , was arrested at Merbau Pulas , Kedah , for leafleting leaflets containing the demands of Jerit ’s bicycle campaign .
He was released under police bail on the same day .
On December 5 , Jerit cyclists were stopped by the police when they were leafleting at Teluk Kumbar , Penang .
On December 6 , 16 Jerit activists were arrested at Skudai , Johor .
They were released on the same day without charge .
On December 9 , two activists were arrested at Taiping and another six was arrested at Kuala Kangsar .
One of the female Jerit activists , Helen Mary Johnson , was molested and punched on the face by a police officer while she was taking photographs .
Another Jerit activist , Lee Huat Seng , had his camera confiscated by the police and he was also hit on the arm by the police .
At the latest incident on December 15 , 39 individuals from the southern team were arrested at Bangi Lama Estate .
They were consequently released following negotiations between the police and Jerit activists .
The northern team had 30 activists arrested and 26 cyclists who were minors were held at the Balai Polis Rawang for a night .
At the police station , the activists and cyclists , including the 26 minors , were tortured by the police as they were made to stand in heavy rain in the middle of the night .
The 30 activists were charged with “ illegal assembly ” and released on police bail at around 4 am in the morning while the 26 minors were released on December 16 at around 3.15 pm after their parents went to the police station .
Suaram also condemns the false statement made by the Chief Police Officer ( CPO ) of Selangor , Khalid Abu Bakar , claiming that the police detained the 26 minors to “ save them from being misused and exploited by irresponsible people ” .
He also claimed that the minors did not know what they were participating in .
The organisers of the Jerit bicycle campaign had shown the police written consent from the parents of the minors .
The minors also participated in the cycling campaign on their free will and could withdraw their participation at any point if they wanted to .
This proves that CPO Khalid Abu Bakar is making false public statements to mislead the public to form false perceptions of the Jerit campaign .
On top of that , the minors were made to stand under the heavy rain late at night while detained at the Balai Polis Rawang .
Is that the protection that the police are providing to the minors ?
Malaysia has ratified the United Nations ’ Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) and is obligated to provide protection to children .
Freedom of expression of the child is provided for in Article 13 of the CRC and freedom of association and peaceful assembly is accorded to the child in Article 15 .
Article 37 states that the arrest and detention of a child should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time ; no child should be subjected to torture ; and during arrest and detention , the child should have prompt access to legal services .
The latest incident on December 15 has yet again proved Malaysia ’s non-compliance with the CRC .
The actions of the police in detaining the minors and making them stay in poor conditions at the police station , including forcing them to stand under the rain , is in clear violation of the rights of the children as accorded in Article 37 of the CRC .
The police have also violated the minors ’ freedom of expression , association and peaceful assembly by detaining them during their participation in the Jerit bicycle campaign .
Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are guaranteed to Malaysian citizens under Article 10 of the Federal Constitution .
Malaysia is also a member of the Human Rights Council and should uphold the citizens ' rights to expression and assembly as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
Suaram demands the police to stop harassing the Jerit activists and cyclists and to allow them to conduct the last leg of their bicycle campaign in peace .
Suaram further demands Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar and Inspector - General of Police Musa Hassan ensure that the police do not harass the Jerit activists and cyclists any further and to protect the rights of the activists in exercising their rights as they make their way to parliament to hand over their memorandum tomorrow .

Released by Temme Lee , coordinator
“ This agreement expands access to many of these hard - to - find books in a way that is great for Google , great for authors , great for publishers and great for readers , ” said Alexander Macgillivray , the Google lawyer who led the settlement negotiations with the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild .
Most of the critics , which include copyright specialists , antitrust scholars and some librarians , agree that the public will benefit .
But they say others should also have rights to orphan works .
And they oppose what they say amounts to the rewriting , through a private deal rather than through legislation , of the copyright rules for millions of texts .
“ They are doing an end run around the legislative process , ” said Brewster Kahle , founder of the Open Content Alliance , which is working to build a digital library with few restrictions .
Opposition to the 134 - page agreement , which the parties announced in October , has been building slowly as its implications have become clearer .
Groups that plan to raise concerns with the court include the American Library Association , the Institute for Information Law and Policy at New York Law School and a group of lawyers led by Prof.
Charles R. Nesson of Harvard Law School .
It is not clear that any group will oppose the settlement outright .
The groups representing publishers and authors , which filed a class - action lawsuit against Google in 2005 in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of their members , are defending the settlement , as are some librarians at major universities .
“ What we were establishing was a renewed access to a huge corpus of material that was essentially lost in the bowels of a few great libraries , ” said Richard Sarnoff , former chairman of the Association of American Publishers and co-chairman of the American unit of Bertelsmann , the parent company of Random House .
The lawsuit claimed that Google ’s practice of showing snippets of copyrighted books in search results was copyright infringement .
Google insisted that it was protected by fair use provisions of copyright law .
La Paz , Bolivia
THIS week in Vienna , a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs took place that will help shape international antidrug efforts for the next 10 years .
I attended the meeting to reaffirm Bolivia ’s commitment to this struggle but also to call for the reversal of a mistake made 48 years ago .
In 1961 , the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs placed the coca leaf in the same category with cocaine  thus promoting the false notion that the coca leaf is a narcotic  and ordered that “ coca leaf chewing must be abolished within 25 years from the coming into force of this convention . ”
Bolivia signed the convention in 1976 , during the brutal dictatorship of Col. Hugo Banzer , and the 25 - year deadline expired in 2001 .
So for the past eight years , the millions of us who maintain the traditional practice of chewing coca have been , according to the convention , criminals who violate international law .
This is an unacceptable and absurd state of affairs for Bolivians and other Andean peoples .
Many plants have small quantities of various chemical compounds called alkaloids .
One common alkaloid is caffeine , which is found in more than 50 varieties of plants , from coffee to cacao , and even in the flowers of orange and lemon trees .
Excessive use of caffeine can cause nervousness , elevated pulse , insomnia and other unwanted effects .
The government took the unprecedented decision yesterday to block the release of cabinet minutes about the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that it would undermine democratic decision - making , the very argument used by freedom of information bodies which had ordered their disclosure .
Jack Straw , the justice secretary , told MPs the government had decided to use its veto powers under the Freedom of Information Act because publication " risked serious damage to cabinet government " .
He argued that the potential damage " far outweighs " any potential public benefit of publication and added that the decision to go to war had already been examined " with a fine - toothed comb " in several inquiries .
Straw denied he was trying to " circumvent " the FOI Act and said he had finally come to the decision on Monday afternoon , after the " final cabinet discussion of the matter " .
There had already been at least four inquiries into the war and the prime minister would consider the case for a further inquiry once the troops were home , he said .
" Confidentiality serves to promote thorough decision - making .
Disclosure of the cabinet minutes in this case jeopardises that space for thought and debate at precisely the point where it has its greatest utility . "
The decision was greeted in the chamber by calls of " shame " and " disgraceful " from Labour and Conservative MPs .
But Dominic Grieve , shadow justice minister , backed the government , clearly reflecting concern on the Conservative frontbench at the prospect of their potential cabinet discussions seeing the light of day .
However , Grieve said the case went to the heart of what he called the disquiet over how the decision was taken .
He referred to " sofa government " , the criticism made by the Butler inquiry into the use of intelligence on Iraq , and one of the key reasons why Richard Thomas , the information commissioner , and later the Information Tribunal , said the minutes should be published .
There was now an overwhelming case for an inquiry into the Iraq war , along the lines of the privy council inquiry that was held into the Falklands war , said Grieve .
He continued : " Do you appreciate how it will appear to the public for someone so closely involved in the key decisions now to be personally blocking the release of that information ? "
Grieve said the government released information " when it suited them " - such as Conservative cabinet documents from the exchange rate mechanism crisis in the 1990s - for " reasons of the most blatant political advantage " .
Thomas , the tribunal observed last month , had stressed " the fact that the decision to go to war was controversial at the time , and remains so , because it was not one that was based on self - defence or a united international response to aggression .
It had been opposed by a mass public demonstration ... and is now perceived as having been based on incorrect intelligence . "
Criticism had been made , the tribunal added , that it was not until " the last minute " that the full cabinet was able to see the then attorney general 's revised opinion that invasion without a fresh UN resolution was legal .
There had been criticism that his previous legal opinion of 7 March , which contained serious caveats , was not disclosed to the cabinet .
Concern remained that the stated reasons for invading were " not genuine " .
The Information Tribunal had ordered the disclosure of minutes of two key cabinet meetings , on 13 and 17 March 2003 , when the legality of the invasion was discussed .
It described the case as exceptional .
It brought together issues " that were so important that , in combination , they created very powerful public interest reasons why disclosure was in the public interest " , it said .
By a majority of two to one , it rejected arguments by the country 's most senior officials that disclosure would prevent ministers from having frank discussions and would undermine the principle of collective cabinet responsibility .
Thomas said last night that his decision to order disclosure of the cabinet minutes was made under the Freedom of Information Act on public interest grounds .
" Using the power available to me under ... the Freedom of Information Act , I will shortly lay a report before parliament to record the circumstances leading to this outcome , " he said .
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament condemned the decision , claiming it was another attempt to suppress public debate on the " biggest political scandal " in decades .
The Conservative MP Edward Leigh also condemned the move : " Surely the people have the right to know the legal basis of a war in which up to 600,000 people died ?
This whole thing stinks . "
Labour 's Andrew Mackinlay noted Straw did not seem to have any heavyweight political backing in the house to support his decision .
" Have you looked behind you to see there are only two office holders - a parliamentary private secretary and the church commissioner - who support you ?
There is not a single member of your honourable friends here endorsing you .
Could it be they are ashamed and embarrassed by this announcement ?
" I bear the scars of having trusted the prime minister on this matter . "
Do you recognize the following image ?
If you are familiar with digital image processing , you must surely have .
This image , simply know as Lenna , is the most widely used test image in image processing research .
But despite the years of attention this image has received from millions of image processing researchers and students alike , very few of them are aware of the history behind it .
An example use of Lena
The woman in the image is Lena Soderberg , a Swedish model , who originally appeared on the November 1972 issue of the Playboy magazine .
The image started making rounds among computer nerds when some researchers from the University of Southern California scanned the image from the magazine to use it in their work .
It was in the summer of 1973 , an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the University of Southern California Signal and Image Processing Institute , along with a graduate student and the lab manager , was hurriedly searching the lab for a good image to scan for a colleague ’s conference paper .
They got tired of their stock of usual test images , dull stuff dating back to television standards work in the early 1960s .
They wanted something glossy to ensure good output dynamic range , and they wanted a human face .
Just then , somebody happened to walk in with an issue of Playboy .
The engineers tore away the top third of the centerfold so they could wrap it around the drum of their Muirhead wirephoto scanner , which they had outfitted with analog - to - digital converters .
The Muirhead had a fixed resolution of 100 lines per inch and the engineers wanted a 512 × 512 image , so they limited the scan to the top 5.12 inches of the picture , effectively cropping it at the subject ’s shoulders .
Of course , they would n’t have dared to use the complete image on a conference paper for , like every Playboy centerfold image , Lena had posed nude .
The imperfect scanning machine however lost one line from the image .
Since the image was needed in a hurry , the top line of the image was replicated to obtain exactly 512 lines .
Further , the A/D converters distorted the image resulting in a slightly elongated image .
Nonetheless , this image soon became one of the most used image in computer history , so much that the mysterious Lenna came to be dubbed the “ First Lady of the Internet ” .
David C. Munson , editor - in - chief of IEEE Transactions cited two reasons for the popularity of the image in research
First , the image contains a nice mixture of detail , flat regions , shading , and texture that do a good job of testing various image processing algorithms .
It is a good test image !
Second , the Lena image is a picture of an attractive woman .
It is not surprising that the ( mostly male ) image processing research community gravitated toward an image that they found attractive .
The image also had it ’s share of controversy , from people of the community who disliked the fact that the source of the image is Playboy and also from the magazine publisher for infringement of copyright .
Though later Playboy decided to overlook the widespread distribution of this particular centerfold .
Eileen Kent , VP of new media at Playboy explains ,
We decided we should exploit this , because it is a phenomenon .
Coincidentally , Playboy states the issue was its best - selling ever , having sold 7,161,561 copies as of May 2006 .
While all this was happening , Lena Soderberg was blissfully unaware of the fame these researchers had shot her into .
It was only in 1988 that she came to know about it when she was approached by a Swedish computer publication for an interview .
Lena Soderberg currently leaves in Sweden , happily married with three kids and a job with the state liquor monopoly .

Stimulate the Economy -- Forgive Student Loans !
by : Kevin M. Bartoy
recipient : President Barack Obama
Over the past twenty years , student loan debt in the United States has more than doubled .
We are now graduating students with a marvelous skill set as well as a mountain of debt .
If we were to take our tax dollars and invest them in paying off student loan debt in this country , we would be investing in our future and in ourselves .
Many individuals and families pay more than a third of their monthly income to student loan debt .
If we free up this earned income by paying off debt , our educated masses in this country could create new businesses , invest in homes , and become a foundation for the new economy .
This will have a much deeper positive impact on all Americans than handing bailouts to corporations who have no impetus to invest in this country .

Hundreds of billions of our tax dollars have been given to Wall Street and other corporations in hopes of " jump starting " the economy .
We want to see our tax dollars going directly to Main Street rather than routed through Wall Street .
Americans are increasingly saddled with debt .
Chief among this debt is student loan debt .
We provide the best education in the world in our colleges and universities , but we leave our graduates at a severe disadvantage as they leave our institutions with a degree and a mountain of debt .
This debt inhibits many of these young people from achieving their dreams and making productive contributions to America and the American economy .
We ask you to consider a relief package for student loan debtors .
By forgiving student loan debt , we can invest in our future and save our economy .
Families pay upwards of a third to half of their monthly incomes trying to pay down student loan debt .
If this real wealth was freed , our educated masses could spend that money by creating new businesses , which would in turn create new jobs .
Freed from debt , these families could also begin to invest in themselves by purchasing homes and land .
This would infuse our economy with real wealth that would benefit all sectors not just the wealthy few on Wall Street .
We ask you to make a real investment in America .
We ask you to truly stimulate this economy .
We ask you to use our tax dollars to relieve the burden of student debt and allow our graduates to truly use their education to give back to this great country .
Thank you for bringing hope to America .
Now , let us help you turn that hope into a brighter future .

A Spanish - British research project has come up with three future scenarios for the effects of climate change on the Mediterranean over the next 90 years , using global models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The conclusions show that ocean temperatures in this area will increase , along with sea levels .
In order to understand and correctly predict risks for the Mediterranean coast , researchers from the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies ( IMEDEA , a joint centre run by the University of the Balearic Islands ( UIB ) and the Spanish National Research Council , CSIC ) and the National Oceanography Centre of Southampton in the United Kingdom have analysed simulations based on three scenarios related to climate change and the rise in greenhouse gases .
Their goal was to predict the temperature , sea level and salinity of the Mediterranean in the 21st Century .
" The most positive scenario assumes that greenhouse gas concentrations remain constant at their levels in the year 2000 , and even in this case climate change still has an impact .
The most negative scenario is based on diverse levels of economic development all over the world , with an ongoing increase in greenhouse gas production throughout the 21st Century , " Marta Marcos , the study 's lead author and a researcher at the UIB , tells SINC .
The study , which has been published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Oceans , shows what could happen in the Mediterranean .
The models predict that higher concentrations of gases will lead to an increase in temperatures throughout the entire sea .
In the most positive scenario , the changes are least , with temperature increases of less than 1 ºC expected to be recorded in the Mediterranean by the end of the 21st Century .
The other two scenarios envision an increase in greenhouse gases over coming decades , and foresee an increase in the temperature of the sea of up to 2.5 º
C. In addition , the results show that the temperature increase will accelerate during the 21st Century .
In the long term , sea levels could alter due to changes in temperature ( warming leads to an increase in volume ) as well as additional mass .
" The level of the whole Mediterranean will rise by between 3 cm and 61 cm * on average as a result of the effects of warming , " says Marcos .

There is " greater uncertainty " in terms of the mass likely to be added as a result of melting ice at the poles and from continental glaciers , and this aspect is not incorporated in the study .
The most important area in terms of understanding sea level rise is the coasts , " but it is here that we know least because of the low spatial resolution of the models " the expert adds .
In search of greater clarity
The conclusions of this study are not based on observations , but rather on global climate models that include a whole range of possible future socio-economic scenarios in order to predict what is likely to happen in the Mediterranean .
According to the scientists , climatic conditions are going to change greatly , and for this reason it is impossible to make a completely precise prediction of what the future really holds .
In these circumstances , Marta Marcos and Michael Tsimplis say that , aside from temperature changes , the models show that the Mediterranean will also become saltier over the coming century .
However , this prediction is also very uncertain because " the variations in salinity in the Mediterranean are controlled by the exchange of water through the Straits of Gibraltar , and this has not been incorporated as an indicator , meaning the related results are not very reliable " .
This is due to the fact that IPCC models have very low spatial resolution , which means they can show global processes " reasonably well " , but not always regional ones .
In particular , the 14 km - wide Straits of Gibraltar , which are of key importance in the processes of water exchange between the Mediterranean and Atlantic , are not well reproduced in the models .
The global models are of no use in estimating the impact of sea level rise in coastal areas , because of the high level of regional variability for this factor .
The solution would be to use high - resolution , regional climate models to show the Mediterranean straits with greater clarity , as well as the oceanic processes that take place within the ocean 's basin and coastal areas .
This is a strategy currently being pursued by European research groups working to predict the effects of climate change at a regional level , and it is expected that the level of uncertainty in predictions will be reduced over the short term .
In Spain , IMEDEA is working to produce data on ocean levels in collaboration with the Spanish Port System .
Without such resolution in the models " we can not be sure of the scale of the changes " , the researcher concludes .

Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh ’s bombshell earlier this week that Vice President Dick Cheney controlled an “ executive assassination ring ” continues to reverberate throughout Washington , with Nixon aide John Dean going so far as to accuse the former VP of murder if the charges are true .
MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann visited the issue on his show Countdown Thursday night where he discussed the legal implications of Hersh ’s allegations with Dean , who was White House legal counsel under President Richard Nixon .
“ It ’s potentially a war crime , ”  Dean said of the reported assassination ring .
“ It ’s potentially just outright murder and it ’s clearly in violation of the Ford Executive Order . ” 
Hersh told the students at the University of Minnesota on Tuesday that the assassination squad was “ a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
In the Bush - Cheney Days , they reported directly to the Cheney , Cheney office .
They do not report to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or to Mr. Gates , the secretary of defense .
They report directly to him .
Congress has no oversight of it .
It ’s an executive assassination ring , essentially . ” 
“ If this is true you have to prosecute this .
There is no way around this , ”  said Olbermann , noting the 1976 executive order of President Gerald Ford which explicitly outlawed the engagement of political employees in political assassination .
Cheney was Ford ’s chief of staff at the time the order was issued .
“ By the time Cheney was back in the West Wing it appears that Cheney had forgotten his own boss ’s executive order , or worse , he had decided to ignore it , ”  Olbermann said .
Dean told Olbermann that “ the President ’s the only one you can argue who may have the authority to engage in assassinations .
Newsweek editor Howard Fineman shared with Olbermann his own investigation into the veracity of Hersh ’s claims .
Fineman said his talks Thursday with sources in the intelligence community had revealed that while they are skeptical of the existence of any assassination ring , they had too much respect in Hersh ’s reporting to dismiss the allegations outright and that they warranted further study .
However , not everyone is buying the claims made by Hersh .
The Weekly Standard ’s Bill Roggio writes , “ Hersh has made a living of making fantastic claims that do n’t quite live up to the hype .
Chalk this one up as another Hersh fantasy . ”
Claims by the CIA that the Hersh allegations were “ utter nonsense , ”  are not surprising , said Fineman .
“ If there is in fact such a thing … and the CIA was kept in the dark about it , the last thing they would want to do right now is to admit it , ”  Fineman said .
Fineman said he has been told by aides to Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who has proposed forming an independent “ ˜ Truth Commission ’ to investigate abuses of the Bush administration , that not many members of the Senate have signed on to the proposal as of yet .
However , the new allegations by Hersh may be shocking enough to push more senators over to Leahy ’s side , Fineman said .
“ This could be that thing , depending on how much it pans out , ”  Fineman said .
“ One more really serious allegation ” ¦I think you ’re going to see a lot of senators wanting to join Sen .
Leahy ’s side on this . ” 

Like Dubai , Doha is one of the wealthiest cities in the world .
It is a dream to many of us to visit the country , including me .
Today while browsing online through the interesting places to travel in Doha , I found this very interesting post .
I feel like , “ Hey the new Awesome Lamborghini Gallardo has come in the traffic patrols team , nobody can speeding anymore ” .
But the truth is , my friend who worked at oil and gas company told me that he has been working in Doha for 6 months and saw , say thousands of traffic violations , which many of these violations were just next to police cars ( they were land cruiser violations ) and nothing happened !!!
So is this only for the luxury show or needs ?
Think about it .
Anyway , enjoy the photos 🙂

A group of performers from the UCB
Theatre got together to see the Yankees / Tigers game on Wednesday , August 30th .
A few weeks before the game , Agent Lathan approached me about doing a favorite prank of his at the stadium .
He stumbled onto the prank by accident at Fenway Park back in 2001 .
After leaving his seat at Fenway to hit the concession stand , he had a difficult time finding his way back .
His friends started shouting at him , trying to get his attention , and pretty quickly several strangers in the section began shouting his name as well .
Agent Lathan decided to keep it going by pretending he could n’t hear them and pretty soon the entire section was frantically yelling his name .
He did the prank again at Shea Stadium in 2002 ( this time on purpose ) on a slightly larger scale .
For the Yankee Stadium version , the goal would be to spread the prank over many sections , trying to get as many people as possible involved in bringing “ Rob ” back to his seat .
Unfortunately , Yankee Stadium does not allow any video cameras or backpacks ; so smuggling in filming equipment would be nearly impossible .
Agent Lathan decided to pull the prank anyway , even if we could n’t film it .
Fortunately several members of our group brought cameras to the game and were able to snap photos and take some footage using their camera ’s “ movie mode ” .
Rob waited until the 6th Inning to begin his journey .
After a beautiful sunset , he left our section in the right field upper deck to grab some food .
He returned moments later with a large cardboard tray filled with beer and popcorn .
Although he was walking in the aisle right by our group , Rob could n’t seem to locate us .
The few of us who were in on the prank from the beginning hopped up and started yelling , “ Rob ! ! ! ” and waving our hands .
Rob just stared past us with a vacant look on his face , neither hearing nor seeing us .
The rest of our group started yelling his name as well , but no one could seem to get his attention .
As he started walking back down the aisle , strangers started yelling his name as well , but he kept walking down and eventually disappeared through the tunnel .
About five minutes later Rob appeared again , this time two sections to our left .
Rob appears two sections over
Same photo , detail enlarged
Someone from our group spotted him and we all started yelling his name again .
There were now two sections in between our group and Rob , so everyone in between got involved and started yelling “ Rob ! ” trying to help out .
Although the photos are a little blurry , it was actually very easy to spot Rob .
He ’s a tall guy , and he was wearing a very recognizable red , white , and blue shirt ( much like everyone ’s favorite person to spot in a crowd , “ Waldo ” . )
Rob just kept walking up and down the stairs , looking quite pitiful with his huge platter of concessions .
He disappeared again into the tunnel , and everyone sat back down .
People around us were laughing and trying to figure out what was wrong with him .
One guy asked me how much he Rob had had to drink .
“ One too many , I think , ” I told him .
After another five minutes passed , Rob very quickly appeared in the section just to the left of us , the one in the middle of the two sections he had already searched .
His head emerged from the tunnel and he looked around for about ten seconds before disappearing again .
All three sections in our corner lept to their feet and screamed his name , but he was gone in a flash .
Rob ’s quick appearance
At this point the game got pretty interesting .
The Yankees had a few people on base and looked like they were about to tie the game .
Yankee fans forgot about Rob and got back into the game .
Pretty soon , the Tigers decided to change pitchers and this provided a nice lull for Rob to strike again .
This time he appeared seven sections away .
Agent Kula and I spotted him and started pointing and screaming his name as loud as we could .
Very quickly the entire right field section was on their feet trying to get his attention .
Rob cocked his head our way as if he could hear something , but once again disappeared into the tunnel .
Rob , seven sections down
Same photo , detail enlarged
At this point enthusiasm for helping Rob had grown so large that other groups of people were even more excited about it than we were .
A group of guys sitting directly behind us began leading a series of chants as they waited for Rob to appear again .
Several rounds of “ WHERE IS ROB ?
WHERE IS ROB ? WHERE IS ROB ? ” were followed by the somewhat cruel , “ ROB ’S RETARDED ( CLAP CLAP , CLAP CLAP CLAP ) . ”
Several sections joined in on the chat as everyone speculated what was going on with Rob .
The leaders of the Rob - related chants
The Yankees ended up scoring three runs in the bottom of the 6th to go ahead 2 – 3 .
Shortly after the inning ended , Agent Kula spotted Rob on the complete opposite side of the stadium .
Rob was so confused that he somehow found himself in the far most section in left field .
Rob ’s friends wave at him from across the field
Word traveled quickly through the upper deck .
Sections full of strangers started waving their hands at Rob , barely making out his white shirt from across the way .

Rob of course could n’t hear our yelling from the other side of the stadium .
He gave up and ducked back through the tunnel after searching up and down the aisle .
The 7th inning stretch provided another break from Rob spotting , but as soon it was over Rob appeared again .
This time he was somehow in the lower level , right by the Yankees dugout !
Where ’s Rob ?

This appearance marked Rob ’s 6th attempt at finding his seats .
You can track his journey on this map , with his sightings numbered .
His original seat was in section 33 in the right - hand corner .
At the halfway point of the 8th inning , Rob appeared again , this time right in front of us .
The upper deck erupted with cheers as everyone chanted “ Rob ! Rob ! Rob ! ” and pointed towards his seat .

Fans take photos of Rob
Many fans wanted a photo of Rob , and some even wanted to meet him and get their photos taken with him personally .
Rob was so lost that he somehow reached celebrity status , and folks wanted to remember their encounter with him .
The photos do a good job of showing how happy everyone was to see Rob finally find his seat , but the video truly captures the roar of the crowd upon his return .
This was shot by Agent Corrigan with a digital still camera on “ movie mode ” , the best equipment we were able to get inside the stadium .
Rob took his seat and watched the last two innings .
Every few minutes people would walk up to him to say hello and snap a photo .
The guys behind us started up another “ Rob ’s retarded ” chant .
Rob just smiled and waved .
The Tigers scored three runs in the 9th inning and went on to win the game .
As we were leaving the stadium , Yankee fans ’ spirits were lifted when they spotted Rob .
As he walked down the exit ramp a huge chant broke out in his honor as fans shook his hand and gave him high fives .
So that ’s my account from the upper deck .
Now enjoy a first - hand account from Rob himself .
Agent Lathan , “ Ro b ”
This mission called for something I specialize in : being LOST .
Yankee Stadium promised to be a good place to get a reaction for three reasons : 1 ) there are tons of people around 2 ) a baseball game has many lulls 3 ) people are drunk .
Still , I had no clue I would get the reaction that I ended up getting .
I waited until the 6th inning to start the mission ( see reason # 3 ) .
I got out of my seat and ventured to the nearest concession stand to retrieve some refreshments .
When I returned to my original aisle holding a tray full of popcorn and a beer , I did my best to appear lost – once again , an easy task for me .
I glanced up in the general vicinity of my seats , but did not recognize anyone in my section .
Agent Todd led a team of our friends sitting in my section – who were all wildly waving their arms in the air and yelling , “ Rob !
We ’re up here ! ”
But I still continued to glance around them , squinting in their direction and glancing back at my ticket stub .
Giving up , I hopelessly retreated from my aisle and continued my search .
I emerged again with tray in hand – this time two aisles over .
I was greeted by an enormous reaction .
The hysteria created by my friends had quickly spread .
As I stumbled up the aisle looking aimless and not unlike a lost puppy , several hundred people who had never met me before began to scream my name and yell in my face : “ Your friends are over there !
Right over there !!
Hey Rob !
Where are you going ? ! ”
I paid no attention to them and continued looking for my seat .
Next , I briefly appeared in the aisle in between the two aisles from before .
I glanced up to my section , heard a loud , “ Rob ! ” and quickly darted out – just a little “ tease ” to keep my spotters on their toes .
I also did n’t want to get tackled or grabbed by a concerned citizen who desperately wanted me to find my seat .
My next strategy was to wait a few minutes before making another appearance until there was a lull in the baseball game .
I practiced this strategy throughout .
If the Yankees were making a rally or if everybody was standing during the Seventh Inning Stretch , I would stay hidden .
Once the commotion to the real game died down , I would then immediately burst through the aisle and make my appearance .
After all , it was n’t about the actual game was it ?
It was all about looking for me , right ?
Right .
My seat - finding odyssey escalated to the point where I was now wandering around at the exact opposite side of the stadium .
As I stumbled up the very last aisle in the left field upper deck , I was worried that no one would see me .
But sure enough Agents Kula and Todd spotted me out , and the entire section in the right field upper deck erupted in a cheer .
Someone announced , “ There he is !
Look ! ”
And then everybody cheered , “ Rob !!
Over here !
Rob !! ”
Amazingly , people who did n’t know me honestly thought I was dumb enough to look for seats on the opposite side of the stadium .
Several strangers began a chant in my honor : “ Where is Rob ? ! ”
This morphed into a more direct chant : “ Rob ’s retarded ! ” ( CLAP - CLAP , CLAP - CLAP-CLAP )
The whole entire upper deck began chanting this – most of whom had no idea who I was – some of those from distant sections might ’ve thought I was an opposing player up to bat or something .
There was only one way to heighten the opposite - field upper - deck wandering : a front row sighting by the Yankee dugout .
This would be tough since the area is heavily guarded by ushers and the rows are even chained off to those without proper tickets .
But once I made my way to the lower level , I waited until a Yankee rally ended and more importantly until a vendor undid the chain to the aisle and followed closely behind him .
I slowly tiptoed toward the Yankee dugout and falsely glanced around for my seat .
For a brief second I peeked up to the upper deck and out of the corner of my eye I could see hundreds of tiny arms waving around in my direction .
Off in the distance I could faintly hear the chant : “ Rob ’s retarded ! ” ( CLAP - CLAP , CLAP - CLAP-CLAP )
All was well .
In the top of the 8th inning and after over an hour of searching for my long , lost seat , I finally staggered back up to my section .
When I appeared , the upper deck exploded in a cheer .
I ’ve never received such an ovation in my entire life .
I thought to myself , “ Maybe I should try getting lost more often . ”
Then a troubled usher grabbed my arm and asked , “ Are you diabetic ? ” I nodded yes , even though I ’m not .
Another usher strenuously informed me , “ That is your last beer ! ”
He also made extra sure that I found my way to the proper seat .
Walking up the aisle , some people high - fived me , some asked for a picture to be taken with them , and several shook their heads in dismay , telling me the obvious : “ You were really lost . ”
After the game , as I strutted down the exit ramp , several people from other sections of the stadium pointed me out and gave me a few shout - outs such as , “ Hey look , there ’s Rob ! ” or “ Watch out , Rob !
Do n’t get lost ! ”
I nodded my head and pointed back to them as the Fonze would have done back in the day ( I realized I better soak all this up while I can . )
Some of my “ fans ” asked me to pose for photos with them .
One guy said he would add it to his MySpace page .
On the way home I rode the subway by myself .
Some people on the train , who had been sitting in our section , also recognized me as the lost guy from before .
“ Hey , it ’s Rob ! ” they announced excitedly .
Then they started to get worried that I was still lost : “ Wait , were n’t your friends going to some bar on the west - side ?
This train only goes to the east - side . ”
Staying in character I replied , “ Oh whoops .
Oh well … do n’t worry … I ’ll find them . ”
Mission Accomplished .
Check out the sequel to this mission – Where ’s Rob ?

IBM has won a $ 4.9 million government grant from DARPA to begin the first phase of research on " cognitive computing " -- essentially building computers that work like living brains .
The new brain - like computers will aim to process vast amounts of data to solve problems without relying on specific programmed algorithms .
Mark Dean , Vice President of IBM said ,
" The challenge is that computers today are very good at computing , but what we really need is a more efficient way of sifting through information " [ International Herald Tribune ] .
The inside of computers already have the look of neural networks , a static road map of electronic circuits .
But the brain actually works by constantly creating , breaking , and tweaking the synaptic connections between neurons .
Although today 's computers may excel at complex challenges with clear rules , like chess , they fail at simple tasks that require strategy , sensation , perception , and learning , like finding misplaced keys .
IBM will partner with five universities to develop new nano - scale circuitry that has the ability to shift depending on the signals that pass through them .
Free from the constraints of explicitly programmed function , computers could gather together disparate information , weigh it based on experience , form memory independently and arguably begin to solve problems in a way that has so far been the preserve of what we call " thinking " [ BBC ] .
Dharmendra Modha , lead scientist on the project ,
says that the time is right for such a cross - disciplinary project because three disparate pursuits are coming together in what he calls a " perfect storm " [ BBC ] .
First , neuroscience has discovered the biological processes underlying simple brain function .
Second , supercomputing has enabled technology to match the complexity of these brains .
And third , nanotechnology has made it possible to imagine creating simulated synapses , the very element of the brain that enables it to work at speeds and efficiencies computer scientists have so far only dreamed of [ CNET News ] .
Modha says scientists have already created computers that rival the mental abilities of rats , but the new " thinking " computers will aim for the intelligence of cats .
When asked whether he foresees any potential dangers to re-creating the brain 's powers , Modha hedged
, " The questions are so technically challenging and it is so engaging at this point to begin to put the puzzle together , and the whole part is still not completely visible ...
I think it is premature to worry about what if " [ CNET News ] .

Around 80 % of the end - user response time is spent on the front - end .
A fair share of this time is spent on downloading components of the page like scripts , Flash , stylesheets , images etc.
Javascript takes majority of the loading time of a webpage because scripts block parallel downloading and rendering in the page .
Even if you do not have a lot of Javascript files to load on your webpage they can still block loading other content on your page while they load .
Lets have a look at how the standard javascript file include method and the script DOM element method in detail below .
Standard Javascript file include method
< SCRIPT src= " A.JS " language = " JavaScript / text " ></ SCRIPT > < SCRIPT src= " B.JS " language = " JavaScript / text " ></ SCRIPT > < IMG src= " 1.GIF " /> < IMG src= " 2.GIF " /> < IMG src= " 3.GIF " />
Script DOM element method
var p = g.getElementsByTagName ( " HEAD " ) [ 0 ] ; var c = g.createElement ( " script " ) ; c.type= " text / javascript " ; c.onreadystatechange = n ; c.onerror = c.onload = k ; c.src = e ; p.appendChild( C ) ;
This method creates a DOM element for each Script and then adds the element to the HTML .
NOTE :
1 ) Only when the appendChild function is called the Javascript will be executed .
2 ) For inlined code that depends on the Javascript and also for a similar method of Asynchronous Script Loading – See Steve Souders blog
3 ) If you go to MSN.com ( Alexa top 10 site based on traffic ) and hit view source you can see the javacript elements are included by using the script dom element to load the web pages faster .
This is a good example of where you can use the script dom element method for certain js files that do not have inlined code dependency .
Let us run a Pagetest waterfall report and you can see the following for MSN.

We are now just one month out from the time when the first iTunes Connect / App Store contracts are due to expire .
To date , iTunes Connect has yet to offer any renewal option on its website to developers .
This is despite the fact that the page itself says , " Within 90 days of your contract expiration , a renewal contract will be available to you in the ’ Request New Contracts ’ section above . "
Ars gave the Apple Developer Connection a call this morning after Chris Foresman pointed us to this Apple Insider post about the situation .
When attempting to renew an iPhone developer membership , we were told by the representative that Apple had not even implemented a process to do so yet .
" There is no process in place yet to renew it just now , " the rep told us .
" As soon as a process is in place , you 'll be notified via e-mail or the website .
It 's a new program .
This program was not yet in place last year , and Apple needs time . "
When we explained that we were looking both to renew ADC memberships and to update iTunes Connect contracts , the representative instructed us to send a query to devcontracts@apple.com .
She told us that ADC has been receiving a high call volume about these questions as there were " many developers in this situation . "
She also assured us that Apple will not be removing already - approved applications from the store .
We did in fact contact the iTunes Connect e-mail address , who wrote back to us saying , " Please refer to the Contact Us links at the bottom of iTunes Connect .
devprograms should be able to assist you . "
Apparently 1 Infinite Loop does not just refer to a corporate street address .

Michael Moore seeks banking industry whisteblowers to expose ' greatest crime story ever told '
John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Michael Moore is looking for cash .
Not cash to fund a movie -- but cash , the kind that trickles through the fingers of New York bankers .
In a posting on his blog Monday , he called on people who work on Wall Street or in the financial industry to come forward and share with him and his film " what they know . "
" Based on those who have already contacted me , I believe there are a number of you who know " the real deal " about the abuses that have been happening , " Moore wrote in a blog post Wednesday .
" You have information that the American people need to hear .
I am humbly asking you for a moment of courage , to be a hero and help me expose the biggest swindle in American history . "
" A few good people have already come forward , which leads me to believe there are many more of you out there who know what 's going on , " he added .
Moore 's posting offers a tantalizing hint to an element of his new project .
If he 's successful in the way he was in " Sicko , " an expose on the US healthcare system , his next film could be both timely and scathing .
" All correspondence with me will be kept confidential , " Moore promises .
" Your identity will be protected and you will decide to what extent you wish to participate in telling the greatest crime story ever told . "
Moore joked that his regular readers would be flummoxed : " I thought he said he was making a romantic comedy ! "
" Well , I just ca n't say much right now , " he added .
" I 'm sure you can understand why .
One thing I can tell you is that you 're gonna like this movie when I 'm done with it .
Oh , yeah . "

Public schools in Raytown , Mo. , have turned to high - speed Wi-Fi to help boost academic performance for students sharing laptops .
The district serves about 8,000 students , nearly half of them on school lunch assistance , in an aging suburb nearly surrounded by Kansas City , Mo. , said Justin Watermann , technology coordinator for the public schools .
About 1,500 laptops are used for a variety of subjects , including math , and are often shared by students and transported to classrooms via rolling computer carts where they connect to the Internet via Wi -Fi .
The transition to faster 802.11n - based Wi-Fi from Aruba Networks Inc. has taken place in the past four months , partly as a result of replacing Wi -Fi equipment from Meru Networks that was connected to Foundry switches .
The older Wi-Fi access points and infrastructure , installed only a year ago , were n't delivering consistent connections -- especially near homes with Wi-Fi and businesses with radio dishes that created network interference , he said .
" After a year of trying , we were still having problems finding good coverage , " Watermann said in a recent interview .
To make the older Wi -Fi network coverage work properly with about 150 access points ( APs ) , the district would have needed to buy an expensive second Wi -Fi controller .
That 's what prompted Watermann and integrator CDW Government Inc. ( CDWG ) to switch to Aruba hardware .
For less than $ 400,000 , the district has been able to install about 250 Aruba APs and related infrastructure for 22 buildings serving elementary through high school students .
CDWG was able to recoup some costs from the older Foundry technology through a competitive upgrade , he said .
Watermann said he researched several Wi-Fi products and found that Aruba 's Adaptive Radio Management technology was useful in adjusting channels and power levels to mitigate the interference experienced on the older system .
" When we picked Aruba , we said that if we make this change , it really has to work .
And it worked instantly , " he said .
A feature in the Aruba technology allows Watermann to import floor plans and maps of buildings to show where APs are located , allowing him to adjust Wi -Fi signal patterns .
Another plus from the transition has been the improved signal strength 802.11n offers .
Part of the instigation for the Wi-Fi transition came from a school principal whose office was in the same building as Watermann , he said .
She complained whenever the older system failed , noting that the district 's academic objectives relied on effective wireless connections to laptops running academic programs , Watermann said .
" Because she was in our building , she would say , ' OK , we 've paid for the software and the laptops , and we have the kids sitting in class unable to learn . '
She was polite , but very insistent , " Watermann recalled .
The district 's investment in laptops and wireless networking is designed to help improve math scores and other academic benchmarks , Watermann noted .
" If the laptops were just for casual Web browsing , that would be one thing .
But we have run a budget deficit this year and still have computer labs and math coaches who are working off a grant to improve math scores .
...
We have the Carnegie math program on Mac laptops and incentives under No Child Left Behind for doing more assessments and testing .
It became critical to have a good wireless network . "
Watermann said he and other school officials view the 802.11n network as " one more education tool .
The staffers think it is essential . "
While he said the upgrades are " pretty advanced " for a public school district of Raytown 's size , he also said the district faces financial challenges and has to make every dollar count .
" When I meet with technology vendors , I tell them I have a very limited budget , this is what I 'm looking for and it's got to work and be a good value . "

: First release of nftables
From : Patrick McHardy < kaber@trash.net >
To : Netfilter Development Mailinglist < netfilter-devel@vger.kernel.org >
Subject : [ ANNOUNCE ] : First release of nftables Date : Wed , 18 Mar 2009 05:29:42 +0100 Message -ID : < 49C078B6.4020603@trash.net >
Cc : Linux Netdev List < netdev@vger.kernel.org >

Finally , with a lot of delay , I 've just released the first full public version of my nftables code ( including userspace ) , which is intended to become a successor to iptables .
Its written from scratch and there are numerous differences to iptables in both features and design , so I 'll start with a brief overview .
There are three main components : - the kernel implementation - libnl netlink communication - nftables userspace frontend
The kernel provides a netlink configuration interface , as well as runtime ruleset evaluation using a small classification language interpreter .
libnl contains the low - level functions for communicating with the kernel , the nftables frontend is what the user interacts with .
Kernel ------
The first major difference is that there 's no one - to - one relation of matches and targets available to the user and those implemented in the kernel anymore .
The kernel provides some generic parameterizable operations , like loading data from a packet , comparing data with other data etc .
Userspace combines the individual operations appropriately to get the desired semantic .
Data is represented in a generic way inside the kernel and the operations are defined on the generic data representations , meaning its possible to use any matching feature ( ranges , masks , set lookups etc. ) with any kind of data .
Semantic validation of the operation is performed in userspace , the kernel does n't care as long as the operation does n't potentially harm the kernel .
The kernel does n't have a distinction between matches and targets anymore , operations can be arbitrarily chained , fixing a common complaint that multiple rules are required to f.i. log and drop a packet .
Terminal operations will stop evaluation of a rule , even if further operations are specified .
Userspace warns about rules containing operations after unconditionally terminal operations .
Some operations can be runtime - parameterized , f.i. the " meta " module , which can change meta - data like packet marks .
This can be used to transfer marks between conntracks and packets , transfer routing realms to marks for binding connections to a route in multipath environments , or create maps ( dictonaries ) of parameters depending on some different value and more .
Last but not least , nftables natively supports set lookups and dictionary mappings .
Sets ( as everything else ) operate on generic data and thus can be used for any kind of match .
Depending on the kind of set , they also support range queries , which allows to specify sets containing f.i. individual hosts as well as entire networks with different prefix lengths .
Currently implemented are hash lookups and rb-trees ( which are quite suboptimal for this purpose ) .
The internal set representation is currently selected by userspace , but the goal is to have the kernel select it automatically based on the required operations .
Dictonaries can associate a different data item that is returned with each key .
This data item may be a generic data item , or one of the control - flow altering netfilter verdicts , including jumps .
This can be either used ( with generic data ) for runtime - parameterized operations , or , in case of verdicts , for creating jump tables , which allows to create a tree structure for classification with efficient branching in the nodes .
The end - goal is to have userspace optionally perform a transformation of the ruleset to such a structure .
Some of the less major differences include : - protocol family independancy : currently supporting IP v4 and IP v6 , with basic support for bridging .
Support for mixed IPv4 / IP v6 rulesets is planned .
- incremental changes supported , no atomic ruleset replacement anymore - the core is completely lockless , the few operations that require locking take care of this internally - packet and byte counters are an optional operation , by default none exist .
This allows to only register chains with netfilter when there are actually rules present , reducing the performance impact of empty chains to zero .
- tables are normally ( currently one exception : nat ) created by userspace , which also specifies the contained chains and hook priority for chains hooked directly with netfilter .
- kernel is dumb and mainly does what it is told , whether it makes sense or not .
Semantics are validated in userspace , where proper error reporting can be done .
- far smaller code size than iptables :)
Userspace ---------
I 'll skip libnl here as it contains mainly low - level communication support .
The userspace frontend is probably even more different to iptables than the kernel .
The classification language is based on a real grammar that is parsed by a bison - generated parser ( currently , it might have to be replaced ) and converted to a syntax tree .
Besides things like table and chain operations , the language elements are mainly : - runtime data describing expressions : " tcp dport " , " meta mark " , ... - constant data expressions : " ssh " , " 22 " , " 192.168.0.1/24 " , ... - relational expressions and operations : " equal " , " non-equal " , " member of set " , ... - combining expressions , like sets and flag lists : { 22 , 23} and established , related - actions ( " log " , " drop " , " meta mark " , ...)
Constant parsing is context - dependant , meaning constants can only be used when the necessary context exists , i.e. on the RHS of a relational expression or within a dictionary for the data items , where the context is defined based on the use of the mapped items ( dnat map tcp dport { 22 => host.com } has an IPv4 address context for host.com from the DNAT operation ) .
There are currently about 25 defined data types , covering addresses ( IPv4 / IPv6 / LL ) , numbers , ports , strings , ethertypes , internet protocols , different protocol specific flag values , marks , realms , UIDs / GIDs etc. etc.
Constants are automatically converted to the approriate byte order , which is also dependant on the context .
Currently casts are unsupported , but they might be useful in some cases :)
The frontend supports both dealing with only a single rule at a time for incremental operations , as well as parsing entire files ,
In the later case verification is performed on all rules and changes are only made after full validation .
Currently not implemented , but planned , is transactional semantic where changes are rolled back when the kernel reports an error .
At this point a few example might be in order ... - a single rule , specified incrementally on the command line : # nft add rule output tcp dport 22 log accept
The default address family is IP v4 , the default table is filter .
The full specification would look like this : # nft add rule inet filter output tcp dport 22 log accept - a chain containing multiple rules : #!
nft -f include " ipv4 - filter " chain filter output { ct state established , related accept tcp dport 22 accept counter drop } creates the filter table based on the definitions from " ipv4 - filter " and populates the output chain with the given three rules .
OK , back to the internals .
After the input has been parsed , it is evaluated .
This stage performs some basic transformations , like constant folding and propagation , as well as most semantic checks .
During this step , a protocol context is built based on the current address family and the specified matches , which describes the protocols of packets that might hit later operations in the same rule .
This allows two things : - conflict detection : ... ip protocol tcp udp dport 53 results in : < cmdline > : 1:37 - 45 : Error : conflicting protocols specified : tcp vs. udp add filter output ip protocol tcp udp dport 53 ^^^^^^^^^ ... ip6 filter output ip daddr 192.168.0.1 < cmdline >: 1:19 - 26 : Error : conflicting protocols specified : ip6 vs. ip ip6 filter output ip daddr 192.168.0.1 ^^^^^^^ ^
The context is currently defined based on the tables protocol family , any specified payload matches on protocol fields , as well as meta data matches on the incoming interface type .
Conntrack expressions are currently not included , but will be .
- dependency generation :
To match IPv4 SSH - traffic , the full match specification would be " ip protocol 6 tcp dport 22 " .
The shortcut is " tcp dport 22 " , the necessary protocol match can in this case be deduced automatically based on the table information ( IPv4 ) and the higher layer protocol ( TCP ) .
After evaluation ( which contains a few more steps that are getting into too much detail ) of the entire input , a final transformation step is performed .
During this , all sets and dictonaries containing ranges are converted to elementary interval trees .
In the case of sets , no conflicts can arise from overlapping members and they are simply joined .
In case of dictonaries , overlaps are resolved based on the size of the range ( smaller wins ) , the assumption being that a smaller range is an exception to a bigger range .
So in the rule : ip daddr { 192.168.0.0/24 => drop , 192.168.0.100 => accept} the host 192.168.0.100 would be regarded as an exception to its containing network .
Only when no resoltion based on this is possible , an error is reported .
Finally , the internal representation is linearized , registers for passing values between operations are allocated and everything is sent to the kernel .
The kernel - internal represenation of course does n't include types and f.i. payload matches are merely an offset and a length .
During dumping , the entire syntax tree , including types , is reconstructed .
Redundant information might get lost before it is sent to the kernel , but both the kernel and the reconstructed ruleset are semantically equivalent .
Examples --------
There are a lot more details that would be worth to describe , but since its exceeding the volume of a reasonable release announcement , I 'll skip the rest and conclude with a list of supported features and a few more examples that might be helpful to get started .
- the " describe " command : this can be used to get information about a primary expression , like types and pre-defined constants : # nft describe ct state ct expression , datatype conntrack state ( basetype bitmask , integer ) , 32 bits pre-defined symbolic constants : invalid 0x00000001 new 0x00000008 established 0x00000002 related 0x00000004 untracked 0x00000040 # nft describe ip protocol payload expression , datatype Internet protocol ( basetype integer ) , 8 bits - include files : other files can be included from a ruleset .
A default search path can be specified using " - i " , by default it contains only " / etc/nftables " .
A set of files is included that contain the standard table definitions known from iptables .
Usage : include " ipv4 - filter " , include " ipv6 - mangle " , ... Supported features
------------------
Some very basic documentation is included that might contain some more details .
Expressions ( matches and statement parameterization ) : -----------------------------------------------------
Primary expressions :
--------------------
Primary expressions describe a single data item .
They can be constant or non-constant , where non-constant means the data is collected during runtime .
- meta data expression : gather skb meta data Usage : meta < key > where key is one of : length , protocol , priority , mark , iif , iifname , iiftype , oif , oifname , oiftype , skuid , skgid , rtclassid , secmark Use the " nft describe " command to get more information on these .
- conntrack expression : gather conntrack data Usage : ct < key > where key is one of : state , direction , status , mark , seecmark , expiration , helper , protocol , saddr , daddr , proto-src , proto - dst - payload expression : gather data from packet payload Usage : < key1 > < key2 > with ( key1 : key2 : ) eth : saddr , daddr , type vlan : id , cfi , pcp , type arp : htype , ptype , hlen , plen , operation ip : version , hdrlength , tos , length , id , frag_off , ttl , protocol , checksum , saddr , daddr icmp : type , code , checksum , id , sequence , gateway , mtu ip6 : version , priority , flowlabel , length , nexthdr , hoplimit , saddr , daddr ah : nexthdr , hdrlength , reserved , spi , sequence esp : spi , sequence comp : nexthdr , flags , cpi udp : sport , dport , length , checksum udplite : sport , dport , csumcov , checksum tcp : sport , dport , sequence , ackseq , doff , reserved , flags , window , checksum , urgptr dccp : sport , dport sctp : sport , dport hbh : nexthdr , hdrlength rt : nexthdr , hdrlength , type , seg_left rt0 : addr [ NUM ] rt2 : addr frag : nexthdr , reserved , frag_off , reserved2 , more_fragments , id dst : nexthdr , hdrlength mh : nexthdr , hdrlength , type , reserved , checksum A lot of these define their own types , use the " describe " command to get more information .
Combined expressions : ---------------------
Combined expressions combine two primary expressions : - Bitwise expressions : & , | , ^ Usage : < expr > < operator > < constant - expr > Constant expressions are evaluated in userspace .
- Prefix expressions : network prefixes , may be useful for other types Usage : < constant - expr > '/' < NUM > - Range expressions : value ranges Usage : < constant - expr > '-' < constant - expr > - List expressions : lists of expressions Usage : < constant - expr > , < constant - expr > [ , ...]
This is currently only used for specifying multiple flag values .
- Concat expression : concatenate multiple expressions < expr > . < expr > [ . ... ]
Useful for doing a multi- dimensional set lookup .
Kernel side not implented , currently only works with adjacent header fields .
- Wildcard expression : useful for defining default cases in dictionaries Usage : '*' Relational Expressions : -----------------------
Relational expressions are used to build match expressions by combining primary expressions with relational operations : - basic relational expressions : Usage : < expr > < operator > < expr > with operator being one of == , != , < , <= , > , >=. " == " is implicit and can be omitted .
When the RHS is a set , the operation defaults to " set lookup " : < expr > [ implicit ] ' { ' < constant expr > , ... ' } '
The " in-range " relation is implicit when the RHS is a range : < expr > [ implicit ] < constant - expr > '-' < constant - expr > - flag comparisions : Usage : < expr > [ implicit ] < flag- list >
Which basically does " expr & flag - list != 0 " .
flag - list is a comma seperated list of constant expressions of basetype bitmask .
Statements ( somewhat similar to targets ) :
-----------------------------------------
- verdicts : accept , drop , queue , continue , jump , goto , return - verdict maps : dictionaries of verdicts : ip daddr { 192.168.0.1 => drop , ... } - byte / packet counters : Usage : add " counter " anywhere before a terminal verdict - logging : logging using the nf_log mechsism using the primary backend .
Usage : " log [ prefix " prefix " ] [ group NUM ] [ snaplen NUM ] [ queue - threshold NUM ] - limit : might be broken currently Usage : " limit rate RATE / time - unit " - reject : reject packets Usage : " reject " ( no parameters currently ) - NAT : SNAT / DNAT targets : Usage : " snat [ constant address or map expr ] [ constant port or map expression [ ' :' constant port or map expr ] ] "
The port or port - range specification is optional , similar to iptables .
The snat syntax is identical .
- meta target : Usage : meta < key > set < expr >
See above for valid keys .
Some final notes ...
The source code is available in three git trees : git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kaber/nft-2.6.git
git://git.netfilter.org/libnl-nft.git git://git.netfilter.org/nftables.git
The kernel tree will eventually also move to netfilter.org , currently the git daemon is unable to handle it because of memory shortage .
Ths source code is considered alpha quality and is not meant for users at this time , it will spew quite a lot of debugging messages and definitely has bugs .
Nevertheless , all of the basic features and most of the rest should work fine , the last crash has been several months ago .
The two most noticable things that currently do n't work is numerical argument parsing for arguments that have more specific types ( f.i. port numbers ) , as well as reconstruction of the internal representation of sets and dictionaries using ranges .
Both will be fixed shortly .
Additionally there are some optimizations missing from the public kernel tree , I 'll forward port and merge them shortly .
The plans for the near future are to complete the missing feature and stabilize the code , in order to have it in proper shape within a few months .
There is a short TODO list in the nftables source tree .
Anyone interested in working on the code , please let me know , there are a few self - contained things that are good to get started .
Have fun :) --

New York City in super slow motion
Posted by Pete Berg on Monday , February 2nd , 2009 at 9:23 am
Vicente Sahuc shot this video at 300 fps on a Casio EX - F1 in NYC … on roller skates .
Further proof that everything looks awesome in slow motion .
New York 2008 from Vicente Sahuc on Vimeo .
Thirty - plus years ago , when I was a graduate student in economics , only the least ambitious of my classmates sought careers in the financial world .
Even then , investment banks paid more than teaching or public service  but not that much more , and anyway , everyone knew that banking was , well , boring .
In the years that followed , of course , banking became anything but boring .
Wheeling and dealing flourished , and pay scales in finance shot up , drawing in many of the nation ’s best and brightest young people ( O.K. , I ’m not so sure about the “ best ” part ) .
And we were assured that our supersized financial sector was the key to prosperity .
Instead , however , finance turned into the monster that ate the world economy .
Recently , the economists Thomas Philippon and Ariell Reshef circulated a paper that could have been titled “ The Rise and Fall of Boring Banking ” ( it ’s actually titled “ Wages and Human Capital in the U.S. Financial Industry , 1909 - 2006 ” ) .
They show that banking in America has gone through three eras over the past century .
Before 1930 , banking was an exciting industry featuring a number of larger - than - life figures , who built giant financial empires ( some of which later turned out to have been based on fraud ) .
This highflying finance sector presided over a rapid increase in debt : Household debt as a percentage of G.D.P. almost doubled between World War I and 1929 .
Christine St - Pierre , Quebec ’s Minister of Culture , Communications and the Status of Women , today announced the classification of Habitat 67 in Montreal , Canada as a historic monument .
Units 1011 and 1012 , which are owned by architect and designer Moshe Safdie , were also classified .
Mr. Safdie was present at the announcement .
â€ œHabitat 67 was showered with praise from the day it was created .
Specialists and the uninitiated alike were won over by its original , bold design , which showcased construction techniques unheard of at the time , â€ said St - Pierre .
â€ œI am very proud to announce the classification of this unique architecture .
It is a fine example of modern heritage and will henceforth be classified under the Cultural Property Act.â€ 
â€ œI am very moved and honored that Habitat 67 has been classified as a historic monument , â€ stated Mr. Safdie , â€ œthe greatest pleasure for an architect is to see the creation alive , as a thriving community , 42 years later.â€ 
Habitat 67 began life as a masterâ€™s thesis project prepared in 1961 by Mr. Safdie , then an architecture student at McGill University .
He came up with the idea of a high density apartment building that would provide residents with privacy as well as peace and quiet .
He was invited to develop his idea for Expo 67 and did so alongside engineer August E. Komendant .
By the time the universal exhibition came round , the project was partially completed , and 26 apartments were reserved for the Expo .
The housing complex had 354 prefabricated units , initially forming 158 one or two story apartments with one to four bedrooms .
The apartments were divided into three pyramids .
Each apartment featured a landscaped garden built on the roof of the level below .
Dwellings had a molded plastic bathroom and a modular kitchen that are still incredibly modern even by todayâ€™s standards .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Yesterday , I tried to take on some of the opposition to Obama ’s handling of the financial crisis .
I think I did a fine job – but I ’m certainly no Jon Stewart .
Pointing out that the stock market tanked after Ronald Reagan became president and after we won World War II , he takes on this farcical idea that the stock market is some sort of rational indicator of economic conditions :
( I ’ll post full links when TDS posts them . )
The stock market is n’t a rational creature – it is subject to panics and irrational exuberance and sour moods and churlishness and massive misjudgments .
To judge whether an economic plan is working or not requires time and wisdom – neither of which are found in the daily results of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Of course , Stewart founds some time to mock Rick Santelli on the way :
Humor makes it all go down so much easier .
There ’s no denying the inchoate anger , not fully formed , matured , directed , or realized , that some seek to target Obama with .
The problem is that these Santellis and these Limbaughs and the rest of them have no more to offer than the mythical Howard Beale of Network – whose famous rants clearly inspired Santelli ’s on - air persona :
Watching this famous clip today is eerie – as it echoes into our own time – and makes Santelli ’s performance seem all the more post - modern .
In the end , it comes down to this :
As a nation we have a choice to do nothing , to let Obama implement his plan , or to come up with a better one .
In my opinion , Obama ’s opponents have yet to offer a serious alternate plan .
Which is why I ’m sticking with him on this , at least for now .
A note on the clips :
These clips have been taken from an episode of the television show The Daily Show originally airing on March 4 , 2009 .
It is believed that this short clip qualifies as Fair Use under United States copyright law .

A federal appeals court ruling has brought an Oregon man one step closer to suing the Vatican for sexual abuse he says he suffered by a Roman Catholic priest .
In a 59 - page decision issued Tuesday , a three - judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the man -- who says he was molested in the 1960s by a priest at a Catholic school -- can pursue a civil lawsuit against the Holy See because the priest allegedly abused him while serving in a religious capacity .
Lawyers for the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a watershed moment for victims of clergy abuse , who for decades have wanted to hold the Catholic hierarchy accountable for protecting priests .
A lawyer for the Holy See commended the ruling for acknowledging the Vatican ’s decentralized structure .
Advertisement
“ They have been choosing for years . . . to protect the clerics and not the kids , ” said Jeff Anderson , a Minneapolis lawyer representing the Oregon man .
“ This really is another step forward , another door open .
. . .
The good news for the laity , the community of faith , the parishioners and all of us is that the Vatican can now be held accountable . ”
Although the ruling does not permit victims to sue Pope Benedict XVI , Anderson said he intended to depose the pontiff .
The case involves the late Rev. Andrew Ronan , a Servite priest who , according to victims ’ lawyers , was sent to Chicago after being accused of molesting children in his native Ireland .
Archdiocesan officials said Ronan worked for St. Philip High School on Chicago ’s West Side from 1960 through 1965 .
He was then transferred to a Catholic school in Oregon , where he reportedly assaulted the plaintiff in the case .
St. Philip closed in 1970 .
Ronan died in 1992 .
Officials from the Servite order did not return calls seeking comment .

Marci Hamilton , a professor at New York ’s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law who assisted in the plaintiff ’s case , commended the ruling as a model of how the American judicial system is supposed to work , likening the triumph to the biblical story of David vs. Goliath .
“ The fact that the United States courts have opened this opportunity in this case sets the standard for the whole world that there really can be justice for one victim even though he ’s a victim of one powerful organization , ” Hamilton said .
“ We now have a template for understanding that anyone who harms our children in the U.S. is going to be held accountable whether they ’re sovereign or not . ”
But Jeffrey Lena , a California lawyer who represented the Holy See , said the ruling favored the Vatican by recognizing that every action everywhere could not be traced directly to Rome .
“ The court did recognize , based on the plaintiff ’s complaint , that within the Catholic Church there exists different and separate legal entities , ” he said .
Advertisement
The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in November that a lawsuit filed against the Vatican by three men alleging they were abused by clergy could continue .
The lawyer in that case is seeking class - action status , saying there are thousands of victims nationwide .
Some legal scholars say the rulings are not the last word and expect the 9th Circuit Court ’s ruling to be overturned by the Supreme Court .
But G. Robert Blakey , a professor of law at the University of Notre Dame , said that if the plaintiff could prove that the priest was an employee of the Vatican , the ruling would stand .
“ Is the Vatican potentially liable for child molesting ?
The answer to that question is yes if and only if you can show that the priest was engaged in conduct as an employee of the Vatican , ” Blakey said .

The mighty weapon that built galactic empires ... the ray gun .
No true space adventurer is ever without one .
Constructed from recycled parts , each ray gun comes with an amazing , if not quite outlandish , backstory .
Politicians on both sides of the divide between the Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in the province denounced the killing as the work of “ terrorists , ” and called on anyone with knowledge of the killers to step forward and help the police , despite the deep mistrust for the force that lingers among Catholics from the past , when the police were widely regarded as allies of the Protestants .
With three members of the security forces killed in less than 48 hours , there were fears that the fragile peace that culminated with the establishment of a power - sharing government in May 2007 might be at risk .
The reaction in Craigavon , on one of the main roads from Belfast to the border with the Irish republic , suggested that for now , those concerns might be overblown .
The town , in the county of Armagh , a major sectarian battlefield in the past , has a mixed population of Catholics and Protestants , but people approached at random at the site of the shooting and in shopping malls seemed confident that the peace would survive the shootings .
A 25 - year - old Catholic man who gave his name only as William said that he supported Sinn Fein , the main nationalist party in the power - sharing government , and that he “ feared something like this was going to happen ” when I.R.A. sentiment split over the peace agreement .
“ There is still a small minority out there who agree with shootings and all that , ” he said .
“ I do n’t agree with it myself .
There was a time when I may have agreed with it .
But it is the wrong time .
Violence is in the past . ”

The killing in Craigavon was the first time that a police officer had died from a politically motivated attack since the old Royal Ulster Constabulary was reformed in 2001 and renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland .
The force has been sharply reduced in size , shorn of a paramilitary wing known as the “ specials ” and set on a course to even out a recruitment policy that for decades had favored Protestants over Catholics .

It 's the free music service that 's attracting thousands of new users every day , and now Spotify is taking on the daddy of online music – iTunes .
The on - demand streaming service has signed a deal to sell MP3 downloads as well as just playing them .
Tracks on the Spotify player , which looks not unlike Apple 's familiar iTunes software , will now come with a link leading its European users to downloadable , 320 kilobyte per second MP3 copies of songs and albums via the London - based online music store , 7 Digital which sells individual tracks for as little as 50 p , and some albums for just £ 3 .
While the service will begin by offering individual tracks and albums , it will soon allow users to buy entire playlists either constructed by themselves or shared by other users .
Spotify , which has a catalogue of six million tracks and this month announced that it had surpassed one million members , allows its users to enjoy streamed playlists interrupted infrequently by advertisements .
It also offers a premium streaming service , which , for a fee of £ 9.99 per month , allows subscribers to listen ad - free .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Spotify also has retail affiliate relationships with Amazon and iTunes .
However , they currently apply to only a very small selection of the Spotify catalogue .
In future , said Daniel Ek , the service 's founder , Spotify would boast a " more integrated offering " with Amazon 's music store as well as 7 Digital .
Mr Ek 's company is developing ways to allow users to buy tracks from both sources without having to navigate away from the Spotify player application .
As for iTunes , the service will continue to offer more traditional links to the Apple music store .
While the new download service will not put Spotify in direct competition with iTunes , it could mark a significant shift in the way consumers choose to listen to and then purchase music .
Should Spotify become the most popular and enduring of the free online jukeboxes , then online music stores such as iTunes will be keen to have the most convenient links from the Spotify player .
Ad -supported free music services , including Spotify and Last.fm ( which also offers some downloads ) , may be forced to diversify into music sales in the current economic climate .
Mark Mulligan , an analyst at Forrester Research , told the BBC : " [ Spotify ] went into this thinking it was going to be a premium subscription business ...
The problem is what 's proven to be the successful part is the free bit . "
Two sites with similar business models , Spiral Frog and Ruckus , have been forced to close down recently as a result of the collapse in advertising revenues .
Some experts argue that there simply is n't enough advertising revenue to sustain free music services .
Meanwhile , iTunes has raised the price of tracks in the US from 99 cents to $ 1.29 .
In the UK , the cost of the cheapest iTunes songs remain 59 p , greater than 7 Digital 's 50 p minimum .
" The market leader is n't iTunes , " claimed Ged Day , founder of the download site Bleep.com .
" The market leader is free . "
Spotify 's buying option will first arrive in the UK , Germany , France , Italy and Spain .
Sweden , where Spotify is based , and Norway and Finland , will have to wait a few more weeks for the download service .
Spotify is currently unavailable elsewhere .

On CNN's " State of the Union , " host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country .
This week , King traveled to Georgia to learn about the toll military service is taking on two veterans .
Chris Tucker , who served three tours in Iraq , suffers from hearing , back , foot problems and still has nightmares .
SAVANNAH , Georgia ( CNN ) --
As his tank rolled into Baghdad in April 2003 , Chris Tucker mounted his camera to capture the moment .
" It 's history ; we made history , " he told CNN back then .
" It 's my first war , hopefully my last war . "
He could not have imagined then that six years later , Iraq would still be a combat zone .
" I thought we would get there quick and handle our business and we'd be out , " Tucker told us this week .
" At least , that 's what we were told anyway . "
Tucker received a medical discharge from the Army last year and he now is Officer Chris Tucker of the Savannah - Chatham Metropolitan Police Department .
" You still get to serve your community and your country in other ways , " he said .
At age 26 , he is a veteran of three combat tours .
The patrol skills he learned on the streets of Baghdad , Fallujah and Sadr City come in handy as he drives his police cruiser around the neighborhoods of his Savannah precinct .
" Some people -- you will be moving around the corner and they will just run , " Tucker said as he drove his cruiser .
" And you can tell they are favoring one side -- maybe they have a gun . "

" So my life is slowing down , " Tucker said .
" But I enjoy the slow pace . "
But he has n't left it all behind .
As the war hits the six - year mark , Tucker is part of a history -- and a legacy -- still being written as the military tries to better understand the depth of the damage to those exposed repeatedly to the violence .
" I still have the nightmares and wake up and find myself downstairs and I do n't know how I got there , " Tucker said .
" I still see and dream the same things .
... Faces . Kids ' faces .
People that you have engaged or you have had contact with .
...
You see your colleagues blown up .
Things like that . "
He left the Army with a sour taste .
He was sent back for his third tour despite the nightmares , depression , major hearing loss and painful injuries to his back and both feet .
Then , the Army decided to give him a medical discharge for his back issues even though Tucker believes he could have recovered with rehabilitation .
But he tries not to dwell on his frustration .
" I try to distance myself from it as much as I can , because for me , the more I think about it , the more I reflect on what happened and what we did , the more I think the dreams and the nightmares actually come back . "
Tucker is as tired of the Iraq war as anyone , but his experience tells him things can suddenly take a turn for the worse , and so he is skeptical of President Obama 's promise to get most combat troops out of Iraq by August 2010 .
" I think we are in too deep to pull out , " Tucker said .
" You ca n't just commit the way we committed and then say , ' OK , we are done . ' ...
Politics should not be involved in the way the war is handled . "
There will be no more tours for Tucker , but a colleague on the Savannah - Chatham force will soon deploy for his first Iraq tour , and is being ribbed around the precinct , by Tucker and others , as " the grandpa going off to war . "

Powell is 50 years old and became a grandfather just last week .
Watch Tucker and Powell tell their stories »
Powell served nearly 20 years ago in the Persian Gulf War , then in 1992 took an early retirement package when the Army was downsizing after the war .
The deal required him to stay on what the military calls the IRR -- the Individual Ready Reserve -- but even as troops were sent to Afghanistan after 9/11 and then to Iraq for repeat combat tours , Powell heard nothing .
Then last year , nearly 15 years after leaving the military , he was told to report to a local Reserve center .
Another request came in January of this year .
Both times , after some perfunctory paperwork , Powell was sent home .
But when he returned home from work one day last month , an overnight letter from the Army had arrived with orders that he was being activated for an Iraq deployment .
First , starting next month , he 'll have refresher training on radar systems at Fort Jackson in South Carolina .
" They 're kind of shocked , " Powell said of his family .
But there are no complaints from Powell -- to the contrary .
" I still feel I am fully capable of being a soldier , " he told us outside at his police precinct .
" Once a soldier , always a soldier .
I find that it's an honor to serve within the military .
I enjoyed the military while I was in .
Kind of looking forward to getting back in the groove . "

A senior Treasury official involved in the bailout effort said the administration was carefully trying not to do anything that could harm the banks and was giving financial incentives to modify mortgages .
The official said the restrictions were part of a larger effort to clean up bank balance sheets and assist the economy .
“ We ’re having to take some very unpleasant actions when the alternatives are so much worse , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of not being identified .
But a growing chorus of industry experts are warning that asking weak banks to carry out the government ’s economic and social policies could increase the drain on the public purse .
These experts say that the financial assistance , while helpful in the short run , could force weak banks to engage in lending practices that will lose even more money , and that the government inevitably will become more heavily involved in dictating how banks do business .
“ I honestly believe the people in power pushing this policy see it as a win - win  as something that is good for the banking industry and good for homeowners and others , ” said Douglas J. Elliott , a former investment banker who is now an economics fellow at the Brookings Institution .
“ But there is a slippery slope and there are potentially significant negative consequences . ”
Mr. Elliott says that by modifying loans , banks that are already fragile could wind up losing more money .
“ What gets us in real trouble , ” he said , “ is when we try to fudge things and pretend that something is in the direct interest of both the government and the financial institutions when it in fact costs the banks money or increases their risk levels . ”
Take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the housing - finance companies that the government now controls .
In recent months , they have been told to spend billions of dollars buying bundles of mortgages for which there are no other buyers , and to let homeowners refinance their loans  even if they have no equity .

Sikh sues IRS after losing job over religious knife 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
A Sikh woman sued the Internal Revenue Service this week , alleging that the IRS violated her religious freedom by prohibiting her from wearing a small ceremonial knife to her job as a revenue agent .
The lawsuit , filed in Houston federal district court on Tuesday , states that the IRS fired Kawaljeet Kaur Tagore in July 2006 because she refused to take off her kirpan , an article of faith that Sikhs are required to wear at all times .
The blunt blade , worn sheathed , is intended to remind the bearer of a Sikh 's duty to protect the weak and promote justice .
Tagore , 35 , is the same woman who said she and her family were harassed by Harris County sheriff deputies in November after calling 911 to report a burglary at their home .
An investigation by the sheriff 's Internal Affairs Division is ongoing .
" Our government is tasked with securing our religious liberties , but in Ms. Tagore 's case , both the federal government and the local government not only failed to secure her rights , but trampled on them , " said Harsimran Kaur , legal director of the New York - based Sikh Coalition .
" Both incidents underscore the governments ' ignorance about Sikhism and about the kirpan in particular . "
The coalition , along with the D.C. - based Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and Houston civil rights attorney Scott Newar , filed the suit against the IRS on Tagore 's behalf .
The IRS banned the kirpan as a so - called dangerous weapon , even though the government allows hundreds of sharp scissors , letter openers , knives and box cutters in the Mickey Leland Federal Building in downtown Houston , where Tagore worked , Newar said .
" There 's never been any allegation that she had somehow taken the kirpan and used it as a weapon — that 's not what its purpose is , " Newar said .
" It 's a symbolic religious article that Sikhs have carried for centuries .
It 's like a Cross , it 's like a Star of David , it 's like any other religious ornament .
It just happens to have a blade . "
IRS spokeswoman Lea Crusberg declined to comment on pending litigation .
According to the suit , Tagore began working for the IRS in July 2004 .
On April 14 , 2005 , she was formally initiated into the Sikh faith .
After the initiation , a Sikh is obligated to wear five Sikh articles of faith , including the kirpan .
The articles serve as a public expression of the Sikh faith .
" It 's a religious uniform just like a Jew wears a yarmulke or a Priest wears a white collar , " said Kaur , of the Sikh Coalition .
The articles must be worn at all times , even if a Sikh is threatened with the loss of property , freedom or life , she said .
A few days after her initiation Tagore began wearing a 9 - inch kirpan sheathed under her shirt to work .
She informed her IRS supervisor , who " expressed concern about her ability to carry her kirpan in her workplace , " the lawsuit states .
Tagore agreed to carry a shorter kirpan to work .
This one was 6 inches long with a 3 - inch blade .
It was not sharp or capable of inflicting bodily harm , and never triggered the Leland building 's metal detector , the lawsuit states .
On April 20 , Tagore provided the IRS with information about the kirpan and requested , through counsel , that she be allowed to carry it in the workplace .
Her supervisor told her to leave .
He said the kirpan violated agency rules of conduct and federal law prohibiting people from possessing knives with blades of 2.5 inches or longer in federal facilities .
Kaur , of the Sikh Coalition , said there 's no prescribed length for a kirpan .
" It 's really up to an individual and their understanding of the faith , " she said .
" For Ms. Tagore , she felt that she began carrying a smaller kirpan that was as small as her religious conscience would allow . "
The IRS allowed Tagore to work from home for nine months , but in January 2006 , the IRS director of field operations ordered Tagore to modify her kirpan and report to the Leland Building by the end of the month .
When Tagore showed up with the same kirpan , officers with the Federal Protective Service barred her from the building .
She was fired in July 2006 .
Tagore 's lawsuit seeks lost pay and reinstatement with restoration of benefits and seniority , as well as compensatory and punitive damages .
In the last few years , employers like AT&T and organizations like the International Monetary Fund have reversed bans against Sikh kirpans across the country , Kaur said .
Tagore , who later found a job as a tax consultant with a Houston firm , has no problem carrying a kirpan in her new office , she said .
Tagore did not return phone calls for comment .
Kaur said she has been advised by her attorneys not to speak to the media .
Harris County sheriff 's spokesman Paul Mabry said news of Tagore 's lawsuit will not affect the ongoing internal affairs investigation into her family 's alleged harassment by deputies , an incident sparked in part by the same kirpan .
Family members have said they called 911 on Nov. 26 when their home in the 10800 block of Oak Bayou Lane was burglarized .
But instead of investigating the break - in , they said , the responding deputy became alarmed when he noticed Tagore wore a kirpan on her hip .
The deputy aimed his Taser at her and called for backup , Tagore has said .
Other deputies arrived and began cursing and handcuffing family members , including Tagore and her 60 - year - old mother , relatives have said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
One in five U.S. homeowners with mortgages owe more to their lenders than their properties are worth , and the rate will increase as housing values drop in states that have so far avoided the worst of the crisis , a new study shows .

One in five U.S. homeowners with mortgages owe more to their lenders than their homes are worth , and the rate will increase as housing prices drop in states that have so far avoided the worst of the crisis , a new study shows .
REUTERS / Lucy Nicholson
About 8.31 million properties had negative equity at the end of 2008 , up 9 percent from 7.63 million at the end of September , according to the study , released Wednesday by First American CoreLogic .
The percentage of “ underwater ” borrowers rose to 20 percent from 18 percent .
Another 2.16 million properties could go underwater if home prices fall another 5 percent , the study shows .
First American said the value of residential properties fell to $ 19.1 trillion at year - end from $ 21.5 trillion a year earlier , with half the decline in California .
Forty - three U.S. states and Washington , D.C. , were included in the study .
While states such as California , Florida and Nevada were particularly stressed , the study showed worrying signs of deterioration in relatively healthy parts of the nation .
“ The economic slowdown is broadening , ” said Sherrill Shaffer , a banking professor at the University of Wyoming at Laramie and a former Federal Reserve official .
“ As more people lose jobs , it will be more difficult to sustain the levels of pricing and home ownership , and that is a big factor driving down housing prices in more parts of the country . ”
Arizona , California , Florida , Georgia , Michigan , Nevada and Ohio remained the most stressed states , with 62 percent of underwater borrowers and just 41 percent of mortgages .
Other areas , though , also face more stress .
Connecticut , for example , saw a 25 percent increase in homes with negative equity , while Washington , D.C. , had a 44 percent increase .
“ Even I continue to be surprised at the tentacles of this financial and economic debacle , ” said Robert MacIntosh , chief economist at Eaton Vance Management in Boston .
“ More people are being laid off , resulting in reduced income and therefore less consumption .
That leaves fewer people with money to buy homes , and the mentality is that people believe they should wait six months rather than buy now .
Less demand means falling prices . ”
Roughly 68 percent of U.S. adults own their own homes , and about two - thirds of these have mortgages .
Many economists expect the nation ’s unemployment rate to rise above 9 percent before the recession ends , up from January ’s 7.6 percent .
CALIFORNIA , NEVADA UNDER STRESS
California had 1.9 million borrowers with negative equity at year - end , more than any other state , followed by Florida ’s 1.28 million .
About three in 10 borrowers in both states were underwater .
By other measures , Nevada was the most stressed , with 55 percent of owners having negative equity and borrowers on average owing 97 percent of what their homes are worth .
About 28 percent owe more than 125 percent of their homes ’ value .
Michigan had 40 percent of its homeowners underwater , while Arizona had 32 percent .
New York fared best , with just 4.7 percent of borrowers with negative equity and an average 48 percent loan - to - value ratio , though this could change as employment and bonuses slide in the financial services industry .
According to the S&P / Case - Shiller Home Price Indices , prices of U.S. single - family homes slumped 18.5 percent in December from a year earlier , the biggest drop in the 21 - year history of the data .
Many lenders are taking steps to keep borrowers out of foreclosure .
The Obama administration has backed legislation that could broaden powers of bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages for troubled borrowers .
Among major lenders , only Citigroup Inc has supported such a plan .
MacIntosh expects housing prices to keep falling until “ well into ” 2010 .
“ There is no magic bullet or magic arrow here , ” he said .
“ It is a question of trying to come up with ideas and seeing what happens .
It could take a long time . ”

Parents can select hair and eye colour A US clinic has sparked controversy by offering would - be parents the chance to select traits like the eye and hair colour of their offspring .
The LA Fertility Institutes run by Dr Jeff Steinberg , a pioneer of IVF in the 1970s , expects a trait - selected baby to be born next year .
His clinic also offers sex selection .
UK fertility experts are angered that the service will distract attention from how the same technology can protect against inherited disease .
The science is based on a lab technique called preimplantation genetic diagnosis , or PGD .
I would not say this is a dangerous road .
It 's an uncharted road
Dr Steinberg
This involves testing a cell taken from a very early embryo before it is put into the mother 's womb .
Doctors then select an embryo free from rogue genes - or in this case an embryo with the desired physical traits such as blonde hair and blue eyes - to continue the pregnancy , and discard any others .
Dr Steinberg said couples might seek to use the clinic 's services for both medical and cosmetic reasons .
For example , a couple might want to have a baby with a darker complexion to help guard against a skin cancer if they already had a child who had developed a melanoma .
But others might just want a boy with blonde hair .
His clinic is offering this cosmetic selection to patients already having genetic screening for abnormal chromosome conditions in their embryos .
This is the inevitable slippery slope of a fertility process which results in many more embryos being created than can be implanted
Josephine Quintavalle of Comment on Reproductive Ethics " Not all patients will qualify for these tests and we make NO guarantees as to ' perfect prediction ' of things such as eye colour or hair colour , " says the clinic 's website .
Dr Steinberg said : " I would not say this is a dangerous road .
It 's an uncharted road . "
He said the capability to offer such services had been around for years , but had been ignored by the medical community .
" It 's time for everyone to pull their heads out of the sand . "
Slippery slope But Dr Gillian Lockwood , a UK fertility expert and member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ' ethics committee , questioned whether is was morally right to be using the science in this way .
" If it gets to the point where we can decide which gene or combination of genes are responsible for blue eyes or blonde hair , what are you going to do with all those other embryos that turn out like me to be ginger with green eyes ? "
She warned against " turning babies into commodities that you buy off the shelf . "
Josephine Quintavalle of Comment on Reproductive Ethics said : " This is the inevitable slippery slope of a fertility process which results in many more embryos being created than can be implanted .
Choices will always have to be made .
Do you choose octuplets or the ones with the prettiest noses ? "
In the UK , sex selection is banned and choices are currently permitted only in relationship to the baby 's health .
Italian fertility law does not permit the creation of surplus embryos or selective testing .
Ms Quintavalle said that was " one sure way to avoid the slippery slope " .
Meanwhile , new legislation in the UK , due to come in on 6 April , will allow IVF mothers to name anyone as " father " on the birth certificate - even another woman .
The only restriction on naming a second parent will be if they are close blood relatives or if the second person does not agree .

A cream puff interview turned up in one of the least expected places Sunday , on 60 Minutes .
Correspondent Scott Pelley kicked off an Interview With Bernanke with the question " Mr. Chairman , I 'm gonna start with a question that everyone wants me to ask : when does this end ? "
Bernanke answered " It depends a lot on the financial system , " he replied .
" The lesson of history is that you do not get a sustained economic recovery as long as the financial system is in crisis .
We 've seen some progress in the financial markets , absolutely .
But until we get that stabilized and working normally , we 're not gonna see recovery .
But we do have a plan .
We 're working on it .
And I do think that we will get it stabilized , and we 'll see the recession coming to an end probably this year .
We 'll see recovery beginning next year .
And it will pick up steam over time . "
There was no followup by Scott Pelley .
I would have hoped for something like " OK If you have a plan what exactly is it , and why does it seem to be changing day by day by the seat of your pants ? "
Sadly , Pelly did not challenge Bernanke on a single question .
Instead Pelly just listened to Bernanke , accepting the fact as gospel that Bernanke knows what he is doing .
Well if Bernanke knows what he is doing why are we in this mess ?
Why did n't Bernanke see this coming ?
How about some clips of statements Bernanke made about housing bottoming and no recession coming .
Why no questions on the Fed 's role in this mess ?
How about Bernanke 's opinion on the role of Congress ?
Watching the interview I get the feeling Bernanke wrote the questions and submitted them to 60 Minutes and said , I am prepared to answer these .
Certainly Bernanke got his self - serving answer in to the question " What are the dangers now ?
What keeps you up at night ? "
Bernanke 's reply was " I think the biggest risk is that , you know , we do n't have the political will .
We do n't have the commitment to solve this problem , and that we let it just continue .
In which case , you know , we can't count on recovery . "
The biggest risk in my opinion is we keep listening to Ben Bernanke , self - proclaimed expert on the great depression .
Yes policy mistakes were made in the great depression , the biggest of which is arguably the Smoot Hawley Tariff which caused a collapse in trade .
Blatantly illegal actions were undertaken as well , such as the confiscation of gold and the burning of produce attempting to force prices up .
However , the root cause of the great depression was without a doubt the reckless expansion of credit that preceded it .
Ron Paul or Jon Stewart would have done a far better job on this interview .
Then again , so would have my dead grandmother .
Scott Pelley simply blew it .

Advertisement French President Nicolas Sarkozy has announced his country is to return to Nato 's military command , reversing four decades of self - imposed exile .
Mr Sarkozy confirmed the decision in a speech to defence experts at the Ecole Militaire staff college in Paris .
President Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of Nato 's integrated military command in 1966 , saying it undermined France 's sovereignty .
Critics say France will now be no more than " a clone of Great Britain " .
But Mr Sarkozy said there was no sense in France - a founder member of Nato - having no say in the organisation 's decisions on military strategy .
" This rapprochement with Nato ensures our national independence , " said Mr Sarkozy .
" To distance ourselves would limit our independence and our room for manoeuvre .
France has 3,000 troops in Afghanistan
He went on : " We have to be progressive .
A solitary nation is a nation that has no influence whatsoever .
" We need strong diplomacy , a strong defence and a strong Europe . "
He said Nato remained a central element of France 's security and defence policies , but stressed that he would not give up the country 's independent nuclear deterrent .
Mr Sarkozy is expected to formalise the move with a letter to Nato before the alliance celebrates its 60th anniversary next month with a summit in the French city of Strasbourg .
Military action Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer warmly welcomed Mr Sarkozy 's announcement .
" [ France 's ] full participation in all the civil and military decision - making and planning processes cannot but strengthen the alliance further , " he said .
Correspondents say France 's " independence " from Nato is dearly treasured by many French , and Mr Sarkozy 's move has provoked a furore among those who worry it will now have to bow to US dominance .
If tomorrow , we integrated into Nato , would we , could we , maintain the position that we have done on Iraq ?

Q&A : France and Nato French split over rejoining Nato 2007 : France edges closer to Nato
The great fear , says the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby in Paris , is that France will now be at the beck and call of the US , and may well be dragged into conflicts in which it did not want to be involved .
" Nothing today justifies returning to Nato military command , " said the leader of the opposition Socialists , Martine Aubry .
" There 's no hurry , no fundamental need , except for this Atlanticism that 's becoming an ideology . "
But Defence Minister Herve Morin rejected claims
France would now be forced to go along with the US on issues like the war with Iraq , which it vehemently opposed .
Germany , he noted , has remained fully integrated in Nato yet opposed the war .
Renewing France 's relations with Nato " will benefit the alliance , benefit Europe and benefit France " , Mr Morin said .
" It will be done without calling into question the independence of France . "
Indeed , it would allow France to take a greater role in shaping military strategy , he argued .
Javier Solana , the European Union 's foreign policy chief , said France 's re-entry into NATO would benefit security in Europe .
" I think it 's very important that France returns to the alliance completely , " he said .
We are delighted that after a 43 - year absence , France is back where it belongs
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell
" I think for those who believe , as myself , that there is a need of having a capacity , a military capacity , within the European Union , it 's a very important decision that France is going to take . "
The US also reacted positively to Mr Sarkozy 's announcement .
" We are delighted that after a 43 - year absence , France is back where it belongs , in the command structure of the alliance it helped found , " said Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell .
" Although their troops have been bravely fighting alongside ours in Afghanistan , it is welcome news to have them fully re-integrated in all Nato military matters . "
While in 1966 France withdrew from Nato 's decision - making core , its nuclear weapons structure and planning committee , it never left the alliance itself .
Indeed , it has been one of the most active members , supplying troops under allied command in Bosnia , Kosovo and in Afghanistan , where it has suffered significant losses .
Analysts say France has actually been gradually moving closer to the heart of Nato since the end of the Cold War .

The world ’s deadliest malaria parasite , Plasmodium falciparum , sneaks past the human immune system with the help of a wardrobe of invisibility cloaks .
If a person ’s immune cells learn to recognize one of the parasite ’s many camouflage proteins , the surviving invaders can swap disguises and slip away again to cause more damage .
Malaria kills an estimated 2.7 million people annually worldwide , 75 percent of them children in Africa .
Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) international research scholars in Australia have determined how P. falciparum can turn on one cloaking gene and keep dozens of others silent until each is needed in turn .
Their findings , published in the December 28 , 2005 , issue of Nature , reveal the mechanism of action of the genetic machinery thought to be the key to the parasite ’s survival .
A DNA sequence near the start of a cloaking gene , known as the gene ’s promoter , not only turns up production of its protein , but also keeps all other cloaking genes under wraps , according to Alan Cowman and Brendan Crabb , HHMI international research scholars at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne , Australia , and their co-authors .
“ The promoter is all you need for activation and silencing , ” Cowman said .
“ It ’s the main site of action where everything is happening . ”
Malaria parasites enter human blood from infected mosquitoes .
The organisms invade and promptly remodel red blood cells .
They decorate the surface of the cells they occupy with a protein called PfEMP1 , made by the var gene family .
Using this versatile surface protein , the parasite evades the host ’s immune system using two basic strategies .
First , the protein sticks infected red blood cells to the blood vessel lining , removing the infected cells from circulation , where they would probably be destroyed .
But the protein cannot protect the parasite from patrolling immune cells , which eventually detect the invader and recruit troops to fight it .
So , during a malaria infection , a small percentage of each generation of parasites switches to a different version of PfEMP1 that the body has never seen before .
In its new disguise , P. falciparum can invade more red blood cells and cause another wave of fever , headaches , nausea , and chills .
“ It ’s like a leopard being able to change its spots , ” Cowman said .
“ New forms come up , and the immune system beats them down again .
Because of this a lot of people think you need five years of constant exposure to malaria in its different disguises to gain immunity . ”
Many children do not survive malaria long enough to develop immunity .
And without continuous exposure , hard - won immunity may disappear .
For example , adults in Papua New Guinea who move to work in the mining industry , which is in mountainous regions that are mosquito - free , lose their immunity within a short time , he said .
The diverse genetic sequences of the 60 var cloaking genes all code for remarkably similar protein structures , the malaria researcher added .
The genes are generally found at the ends of P. falciparum ’s 14 chromosomes , although some of them cluster in internal regions .
In April 2005 , Cowman , Crabb , and colleagues showed that var genes are regulated by the chromosome packaging , which unwraps one gene to be expressed at a time and literally packs away the inactive genes .
In chromosomes , DNA can be encased so securely by some proteins that other proteins cannot access the nucleic acid for transcription , a process known as epigenetic silencing .
In their new paper , the researchers show that the activation of a var gene promoter is all it takes to trigger both the production that gene ’s protein and the epigenetic silencing of the 59 other var genes .
As in a previous study , they found that the physical location of the promoter within the nucleus seems to make a difference .
The genetic activity occurred at the edge of the nucleus , with the activated promoter surrounded by chromosome ends containing silenced var genes .
To do this research , the scientists had to master the difficult technique of cloning large DNA sequences with a var promoter attached to various genes , inserting them into plasmid vectors , and introducing them into red blood cells infected by malaria parasites .
In one experiment , they set up a system where var gene expression could be studied using drug selection rather than the immune pressure that is normally needed to select variants in the field .
Using this system they found that the information required for switching var genes on and off was contained within a promoter and that when active this could silence all of the var genes in the parasite .
“ This is the first time anyone has actually been able to infiltrate an antigenic variation program , ” Cowman said .
“ We forced the cell to switch our gene on and others off . ”
Their system can be used to study blood samples from people in the field to determine how they gain immunity over time .
Kirk Deitsch ’s lab at Cornell University found that a piece of shared DNA – discarded in the process of translating the protein from its genetic instructions –was a key regulator of var gene silencing and activation .
The HHMI researchers confirmed that this gene segment caused tighter packaging for the silenced genes , but they also showed that it was n’t vital .
The researchers are continuing to disassemble the var gene machinery , piece by piece .
They want to identify the proteins that unpack and activate the promoter region and learn more about the other proteins in the nuclear compartment that make it the prime spot for var gene activation .
Eventually , they think their work may lead to new types of therapies that interfere with the parasite ’s immune evasion strategies .
