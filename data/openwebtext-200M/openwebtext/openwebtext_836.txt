For more than a century , the idea of a world government has persisted .
From Cecil Rhodes ' vision of a global British Empire , to Woodrow Wilson 's vision of a League of Nations , to Franklin Roosevelt 's creation of the United Nations , this dream of a world government has advanced .
In Berlin , Barack Obama announced that he is a " citizen of the world . "
He and his administration are about to pay homage to that global citizenship .
The people who created the League of Nations for Woodrow Wilson were behind - the - scenes advisers .
In the United States , Wilson 's advisers were known as Edward Mandell House 's " Inquiry . "
In England , the government was advised by Alfred Milner 's group called the " Chatham House Gang , " created by Cecil Rhodes in 1891 .
These two groups drafted the Treaty of Versailles , which ended the First World War and created the League of Nations .
During the final days of treaty negotiations , these two groups met at the Majestic Hotel in Paris and decided to formalize their organizations .
The European group became the Royal Institute of International Affairs , and House 's group became the Council on Foreign Relations .
These two groups have been the sustaining power behind the idea of world government throughout the 20th century .
Franklin Roosevelt served in Wilson 's administration and knew well Mandell House 's Inquiry and the Council on Foreign Relations .
Roosevelt 's administration was filled with members of the CFR .
In fact , Roosevelt 's " New Deal " was a product of the CFR .
Roosevelt 's son - in - law wrote :
TRENDING : Alleged attacker behind carnage at pro-Trump event linked to ' Caravan 4 Justice ' group
For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country , the USA .
But he did n't .
Most of his thoughts , his political ammunition , as it were , was carefully manufactured for him in advance by the CFR - One World Money Group .
( Curtis Dall , " FDR : My exploited Father - in - law , " 1967 )
The majority of Roosevelt 's committee that drafted the United Nations Charter were members of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Every administration since Roosevelt 's has been dominated by members of the CFR .
During Bill Clinton 's administration , Washington Post writer Richard Harwood reported that the Council on Foreign Relations is " … the closest thing we have to a ruling Establishment in the United States , " and went on to identify dozens of CFR members in the White House .
( Washington Post , Oct. 30 , 1993 , p. A - 21 )
CFR members dominated both of the Bush administrations .
Richard Haass served in both .
Until June 2003 , he was director of planning at the State Department .
He resigned to become the president of the Council on Foreign Relations in July 2003 .
Haass continues to push the idea of world government .
In an article for the Taipei Times , Haass said : " … states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function . "
( Feb. 21 , 2006 )
Here is the crux of the matter : National sovereignty and global governance are mutually exclusive .
Both can not exist at the same time .
A nation is either sovereign , or it is not .
The League of Nations failed because the United States was unwilling to cede its sovereignty to an international system .
The United Nations has not failed because nations , including the United States , continue to cede sovereignty , as Haass says , to " world bodies . "
The Council on Foreign Relations , and much of official Europe , are convinced that the only way the world can survive is through some form of global governance .
They contend that : " Governance is not government – it is the framework of rules , institutions and practices that set limits on the behavior of individuals , organizations and companies . "
( U.N. Human Development Report , 1999 , page 34 ) Any authority that can " … limit … the behavior of individuals , organizations and companies " – is a government .
For such a system of " governance " to work there must be a procedure for making laws and rules , an independent revenue stream and a mechanism for enforcement .
The rule - making procedure is well - established .
The International Criminal Court provides the basis for enforcement .
But the absence , so far , of an independent revenue stream has prevented the United Nations from becoming the world government so many have envisioned for so long .
The current economic crisis is the excuse needed to create a global mechanism to control the global economy and siphon off an independent revenue stream for the world government .
The United Nations first adopted a " New International Economic Order " in 1974 ( A / RES/S-6/3201 ) .
It called for a global socialist economic system under the auspices of the United Nations .
Fortunately , the United States ignored the idea and it faded away , but it did not die .
In 1995 , The U.N. - funded Commission on Global Governance released its final report called , " Our Global Neighborhood . "
Among the many recommendations made to effect global governance was a call to create a new Economic Security Council .
Its jurisdiction would include :
… long - term threats to security in its widest sense , such as shared ecological crises , economic instability , rising unemployment ... mass poverty ... and the promotion of sustainable development .
The U.S. representative on the Commission on Global Governance was Adele Simmons , a member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Before he left office , President Bush called a meeting of the G20 to set the agenda for an April meeting in London .
They hope to create a global system to finally control the global economy .
Whatever the structure that comes out of the meeting , it will likely be empowered to control the global economy and to connect economic actions with ecological and social justice issues as well – just as prescribed by the Commission on Global Governance .
The creation of the World Trade Organization went a long way toward giving a " world body " power to regulate trade .
The United States ceded significant sovereignty when it agreed to conform its rules and laws to the dictates of this U.N. agency .
The World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of International Settlements are not yet run by the consensus of boards arbitrarily appointed by the U.N .
And so far , the U.N. has not been able to find a way to siphon off a revenue stream from international currency exchange .
But this could change beginning with the April 2 meeting in London .
Already , European leaders are making noises about tighter international control over the global economy .
Among the ideas advanced in the past are things such as U.N. licensing and even tighter regulation of international trade ; U.N. representation in the boardrooms of international corporations ; and international taxation for the privilege of doing business globally .
Whoever controls the flow of money controls the activity of those who have money , as well as those who want it .
For example , whatever international economic structure may arise can insist that a nation adopt U.N. - prescribed global warming goals as a condition for participating in economic flows .
This new international economic structure could dictate tax rates , interest rates and credit terms .
This proposed international economic structure could sap the last vestige of sovereignty from the United States .
Aside from Ron Paul and Glenn Beck on the Fox News Channel , there is very little concern being expressed by the media or by politicians .
Global governance is at the world 's doorstep .
Gustav Speth , who served on Bill Clinton 's transition team before being appointed to head the U.N. Development program told a 1997 global conference :
" Global governance is here , here to stay , and , driven by economic and environmental globalization , global governance will inevitably expand . "
Strobe Talbott , Bill Clinton 's deputy secretary of state , said in Time magazine :
" … within the next hundred years … nationhood as we know it will be obsolete ; all states will recognize a single , global authority . "
Both Speth and Talbott are members of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Timothy Geithner , secretary of the treasury , and Lawrence Summers , the president 's chief economic adviser , will represent the United States at the G20 meeting in April .
Both are members of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Hillary Clinton , secretary of state , publicly endorsed world government when she praised Walter Cronkite for his work that earned him the World Federalist Association 's " Global Governance " award .
Throughout the Clinton years , and the Bush years , members of the Council on Foreign Relations have pushed to advance global governance .
Opposition in the House and Senate , and sometimes , an obstinate President Bush , blocked U.S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol , the International Criminal Court , the Convention on the Law of the Sea , the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the imposition of a U.N. tax on international currency exchange .
Today , opposition to global governance has diminished in Congress and has vanished from the White House .
With eyes wide open , the United States is welcoming global governance .
This administration , with approval of the majority of Congress , will cede our sovereignty to an international system that is beyond accountability and devoid of morality .
The U.N. is eager to fund its nefarious adventures with money placed under its care by those who bought the promise of hope and blindly voted for change .
Once the U.N. has an independent revenue stream to fund its " peacekeeping " forces , which can enforce treaties and the decrees of the International Criminal Court , there will be no force on earth with the power to overthrow it .
When the United States realizes the true cost global governance , it will be much too late .
The U.N. will control the flow of both money and energy available to the U.S .
Obama and the current congressional majority will be long gone , leaving the next generation to curse their parent 's stupidity – and only wonder what freedom was .

Culture of Honor : The Psychology of Violence in the South Culture of Honor shows that the U.S. South is more violent than the North .
The greater violence is limited to situations where there has been an insult or a threat to home or property .
Laboratory experiments show that southerners respond with more anger and greater increases in testosterone and cortisol levels when insulted than do northerners and surveys show they feel that violence is an appropriate response to insult or threat to property .
Field experiments show that southerners are more accepting of other people who have killed to protect their honor than are northerners .
This pattern of sensitivity to insults and threat is found in cultures throughout the world and is particularly common where there is a tradition of earning a living by keeping herds of animals .
When this is the case , the individual risks the possibility of losing all his wealth by theft .
A stance of toughness and unwillingness to brook any threat or insult is an effective way of making it clear that it would be unwise to steal from him .
The U.S. South was founded mostly by herding peoples from Scotland and Ireland and the U.S. North was founded mostly by farming peoples from England , Holland and Germany .

The Geography of Thought : Why We Think the Way We Do The Geography of Thought shows that East Asia and the West have had different systems of thought , including perception , assumptions about the nature of the world , and thinking processes , for thousands of years .
Ancient Greek philosophers were " analytic " — objects and people are separated from their environment , categorized , and reasoned about using logical rules .
Psychological experiments show the same is true of ordinary Westerners today .
Ancient Chinese philosophers and ordinary East Asians today share a " holistic " orientation — perceiving and thinking about objects in relation to their environments and reasoning dialectically , trying to find the Middle Way between opposing propositions .
Differences in thought stem from differences in social practices , with the West being individualistic and the East collectivistic .

A Chilean man with a broken leg was arrested at Barcelona airport after his " cast " was found to be made of cocaine not plaster , Spanish police say .
The 66 - year - old carried six cans of beer and two hollowed - out stools that also contained cocaine , they add .
The police statement said officers were investigating whether the injuries were inflicted intentionally " to facilitate trafficking through security checks " .
Spain is a key entry point into Europe for cocaine from South America .
The country is one of the highest consumers of cocaine in Europe , studies have found .
Airport officials pay close attention to flights arriving from South America .
Operation
Spanish police said the Chilean had travelled from Santiago to Barcelona with a " plaster cast ... entirely made from cocaine " .
Police suspect the leg was deliberately broken to aid the smuggling
It was discovered after police sprayed the cast with a chemical that turns bright blue when it comes into contact with cocaine , police spokesman Jose Antonio Nin told the Associated Press .
Along with the cocaine in the cans and the small stools , he was carrying a total of 4.85 kgs ( 10.7 pounds ) of the drug .
X -rays had shown the man was suffering from an " open fracture of the tibia and the fibula , and has been transferred to a clinic for an operation " , the police statement said .
" Investigators are examining the possibility that these injuries were brought about voluntarily ... to facilitate trafficking through security checks " .
AIG Warned of ' Crisis ' if Government Didn't Help Draft obtained by ABC News warned of worldwide crisis if no bailout .
March 9 , 2009  --
An AIG report to the Treasury Department last month warned that if the government did n't come to its rescue again , its collapse would trigger a " chain reaction of enormous proportion " that would " potentially bankrupt or bring down the entire system " and make it impossible for AIG to repay the billions it already owed the U.S. government .
Four days later , AIG was given $ 30 billion in federal aid on top of the $ 130 billion it had already received .
Read the AIG Report to the Treasury Department here .
A draft of the report , obtained by ABC News , was marked " strictly confidential . "
It said , " The failure of AIG would cause turmoil in the U.S. economy and global markets and have multiple and potentially catastrophic unforeseen consequences . "
The draft was dated Feb. 26 .
On March 2 , the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve system announced that AIG , which lost $ 61.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 , would receive $ 30 billion in new government help .
AIG warns in its report of the " systemic risk " that a potential collapse posed .
It describes a " systemic risk " as one that " could potentially bankrupt or bring down the entire system or market . "
The company said , " What happens to AIG has the potential to trigger a cascading set of further failures , which cannot be stopped except by extraordinary means . "
" The inability of AIG to immediately secure additional assistance from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury threatens not only AIG 's sales process , but also consumer and business confidence around the world , " it said .
The report referred to the unexpected downward economic spiral after the Fed allowed Lehman Brothers , the giant investment bank , to collapse last fall .
AIG said the damage to credit market would " dwarf the Lehman fallout . "
The Treasury Department told ABC News it would have no comment on the report , and the White House referred questions to the Treasury Department .
Late today , AIG released a more recent version of the draft , dated March 6 .
The language in it was substantially the same as in the copy obtained earlier by ABC News .
The company points out in the report that it operates in 140 countries and is the largest insurer in the Mideast , Southeast Asia , Hong Kong , the Philippines , Thailand and Japan .
It argues that its failure would create a " crisis of confidence " worldwide .
Fed Feared AIG 's Ripple Effect
The struggling insurance behemoth also describes itself as the largest retirement - services provider for the American education and health - care systems in the United States .
AIG warned the Treasury Department that it was even more crucial for it to be rescued in February than it was late last year when the Bush administration came to its aid with tens of billions of dollars .
" Permitting AIG to fail would be even more serious today than in September , especially in view of the support of the U.S. government , " the report said .
" Public confidence in financial institutions is at a nadir and it is questionable whether the economy could tolerate another shock to the system that a failure of AIG would produce . "
The company warns , in its presentation , that the effects of a failure would spread far beyond its core insurance business .
It says the value of the U.S. dollar would suffer on international markets ; that bond markets would be placed under additional stress ; that money - market funds might be forced to reduce their returns to investors ; and that Boeing , the nation 's largest maker of airliners , might be forced to make new layoffs if AIG 's plane - leasing operation closed down
Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff told ABC
News that the federal government will have to " continue propping up AIG until they 've got a plan for the financial sector because for a lot of the big financial institutions , if AIG goes under they 're going to lose a lot of money . "
" They have trades with AIG where they 're just going to lose their shirt and then the financial institutions are going to come to Washington , " Rogoff said .
" We need a complete plan . "
Not everyone was convinced .
" Whenever you hear the phrase ' systemic risk , ' it 's shorthand for ' we 're really in trouble and need money , ' " said Barry Ritholtz , director for Equity Research for Fusion IQ and author of " Bailout Nation . "
" I 'm very skeptical of what 's called systemic risk . "
Ritholtz acknowledged that it 's extremely difficult to determine what " potentially " could happen , but said it " certainly smells like scare tactics . "
" If it just takes scare tactics to squeeze a billion dollars out of you , they 'll use scare tactics , " he said .
The report , sources say , was submitted to federal regulators .
A source who asked not to be identified said he believed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner saw the report before the AIG bailout , but the Treasury Department could not confirm that .
Geithner said he was concerned about ripple effects from an AIG failure when he testified to Congress on March 4 .
" Millions of Americans here and around the world depend on AIG for insurance policies and a range of different types of savings products , " he continued .
" So the judgment your government made in that context was , and I think it was the right judgment , that the effect on confidence would have been very dramatic , I think more dramatic than even in the case with the failure of a major investment bank . "
" It would be much better for us and for you if we had another alternative to this path that would contain the damage to the economy as a whole , but that alternative does not exist , " Geithner concluded .
In the previous post I covered the motivation and basics of rvalue - references , one of the language additions in the next C++ standard .
Today I will examine the changes that rvalue - references will bring to the way we write C++ code .
We will start with the following example :
typedef string Word ; typedef vector < Word >
Words ; typedef map < Word , Words > SynonymMap ; Words words = ... SynonymMap map ; for ( Words::const_iterator i = words.begin ( ) ; i != words.end ( ) ; ++i) { Words& syn = map [ * i ] ; //
Load synonyms into syn . }
Seeing that the code that loads all the synonyms for a particular word is quite long , we would like to move it into a separate function .
The straightforward change would look like this :
Words load ( const Word& w ) { Words r ; //
Load synonyms into r. return r ; } Words words = ... SynonymMap map ; for ( Words::const_iterator i = words.begin ( ) ; i != words.end ( ) ; ++i ) { map [ * i ] = load ( * i ) ; }
With the current state of C++ this code has a potential efficiency problem .
As was discussed in the previous post , depending on the complexity of the load ( ) function and C++ compiler used , the addition of the function call can result in the synonym list being copied twice .
The first time in the load ( ) function from r into a temporary and the second time from the temporary into the object stored in the map .
There are two common ways in which this inefficiency is addressed right now .
The first involves passing a reference to the result object instead of returning it by value :
void load ( const Word& w , Words& r ) { //
Load synonyms into r. } Words words = ... SynonymMap map ; for ( Words::const_iterator i = words.begin ( ) ; i != words.end ( ) ; ++i ) { load ( * i , map [ * i ] ) ; }
This approach has a number of drawbacks .
For one , the code is unnatural .
We would n’t have written it like this if we were n’t optimizing .
More importantly , this approach is limited to cases where the type has the default constructor or we have enough information to create an empty instance before passing it to the load ( ) function .
Consider , for example , the following simple change to the above code :
typedef string Word ; typedef vector < Word >
Words ; class Synonyms : Words { public : Synonyms ( const string& source ) ; ... } ; typedef map < Word , Synonyms > SynonymMap ;
Now only the load ( ) function knows how to construct the Synonyms object .
Both the return by value and pass by reference approaches have another drawback that may not be apparent at first .
As we insert new entries , the synonym map may need to grow the underlying storage from time to time .
When this happens , all the existing Words object are copied from the old storage to the new one .
The second way to deal with the inefficiency of returning the Words object by value is to allocate it on the heap and return a pointer instead :
typedef string Word ; typedef vector < Word >
Words ; typedef map < Word , shared_ptr < Words > > SynonymMap ; shared_ptr < Words > load ( const Word& w ) { shared_ptr < Words > r = new Words ; //
Load synonyms into r. return r ; } Words words = ... SynonymMap map ; for ( Words::const_iterator i = words.begin ( ) ; i != words.end ( ) ; ++i ) { map [ * i ] = load ( * i ) ; }
This approach forced us to change the way we store the synonym list in the map .
It also requires an extra heap allocation for each Words object .
As we can see , with the current state of C++ there is no perfect solution to the problem of returning complex objects .
If we return the object by value , we pay with two copies per call plus copying during the map growth .
The pass by reference approach cannot always be used and also suffers from the map growth overhead .
Finally , the return by pointer method gets rid of the function return and map growth overheads but has the penalty of allocating each Words object on the heap .
Normally , the return by pointer approach is chosen as the least inefficient .
With the introduction of rvalue - references this situation changes dramatically .
Provided the types we use are rvalue - optimized by including a constructor and an assignment operator for rvalue - references ( std:: vector and std : : map are ) , the return by value approach becomes the most efficient .
The deep copies during the function return are eliminated and when the map grows , the rvalue constructor is used to “ move ” the existing objects to the new storage .
Another advantage of the return by value approach is that it allows the user to choose where to place the object , on the stack or on the heap .
The stack rvalue can be cheaply moved to the heap using the rvalue constructor :
Words load ( const Word& w ) { Words r ; //
Load synonyms into r. return r ; } shared_ptr < Words > syn ( load ( " value " ) ) ;
One , however , needs to understand how rvalue - references work to be able to write efficient code using return by value and rvalue - optimized types .
Otherwise it is fairly easy to shoot oneself in the foot , as shown in the following example :
Words load ( const Word& w ) { Words r ; //
Load synonyms into r. return r ; } Words words = ... SynonymMap map ; for ( Words::const_iterator i = words.begin ( ) ; i != words.end ( ) ; ++i) {
Words syn ( load ( * i ) ) ; map [ * i ] = syn ; }
Here we introduced a variable that temporarily holds the result of the load ( ) function .
With it we also introduced an unnecessary copy since now the non-rvalue assignment operator has to be used .
It does not mean , however , that we cannot do something with the list of synonyms before we insert it into the map .
We just need to use std ::move( ) to “ move ” the object instead of copying it .
for ( Words::const_iterator i = words.begin ( ) ; i != words.end ( ) ; ++i) {
Words syn ( load ( * i ) ) ; if ( syn.size ( ) > 0 ) map [ * i ] = std::move ( syn ) ; }
I suspect that as with many other parts of C++ , people who make the effort to understand rvalue - references will write even more elegant and efficient code while those who do n’t will continue complaining that C++ is too difficult .
While it may seem that the only two places where rvalue - references will be used are constructors and assignment operators , on a more conceptual level , rvalue - references provide a mechanism to distinguish between objects whose state needs to be copied and objects whose state can be reused ( with rvalue objects automatically treated as the latter ) .
As such , rvalue - references can be used in other places where such a distinction can be helpful .
For example , std::vector defines an overloaded version of the push_back ( ) function that takes an rvalue - reference :
template < typename T , ...> class vector { public : void push_back ( const T& ) ; // copy void push_back ( T&& ) ; // reuse ... } ;
To summarize , the introduction of rvalue - references in C++ solves the problem of efficiently returning complex objects by value .
They will allow writing simpler , faster , and more natural code .
I also believe that , at least in well - designed programs , the use of heap - allocated objects will decrease which should make these programs even more efficient .
Yaron Michaeli , spokesman for the Israel Tennis Association , said : " It 's too bad that this is the situation and that is what they have decided .
But we can not tell them how to behave .
But we will go and we will win and come back . "
But Netanyahu also said that Iran threatens many other countries apart from Israel , and so his mission over the next several months is to convince the world of the broad danger posed by Iran .
One of his chief security advisers , Moshe Ya’alon , told me that a nuclear Iran could mean the end of American influence in the Middle East .
“ This is an existential threat for Israel , but it will be a blow for American interests , especially on the energy front .
Who will dominate the oil in the region — Washington or Tehran ? ”
Netanyahu said he would support President Obama ’s decision to engage Iran , so long as negotiations brought about a quick end to Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
“ How you achieve this goal is less important than achieving it , ” he said , but he added that he was skeptical that Iran would respond positively to Obama ’s appeals .
In an hour - long conversation , held in the Knesset , Netanyahu tempered his aggressive rhetoric with an acknowledgement that nonmilitary pressure could yet work .
“ I think the Iranian economy is very weak , which makes Iran susceptible to sanctions that can be ratcheted up by a variety of means . ”
When I suggested that this statement contradicted his assertion that Iran , by its fanatic nature , is immune to pressure , Netanyahu smiled thinly and said , “ Iran is a composite leadership , but in that composite leadership there are elements of wide - eyed fanaticism that do not exist right now in any other would - be nuclear power in the world .
That ’s what makes them so dangerous . ”
He went on , “ Since the dawn of the nuclear age , we have not had a fanatic regime that might put its zealotry above its self - interest .
People say that they ’ll behave like any other nuclear power .
Can you take the risk ?
Can you assume that ? ”
Netanyahu offered Iran ’s behavior during its eight - year war with Iraq as proof of Tehran ’s penchant for irrational behavior .
Iran “ wasted over a million lives without batting an eyelash …
It did n’t sear a terrible wound into the Iranian consciousness .
It was n’t Britain after World War I , lapsing into pacifism because of the great tragedy of a loss of a generation .
You see nothing of the kind . ”
He continued : “ You see a country that glorifies blood and death , including its own self - immolation . ”
I asked Netanyahu if he believed Iran would risk its own nuclear annihilation at the hands of Israel or America .
“ I ’m not going to get into that , ” he said .
Neither Netanyahu nor his principal military advisers would suggest a deadline for American progress on the Iran nuclear program , though one aide said pointedly that Israeli time lines are now drawn in months , “ not years . ”
These same military advisers told me that they believe Iran ’s defenses remain penetrable , and that Israel would not necessarily need American approval to launch an attack .
“ The problem is not military capability , the problem is whether you have the stomach , the political will , to take action , ” one of his advisers , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told me .
Tough times on Wall Street are reaching all the way to the highest levels of the most storied former investment bank — Goldman Sachs — as partners there are being forced to borrow money to cover margin calls , according to sources within the firm .
Several Goldman
Sachs partners have leveraged their Goldman Sachs stock to buy alternative investments such as hedge funds & private equity , and they have done so through their Goldman Sachs brokerage accounts .
But Goldman stock has declined in value by more than 50 percent since last spring , meaning that Goldman Sachs is in the awkward position of making margin calls on its own partners , who can't meet those calls because their alternative investments are underwater and they do n't have enough cash on hand .

IN December , philosopher and artificial intelligence expert Aaron Sloman announced his intention to create nothing less than a robot mathematician .
He reckons he has identified a key component of how humans develop mathematical talent .
If he ’s right , it should be possible to program a machine to be as good as us at mathematics , and possibly better .
This is no mad quest , insists Sloman , of the University of Birmingham in the UK .
“ Human brains do n’t work by magic , so whatever it is they do should be doable in suitably designed machines , ” he says .
 Human brains do n’t work by magic , so whatever it is they do should be doable by machine 
Sloman ’s creature is not meant to be a mathematical genius capable of advancing the frontiers of mathematical knowledge : his primary aim , outlined in the journal Artifical Intelligence ( vol 172 , p2015 ) , is to use such a machine to improve our understanding of where our mathematical ability comes from .
Nevertheless , it is possible that such a robot could take us beyond what mathematicians have achieved so far .
Forget robot vacuum cleaners and android waitresses ; we ’re talking about a machine that could spawn a race of cyber - nerds capable of creating entirely new forms of mathematics .
The field of artificial intelligence has promised much before , of course .
Early researchers thought it might open a fast - track to understanding consciousness , and there were claims that artificially intelligent computers and robots would change the world .
The truth has been more prosaic .
AI has done some clever things , such as …
Today , the Obama Administration released nine previously secret legal documents written by the Department of Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush Administration .
The release includes two previously undisclosed OLC memoranda and seven previously undisclosed OLC opinions .
According to the DOJ , " The two memoranda memorialized that certain legal propositions in ten OLC opinions issued between 2001 and 2003 no longer reflected the views of OLC and ' should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose . ' "
For example , the January 15 , 2009 memo withdraws reliance on several Bush Administration opinions , including the opinion that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to domestic military operations .
Here is the list of the OLC documents released today :

Australia : Labor government and unions seek to divert anger over Pacific Brands closures
Clothing workers speak to WSWS
By our correspondents
28 February 2009
In a bid to head off growing anger among Pacific Brands workers and throughout the working class over the clothing company 's destruction of 2,700 jobs , the Rudd government and the textile union held talks behind closed doors with the company in Melbourne yesterday .
No details were released of the negotiations , but they will almost certainly involve the union offering to make further cuts to workers ' conditions as the price for retaining a reduced number of Australian jobs .
Neither the government nor the unions has any concern about the jobs of the workers in China who are also facing retrenchment .
Industry Minister Kim Carr told journalists he was " seeking to determine whether it is possible for Pacific Brands to maintain manufacturing jobs and capacity in Australia " .
Both the company and the union had agreed to " come back to me with further information " .
Pacific Brands , an Australian - based transnational with operations in New Zealand , United Kingdom , Malaysia , China and Indonesia , announced on Wednesday that it was closing nearly all its factories , including one in China .
The company revealed a half - year loss of $ 149.95 million , after writing off of about $ 200 million in non-cash assets .
In a cost - cutting restructuring operation dictated by a syndicate of banks , the company will outsource all its garment making , which is already 70 percent performed by contractors .
Seven factories will be shut down in Australia — two in Melbourne , and one each in Sydney , Wollongong , Cessnock and Brisbane — with the loss of 1,200 jobs , on top of the 850 jobs destroyed in China , and another 650 office jobs internationally .
Workers outside the Bonds plant in Wentworthville
As soon as the news was announced , the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union ( TCFU ) national secretary Michele O'Neil appealed for " urgent discussions " with the company and the government about ways of preventing the " complete closure " of the Australian sites .
Her plea effectively ruled out any fight for a united campaign to defend all jobs , involving Pacific Brands workers in Australia and other countries , along with other sections of the working class facing jobs cuts and closures .
Like its counterparts in the car industry , and in aviation , the public service and elsewhere , the union is preparing to collaborate in an " orderly closure " , in exchange for the company maintaining a few employees in Australia on lower pay and conditions .
At factory gate meetings yesterday , Pacific Brands workers were given a brief list of demands drawn up by the union — all of which assume that jobs will be destroyed .
The items include a trust fund for all entitlements , the payment of early entitlements if workers find alternative employment , and access to government benefits and retraining programs immediately upon termination .
The final demand reads : " No terminations until all alternatives have been explored in full . "
Workers who gathered yesterday were given no information about what these " alternatives " might be , but the union has a 35 - year record of offering concessions on jobs , wages , working hours and other conditions .
Over that period , employment in the Australian clothing , textile and footwear industry has halved , from 104,800 to 42,800 , according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data .
Outrage over the job losses has been fuelled by revelations that executives at Pacific Brands scored pay rises of up to 170 percent last year , with the total remuneration for 13 directors more than doubling from just over $ 7 million to $ 15.5 million , despite a 45 percent fall in the share price in the six months leading up to the pay deals .
Former chief executive Paul Moore was paid $ 5.8 million when he retired in January last year , and collected a salary of $ 1.5 million — a 25 percent rise from the year before , despite leaving halfway through the financial year .
Current CEO
Sue Morphet , who took over from Moore last year , collected $ 1.86 million in 2007 - 08 .
By contrast , the company is estimating its redundancy costs at about $ 100 million , indicating an average payout of less than $ 55,000 for each worker .
Under its enterprise agreement with the TCFU , workers are entitled to only three weeks pay per year of service , with a 25 percent top - up for those over 45 years of age .
There was further anger when Industry Minister Carr admitted that the company , which has been handed about $ 17 million in government subsidies over the past two years , will be entitled to another $ 8 million or $ 9 million this financial year under the Textile , Clothing and Footwear Post - 2005 Strategic Investment Program Scheme .
The Transport Workers Union , Maritime Union of Australia and the Rail Tram and Bus Union announced yesterday that they would block any attempts to move company machinery to Bangladesh , although Pacific Brands denied it planned such a move .
Industrial Relations Minister Julia Gillard immediately intervened , warning that any such black - bans could constitute a secondary boycott in contravention of the Trade Practices Act , exposing unions to fines of up to $ 750,000 .
" While the government can understand the disappointment with Pacific Brands and shares the concerns for the retrenched employees , it does not condone unlawful behaviour , " she said .
Gillard 's threat underlined the Rudd government 's commitment to retaining the anti-strike provisions of the previous Howard government 's WorkChoices legislation .
Her comments typified the government 's reaction to the Pacific Brands announcement — voicing sympathy for the workers but seeking to prevent any industrial action that could spark a wider movement against the destruction of jobs as the global economic crisis worsens .
In a similar vein , Treasurer Wayne Swan expressed concern at the Pacific Brands executive pay rates but kept silent about the fact that the Rudd government has handed over hundreds of millions of dollars to assist and guarantee the deposits of the same banks that are driving the carve - up of the company — Westpac , the Commonwealth Bank , National Australia Bank , ANZ Bank — along with HSBC .
Wentworthville
The Rudd government 's anxiety to head off any resistance by Pacific Brands workers was on display yesterday at the Wentworthville factory gate meeting in western Sydney .
Female workers peppered local Labor MP Julie Owens with questions after she attempted to convince them that she and the government would " take care of you " .
Owens said she was " so sorry " about the retrenchments but said , " I ca n't keep the factory open " .
She outlined government measures to provide unemployment benefits and " job search " programs , arguing contemptuously that the $ 900 tax rebate payments from the government 's $ 42 billion stimulus package " might help tide you over " .
She urged the workers to " take whatever is good in this , and make it work " .
Merilou Orland and Rita Camilleri
A machinist , Merilou Orland , challenged Owens : " If we lose this job , where are we going to go ?
Me and my husband do n't make $ 80,000 a year between us .
How are we going to pay our mortgage and bills ? "
Owens had no answer , except to claim that Centrelink , the government 's welfare payments agency , would " be there for you " .
Speaking to the WSWS after the exchange with Owens , Orland said : " I 've still got two children at school , and two who have finished .
We have a mortgage to pay and insurance — all up $ 2,000 a month .
Where are we going to get the money ?
I 'm earning only $ 30,000 and my husband $ 45,000 .
We are struggling as it is .
It is going to be more difficult . "
Asked to comment on Owens 's statement that workers should be happy with " stimulus " payments and training programs , Orland asked rhetorically : " What help is that ?
Where are the jobs going to be ?
I 'm already over 40 .
No one will employ us . "
Orland was disgusted by the role of the banks and their bailout by the Rudd government .
" Are they [ the banks ] going to help us ?
What have they promised the government ?
That they will help us ?
I do n't think so !
" Where is that money now ?
It 's a big question .
My children will be struggling for things that they need , and they will be asking .
What am I going to tell them ?
I just ca n't understand things anymore . "
When it was suggested that the banks should be nationalised under workers ' control , she said : " We wish ; why not ?
I may not be good at managing things , but I am good at my job .
We are all multi-skilled here , but where are we going to get a job ?
There 's nothing . "
Another worker , Rita Camilleri , commented on the salary of CEO Sue Morphet : " It stinks .
She is a millionaire .
With this global financial crisis all the factories are closing .
Who is going to take us ?
No-one ! " Camilleri also denounced the banks .
" The banks are greedy , greedy .
Everything we have they take .
How can this happen ?
There will be no jobs for the little ones . "
A discussion followed with a group of about a dozen female workers — all immigrants from different parts of the world — on the global economic crash and the fact that millions were being thrown out of work internationally , including in China , where more than 20 million workers had already lost their jobs this year .
Camilleri observed that the Chinese workers were " maybe doing the same as us — fighting for their jobs . "
Cessnock
Outside the factory at Cessnock in the Hunter Valley , one incensed worker asked the local Labor MP , Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon , why the government was not " taking over " the factories to defend the jobs .
Like Owens , Fitzgibbon made a flying visit to the plant in an obvious exercise to hose down opposition .
He revealed that the Rudd government had offered extra assistance to the company , which had refused it .
" I know this is not what you want to hear , but the government is doing all it can , " he told workers .
" We have put in place stimulus packages to get the economy moving . "
Workers at Cessnock
Donna Twomey
Donna Twomey told the WSWS : " We are stunned by what has happened .
We were called to the canteen and told the plant would close but before that we were being told everything was OK .
I am a single mother with two children .
It will be almost impossible for me to find another job in the Cessnock area and I can't possibly live on what Centrelink pay people . "
Lyn Wright said she had not heard that the workers at the company 's plant in China were being sacked too until she read it in the WSWS leaflet ( " Australian banks dictate jobs axe at Pacific Brands " ) distributed at the site that day .
" It is not good that they are losing their jobs too .
We thought that the work would be sent to China because the labour is cheaper there but it seems the same is happening there .
What is happening is a real disaster .
When they close these plants they will never reopen and the jobs will never come back . "
Leonie Smith said : " We have been fighting for decades for this industry .
We have been going to rallies for years and protesting about the state of the industry and demanding that governments do something to help us .
" Yet the Labor government pats itself on the back , telling us that they met with the company about making some kind of deal .
Labor knew for at least three weeks that this closure was being planned but said nothing to us .
They offered the company money again but Pacific has been getting government money for years so why are they still putting us off and closing plants ? "
Asked if she had expected better conditions after the Howard government was replaced by Labor , Smith said : " No , I 'm not that gullible .
The political parties are all the same .
Their main concern is looking after themselves and the companies . "
Coolaroo
Steve Stojkovski
At the Coolaroo plant in northern Melbourne , the company 's own efforts to block discussion were exposed when security guards removed WSWS supporters who were giving out leaflets in the factory car park .
Steve Stojkovski , who has worked as a storeman at Coolaroo for nearly 40 years , told the WSWS that people were " totally shocked " when informed about the company 's plans on Wednesday .
" Most of the women are Vietnamese , Turkish or Indian .
Some people just sat there with their heads in their hands — they could n't move with shock .
" We have couples who have worked here for years .
There is one man who is 70 who has worked here for 44 years .
There are 70 people working here who are all over 60 years old .
The union had a meeting and they said they would fight to the end .
What the union is going to do is talk to the government . "
NASA commissioned a study on the feasibility of using little smallish tractor bots to prep a lunar outpost before the humans show up , and the research seems to show it as a good idea .
The theoretical plan is for 330 pound mower - sized bots to show up on the moon and prep the surface for actual buildings , landing sites , roads and so forth .
The robots are basically glorified tractors ( or perhaps simplified tractors ) so lunarnauts should n't expect a palace by the time they show up -- just a bunch of displaced dirt .
Berms seem to be a big theme of construction , since a sort of " blast shield " is needed to make sure debris from takeoff and landing do n't damage the actual settlement .

Ministers apologise as they admit Britain DID hand over two terror suspects to U.S. for ' torture flights '
Gordon Brown is under mounting pressure to order an independent inquiry into ' torture flights ' after it emerged that terror suspects captured by British forces were flown by the U.S. to Afghanistan for interrogation .
Defence Secretary John Hutton apologised to Parliament yesterday as he admitted that British officials handed over two men detained in Iraq to U.S. authorities in 2004 .
The men - said to be members of a group linked to Al Qaeda - were flown to an Afghan jail , where they remain in a legal limbo .
Admission : John Hutton ( left ) told MPs Britain was involved in extraordinary rendition putting Gordon Brown under pressure to order an independent inquiry
The astonishing admission is the closest yet to confirming allegations that Britain knew terror suspects were being secretly flown to countries where prisoners face torture .
Mr Hutton told shocked MPs that two senior ministers , the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Home Secretary Charles Clarke , were given details of the transfer but had not realised its ' significance ' .
The Defence Secretary said he regretted that ' inaccurate ' information on British involvement with so - called ' extraordinary rendition ' had previously been given to MPs by his department .
The Government has repeatedly denied colluding with flights carrying suspects to countries where torture is practised .
The U.S. has been accused of using extraordinary rendition hundreds of times since the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Papers prepared for the then home secretary Charles Clarke ( left ) and foreign secretary Jack Straw included references to an extraordinary rendition case
' Ghost ' flights are said to have flown terror suspects - chained hand and foot and blindfolded - to secret CIA prisons in third - party states such as Jordan , Syria , Morocco and Uzbekistan , as well as Romania and Poland , with the aim of keeping detainees beyond judicial oversight .
Most suspects have finished up in Guantanamo Bay .
Campaigners believe Britain has breached international law by collaborating with the transportation and interrogation of such suspects .
Last night the peer who led an EU - wide inquiry into rendition told the Daily Mail that serious concern remained over 170 more flights .
Liberal Democrat Baroness Ludford said there was evidence of 170 stopovers at UK airports by CIAoperated aircraft flying to or from countries where prisoners face torture .
' This is the first actual admission of complicity in extraordinary rendition , ' she said .
' It is another breach in the wall of denials and cover-ups over UK official complicity in torture and secret detention that has been built over the last seven years .
' But the unsatisfactory drip - feed of partial revelations must cease .
We need instead full scrutiny via a comprehensive , independent inquiry .
The British people are owed an apology by Gordon Brown .
' The best way for the Government to redeem itself is through coming clean about the whole sorry story which has dragged Britain 's reputation through the gutter . '
Mr Hutton told MPs that British officials had been aware of the transfer of two prisoners , captured by UK forces in and around Baghdad , from British to U.S. custody in 2004 .
He said they were members of Lashkar e Tayyiba , a proscribed organisation with links to Al Qaeda .
The U.S. moved them to Afghanistan because of a lack of relevant linguists necessary to interrogate them effectively in Iraq , he said .
The U.S. has now told Britain it is not ' possible or desirable ' to move the individuals , who are still in Afghanistan , either back to Iraq or their home countries .
But Mr Hutton said the U.S. authorities had assured Britain the pair had not been mistreated and were being held in a ' humane , safe and secure environment ' .
He said ' brief references ' to the case had been included in papers sent to Mr Straw and Mr Clarke in April 2006 .
He added : ' In retrospect , it is clear to me that the transfer to Afghanistan of these two individuals should have been questioned at the time . '
The incident came to light after an internal review of detentions in Iraq and Afghanistan , which has revealed a series of other errors in details previously released to Parliament .
The Foreign Office is also understood to be trawling through its records to check whether its previous assurances to MPs are accurate .
Last year , Foreign Secretary David Miliband had to apologise to Parliament as he revealed that on two occasions in 2002 , flights carrying terror suspects stopped at the airbase on the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia .
( Adds details on Cantarell , capital spending )
MEXICO CITY , Feb 20 ( Reuters ) - Mexican oil production fell 9.2 percent in January to its lowest level since November 1995 as output from the aging Cantarell oil field continued to dwindle , state oil company Pemex said on Friday .
Mexico pumped 2.685 million bpd in January , down from 2.957 million bpd in the same month a year ago , according to government data .
The giant Cantarell oil field lost its position as Mexico ’s largest single oil producer in January to the nearby Ku Maloob Zaap heavy oil complex , Pemex said .
Cantarell pumped 772,000 bpd in January , down from 811,000 bpd in December and down about 38 percent from a year ago .
Ku Maloob Zaap produced 787,000 bpd in January .
The bulk of the decline at the Cantarell complex came from the main field , Akal - Nohoch , which pumped 704,723 bpd in January , down from 739,695 bpd in December .
Pemex has said it plans to hold oil production at 2.75 million bpd in 2009 by expanding output from Ku Maloob Zaap and the onshore Chicontepec project .
The company plans to invest $ 8.617 billion in its exploration and production business this year , with Chicontepec being the largest single recipient of capital .
Pemex has budged $ 2.314 billion for Chicontepec this year , where it hopes to drill more than 1,000 wells a year to access the oil locked in an extremely challenging geological formation .
Independent analysts are skeptical that Pemex will be able to replace all of the oil production capacity being lost at Cantarell in the short term .
The fall in oil output dragged down oil exports to 1.366 million bpd in January , compared with 1.434 million bpd a year earlier .
Gasoline imports averaged 329,700 bpd in January , up from 303,870 bpd in January 2008 .

When I first heard that the Utah legislature is considering yet another law to regulate keyword advertising , I thought :
Are you kidding me ?
After all , Utah has pursued these regulations twice with disastrous results .
The first time , in 2004 , Utah ’s attempt to regulate adware - mediated keyword advertising was declared unconstitutional , and Utah amended the law in 2005 to make it irrelevant .
In 2007 , Utah tried again , passing a law that restricted keyword advertising across - the - board .
That law was a spectacular failure , garnering derision both within Utah–especially from angry Utah citizens shocked that their elected representatives passed a law that the state AG thought was unconstitutional and that was going to cost valuable taxpayer money to defend in court–and globally as everyone wondered if the Utah legislature was really that crazy .
In 2008 , the legislature tucked its tail between its legs and repealed the 2007 law .
With this track record , the Utah legislature wants to try regulating keyword advertising again … ?
Are you kidding me ?
Then again , perhaps this latest foray really is n’t all that surprising .
My sources tell me that 1 -800 Contacts is the prime mover behind this statute , and 1 - 800 Contacts has testified in support of the law .
1-800 Contacts has an hard - to - explain love / hate relationship with keyword advertising .
1-800 Contacts has been a repeat litigant against keyword advertising , including being the losing plaintiff in the landmark 1- 800 Contacts v. WhenU case , and 1 - 800 Contacts has continued to bring other lawsuits against competitive retailers ( such as the LensWorld case I blogged about a year ago ) .
At the same time , 1- 800 Contacts has been a buyer of trademarked keyword ads , and it was one of the companies that protested the 2007 law because it was concerned the law would limit its own advertising practices ( although , at the last minute , 1 - 800 Contacts flip - flopped and tried to sneak in new restrictions on keyword advertising into the putative repeal of the 2007 law ) .
Clearly , 1- 800 Contacts has a complex attitude towards keyword advertising , although it might just be pure duplicity .
Either way , with 1 - 800 Contacts ’ flip in 2008 and its continued litigation against keyword advertising , it ’s not unexpected that they might try to bend the ear of the apparently pliable Utah legislature .
The Proposed Law
The 2004 - 05 laws banned trademark - triggered pop-up ads triggered by adware .
The 2007 law allowed trademark owners to register their marks with a newly created Utah administrative registry ( which never got created ) and prohibited keyword buyers and sellers from using registered marks as triggers for keyword advertising .
HB 450 , the proposed 2009 law , takes a very different approach than the 2007 law :
Fewer Defendants .
The law only applies to keyword buyers ( advertisers ) .
Unlike the last two laws , keyword sellers such as search engines are immune from liability under this law .
However , the law is expansive in other ways : the law expressly holds an advertiser liable for affiliates ’ keyword purchases ( a currently open point in trademark law ) , and the law expressly references telephone directory assistance advertiser as being within its scope .
Opt Out .
The law only applies after the trademark owner sends a takedown notice / cease & desist demand to the advertiser .
Further , if the advertiser stops within 10 days of the takedown notice , it is not liable for any remedies under this law .
( They might still be liable under other legal doctrines ) .
Limited Remedies .
My reading of the law is that the only remedies against an advertiser are an injunction and attorneys fees–no damages .
I ’m not 100 % sure about this because some states have laws that create damage claims outside the scope of any specific statute ( I ’m thinking of California B&P 17200 ) .
I do n’t know if Utah has a catchall provision like that .
Geographic Restrictions .
One of the most deficient aspects of Utah ’s 2007 law was that it required advertisers throughout the country to check the new registry before buying keyword advertising on a third party trademark , even if the advertiser , the keyword seller and the trademark owner all had zero connection with Utah .
This law tries much more clearly to restrict its reach to Utah .
First , the law only applies to ads “ in Utah , ” whatever that means .
Second , the law only restricts keyword buys made from sellers that allow “ an advertiser to limit the display of advertisements by geographic location . ”
I ’m not exactly sure what this means–after all , a site like eBay segregates its listing database by country ; does that mean eBay gives advertisers geographic choices ?
– but it ’s clear that an advertiser purchasing ads from a seller that does n’t offer any geolocation choices is n’t covered by the law .
Third , the law does n’t apply if segregating Utah ad viewers from non-Utah ad viewers is n’t “ technologically feasible ” or would impose “ an undue financial burden . ”
I ’m not saying that this law will survive a dormant commerce clause challenge–personally , I think all state regulation of the Internet is inherently suspect–but the law certainly tried to limit its reach to Utah .
Narrow Scope .
The law applies when “ the delivery or display of an advertisement in Utah …is the product of a bad - faith attempt to profit from the registrant ’s mark by diverting a consumer from the registrant , the registrant ’s authorized licensees , or another source authorized by the registrant . ”
The statute provides for a multi-factor evaluation of what constitutes a “ bad faith diversion ” by keyword advertising , with the first factor being that the ad “ is likely to create an initial , misleading impression that the person is a legitimate source of the goods or services ” ( which itself is subject to another multi- factor evaluation ) .
Personally , I do n’t think there is such a thing as bad faith diversion or initial misleading impressions with respect to truthful ad copy , so this ought to be a null set .
Even so , the law lists a number of categorical exclusions from its coverage , including :
* advertiser belief that the ad is fair use .
Note : the bill uses the term “ fair use ” several times , even though this term is not well - defined in trademark law .
So it is n’t clear to me if “ fair use ” meant descriptive fair use , nominative use , both , neither , or yet something else .
* the sale is permissible under the First Sale doctrine .
This should exclude keyword buys by other parties in a trademark owner ’s distribution channel .
However , as I recently blogged , courts are struggling with the First Sale doctrine ’s application to e-commerce .
* “ ( a ) fair use of a mark in comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark ; ( b ) noncommercial use of a mark ; and ( c ) all forms of news reporting and news commentary . ”
This is an interesting set of exclusions ; it looks like the drafter tried to ( incompletely ) mimic the federal dilution exclusions .
However , the implicit redundancy with the other fair use aspect mentioned above also raises a question why ( a ) only applies to famous marks .
That ’s either a drafting error or a significant limitation on that prong .
So What Does This Law Do ?
From my reading , it appears that this law does not apply to gripe ads or trademark conflicts within a distribution channel .
Therefore , I think the law really only applies to advertising on competitors ’ trademarks , and even then , only some of the ads .
Given the application to competitive keyword advertising and the focus on an injunction as a remedy , this law covers only limited circumstances that are not already addressed by the search engines ’ trademark policies , which provide an extrajudicial “ injunction . ”
Indeed , this law is nearly co-extensive with Yahoo ’s and Microsoft ’s trademark policies .
On the other hand , the law would govern situations that Google is n’t remediating with its trademark policy because it could force advertisers off keywords that Google would happily sell .
Furthermore , the ambiguous application of the law to keyword buys from places other than search engines , such as telephone directory assistance services , may implicate some keyword sellers who do n’t currently have trademark policies .
Conclusion
If I ’m right that this law simply codifies current search engine trademarks policies and extends them some , then this law is n’t as problematic as Utah ’s last two efforts .
But it also makes me wonder –what ’s the point ?
Does n’t Utah have more important problems to solve ???
Even if the law is less troublesome than the last two , let ’s be clear : this is not a good proposal .
As with Utah ’s past two efforts , this law has nothing to do with improving consumer welfare .
Instead , it would allow companies to suppress competition by helping companies keep their competitors from gaining exposure among the company ’s potential customers ; meaning that companies wo n’t have to work as hard competing on price and quality .
I understand why companies such as 1 -800 Contacts , who has a pattern of trying to use legal tricks to suppress competitors , would find it attractive to ply their local legislators for some corporate welfare .
But why any legislator would waste their time with such an unabashed anti-competitive , anti-consumer request is simply beyond me .
As I have explained elsewhere , policy - makers should be helping consumers get relevant content , not enacting laws to take it away from them .
The bill is making its way through the Utah House , and my observation of Utah legislative proceedings is that bills can be amended substantially from beginning to end .
So this bill could get better , or it could get much worse .
Fortunately , a coalition of Internet companies is lobbying against the bill , and the bill barely survived its first committee hearing on an 8 - 6 vote .
Thus , it ’s not guaranteed that this law will make it through .
My hope is that the Utah legislators will recognize the law ’s depravity and their own poor track record in the area and squelch this latest effort .
As we reach the close of 2008 , it is time to stop for a moment and take stock of the previous year .
When you look at ( and for ) news stories regarding modern Paganism ( and related topics ) every day of the year , you can sometimes lose focus on the larger picture .
So it can be a helpful thing to look at the broad strokes , the bigger themes , the events and developments that will have lasting impact on the modern Pagan movement .
What follows are my picks for the top ten stories from this past year involving or affecting modern Pagans .
10 . Parsing Pagan Numbers : 2008 was a very good year for folks who enjoy sifting through surveys and demographical data about Pagans .
We saw some signs that Pagans might affect the political thinking of those around them , that liberals may be more likely to dabble in the paranormal , that Britain is shifting into a post - Christian reality faster than we imagined , and that Pagans overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama for President .
However , the big story concerning statistical data and modern Pagans comes from the groundbreaking Pew Forum ’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey , which gave us some new insights into just how many Pagans there might be in America .
“ Finally , we have confirmation that modern Paganism is continuing to grow .
The study found that 0.4 percent of Americans adhere to a “ New Age ” religion , broken down into “ Pagan ” , “ Wiccan ” , and “ Other ” .
These figures do n’t include those who described themselves as “ eclectic ” , “ spiritual but not religious ” , “ other liberal faith groups ” , or members of CUUPs who identified themselves primarily as Unitarian Universalists .
Working then with the idea then that ( at least ) 0.4 percent of Americans are modern Pagans ( according to the study ) , that means there are at least 1.2 million Pagans of one variety or another in America . ”
The Pew survey ’s large sample size ( 35,000 respondents ) gives our movement some firm reasons to believe we are indeed steadily growing ( though not as fast as some would think ) .
It seems like the explosive growth patterns we saw around the world in the 1990s are past , and a healthy , maintainable , expansion has replaced it ( look for further confirmation of this hypothesis when the UK and Australia take their next censuses in 2011 ) .
09 . Pagans in Prison :
The issue of the rights of Pagan prisoners continues to be a big story .
Two major stories were the Washington Department of Corrections altering its stance regarding a prisoner ’s adherence to multiple faiths ( which allowed for the existence of “ Christo - Pagans ” and other religious meldings ) , and the historic testimony of Pagan chaplain Patrick McCollum before the US Commission on Civil Rights .
Wiccan Chaplain Patrick McCollum Wiccan Chaplain Patrick McCollum
“ Over more than a decade , I ’ve had the opportunity to interact nationally with both administrators and inmates on religious accommodation issues .
While practices differ from state to state , I found discrimination against minority faiths everywhere . ”
McCollum described discrimination against American Pagan inmates as “ endemic ” , and called for a complete overhaul of the way in which prison chaplains and staff are hired , and the establishment of a independent grievance process which would include experts in non-traditional faiths .
As Pagan populations around the world grow , so too will the number of Pagan inmates , the fight for equal and fair treatment is an essential struggle that will no doubt continue for several years .
08 . The Ups and Downs of Christian - Pagan Relations :
This past year saw two books from Christian publishers that claimed to forward dialogue and engagement with the Pagan community , but only one that actually seemed to back up those claims ( that would be “ Beyond the Burning Times ” ) .
While many Pagans are quick to point out that not all Christians are Pagan - hating Jack Chick - reading caricatures , we found that there is still a lot of skepticism and cynicism inherent in the process of building better relations .
No doubt this skepticism and reluctance to reach out stems from the ongoing stream of alarmist propaganda , straw man arguments , and a long - standing resistance among some Christian organizations to allow us equal access to the rights and privileges enjoyed by the dominant monotheisms .
But small progress is still progress , yes ?
07 . Animal Sacrifice and Santeria Rights : I have long argued that what happens to our religious “ cousins ” in the African diasporic religions ( Santeria , Vodou , Candomble , etc ) ultimately affects the rights and freedoms of modern Pagans .
We ignore their legal struggles – whether due to ignorance , indifference , or abhorrence – at our own peril .
2008 saw the fight over the legal right for these faiths to carry out their rituals in peace , specifically animal sacrifice , intensify dramatically .
Relations between practitioners of Santeria and local police forces are getting tense , and the legal case of Texan Santeria priest Jose Merced , who was prevented from carrying out private rituals after neighbors called the police .
“ Santeria priest Jose Merced filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the city of Euless in December 2006 after officials told him he could n’t sacrifice goats at his home for a ceremony initiating a new priest .
Followers of the African - Caribbean religion consider animal sacrifice as essential to Santeria as Communion is to Catholics .
Euless says the killing of goats for whatever reason would violate its city - wide slaughtering ban .
Last year , the city proposed a settlement that permitted the killing of chickens – which is also involved in the ceremony and allowed under the city ordinance .
Mr. Merced rejected the offer , saying that Santeria would cease to exist without the sacrifice of goats as well . ”
Though Merced lost that case , it is currently being appealed .
The problems being faced by Santeria and other related faiths ( legal and cultural ) is only intensified by ill - informed police and reporters who see dark magical rites whenever a dead animal surfaces in a street or graveyard .
In fact , to some , all these diasporic religions are pretty much the same , and have little issue with casually mixing them up ( which allows for utterly preposterous stories to be taken seriously ) .
You can bet that 2009 will only see more coverage of these religions as they continue through their own version of the “ Satanic Panic ” years that Pagans endured .
06 . Pagans and Litigation :
This past year saw no shortage of the Pagan community in the courtrooms .
Accusations of discrimination are no longer being tolerantly endured , instead we have witnessed more litigation over the rights / rites of Pagans ( and other related matters ) this past year than ever before .
You had a Wiccan who successfully fought a ban on fortune - telling , a Reclaiming Witch who is fighting an unjust firing , a controversial custody case , the Supreme Court pondering the rights of a New Age syncretic religion , a religious displays case that involved Wiccans which fizzled out , a fight over religious graffiti , a bizarre “ Satanic - Panic ” criminal case involving Pagans in North Carolina , and a variety of cases involving public prayer .
All that is only the tip of the iceberg , and you can bet 2009 will see even more courtroom struggles involving the Pagan community .

Some believe that Pakistan 's mystic , non-violent Islam can be used as a defence against extremism ( Photos : Kamil Dayan Khan )
By Barbara Plett
BBC News , Lahore
It 's one o'clock in the morning and the night is pounding with hypnotic rhythms , the air thick with the smoke of incense , laced with dope .
I 'm squeezed into a corner of the upper courtyard at the shrine of Baba Shah Jamal in Lahore , famous for its Thursday night drumming sessions .
It 's packed with young men , smoking , swaying to the music , and working themselves into a state of ecstasy .
This is n't how most Westerners imagine Pakistan , which has a reputation as a hotspot for Islamist extremism .
Devotional singing
But this popular form of Sufi Islam is far more widespread than the Taleban 's version .
It 's a potent brew of mysticism , folklore and a dose of hedonism .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Now some in the West have begun asking whether Pakistan 's Sufism could be mobilised to counter militant Islamist ideology and influence .
Lahore would be the place to start : it 's a city rich in Sufi tradition .
At the shrine of Data Ganj Bakhsh Hajveri , musicians and singers from across the country also gather weekly , to perform qawwali , or Islamic devotional singing .
Qawwali is seen as a key part of the journey to the divine , what Sufis call the continual remembrance of God .
" When you listen to other music , you will listen for a short time , but the qawwali goes straight inside , " says Ali Raza , a fourth generation Sufi singer .
" Even if you can't understand the wording , you can feel the magic of the qawwali , this is spiritual music which directly touches your soul and mind as well . "
But Sufism is more than music .
At a house in an affluent suburb of Lahore a group of women gathers weekly to practise the Sufi disciplines of chanting and meditation , meant to clear the mind and open the heart to God .
One by one the devotees recount how the sessions have helped them deal with problems and achieve greater peace and happiness .
This more orthodox Sufism is n't as widespread as the popular variety , but both are seen as native to South Asia .
' Love and harmony ' " Islam came to this part of the world through Sufism , " says Ayeda Naqvi , a teacher of Islamic mysticism who 's taking part in the chanting .
" It was Sufis who came and spread the religious message of love and harmony and beauty , there were no swords , it was very different from the sharp edged Islam of the Middle East .
" And you ca n't separate it from our culture , it 's in our music , it 's in our folklore , it 's in our architecture .
We are a Sufi country , and yet there 's a struggle in Pakistan right now for the soul of Islam . "
Sufism is a mixture of music , chanting and meditation
That struggle is between Sufism and hard - line Wahhabism , the strict form of Sunni Islam followed by members of the Taleban and al - Qaeda .
It has gained ground in the tribal north - west , encouraged initially in the 1980s by the US and Saudi Arabia to help recruit Islamist warriors to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan .
But it 's alien to Pakistan 's Sufi heartland in the Punjab and Sindh provinces , says Sardar Aseff Ali , a cabinet minister and a Sufi .
" Wahhabism is a tribal form of Islam coming from the desert sands of Saudi Arabia , " he says .
" This may be very attractive to the tribes in the frontier , but it will never find resonance in the established societies of Pakistan . "
So could Pakistan 's mystic , non-violent Islam be used as a defence against extremism ?
An American think tank , the Rand Corporation , has advocated this , suggesting support for Sufism as an " open , intellectual interpretation of Islam " .
There is ample proof that Sufism remains a living tradition .
In the warren of Lahore 's back streets , a shrine is being built to a modern saint , Hafiz Iqbal , and his mentor , a mystic called Baba Hassan Din .
They attract followers from all classes and walks of life .
' Atrocities '
The architect is Kamil Khan Mumtaz .
He describes in loving detail his traditional construction techniques and the spiritual principles they symbolise .
Huge crowds are attracted to Sufi gatherings
He shakes his head at stories of lovely old mosques and shrines pulled down and replaced by structures of concrete and glass at the orders of austere mullahs , and he 's horrified at atrocities committed in the name of religion by militant Islamists .
But he doubts that Sufism can be marshalled to resist Wahhabi radicalism , a phenomenon that he insists has political , not religious , roots .
" The American think tanks should think again , " he says .
" What you see [ in Islamic extremism ] is a response to what has happened in the modern world .
" There is a frustration , an anger , a rage against invaders , occupiers .
Muslims ask themselves , what happened ?
" We once ruled the world and now we 're enslaved .
This is a power struggle , it is the oppressed who want to become the oppressors , this has nothing to do with Islam , and least of all to do with Sufism . "
Sufi people are often actively engaged in social welfare programmes Ayeda Naqvi , on the other hand , believes Sufism could play a political role to strengthen a tolerant Islamic identity in Pakistan .
But she warns of the dangers of Western support .
" I think if it 's done it has to be done very quietly because a lot of people here are allergic to the West interfering , " she says .
" So even if it 's something good they 're doing , they need to be discreet because you do n't want Sufism to be labelled as a movement which is being pushed by the West to drown out the real puritanical Islam . "
Back at the Shah Jamal shrine I could n't feel further from puritanical Islam .
The frenzied passion around me suggests that Pakistan 's Sufi shrines wo n't be taken over by the Taleban any time soon .
But whether Sufism can be used to actively resist the spread of extremist Islam , or even whether it should be , is another question .

So the field of 65 is set and I 'm already reserving the couch and the remote control starting about 11:30 a.m. Thursday .
But looking at the selection of the field and reading between the lines provides a fascinating ( and sobering ) commentary on SEC basketball .
In short , the NCAA selection committee was n't impressed .
At all .
And spoke -- through selections and seedings -- in unprecedented fashion .
And as for Auburn 's chances ?
The committee appeared to say , " What chances ? "
Exactly what are we talking about ?
Well , check this out :
*** Never had an SEC team , since the league went to a 16 - game schedule in 1992 , has a team with a 10 - 6 SEC record been left out .
But this year , both Auburn and South Carolina are sitting at home with their 10 - 6 league marks .
*** Never has the SEC sent just three teams to the NCAAs since the 16 - game league schedule in 1992 , yet that 's what happened Sunday with LSU , Tennessee and Mississippi State .
It 's the fewest since the SEC sent three teams in 1990 .
*** LSU , seeded eighth in the South region , received the second - lowest seeding ever for an SEC regular season champ .
Tennessee had the lowest as a nine - seed in 1982 when it shared the SEC regular season title with Kentucky .
Seeding began in 1979 .
*** Mississippi State , seeded 13th in the West region , received the second - lowest seeding ever for an SEC team .
The worst , of course , was Georgia last year -- which went 17 - 17 but got a spot as a 14th - seed after being perhaps the most stunning winner of the SEC Tournament ever ( or at least since its renewal in 1979 ) on the heels of going 4 - 12 in SEC play .
*** As for Auburn 's claim to the NCAA tournament , the committee did n't appear to even give the Tigers a look .
According to CollegeRPI.com , Auburn finished with an RPI of 64 ( MSU was 63 ) and a SOS of 62 ( MSU was 53 ) .
Auburn finished 10 - 6 in SEC play and 22 - 11 overall ( MSU was 9 - 7 and 23 - 12 ) .
Auburn was 9 - 3 in its last 12 ( MSU was 7 - 5 ) .
In other words , Auburn and MSU were almost identical .
Yet MSU's No. 13 seed was lower than any at - large teams ( Arizona and Wisconsin were the lowest - seeded at - large teams , both 12 seeds ) .
And MSU was seeded on the same line as fellow 13 seeds Cleveland State of the Horizon League , Akron of the Mid-American Conference and Portland State of the Big Sky Conference .
( Ouch !
How does that look ?
Horizon League , Mid-American Conference , Big Sky Conference . ... SEC ?!? ) .
Bottom line ?
SEC basketball has n't been this irrelevant since expanding to 12 teams in 1992 .
And the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee -- chaired by SEC Commissioner Mike Slive --essentially said to the SEC , " You stink ! "
What do you make of all this ?
And is the future as bleak as the present ?
LONDON  A Guantánamo detainee at the center of a long standoff between the United States and Britain was freed and returned to Britain on Monday after almost seven years in American custody .
The detainee , Binyam Mohamed , was flown in a Gulfstream jet to the Northolt Royal Air Force Base in Northwest London , and by the evening had been released from detention .
Mr. Mohamed , 30 , was captured in Pakistan in April 2002 ; American officials said that he was part of a conspiracy to detonate a dirty bomb on American soil .
But all charges against him were eventually dismissed .
He has said he was held for 18 months in Morocco , where he says he was tortured , then was moved to Afghanistan and then to Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The C.I.A. has repeatedly declined to say if Mr. Mohamed was held in Morocco , and has steadfastly denied that he , or anyone else in its custody , was ever tortured .
Britain , where Mr. Mohamed established residence 15 years ago , had been seeking his release since August 2007 .
news PhotoTO : Pillow Fightin’
Pillows and , yes , despite requests from organizers , feathers flew on Saturday as Newmindspace attracted several hundred people to Yonge - Dundas Square for their annual pillow fight .
The good - natured battle started with an intensity and energy that only abated when the first feathered pillow burst , an eruption that was met with a sigh that rose quickly to a cheer .
At the end of the event , the square ’s security personnel fretted about the amount of down covering the concrete , but plenty of volunteers stayed behind to help clean up .

Cartman & Co. are headed for Netflix , as the movie rental company has signed a deal to stream the first nine seasons of South Park through its Watch Instantly service , reports The New York Times today .
South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have already shown their show is a hit online at SouthParkStudios.com , which features 181 episodes and has generated 300 million views since April of last year .
The Times reports that Parker and Stone , who control South Park ’s digital sale and display , met with Hulu and Joost , but went with Netflix because the company offered them cash ( and the guys like the service ) .
Parker and Stone split non-TV revenue 50 - 50 with Comedy Central , the cable channel that carries the show .
The South Park / Netflix deal is interesting on a few fronts .
First , it reinforces how aggressively Netflix is going after premium content for its Watch Instantly service .
The current crop of content is fine , but definitely lackluster — adding a brand name like South Park should give it a shot in the arm .
But Netflix is n’t even getting the content exclusively as South Park episodes are available at SouthParkStudios.com , and for purchase via iTunes and Amazon .
Second , Netflix wanted that content so badly that it paid cash , and cash is king ( especially in this turbulent economic environment ) .
Hulu - shmulu .
Despite its growing audience , the popular premium content service could n’t nab the show with the promise of ad revenues .
Finally , are the days of ad - based hyper - distribution being replaced by direct payment hyper - distribution for premium content ?
Yes , the South Park creators offer free ad - supported content streaming on their own site , but they control the monetization efforts there .
When it came time to distribute through a third party , they went with places that sell episodes directly or paid in cash , not promises .
This follows on the heels of Comcast ( s cmcsa ) wading into the online video waters , working with the cable networks to offer content online for paying subscribers .
And Ad Age reports today on Time Warner ’s new “ TV Everywhere ” initiative that will see its content distributed through many platforms , but require proof of subscription to a cable , satellite or telco TV service .
If this works out for South Park , other creators could soon be telling ad - supported sites , ?
la Cartman , “ Screw you guys , I ’m going MSO . ”

Inside the April issue of Vanity Fair , Jonah Hill , Seth Rogen , Jason Segel and Paul Rudd spoof a 2006 cover with Tom Ford , Keira Knightley and Scarlett Johansson .
But with bodysuits .
What a cop-out .
Advertisement
Is it funny that the guys ( and Annie Leibovitz , who shot both images ) spoofed the shot ?
Sure .
But it would have been funnier if the guys were actually naked .
Who made this decision ?
Why bodysuits ?
It 's understandable to try and create a " pale " skin tone for the purposes of recreating the original photograph properly , but Leibovitz is a whiz with lighting .
Is the world not ready for Jonah Hill 's ass ?
As for Jason Segel , he already did full - frontal nudity in Forgetting Sarah Marshall .
We saw Seth Rogen 's bare buttocks in Knocked Up .
Why is it that naked woman can appear on the cover of Vanity Fair , yet none of these dudes can expose their bellies ?
Is it because they 're not thin ?
Of course , this issue just reflects the problems with nudity in our society in general .
When I went to see Friday The 13th , the theater was crowded with men and women , but after the third time a female actress was shown topless , some girl behind me yelled out , " How come we ca n't see no huevos ? "
She was asking for balls , but knew that the movie would n't show any , because the producers did n't have any .
And that 's the problem with this " spoof . "
As any good comedian knows , you have to commit to the joke .
This one was done — ahem — half - assed .

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , in consultation with the Vatican , is trying to overturn a court order to remove the feeding tubes from a woman who has been in a coma for 17 years and been assessed as having no hope of any recovery .
Why ?
Because she ’s fertile .
The other day , Pavlov ’s Cat referred to pro-life ideas that construct women as nothing more than “ centrally - heated wheelbarrows “ .
The idea revolves around an ignorant , misogynistic mindset that says that a pregnancy is just something a woman carts around like a Tupperware container ; that the impact on the rest of her life is nonexistent or irrelevant ; that all woman have to do with an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy is “ carry it for nine months ” and then everyone would be happy .
This idea that women are no more than meat - containers is reinforced in the fetus - centric imagery of pro-life marketing .
Recently , Catholicvote put out an advertisement purporting to show the real - time fetal ultrasound of Barack Obama ( an obvious lie ) , and his mother was absent – reduced to merely a few uterine shadows on a sonogram .
That advertisement is here ( see RH Reality Check , Menstrual Poetry , Womanist Musings , Sociological Images , and Feministing for more commentary . )
[ image description at footnote 1 . ]
There are many more examples of this flavour of woman - erasure .
Pro-life propaganda often depicts an embryo or fetus floating in a black void , the woman not even existing as a uterus , but completely absent .
Sufficient Scruples wrote in “ You Are a Housing Project for Fetuses “ :
Yep .
Your uterus is the home of a fetus .
Your cervix is merely the front door of its “ apartment ” , and your bodily organs are merely the walls , floor , wiring , and ventilation ducts of its abode .
Acting on your own body , or having a doctor do so on your behalf , is equivalent to bursting down the door of someone else ’s home .
( I admit , I have no freaking idea what the binoculars are for . ) [… ]
Amazingly enough , also , the cartoon manages to show the inside of a woman ’s body without ever implying that there ’s actually a woman present .
Now , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has made it absolutely clear that he believes women are nothing more than fetal housing projects .
And he has done so by trying to overturn a court decision in a right - to - die case .
Eluana Englaro , age 38 , has been in a coma for 17 years .
Her condition is considered irreversible .
Her father has won a decade - long court battle to remove her feeding tubes .
The Guardian reports :
But in an extraordinary turn of events , the country ’s prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , after consultation with the Vatican , has issued an emergency decree stating that food and water cannot be suspended for any patient depending upon them , reversing the earlier court ruling .
On issuing the emergency decree , Berlusconi declared : “ This is murder .
I would be failing to rescue her .
I ’m not a Pontius Pilate . ”
Justifying his campaign to save Englaro ’s life , the prime minister added that , physically at least , she was “ in the condition to have babies ” .
His argument is not that her condition might be reversed , that she might regain some sort of consciousness one day .
Not that this was not her wish .
It is n’t coming from a disability - rights perspective or any notions of slippery - slope .
No , he thinks she ’s a potential fetus container .
Never mind that impregnation by the usual means would be rape .
Never mind that she cannot consent to insemination .
Never mind that there is no one except him and the Vatican who wants to shove embryos or sperm into this unconscious woman .
Her potential as a comatose incubator is the only thing that he thinks gives her existence any value .
Berlusconi apparently fantasises about a world with comatose women in rows , feeding tubes hooked up , the fetuses that will be their goldensons slowly cooking away until they ’re cut out when the machine goes ping .
This is fucking horrifying .
Sadly , this is entirely consistent with the past behaviour of Berlusconi and the Vatican .
They do n’t believe women are even second - class people ; we ’re not people at all , just the bearers of chromosomes and wombs , receptacles who collectively get a bit uppity from time to time and have to be slapped down .
And what better place to start than with women who ca n’t fight back .
Shakesville has more .

If you ca n’t see it clearly in the reduced - size image , a cute pink fetus is lounging in a wingback chair , reading “ Modern Fetus ” magazine , inside a soft , red , squishy - walled apartment with the sign “ Womb Sweet Womb ” hanging on the wall .
The fetus is plugged into the wall through an umbilical cord that terminates in an electrical outlet .
Its baseball cap is hanging from a peg on the wall , a ventilator duct appears on the other wall , and – displaying a worrisome grasp of anatomy – a heart - shaped heart and other organs are visible through a huge gap in the side wall , next to a set of large , coin - operated binoculars like you find at outdoor public attractions .

Cops like David Bratzer are a rare breed .
Think of the late Gil Puder .
A distinguished Vancouver police officer , Puder called for an end to the war on drugs while he was in active service during the late 1990s and continued to do so despite threats of disciplinary action from his superiors .
Or the recently retired West Vancouver police chief Kash Heed .
At one time , while he was still with the Vancouver police , Heed , according to Bratzer , also spoke about the legalization of drugs .
Bratzer has been with the Victoria police for only three years , and already the 31 - year - old officer has stepped forward to question the basis of the country ’s drug laws .
“ As a police officer , you always want to help people , so it ’s very frustrating to be a police officer and enforce laws that are not necessarily helpful , ” Bratzer told the Georgia Straight by phone .
Last month , he addressed participants in a cannabis convention held at the University of Victoria , where he presented his proposals for a post - prohibition era .
Step one , he said , is to legalize all drugs .
Step two is for the provincial government to regulate drugs in the same way it regulates alcohol .
Step three , he continued , is to decide what to do with the “ peace dividend ” or the funds that government can save by stopping the war on drugs .
Bratzer also told participants at the convention , which was organized by the International Hempology 101 Society , that among the things guaranteed in a war - on - drugs regime is criminal activity .
This comes from both drug users in need of money for a quick fix and organized - crime groups involved in the production and distribution of drugs , he said .
Coming out to speak about these things as a volunteer with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition — a Massachusetts - based group composed of current and former members of the police and justice communities — is n’t easy .
“ It ’s been mixed , ” Bratzer said when asked about the reaction of his Victoria police colleagues .
He stressed that his views are entirely his own and do not reflect the position of the police department .
He also has two older brothers who are with the Victoria police .
“ We have talked about it , ” Bratzer said .
“ They understand that I have my own opinions and they respect that .
They do n’t necessarily agree with me but they respect my right to free speech . ”
The Straight caught up with B.C. solicitor general John van Dongen earlier this month at a private screening of A Warrior ’s Religion , a documentary dealing with gangs in the South Asian community .
When asked about the prospects of legalization , van Dongen said : “ That is a federal issue and certainly the Conservative government has made their position clear that they ’re not going there . ”
Where Canada ’s war on drugs may lead to in the future worries Tony Smith , a retired 28 - year veteran of the Vancouver Police Department and also a LEAP member .
In Mexico , Smith noted , drug cartels have grown so powerful with profits from the drug trade that they can either buy off police , judges , and politicians or kill them at will .
“ What ’s really the difference here and there ? ” Smith asked in a phone interview with the Straight .
In the U.S. , according to Smith , there ’s much talk about drug corruption among law enforcers .
That may not be the case in Canada , but he warned that once it starts happening here , “ you wo n’t know which policemen are under the pay of the drug people and which policemen are n’t ” and “ it ’s a very thin line once you approach that point . ”
Referring to the ongoing turf war among gangs here in the Lower Mainland , Smith noted that drug lords now do n’t seem to care about “ what level of violence they ’re using amongst themselves ” .
What if , Smith asked , somebody comes “ stepping out of the line and thinks , ” ˜Well , you know , screw it .
I ’m in a bit of a problem here .
I ’ll just take out the policeman or the judge or whatever . ’
And once that occurs , then we ’ll have total anarchy . ”

I visited Gaza last summer and found many Palestinians ambivalent in a way that Americans and Israelis often do n’t appreciate .
Many Gazans scorn Fatah as corrupt and incompetent , and they dislike Hamas ’s overzealousness and repression .
But when they are suffering and humiliated , they find it emotionally satisfying to see Hamas fighting back .
Granted , Israel was profoundly provoked in this case .
Israel sought an extension of its cease - fire with Hamas , and Egypt offered to mediate one  but Hamas refused .
When it is shelled by its neighbor , Israel has to do something .
But Israel ’s right to do something does n’t mean it has the right to do anything .
Since the shelling from Gaza started in 2001 , 20 Israeli civilians have been killed by rockets or mortars , according to a tabulation by Israeli human rights groups .
That does n’t justify an all - out ground invasion that has killed more than 660 people ( it ’s difficult to know how many are militants and how many are civilians ) .
So what could Israel have reasonably done ?
Bombing the tunnels through which Gazans smuggle weapons would have been a proportionate response , if Israel had stopped there , and the same is true of airstrikes on certain Hamas targets .
An even better approach would have been to ease the siege in Gaza , perhaps creating an environment in which Hamas would have extended the cease - fire .
It was certainly worth trying  and almost anything would be better than lashing out in a way that would create more boomerangs .

“ This policy is not strengthening Israel , ” notes Sari Bashi , the executive director of Gisha , an Israeli human rights group that works on Gaza issues .
“ The trauma that 1.5 million people have been undergoing in Gaza is going to have long - term effects for our ability to live together .

WASHINGTON  The Agriculture Department on Thursday banned the company implicated in the nationwide contamination of peanut products from doing business with the federal government .
At least eight people have died and hundreds have been sickened after eating tainted products .
The order , which affects the Peanut Corporation of America and a subsidiary , will remain in force for one year .
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also stripped the company ’s chief executive of his seat on a board that advises the government on peanut quality standards .
David Shipman , an acting administrator at the Agriculture Department , said , “ The actions of P.C.A. indicate that the company lacks business integrity and business honesty , which seriously and directly hinders its ability to do business with the federal government . ”
The department ’s actions came on a day when senators heard testimony from health experts and a Food and Drug Administration official , who acknowledged that gaps in the food safety system had contributed to delays in catching the outbreak of salmonella in peanut butter and other products that spread to 43 states .
The problem has been traced to a peanut processing facility in Blakely , Ga .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China maintained its scornful response to human rights criticism from the United States , throwing back assertions that Washington was culpable for racism , crowded prisons and torture .
The U.S. State Department sharply criticised China on Wednesday in its annual report on human rights across the world , saying its record “ remained poor and worsened in some areas ” in 2008 .
In the now well - scripted tit - for - tat exchange over the issue , Beijing dismissed the criticisms as “ meddling , ” but also late Thursday issued its tenth annual assessment of human rights in the United States .
That record was not good , said the report issued by the State Council Information Office , the government arm in charge of news and propaganda .
“ The U.S. practice of throwing stones at others while living in a glass house is a testimony to the double standards and hypocrisy of the United States in dealing with its human rights issues , ” said the Chinese report .
The U.S. State Department report said detention and harassment of dissidents , petitioners , human rights defenders and defense lawyers rose with high - profile events such as the Beijing Olympic Games in August .
Citing details from U.S. newspapers and international rights groups that Beijing often dismisses as biased , the Chinese report described crowded prisons , racial inequality , poverty and gun violence that it said blighted the U.S. record .
In past decades , China ’s ruling Communist Party outright dismissed human rights as an alien and subversive idea .
But now it is trying to persuade its own citizens and the world that Beijing has successfully advanced rights , especially through economic growth .
Washington should “ face its own human rights problems with courage and stop applying double standards to human rights issues , ” said the Chinese report .
The pilots of the US Airways plane that ditched into the Hudson River in New York last month initially thought they could return the crippled plane to LaGuardia Airport or land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey .
But they quickly realized the river was where they were headed .
According to transcripts of air - traffic - control communications with the stricken plane released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration , an unidentified pilot calmly said : " Hit birds .
We lost thrust in both engines .

WebKit now supports styling of the scrollbars in overflow sections , listboxes , dropdown menus and textareas .
For those who want to skip the article and just go right to the source , here is an example .
Here is a screenshot for those not running a recent enough WebKit :
The scrollbar pseudo - element indicates that an object should use a custom scrollbar .
When this pseudo element is present , WebKit will turn off its built - in scrollbar rendering and just use the information provided in CSS .
:: - webkit - scrollbar { width : 13 px ; height : 13 px ; }
The width and height properties on the scrollbar element indicate the width of the vertical scrollbar and the height of the horizontal scrollbar .
Percentages can be specified for these values as well , in which case the scrollbar will consume that percentage of the viewport area .
A scrollbar consists of scrollbar buttons and a track .
The track itself is further subdivided into track pieces and a thumb .
The track pieces represent the areas above and below the thumb .
In addition the scrollbar corner can now be styled , as well as the resizer used by resizable textareas .
Here is a complete list of all the new pseudo - elements .
All of these pseudo - elements must be prefixed with - webkit- .
scrollbar scrollbar - button scrollbar - track scrollbar - track - piece scrollbar - thumb scrollbar - corner resize
Each of these objects can be styled with borders , shadows , background images , and so on to create completely custom scrollbars that will still honor the settings of the operating system as far as button placement and click behavior .
The following pseudo classes have been introduced and can be applied to the pseudo - elements .
: horizontal –
The horizontal pseudo - class applies to any scrollbar pieces that have a horizontal orientation .
:vertical –
The vertical pseudo - class applies to any scrollbar pieces that have a vertical orientation .
: decrement –
The decrement pseudo - class applies to buttons and track pieces .
It indicates whether or not the button or track piece will decrement the view ’s position when used ( e.g. , up on a vertical scrollbar , left on a horizontal scrollbar ) .
: increment –
The increment pseudo - class applies to buttons and track pieces .
It indicates whether or not a button or track piece will increment the view ’s position when used ( e.g. , down on a vertical scrollbar , right on a horizontal scrollbar ) .
: start –
The start pseudo - class applies to buttons and track pieces .
It indicates whether the object is placed before the thumb .
: end –
The end pseudo - class applies to buttons and track pieces .
It indicates whether the object is placed after the thumb .
:double - button –
The double - button pseudo - class applies to buttons and track pieces .
It is used to detect whether a button is part of a pair of buttons that are together at the same end of a scrollbar .
For track pieces it indicates whether the track piece abuts a pair of buttons .
: single - button –
The single - button pseudo - class applies to buttons and track pieces .
It is used to detect whether a button is by itself at the end of a scrollbar .
For track pieces it indicates whether the track piece abuts a singleton button .
: no -button – Applies to track pieces and indicates whether or not the track piece runs to the edge of the scrollbar , i.e. , there is no button at that end of the track .
: corner - present – Applies to all scrollbar pieces and indicates whether or not a scrollbar corner is present .
: window - inactive – Applies to all scrollbar pieces and indicates whether or not the window containing the scrollbar is currently active .
( In recent nightlies , this pseudo - class now applies to ::selection as well .
We plan to extend it to work with any content and to propose it as a new standard pseudo - class . )
In addition the : enabled , : disabled , : hover and : active pseudo - classes also work with scrollbar pieces .
The display property can be set to none in order to hide specific pieces .
Margins are supported along the axis of the scrollbar .
They can be negative ( so that the track can for example be inflated to cover the buttons partially ) .
The linked example above provides a very complex scrollbar that has all of the OS X scrollbar behaviors ( double buttons , an inactive look , track overlapping the buttons , etc. ) as well as many of the Windows Vista scrollbar behaviors ( hover effects , unique pressed looks above and below the track , etc. ) .

The wife of Zimbabwe 's Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has been killed in a car crash in which he was also slightly hurt , party officials say .
Susan Tsvangirai was travelling with her husband south of Harare when their vehicle was in collision with a lorry .
Mr Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) party , formed a unity government with President Robert Mugabe last month .
Mr Mugabe and his wife have visited his former long - term rival in hospital .
Speaking outside the private clinic in Harare , Mr Tsvangirai 's spokesman James Maridadi said of the prime minister : " I saw him .
I spoke to him .
He walked from the vehicle that brought him to hospital , he is fine . "
Morgan and Susan Tsvangirai had been married for 31 years Finance Minister Tendai Biti , a senior MDC official , also told reporters that Mr Tsvangirai was " stable " , adding that doctors would give further details in due course .
State television reported that the prime minister , who will turn 57 next week , had suffered some injuries to his head and neck .
The report quoted police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena as saying that a lorry carrying freight had crossed into the lane in which Mr Tsvangirai 's 4x4 was travelling and had side - swiped his vehicle , causing it to roll over three times .
The prime minister was on his way to his rural home in Buhera , where he planned to hold a weekend rally , when the crash occurred near Beatrice at about 1600 local time ( 1400 GMT ) .
The AFP quoted an MDC minister as saying the driver of the lorry had been asleep at the wheel .
The BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg says that given the fierce rivalry between Zimbabwe 's political parties , there will - inevitably - be speculation about the cause of this crash .
So far , though , officials of Mr Tsvangirai 's MDC party have said nothing to suggest that there may have been foul play , our correspondent says .
All Zimbabwe 's roads are in a poor state of repair , after years of neglect and the collapse of the country 's infrastructure , he adds .
' Source of strength '
The crash comes just two days after Mr Tsvangirai delivered his maiden speech to parliament after being sworn in as prime minister in Zimbabwe 's power - sharing government .
It is a very sad day for me and for all Zimbabweans , whether they be at home or abroad
Thabitha Khumalo
MP for the MDC He and his wife Susan , who married in 1978 , had six children .
Thabitha Khumalo , a member of parliament for the MDC who is in Scotland for an international women 's conference , told the BBC that the loss of Mrs Tsvangirai , whom she had known well , was a " huge blow " for the country .
" It is a very sad day for me and for all Zimbabweans , whether they be at home or abroad .
She was a mother figure for the whole nation , " she said .
" Few people knew about her work .
Whenever they saw her she was accompanying her husband to court or to vote , but very few people knew she played a very crucial role behind closed doors ...
" She was a pillar of strength to [ her husband ] .
In a struggle like his , you need someone to lean on and she was always there for him . "

The BBC's Andrew Harding in Johannesburg says that Mrs Tsvangirai was very discreet and stayed out of the limelight , but was a very important part of her husband 's life .
She was a great source of strength to her husband when in the past he was charged with treason and assaulted for his opposition to Mr Mugabe , and sat through all his treason trial , our correspondent says .
She also made a point of visiting MDC members who were jailed while the party was in opposition , he adds .
Her death comes at a very challenging time for the fledgling power - sharing government , our correspondent says , and will only make matters more complicated .
Mr Tsvangirai still relied on his own security teams and used his own convoys when he travelled , he adds , in a sign that he was not entirely comfortable with the security provided by the new government .
Tense relations
The UK's Foreign Office expressed " deep sadness " at the news of Mrs Tsvangirai 's death .
" We are deeply saddened to hear news of Susan Tsvangirai 's death and we offer our condolences , " a spokeswoman said .
" We are monitoring the situation closely . "
Relations between the MDC and Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party remain tense , with MDC ministerial nominee Roy Bennett still in custody , accused of links to an alleged plot to kill Mr Mugabe .
The MDC says the arrest - which happened on the day MDC ministers joined the power - sharing government - is a political manoeuvre by hard - line supporters of Mr Mugabe to destabilise the unity administration .
A magistrate who ordered the release of Mr Bennett was arrested on Friday .

While not primarily a Functional Programming ( FP ) language , python has long had a modest support for many of the constructs supporting FP .
A while back I was studying Monads and Haskell and was curious to see if some of these constructs were applicable in the problem domains I was working on .
I did run into a block very soon since Haskell / Monads have a support for invoking different functions based on type and that support is important for the way many of the constructs are modeled .
However method overloading is not feasible at a language level in Python , and thus its difficult to create similar constructs .
A month later I ran into this article Tighter Ruby Methods with Functional - style Pattern Matching , Using the Case Gem which again piqued my interest in the same matter .
Thats when I looked at the topic once again and came up with the following similar example ( similar to the one in the blog post referred to ) , to demonstrate constructor overloading .
Note that method overloading is not consistent with duck typing approaches for many .
However many a time we do run into a situation where conditional logic is required based upon types .
As one attempts to bring in a more FP oriented style , I suspect the need for type matching is likely to only increase .
As an example you may have a reference to a stream variable which you need to interpret differently based on the format , say xml or json .
In such case one approach is to have two functions parse_as_xml ( stream ) and parse_as_json ( stream )
What the construct below allows you to do is to have a common function around the two parse ( stream ) which can switch between the two internally .
class X ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , * val ) : # Matcher functions .
These return true or false for the type matching #
Possible enhancement could be to have generic function check_dict = lambda x : isinstance ( x [ 0 ] , dict ) check_sequence = lambda x : hasattr ( x [ 0 ] , ' __iter__ ' ) check_args = lambda x : len ( x ) == 3 # Type specific initialisers def initialise_from_dict ( hash ) : self .
first_name = hash [ ' first_name ' ] self .
last_name = hash [ ' last_name ' ] self .
age = hash [ ' age ' ] def initialise_from_args ( * args ) : self .
first_name = args [ 0 ] self .
last_name = args [ 1 ] self .
age = args [ 2 ] def initialise_from_sequence ( seq ) : self .
first_name = seq [ 0 ] self .
last_name = seq [ 1 ] self .
age = seq [ 2 ] # Matching data .
This is the switching data based on which the appropriate # function is called .
dispatch_data = (( check_dict , initialise_from_dict ) , ( check_sequence , initialise_from_sequence ) , ( check_args , initialise_from_args ) ) #
The switch for check , func in dispatch_data : if check ( val ) : func ( * val ) break def __str__ ( self ) : return " %s %s ( %s ) " % ( self .
first_name , self .
last_name , self .
age ) print X ( ' hello ' , ' world ' , 33 ) print X (( ' greetings ' , ' earthlings ' , 44 ) ) print X ( { ' first_name ' : ' john ' , ' last_name ' : ' doe ' , ' age ' : 45 } )
Essentially it boils down to create a list of function pairs , the first to be executed to check if the second should be performed .
Some of the characteristics of this approach are :
Even thought the example is for constructor overloading , the same could be applied to normal function overloading at both class and module level
No external packages being used
The different functions which serve the same intent are actually packaged as nested functions within the function thats being attempted to be overloaded .
This allows for a cleaner structure .
However that is not a requirement .
The functions can be moved into the top level name space and the only change that will be required in the example above is the necessity to explicitly pass the " self " argument as the first argument .
One of the possible enhancements to this could be to have a generic pattern matching function and make the first argument in each of the items in the matching sequence ( dispatch_data in above case ) be some pattern data which results in the pattern matcher function returning a True or a False .
This is not the only way to overload but I found it amongst the easier and simpler structured approaches .
RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP ) 
The Blackwater name is gone .
So is the focus on the security business that made it famous .
Now the founder who built the private company into one of the world 's most respected — and reviled — defense contractors is stepping aside as its chief executive .
Erik Prince 's decision Monday to relinquish his role as chief executive officer underscored how hard the company now called Xe — pronounced " zee " — is working to bury the Blackwater brand and move its focus further away from the security contracting that severely tarnished its reputation .
Prince appointed a new president and chief operating officer in a management shake - up that he said was part of the company 's " continued reorganization and self - improvement . "
It comes less than a month after changing the company 's name to Xe in an effort at re-branding .
" As many of you know , because we focus on continually improving our business that Xe is in the process of a comprehensive restructuring , " Prince wrote in a note to employees and clients .
" It is with pride in our many accomplishments and confidence in Xe 's future that I announce my resignation as the company 's Chief Executive Officer . "
Although Prince will retain his position as chairman of the company , the company said he is removing himself from the day - to - day operations .
Spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said he plans to spend more time with his family and seven children , adding he plans to open a private - equity venture .
Joseph Yorio , recently a vice president at DHL and a former Army special forces officer , will serve as president , replacing retiring executive Gary Jackson .
Danielle Esposito , who has worked within
Xe for nearly 10 years , will be the new chief operating officer and executive vice president , the company said .
The CEO position remains open .
With an auto parts inheritance , Prince founded Blackwater in 1997 with some of his former Navy SEAL colleagues .
They initially envisioned a world - class training facility to support law enforcement and military .
But after Sept. 11 , the bombing of the USS Cole and the start of the Iraq War , the company developed a large presence in providing private security .
The company 's lucrative contract to protect U.S. diplomats in Iraq comprises about one - third of Xe 's revenues , but the State Department announced it would not rehire the firm after its current contract with the company expires in May .
The company has one other major security contract , details of which are classified , and executives have said it will continue doing such work at the U.S. government 's request .
Prince said in an interview in January that losing the contract would be damaging .
" It would hurt us , " Prince said at the time .
" It would not be a mortal blow , but it would hurt us . "
That said , executives have long bemoaned what the work in Iraq has cost the company .
A 2007 shooting in Nisoor Square involving Blackwater guards drew outrage from politicians in Baghdad and Washington and demands that the company be banned from operating in Iraq .
Late last year , prosecutors charged five of the company 's contractors — but not Blackwater itself — with manslaughter and weapons violations .
In January , Iraqi officials said they would not give the company a license to operate .
Xe has already been expanding into other lines of business .
It has built a fleet of 76 aircraft that it has deployed to such hotspots as West Africa and Afghanistan .
The firm continues to expand training for law enforcement , with a renewed focus on international clients .
Last year , some 25,000 civilians , law enforcement and military personnel were trained by the company .

More than once , I asked myself - why the hell are we doing this ?
Putting on a convention with more than 150 speakers in eight different cities across the United Kingdom at the same time as maintaining an alliance of about 50 organisations , not all of whom loved one another - or us - with the weaving , ducking and diving that entails can be demanding .
You begin to glimpse the morbid addictions that fill the life of the seasoned political campaigner .
You find yourself developing skills of appearing to agree when you do n't , of smiling when irritated , of asking for money without the slightest shame , of reading and sending more emails than is recommended in a lifetime .
Your language deteriorates and by degrees you morph into a version of Alastair Campbell , preoccupied by slights , losing friends fast and living off chocolate biscuits .
But you realise this is what politics or , at any rate , activism , is about - trying to have a direct impact on events and opinion , rather than just observing from the wings .
It is much harder .
You find yourself in the same marketplace as everyone else , desperate for attention and wondering why the broadcast media only want celebrities to explain the great crisis that threatens our free society .
It has been a chastening experience to discover that we were more interesting to Russian TV than BBC Parliament , which dismissed a convention representing all parties with " our strong preference is for events based on debate between two sides of an argument " .
There have been a few disasters .
The worst for me involved historian David Starkey .
On Thursday , Dr Starkey sent an email pulling out of the Convention on Modern Liberty because he had mistaken the time of his lecture - " The Antiquarian Endeavour " - in Stoke - on - Trent .
This was irritating because , at Dr Starkey 's request , Matt Brian of the CML research team had spent a couple of days doing a paper on the origins of the British police .
I sent a less than flattering email to the convention office .
To my mortification , I sent it to Dr Starkey by mistake .
He may forgive me for this rudeness sometime in the next geological age , though I doubt it .
At any rate - my apologies to Dr Starkey .
But there have been many triumphs , not the least of which was getting the convention off the ground .
We started in June when David Davis resigned his seat in parliament and the Rowntree Trusts approached my co-director Anthony Barnett with a proposal to hold some sort of public meeting to discuss the state of liberty in Britain .
The idea was n't to form another civil liberties organisation , but to spark a political movement by laying out an argument and the facts of Labour 's erosion of our constitutional rights .
Our ambitions grew into the cross -party event that took place yesterday , featuring some of the best minds in the country , a true convention that drew from all ages and persuasions and was united by the fear of what Labour is doing , the conviction that politics is somehow not working and that parliament is failing to guarantee the rights and liberties of the people .
It was my idea to call it a convention .
Perhaps , rather grandiosely , I wanted to evoke the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 , where delegates met to address problems in the government of the new United States of America and came away with the US Constitution .
It is now the belief of many that the United Kingdom needs a written constitution and a Bill of Rights to protect the people from a parliament like this one .
Naturally , not many MPs agree but we were pleased to gain the crucial support of two party leaders .
Before David Cameron 's son died he reacted to the convention report on the loss of rights by the University College London Student Human Rights Programme .
" When academics look back on Labour 's time in power , " he said , " the erosion of our historic liberties will surely be one of its most defining , and damning , aspects .
Things we have long thought were part of the fabric of liberty in this country - such as trial by jury , habeas corpus with strict limits on the time that people can be held without charge , the protection of parliament against intrusion by the executive - have been whittled away . "
Nick Clegg said : " We are the most spied - upon country in the developed world , with a million innocent people 's DNA on a criminal database , more surveillance cameras than anywhere in the world , parents snooped on by council officials checking up on where children spend the night , and ceaseless attempts by government to limit our freedom of expression .
That 's why the work of the Convention on Modern Liberty is so important in highlighting the liberties we have lost and inspiring a new alliance in Britain to take our freedoms back . "
If there was one man who kept us going through the eight months of preparation and planning , it was not Cameron or Clegg , but justice secretary Jack Straw , now carving out a historic role for himself as one of the enemies of democracy and civil liberties in the United Kingdom .
Any doubts we had along the way were overwhelmed by his Coroners and Justice Bill , which contains measures that introduce secret inquests and would lift the ban on data sharing between ministries in the Data Protection Act .
In an article for the Guardian last Friday , Straw attacked the convention .
" Despite the claims of a systematic erosion of liberty by those organising this weekend 's Convention on Modern Liberty , my very good constituency office files show no recent correspondence relating to fears about the creation in Britain of a ' police state ' or a ' surveillance society ' . "
Failing to address Dame Stella Rimington 's fears , he went on to claim that Labour " had done more than any government to extend liberties and constrain government " .
And this from a man who stood up in parliament last week to veto the publication of cabinet minutes on the decisions to go to war - no doubt to protect himself - and who has tabled amendments to the Policing and Crime Bill that would give ministers the power to retain data - DNA , CCTV footage etc - for as long as they like , which , among other things , goes against the recent European Court of Human Rights ' judgment about the retention of innocent people 's DNA .
He is , quite simply , without shame , a disgrace to his office and parliament .
But yesterday , I hope , a movement was born and the standard raised against Straw and those who would destroy rights and liberties that have taken 800 years to accumulate .
A Pennsylvania filmmaker sued the state on Wednesday for turning down his business ’s name , I Choose Hell Productions , because state law prohibits names that “ constitute blasphemy , profane cursing or swearing or that profane the Lord ’s name . ”
The filmmaker , George Kalman , contends his free speech rights were violated , as was his right to freedom against the establishment of religion .
“ It struck me when I saw it that the statute seemed like it was from another era , ” said Thomas H. Lee II , who is handling Mr. Kalman ’s lawsuit for the American Civil Liberties Union .
A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State said it had not been served papers and had no comment .
Instructions :
There ’s a black dot in the center .
Stare at the dot till the countdown ends , and the black and white picture should look like it ’s in color until you move your eyes !
I know this has been floating around recently , but this is the first version I found that ’s just an animated gif file
Does a nearly $ 1 trillion economic stimulus bill in the wake of $ 700 billion package that seems to have had little effect sound excessive to you ?
If so , you 're not alone : Two U.S. senators are negotiating to cut $ 88 billion out of the version of the bill that passed the House of Representatives on January 28 .
Sounds reasonable .
Until you take a closer look at the proposed cuts , that is .
Among the biggest losers are science , energy and education .
Huh ?
We may be biased over here at Wired Science , but in our view , science , energy and education should be at the top of the list of stimulus priorities rather than the first to go .
In September , Energy Secretary Steven Chu ( when he was director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory before his cabinet appointment ) told me , " We have an option to be a leader in energy technologies , but we are not because our support system for that is on again off again .
The future wealth of the United States will come from our ability to invent new technologies . "
We wholeheartedly agree with this statement .
Money toward science and technology , particularly alternative energy , would undoubtedly have a positive impact on the economy in the long - term and arguably in the short term as well .
Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Republican Susan Collins of Maine clearly do not agree .
Below is a list of some of the cuts they have asked for .
National Science Foundation : $ 1.4 billion ( 100 % cut )
Department of Energy , Efficiency and Renewable Energy : $ 1 billion ( 38 % cut )
NASA exploration : $ 750 million ( 50 % cut )
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration : $ 427 million ( 35 % cut )
Department of Defense , Alternative Vehicle Tech , Procurement : $ 100 million ( 100 % cut )
Department of Energy Office of Science : $ 100 million ( 100 % )
And taking an even bigger hit is education with a proposed cut of $ 15 billion , the bulk of the funding in the House bill .
And the ability of the states to make up for the short fall will be hamstrung by a proposed $ 40 billion reduction in funding for the State Stabilization Fund .
I do n't get it .
It 's not as if the scientists and teachers are going to spend the money on junkets to Las Vegas and million - dollar bonuses .
They'd be spending it directly on the country 's future .
The senators ' recommendations are especially disappointing after President Barack Obama got our hopes up with so much talk about science and energy .
Let 's hope the proposed cuts are n't a sign of things to come .

Paris Favorites : Eating , Drinking and Shopping
Pin 46 55 Shares
A number of folks consult the site for information about Paris , but it ’s always best to get some second opinions .
So I asked a few friends and in - the - know colleagues about their favorite places around the city , and I ’m happy to share them with you .
Included are links , when available , for complete addresses and additional contact information .
Hours change and places close in Paris without notice so it ’s best to call first before visiting .
For restaurants and wine bars where food is served , reservations are strongly advised .
If there any Paris favorites that you ’d like to share , please feel free to do so in the comments .
I ’d love to hear about them .
Favorite Outdoor Market
“ Paris markets are one of my favorite subjects .
I can go to the same market every day of the year and still always find something new .
I regularly visit the boulevard Raspail market , a “ regular ” market Tuesday and Friday , organic ( and expensive ! ) on Sunday .
The fish merchants there are incredible on all days , and I adore the poultry people at the Tuesday and Friday market .
I love testing one fish market or cheese stand against the other , grading them on each purchase .
For 20 years I lived near the rue Poncelet market and still have a soft spot there , especially for Alléosse cheese and coffee beans from Brûlerie des Ternes . ”
“ When I have time , I also love the President Wilson market on Wednesday and Saturday , where of course one finds the famed produce from Joël Thiebault but also wonderful fish , fresh crêpes , and Lebanese specialties .
The market is near my dentist ’s office so I always schedule a Wednesday morning appointment . ”

Favorite Wine Shop
“ I ’d highly recommend Caves Augé ( 116 , blvd Haussmann , 8th . )
Allegedly the oldest wine shop in Paris , this shop is very strong in “ natural ” wines .
Do n’t be put off by the sometimes prickly staff and be sure to ask for their help since the basement of the store is a wine geek ’s treasure trove .
Also not to miss are the massive producer tastings in the spring and fall that spill–and spit–onto the sidewalk . ”

( Author : A Year of Wine )
Favorite Romantic Restaurant
“ My favorite romantic restaurant is Lapérouse ( 51 , quai des Grands Augustins , 6th . )
It has beautiful historic decor , the food is fabulous without being absurdly expensive ( especially at lunch ) , the service is formal but friendly , and — best of all — you can reserve a very private table for two in one of the “ salons privés ” .
Oh la la ! ”

Favorite Place to Buy Oil
“ For nut oils , my favorite place bar none is the Huilerie Leblanc oil shop on rue Jacob .
Their oils are simply a privilege , in both flavor , texture , and color .
If you are talking about extra virgin olive oil , my favorite place is anywhere I find excellent quality .
In Paris that is often Oliviers & Co. because I like their focus on small producers . ”

Favorite Off - The - Beaten - Path Bakery
“ While researching my favorite off - the - beaten - path bakery in Paris , at Véronique Mauclerc , a delightful boulangerie near the Parc des Buttes Chaumont , I may have found a new favorite which just happens to be even more out of my way .
This temple to organic , whole - grain , wood - fired oven breads has spawned a new boutique on the charming market street that is rue Poncelet , at number # 11 .
Closer inspection reveals that this shop specializes in German and Austrian pastries , the window filled with pretzels , cheesecakes , and rustic fruit - filled tortes . ”
“ The linzer tart is a good afternoon snack , and the flaky strudel makes a great breakfast .
But the cheesecake !
I think I giggled a little bit when the first forkful passed my lips , it ’s that good .
Much lighter in texture than the American cheesecake I ’m accustomed to , it scratched an itch I did n’t even know I had .
While I love the fact that Véronique Mauclerc is woman succeeding and thriving in the male - dominated boulangerie field , I love her bread and Bavarian - style pastries even more . ”
Camille Malmquist , of Croque - Camille : Food Adventures in Paris
Favorite Ethnic Grocer
“ It ’s tough to pick a favorite ethnic place in Paris , more so because of the ambiguity of the word .
I mean , American – as in from les États - Unis – could be defined as ethnic , so let ’s just say non-Western .
While les deux Chinatowns are fairly well known , as well as a few Japanese and Korean grocers , one of my favorite ethnic sources in the city is the Philippine Mini -Mart ( 81 , rue Boissière , 16th ) , just off Place Victor Hugo .
The arrondissement ’s network of Filipino housekeepers , nannies , and drivers steadily stream into the tiny , immaculate storefront for their favorite brands of bagoong guisado ( sautéed shrimp paste ) as well as fresh produce including green mangoes and baby bitter melons .
I always get a sack of locally fried chicharrones – delivered daily – which are huge and crunchy with a fair amount of tender fat still attached . ”
Louisa Chu , of Movable Feast
Favorite Place to Share a Plate of Oysters
“ When a craving for oysters strikes , I head to Huîterie Régis ( 3 , rue de Montfaucon , 6th ) , a compact ( there are only 14 seats when the terrace is closed ) , pristine ( almost everything in it is white ) and friendly place with perfect oysters – they serve just about nothing else – and a small selection of good go - with - oysters wines .
That it ’s in the heart of Saint - Germain des Pres , in view of the covered market and just steps from Pierre Hermé ’s patisserie , makes it not just excellent , but convenient for a quick oyster - break after a day of shopping , sight - seeing or macaron munching . ”

Favorite Candy Shop
“ My favourite candy shop is in the 9th , called A l’Etoile d’Or ( 30 , rue Fontaine , 9th . )
The woman who owns it is wonderful and is has an excellent selection of the best chocolate and candy from all over France .
You can indulge in a caloric tour de France in her shop .
A visit to this shop is great fun and full of delicious surprises .
The owner is charming and her shop with its period floor and counters is highly atmospheric . ”

Favorite Cheese Shop
“ My favorite cheese shop is Fromagerie Chez Virginie ( 54 , rue Damrémont , 18th ) .
This bright and charming cheese shop is owned by a passionate , third generation Maître Fromagère / Affineuse who specializes in raw milk cheeses produced on small farms all over France .
The shop has an impressive and varied selection and is a recommended destination in Paris for any cheese lover . ”
Jennnifer , of Chez LouLou
Favorite Brasserie
“ If the question were , “ Which Parisian brasserie would I miss the most were it to close ? , ” my answer would be La Coupole .
If the question were , “ Which Parisian brasserie would I recommend to visiting relatives ? , ” my response would be Bofinger .
But since I am being asked for my personal favorite and the year is 2009 rather than 1929 , I single out the comparatively young , obscure , smallish and unglamorous Le Chantefable ( 93 , avenue Gambetta , 20th ) for all the wonderful ways it is not like La Coupole and Bofinger . ”
“ In the heart of the bobo 20th , Le Chantefable is not a part of a restaurant group and so its food and service are not formulaic .
Its habitués are creative Parisians who do n’t speak only in the passé composé .
Most are certain their best work is still to come and I feel the same is true of myself when I am slurping oysters and sipping Muscadet beside them . ”
Daniel Young , of Young and Foodish
( Author : The Bistros , Brasseries and Wine Bars of Paris )
Favorite Good - Value Restaurant
“ Au Gout Dujour ( 12 , rue Beaugrenelle , 15th ) , which is closed on Sundays .
With the € 20 menu and € 7 wine pitcher one exits at € 27 for terrific food . ”
John Talbott , of John Talbott ’s Paris
Favorite Parisian Bistro
“ My newest favorite Parisian bistro is Jadis ( 208 , rue de la Croix - Nivert , 15th ) , which is well worth
traveling to a way off the beaten track corner of the 15th to discover .
I am really awed by the intense mixture of technical precision and culinary creativity that young chef Guillaume Delagedeploys in his cooking .
Every meal here is a revelation . ”
Alec Lobrano , of Hungry for Paris and Gourmet
( Author : Hungry for Paris )
Favorite Ice Cream
“ It ’s hard to name just one , but I will name Caramella ( 47 , rue des Martyrs in the 9th ) , “ Le Glacier moderne , ” a pretty ice cream parlor that sells artisanal gelati .
Why ?
Because their stuff is made fresh and on the premises , because they offer a good mix of seasonal classics ( raspberry , lemon , gianduja , yogurt ) and unusual flavors ( PB&J , mojito , spéculoos ) at exactly the right temperature .
Because there are a couple of tables on the wide sidewalk where you can sit if you like , and because it ’s just a few blocks from me and I ’ve waited so long to have a good glacier in my neighborhood .
The one downside is that their opening hours are unpredictable ( in true Parisian style ) , so call ahead ( tél : 01 44 53 09 56 ) if you ’re coming from the other side of town . ”
Clotilde Dusoulier , of Chocolate & Zucchini and Edible Adventures in Paris
( Author : Chocolate & Zucchini and Clotilde ’s Edible Adventures in Paris )
Favorite Restaurant Wine List
“ La Biche au Bois ( 45 , avenue Ledru - Rollin , 12th ) is a restaurant that feels like home .
Traditional dishes executed with generosity .
Clearly one of the best value restaurants in town .
Their wine list is provocatively inexpensive – pure temptation !! ”
Oliver Magny , of O - Château and Stuff Parisians Like
Favorite Cookware Store
“ Kitchen Bazaar ( multiple locations ) , because they ’ve got everything I need , and more .
The store is designed for easy shopping , the staff is generally well - informed and there are always new gadgets to intrigue me . ”
Paule Caillat , of Promenades Gourmandes
Favorite Coffee Spot
“ I find most of the coffee served in Paris cafés undrinkable , so I ’m grateful for the existence of Soluna Café ( 52 , rue de l ’ Hôtel de Ville , 4th ) , otherwise known as the Caféothèque .
Here , they take their coffee so seriously that you can even take part in an hour - long tasting involving vials of scents commonly found in coffee .
It ’s run by a woman from Guatemala , and my favorite beans so far have been from her home country . ”
Rosa Jackson , of Edible Adventures and Edible Paris
( Editor : Time Out Paris Eating & Dining Guide )
Favorite Neighborhood Restaurant
“ Sometimes it ’s fun to travel to “ remote ” areas of Paris to have dinner .
La Veraison ( 64 , rue de la Croix - Nivert , 15th ) is certainly worth the trip .
It ’s casual and small — the one - man kitchen is up front , and you ’ll see the chef cooking as you walk in .
Excellent selection of wines ( the chef will obligingly zip out from behind the stove to help you make a selection ) .
The food is a modern take on traditional French cooking .
The neighborhood is residential and we were the only non-locals dining .
My veal was excellent and the chocolate and creme caramel dessert was fantastic .
Highly recommended . ”
Andy Herbach , of Europe Made Easy
( Author : Eating & Drinking in Paris and The Best of Paris )
Favorite Baguette
“ I did a stage with Arnaud Delmontel ( 39 , rue des Martyrs , 9th and 57 , rue Damrémont ) ) , who won the best baguette in Paris in 2007 , so perhaps I am partial .
But in the relatively recent tradition of baguettes made with a long delayed fermentation , with a crisp exterior , pliable crumb , and pronounced interior holes , his are winners .
If you pine for the mild acidic notes of levain ( sourdough ) , with a slightly more pronounced crust , I ’d direct you to Du Pain et Des Idées ( 34 , rue Yves Toudic , 10th ) , where Christophe Vasseur is making waves . ”
“ And though he has something of a bread empire , the airy , light baguettes with a hint of levain made by Eric Kayser ( multiple locations ) still rank very high .
Finally , outside the realm of baguettes I ’d recommend Véronique Mauclerc , whose exceedingly dark , rustic , wood - fired organic loaves leave a lasting impression . ”
Samuel Fromartz , of Chewswise
( Author : Organic , Inc. )
Favorite Gourmet Store in the Marais
“ It ’s Goumanyat ( 3 , rue Dupuis , 3rd ) , they carry luxury goods for professionals in the hotel industry but sell to individuals , too . ”
Pascal Fonquernie , of Paris Marais
Favorite French Fries
“ My all - time favorites can be found at Café des Musées ( 49 , rue de Turenne , 3rd ) .
They ’re hot , homemade and heavenly : firm , thick , non-greasy , crispy on the outside and flavorful with a melting texture on the inside . ”
( Note : Café des Musées changed owners in the Fall of 2014 . )
Heidi Ellison , of Paris Update
Favorite Vegetarian Restaurant
“ It would be Tieng Hang ( 92 , rue Chemin Vert , 11th ) It ’s an inexpensive Asian vegan restaurant with a vast menu serving faux “ chicken ” , “ beef ” and “ pork ” dishes prepared out of ingredients such as soya protein .
Food is fresh and spicy .
A meaty heaven and yet they did n’t harm a single hair on a poor animal ’s head at this cosy family restaurant . ”
Gideon Ben -Ami , of Paris Talk
Favorite Unusual Dining Experience
“ Drinking a glass ( or three ) of vin naturel makes any Paris dining experience unusual .
That ’s because you never know what you ’re gonna get with these small - batch untreated organic wines .
The flavors are alive – never flat or boring .
With each glass , I feel like I ’m learning something new , as well as sustaining small artisanal producers … how ’s that for justifying a habit ?
My favorite local places to drink vins naturels include Racines , le Baratin , le Chapeau Melon , la Garde Robe , Autour d’un Verre and les Fines Gueules .
These wines are generally not stable enough to ship outside of France , which is all the more incentive to enjoy them while in Paris . ”
Meg Zimbeck , at ParisbyMouth.com
Favorite Café to Write In
“ My favourite café to write in would have to be Café Charlot ( 39 , rue de Bretagne , 3rd . )
Because it looks across the street to the always colourful Marché des Enfants Rouges , because the waiters do n’t mind if you sit on a single espresso over a four - hour period , because its regular clientele of tragically - hip fashionistas from the local quartier makes for fascinating people - watching and because there are plenty of electric plugs for my laptop ( and as an experienced café - hopper , I cannot understate the importance of this last point . ) ”
Bryce Corbett , of Bryce Corbett
( Author : A Town Like Paris )
Favorite 3 - Star Restaurant
“ My favourite three star restaurant– that ’s a difficult question .
First , my favourite restaurant in town today is most probably le Cinq , but it is only two - star .
I think that the two most recommendable three - stars in town are Ledoyen ( 1 , ave Dutuit , 8th ) and l’Arpège , and I would probably tend to emphasize l’Arpège because it is a much , much more festive place .
But Ledoyen in general has better food . ”
“ My favourite three star in Paris used to be Lucas - Carton , and Jamin before that .
I also had some of the best food of my life at l’Ambroisie but I consider the place to be both unreliable and obnoxious .
Ledoyen has that old lady feeling , the smell almost .
I think I ’d have to go for l’Arpège in the current state of things , which is unsatisfactory for me .
La Grande Cascade is also higher on my list than it is in the Michelin . ”

Like everyone , I 'm starting to freak out a little about the state of the economy .
Many of my good friends are out of work — and some of them have been out of work for a longer period than I would have thought possible .
It seems like every day , I pass another closed store or cafe on my way to the office .
And of course , the suggestion file here at Boing Boing is full of stories of the collapsing property bubble in Dubai , the implosion of the South Chinese manufacturing cities , and a million indicators , large and small , of a crisis that is global , deep and worsening .
How do you keep your spirits up ?
I wrote before Christmas that this is the best time in history to have a worst time — the time at which our capacity to do things in a way that 's outside of traditional economics is at its highest .
It 's never been easier to come together to have fun , to make stuff , to change things .
I keep reminding myself of that , but it 's not easy .
My little family is probably OK — we have a diverse set of income sources , from a variety of countries and industries — but nothing 's certain .
In the past two recessions , I was a young kid with bottomless energy and no responsibility .
Now I 'm 37 and responsible for a child , and my boundless energy has been replaced by discipline and systems that let me get more done with less effort .
I lived through the dotcom boom and bust in San Francisco , arriving in 1999 and departing in 2003 , and the two things that stand out for me were 1 ) how fast it fell and how deep the bottom turned out to be and 2 ) how quickly the unthinkable became normal and people started to have fun and do cool stuff even without the stupid amounts of money sloshing around the city , like Whos having Christmas without all the be -Grinched trees and trinkets .
For me , I think it 's the suspense that 's the killer .
What institutions will survive ?
Which ones are already doomed ?
Which of the items in my calendar are likely never to come to pass ?
Will my bank last ?
My favorite cafe ( the one near the kid 's day - care shut suddenly one day with a " Closed for Refurnshment " ( sic ) sign in the window , and now the window is plastered with signs for the second - rate cafe across the street , which gets points for cheekiness , if not coffee ; if you 're reading this , Coffee At Goswell Road baristas , I miss you ! ) ?
The burrito stand in Exmouth Market ?
Will the publisher of that half - finished series of books I love last long enough to finish it ?
And then there 's the environmental question : how bad ?
How fast ?
Will the Thames estuary flood ?
Will the Gulf Stream stall ?
Is it insane to contemplate buying any house at sea level , at any price ?
What are you telling yourself ?
How are you all sleeping at night ?
Are you hedging your bets with canned goods and shotguns , or plans for urban communal farming ?
Are you starting a business ?
Restructuring through bankruptcy ?
Moving back in with your parents ?

The new web service MixTape .me fills a gap left by MuxTape .
You can't upload your own tracks , but you can pull MP3s from all over the web , build a playlist and share it with your friends .
Screenshot : MixTape .
meWe still miss MuxTape .
The popular MP3 - streaming service was shut down by the RIAA last year , and while there have been quite a few similar projects since MuxTape went off the air — OpenTape , the revamped FavTape as well as an RIAA - sanctioned version of MuxTape — nothing we 've seen has been quite as nice as the original .
Until yesterday , when we discovered MixTape.me .
MixTape.me has almost everything you loved about MuxTape .
The core functionality is the same — a slick , simple - to - use interface that makes building and sharing custom playlists of your favorite music dead easy .
MixTape .me also adds some cool extras by mashing up all sorts of musical info from across the web .
Getting started building a customized , shareable playlist with MixTape .me is simple .
Just search for your favorite artists and available songs show up in the results .
Drag the songs you want into the playlist creator and then grab the embed code to post that playlist anywhere you like .
The interface looks just like most popular desktop jukebox apps , so if you 're familiar with iTunes , Songbird or Windows Media Player , you 'll be able to jump right in .
You can't upload tracks from your computer and share them — that 's the biggest difference between MixTape .me and MuxTape — but we had no trouble finding all but the most obscure artists in the site 's search tool .
The service pulls files from around the web .
Quite a few come from SeeqPod ( which has been a record label target , but so far remains functional ) .
The rest come from other public sources like blogs , labels and artist pages .
Also , as we mentioned , MixTape .
me does n't just grab the songs .
It also pulls in tons of outside data so you can discover all sorts of new information while you ’re crafting the perfect mix — artist bios are pulled from last .
fm , there are music videos from YouTube and song lyrics from LyricWiki .
If creating and sharing mixes is n’t for you , MixTape .
me is still useful for exploring and finding new music .
There are dozens of popular playlists created by other users listed on the homepage which you can listen to or embed anywhere you like .
Because each playlist has its own URL , there ’s no need to join the site just to listen — all you need is a URL .
That makes MixTape .me mixes perfect for sharing via Twitter and other microblogging platforms .
If you do end up signing up for the site , MixTape .
me offers some minimal social networking tools of its own .
The most useful tool gives you the ability to follow users whose mixes you enjoy .
Follow somebody and you ’ll be notified whenever they post a new mix .
Now , we know what you ’re thinking — sounds great , but what about the RIAA ?
Well , like FavTape , MixTape .me skirts the major flaw that brought down MuxTape — MixTape .me does not host any of the .mp3 files .
They are pulled in from external , and largely legal , sources .
That ’s no guarantee MixTape .me wo n’t suffer a fate similar to MuxTape .
However , at least for the foreseeable future , it 's a great way to mix , share and discover some new music .
Incidentally , Lifehacker editor Adam Pash is the one behind MixTape.me .
An impressive service to pull off in your spare time , Adam !

d'Espagnat is troubled by the scant attention paid to philosophy of physics Bernard d'Espagnat , a French physicist and philosopher , has won the annual Templeton Prize with a purse of £ 1 m .
The prize honours " an exceptional contribution to affirming life 's spiritual dimension " and has been awarded to scientists and theologians .
Professor d'Espagnat , 87 , worked with great luminaries of quantum physics but went on to address the philosophical questions that the field poses .
The award will be officially presented by the Duke of Edinburgh on 5 May .
The prize is consistently the largest annual award given to an individual .
A professor emeritus from University of Paris Sud , d'Espagnat told BBC News that he would use one - third of the prize money to fund the kind of research he has pursued , and will donate a further third to charity .
Grounded The Templeton Foundation award is largely designed to honour work that finds a common ground between science and religion , with the award going more often to scientists than theologians or philosophers .
Professor d'Espagnat 's scientific pedigree put him at the centre of the growth of quantum mechanics , working with Nobel laureates in the field including Enrico Fermi and Niels Bohr .
But he was troubled by how little the field was addressing the philosophical questions raised by the theory - which for the first time suggested that experiments were not measuring an absolute reality and that the experimenter could influence the result .
While Professor d'Espagnat 's work is not explicitly religious , he aims to delineate what science cannot definitively rule out .
Mystery is not something negative that has to be eliminated
Bernard d'Espagnat
His concept of an ultimate reality - as he terms it , " the ground of things " - is only glimpsed , not explicitly described , by science .
Science , he said , " is aimed not at describing ' reality as it really is ' but at predicting what will be observed in such - and - such circumstances " .
" What science really teaches us is that it 's not with ordinary concepts that we shall ever reach ' the ground of things ' , " he added .
The spiritual , he argues , cannot be ruled out by scientific endeavour .
However , for him , the existence of something inexplicable does not create an uncomfortable sense of mystery .
" Mystery is not something negative that has to be eliminated , " he said .
" On the contrary , it is one of the constitutive elements of being . "

Science is not difficult to explain .
Today we will see how British journalists go out of their way to cherry pick which evidence they cover , and then explain the risks and benefits in what has been shown to be the single most unhelpful way possible .
“ Screening all older men for prostate cancer ‘ could reduce deaths by a fifth ’ ” said the Mail .
“ Prostate cancer hope ” said the Mirror .
Calls for new policies on NHS cancer tests said the Independent .
Prostate cancer screening could cut deaths by 20 % said the Guardian .
Better cancer screening is every man ’s right was the editorial in the Scotsman , where they wound themselves into a froth of indignation .
But was this just British journalists finding something to complain about ?
Because all around the world , people were saying something completely different , on the same day , about the very same academic publication : Prostate Cancer Screening May Not Reduce Deaths said the Washington Post .
Studies cast doubt on leading prostate cancer test said USA Today .
PSA testing may not save your life , after all said Scientific American .
Prostate cancer blood test does little to decrease death rate said the Sydney Morning Herald .
And so on .
Why would the American and the Australian journalists say something completely different to the British ones , about the very same evidence ?
Firstly , our journalists were simply confused .
Not a single newspaper managed to clearly explain the risks and benefits of screening in the trial they were writing about .
It ’s very simple : the study took over 160,000 men between the ages of 55 and 69 and randomly assigned them either to get PSA screening , or to be left alone .
The differences were marginal .
Yes , there were 20 % fewer deaths in the screening group .
What does that mean in terms of real people , in real numbers you can understand , not percentages ?
1410 men would need to be screened to prevent one death .
For each death prevented , 48 people would need to be treated : and prostate cancer treatment has a high risk of very serious side effects like impotence and incontinence .
These figures are not hard to find : they are in the summary of the research paper .
For complex risk decisions like screening , it has been shown in three separate studies that patients , doctors , and NHS purchasing panels make more rational decisions about treatments and screening programmes when they are given the figures as real numbers , as I did above , instead of percentages .
I ’m not saying that PSA screening is either good or bad : I am saying that people deserve the figures in the clearest form possible so they can make their own mind up .
Journalists meanwhile – professional communicators no less – all used impenetrable percentages , called “ relative risk differences ” , or worse .
The piece by the Guardian ’s health correspondent quoted several entirely meaningless numbers .
“ 214 prostate cancer deaths had occurred in the screening group and 326 in the “ control ” group . ”
Without explaining the other numbers in each group , these digits are hardly more than decorative .
It went on : “ The rate of overdiagnosis – defined as diagnosis in men who would not have clinical symptoms during their lifetime – was as high as 50 % among those who were screened . ”
I cannot see how this number helps me understand the risks .
But it gets worse .
British journalists also deliberately ignored one whole half of the research , and I ’ll confess I ’ve slightly lost my sense of humour over this .
There were in fact two large studies on PSA testing published in the New England Journal on the 18th of March 2009 , not one .
They were both published on the same day , in the same journal , they are side by side on the same contents page .
British journalists discussed only one of them : the one that said PSA screening does reduce deaths .
The study they ignored was huge too : it took over 75,000 men and randomly assigned them to either a screening programme , or no screening .
It found no difference in death rates between the two groups at all , and in case you think it was a close thing , in fact , there was a non-significant trend towards more deaths in the screening group .
Not one UK newspaper mentioned this trial .
So newspapers ignore one half of the evidence , and they fail to explain the other half properly .
In the past , nobody could catch them , and nobody could compete with them .
That has now changed .
Anyone can write , and publish online , and appear in Google news alerts : the NHS , medical research charities , individual academics , journals ’ press offices .
These people are intelligent , informed , and they can explain things clearly , without worrying about eyecatching hysteria , or space , or hyperbole .
Some will be silly , some wo n’t be .
If they ignore half the evidence , they will be busted in the comments , mocked , and sensible visitors will never come back .
They can also link directly and transparently to scientific papers , which mainstream media still refuses to do .
Journalists insist that we need professionals to mediate and explain science .
From today ’s story , their self belief seems truly laughable .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Fire consumed a building in Beijing that formed part of Central China Television ’s new headquarters as residents set off fireworks throughout the city to celebrate the Lantern Festival on Monday evening .
Flames 20 - 30 feet high shot out of the building , just north of the landmark CCTV tower designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas .
The flames were reflected in the tower , which itself appeared to be untouched .
“ The upper fifth is on fire , multiple floors .
Debris is falling and flames are coming out in all directions , ” Edie Marshall , a Beijing resident , told Reuters .
The fire began abating just before midnight ( 11:00 a.m. EST ) .
No one appeared to have been in the building , a policeman on the scene said , adding he had no immediate knowledge of any casualties .
Hundreds of people watched and took photos as fire trucks sprayed streams of water on the building .
Armed police moved the onlookers beyond a cordon as paramilitary troops moved in on the building .
The fire department did not immediately comment on the suspected cause of the blaze , which occurred as the city was bombarded with fireworks on the final day of the Lunar New Year holiday .
The destroyed building housed the Mandarin Oriental hotel in eastern Beijing , which was supposed to open in 2009 .
It was also designed to include a theater , recording studios and cinemas , while CCTV ’s main production and broadcasting units were to occupy the main building next door .

Advertisement Call of Duty 4 took three awards at the 2009 British Academy of Film and Television Arts video game ceremony .
The surprise winner of game of the year , the biggest award , was Super Mario Galaxy .
More surprising was the fact that best - selling title GTA IV went home without any awards - despite being nominated in seven separate categories .
Fifteen video Baftas were on offer , with TV presenters Jonathan Ross and Konnie Huq among those presenting .

Of all the other games nominated the only other title to pick up more than one award was Dead Space .
It won Best Use of Audio and Best Original Score .
The shock of the ceremony was Super Mario Galaxy being picked as Game of the Year .
British game makers were represented with Codemasters and Lionhead getting awards for their work on Race Driver : Grid and Fable II respectively .
Film director Steven Spielberg won an award for his work on casual game Boom Blox for the Nintendo Wii .
The Video Game Baftas are given out to recognise " the very best in artistic , creative and technical innovation in video games " .

Have Your Say : Did the right games win at the video game Baftas ?
Bafta has been giving out awards to the games industry since 1998 , although it only became a separate event in 2004 .
39 different games were nominated for an award and the event was hosted by Mock The Week compere and stand - up comedian Dara O'Briain , an avid gamer himself who describes his playing habits as " midway between hardcore and casual " .
The Academy also bestowed a Fellowship award on Nolan Bushnell , founder of Atari and the man who created the first ever mass - market video game , Pong .
The last awards event , in 2007 , caused controversy as some of the nominated titles had not actually been released in the shops and , in some cases , were not even finished .
As a result the 2008 ceremony was delayed until March 2009 to avoid clashing with the Golden Joysticks and to give judges more time with the nominated games .

According to a nationwide study of anonymous online credit card transactions , Americans living in traditionally religious , conservative states consume more online porn than their godless liberal blue state fellow citizens , with Utah leading the way .

Benjamin Edelman , an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School , analyzed anonymous credit card transactions to attempt to find a link between the rise in online porn consumption and division of " red " and " blue " states from a sociological standpoint .
" Do consumption patterns of online adult entertainment reveal two separate Americas , " Edelman writes , " Or is the consumption of online adult entertainment widespread , regardless of legal barriers , potential for embarrassment , and even religious conviction ? "
Ewan Callaway of New Scientist analyses Edelman 's findings , noting that after Edelman factored in population density and broadband usage , Utah was actually the state with the most online porn subscriptions per 1000 broadband users .
Conservative states made up the bulk of the top ten , in terms of porn subscriptions .
As Callaway notes , " Eight of the top 10 pornography consuming states gave their electoral votes to John McCain in last year 's presidential election – Florida and Hawaii were the exceptions .
While six out of the lowest 10 favoured Barack Obama . "

Edelman notes a difference in porn preferences between red states and blue states : " Using individual - level data from a Hitwise sample of ten million anony - mized U.S. Internet users , Tancer ( 2008 ) , ﬁnds that adult escort sites are more popular in " blue " states that voted for Kerry in 2004 , while visitors from the " red "
states that voted for Bush in 2004 are more likely to visit wife - swapping sites , adult webcams , and sites about voyeurism , " a fairly fascinating insight that could surely be explored further .
Church - going porn subscribers also tended to download less porn on Sundays , as church attendance provided a drop in porn usage .
States that banned gay marriage had 11 % more porn subscriptions than states that had not banned gay marriage .
And , as Callaway notes , " States where a majority of residents agreed with the statement " I have old - fashioned values about family and marriage , " bought 3.6 more subscriptions per thousand people than states where a majority disagreed .
A similar difference emerged for the statement " AIDS might be God 's punishment for immoral sexual behaviour . "
Conservative hypocrisy is no surprise : anyone who has watched the Republican party fight off allegations of bathroom sexual encounters , child molestation , and prostitutes has witnessed the " Do As I Say , Not As I Do " philosophy that seems to sweep through the right - wing on a regular basis .
Yet Edelman 's research provides evidence of said hypocrisy ; those who feel it necessary to judge others on their sexual choices and " morality " seem to have no problem accessing pornography , which many religions view as immoral and wrong .
And yet although the red states tend to view porn more often than blue states , Edelman finds that porn is a fairly purple subject , accessed in each state across the nation : " When it comes to adult entertainment , it seems people are more the same than different . "

But the paradigm is flawed .
For a start , cleaning sewage guzzles energy .
Sewage treatment in Britain uses a quarter of the energy generated by the country ’s largest coal - fired power station .
Then there is the nutrient problem : Human excrement is rich in nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium , which is why it has been a good fertilizer for millenniums and until surprisingly recently .
( A 19th - century “ sewage farm ” in Pasadena , Calif. , was renowned for its tasty walnuts . )
But when sewage is dumped in the seas in great quantity , these nutrients can unbalance and sometimes suffocate life , contributing to dead zones ( 405 worldwide and counting , according to a recent study ) .
Sewage , according to the United Nations Environment Program , is the biggest marine pollutant there is .
Wastewater - treatment plants work to extract the nutrients before discharging sewage into water courses , but they ca n’t remove them all .
And there ’s also the urine problem .
Urine , like any liquid , is a headache for wastewater managers , because most sewer systems take water from street drains along with the toilet , shower and kitchen kind .
Population growth is already taxing sewers .
( London ’s great network was built in the late 19th century with 25 percent extra capacity , but a system designed for three million people must now serve more than twice as many . )
When a rainstorm suddenly sends millions of gallons of water into an already overloaded system , the extra must be stored or  if storage is lacking  discharged , untreated , into the nearest river or harbor .
Each week , New York City sends about 800 Olympic - size swimming pools ’ worth of sewage - polluted water into nearby waters because there ’s nowhere else for it to go .
This probably wo n’t kill us , but it ’s not ideal .
Environmental scientists in California have calculated that sewage discharged near 28 Southern California beaches has contributed to up to 1.5 million excess gastrointestinal illnesses , costing as much as $ 51 million in health care .
We can do better .

Urine might be one way forward .
Before engineers scoff into their breakfast , consider that since at least 135,000 urine - diversion toilets are in use in Sweden and that a Swiss aquatic institute did a six - year study of urine separation that found in its favor .
In Sweden , some of the collected urine  which contains 80 percent of the nutrients in excrement  is given to farmers , with little objection .
“ If they can use urine and it ’s cheap , they ’ll use it , ” said Petter Jenssen , a professor at the Agricultural University of Norway .

Jarre collected a career award at the Berlin Film Festival last month French president Nicolas Sarkozy has paid tribute to Oscar - winning film composer Maurice Jarre , who has died in Los Angeles at the age of 84 .
Mr Sarkozy called French - born Jarre , whose credits include Lawrence of Arabia , " a great composer " who produced " majestic and full - bodied works " .
Jarre also won Academy Awards for Dr Zhivago and A Passage To India .
His last public appearance was in February at the Berlin Film Festival , where he won a lifetime award .

' Unforgettable ' Mr Sarkozy added : " By working with some of the greatest filmmakers in the world , he showed that music can be just as important as pictures to make a beautiful and successful film . "
French culture minister Christine Albanel called the composer a " creative , modern musician who showed a perfect mastery of sound " .

" His music provided a counterpoint to the pictures and formed one with the film , " she added .
Jarre rose to prominence relatively late in life , writing his first score for a French short film in 1952 .
His breakthrough came in 1962 when provided the soundtrack for the epic Lawrence of Arabia , for which he was awarded an Oscar .
He went on to compose music for more than 150 films .
A further six Academy Award nominations came Jarre 's way for his scores on other high profile films , including hits like Ghost , Gorillas In The Mist and Witness .
The musician also earned two Bafta Awards , four Golden Globes and a Grammy in a career rich with accolades .
Jarre received his third Oscar in 1985 for A Passage To India
His scores enhanced the work of some of the film industry 's greatest directors - among his collaborators were David Lean , Alfred Hitchcock , John Huston and Luchino Visconti .
He also wrote symphonic music for theatre , ballet and television , including the 1970s mini-series Jesus of Nazareth .
Jarre , who moved to the US in the 1960s , was married four times and is the father of Jean - Michel Jarre , a pioneer of electronic music .
His other son , Kevin , is a screenwriter based in the US .

At the Berlin Film Festival earlier this year , event director Dieter Kosslick paid tribute to Jarre saying : " Film composers often are in the shadows of great directors and acting stars .
" It 's different with Maurice Jarre - the music of Doctor Zhivago , like much of his work , is world - famous and remains unforgettable in cinema history . "

With the Afghan frontier in a near constant state of insurrection , and separatist movements remaining a top concern in Balochistan , the twin provinces of Sindh and Punjab have been the stable , safe part of Pakistan .
That now appears to be a distant memory .
Today , the Pakistani government imposed Section 144 , or emergency rule , on the Sindh Province , matching a move yesterday in Punjab , and placing roughly two thirds of the nation ’s 172 million people under harsh restrictions .
The Punjab edict resulted in mass arrests of opposition members and a ban on all public gatherings .
The Sindh edict has similarly banned public gatherings , and several have already been arrested .
At least one district leader in Sindh has refused the order .
Shahbaz Sharif , who was Chief Minister of Punjab until last month when President Zardari imposed governor ’s rule , today echoed his brother ( former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ) ’s call for people to take to the streets for a revolution .
A massive protest march planned to begin tomorrow is expected to be a major flash point .
The government has threatened to use the army to prevent the march and the planned sit -in to follow .
Many of the rights activists and lawyers who were to lead the march calling for the restoration of judges ousted by former President Pervez Musharraf have been arrested however , leaving the protest movement short on leadership , but with growing popular support organizers say it will continue as planned .
Apparently , Monroe County , New York , the county in which I reside , has " Upstate ’s highest foreclosure rate . "
At least a piece of campaign mail I received a while back says so .
That piece of election propaganda also said , " Predatory lenders brought us to foreclosure and now we ’re bailing them out ? "
Given all the press that " predatory lending " has gotten recently , in light of the fact that legislation  specifically laws like the Community Reinvestment
Act  resulted in many of the supposedly sub - prime mortgages and given that the percentage of people receiving these loans who were black , the issue interests me .
The pejorative term " predatory lending " and how such scary descriptions are used to justify statist protection of black folk also sparked my interest .
According to the more - than - occasionally - correct Wikipedia :
Predatory lending is a pejorative term used to describe practices of some lenders .
There are no legal definitions in the United States for predatory lending , though there are laws against many of the specific practices commonly identified as predatory , and various federal agencies use the term as a catch - all term for many specific illegal activities in the loan industry .
One less contentious definition of the term is " the practice of a lender deceptively convincing borrowers to agree to unfair and abusive loan terms , or systematically violating those terms in ways that make it difficult for the borrower to defend against . "
Other types of lending sometimes also referred to as predatory include payday loans , credit cards or other forms of consumer debt , and overdraft loans , when the interest rates are considered unreasonably high .
Although predatory lenders are most likely to target the less educated , racial minorities and the elderly , victims of predatory lending are represented across all demographics .
I have no real dispute with much of this .
What troubles me , however , is the presumption that the State must protect certain people from taking out a loan that they themselves are seeking in the first place !
I rather think predatory lending is when the taxpayer lends the government money to finance the clean - up of a malady that government policy caused .
( Actually , in that case lending is a bogus description .
That scenario sounds more like theft . )
But maybe I ’m getting ahead of myself .

Steering Committee Election Results
The election to elect the second Scheme Language Steering Committee has concluded .
The following materials are collected here :
The new Steering Committee will therefore be :
NOTE : Clang / LLVM is the system compiler on several platforms in FreeBSD 10.0 and later , and GCC is not installed by default .
Some of the information on this page is out of date , and maintained for historical reference only .
Building FreeBSD with clang / llvm
FreeBSD world and kernel can be built with clang / llvm .
Clang is a compiler built on the LLVM compiler infrastructure .
Both clang and llvm are released under a BSD like license .
Status
Clang has been imported into head and stable / 9 , and is built by default , so there is no need to install the port anymore , unless you want to play with the other tools that llvm provides .
Alternatively , you can set WITH_CLANG_EXTRAS in src.conf , to build most of the additional tools .
An unmodified FreeBSD head and stable / 9 can completely be built by clang !
( Note that you still need to setup /etc/make.conf or /etc/src.conf properly , see below for the details . )
Newer snapshots of clang / llvm are imported regularly into head , and will be merged to stable branches , as appropriate .
FreeBSD 9.0 is the first release to contain clang by default .
All of userland ( plus clang / llvm itself ) and the kernel compiles and runs ok .
The amd64 , i386 , powerpc64 and arm kernels boot multiuser .
ARM works with the current ABI ( OABI ) and ARM EABI .
PowerPC32 kernel needs a patched version of llvm ( not saving FP registers on call func ) .
A buildbot that runs on - commit builds and boot tests can be found here .
Build status amd64 i386 arm OABI arm EABI powerpc powerpc 64 mips mips64 Hello world OK OK OK OK OK OK unknown OK FreeBSD World OK OK OK OK OK , PIC missing OK , asm parser missing unknown unknown GENERIC kernel OK OK OK OK OK ( with patches ) OK missing - mno- abicalls unknown LINT kernel OK OK OK OK unknown unknown missing - mno- abicalls unknown
Please note that cross compiling is not yet supported by clang ( or at least , it is not easy to do out of the box ) .
Quickstart
Checkout head :
# svn co http://svn.freebsd.org/base/head
src
Add the following lines to /etc / make .conf ( if you want to use clang for everything , even ports ) , or /etc /src.conf ( if you want to use clang just for world and kernel ) :
CC=clang CXX=clang ++ CPP=clang-cpp
( NOTE : Do * not* use " clang - E " for CPP , this will not work correctly .
You will almost certainly get RPC - related build errors . )
As of r233419 , head should build without - Werror bailing out the build , e.g. there should be no unexpected warnings .
If you are attempting to build something earlier , or encounter - Werror bailouts anyway , add the following to /etc / make.conf or /etc/src.conf , as appropriate :
# This setting to build world without - Werror : NO_WERROR= #
This setting to build kernel without - Werror : WERROR =
If you are building jails , the following can make life easier by not setting system - immutable flag on various important system files .
This may have serious security implications depending on your use , ( schg / nouchg are explained in chflags ( 1 ) , the jail ( 8 ) man page exlains how jails implement BSD securelevel ) :
# Does not set schg bit on various system files , # useful for building Jails , has security implications .
NO_FSCHG=
Verify that " /usr / bin/clang -v " works :
FreeBSD clang version 3.0 ( tags/ RELEASE_30/final 145349 ) 20111210 Target : x86_64-unknown-freebsd10.0
Thread model : posix
and produces output similar to the above .
Building / installing world ( into a chroot ) .
# make buildworld # make installworld DESTDIR = / usr / obj / clang # chroot / usr / obj / clang / bin / echo Hello clang world !
Hello clang world !
# chroot /usr / obj / clang / bin/tcsh
Building / installing kernel .
# make kernel KERNCONF=GENERIC INSTKERNNAME=clang
Boot it .
OK set module_path= / boot / clang OK boot clang
To update the source tree perform the following steps .
# cd src/ # svn up
Using the static analyzer
On the kernel ( This requires lots of space in the output directory , 406 M when using " scan- build make MODULES_OVERRIDE= " ) .
# cd /sys / {amd64,i386}/conf / # config GENERIC # cd ../ compile/GENERIC/
# make depend # scan - build make MODULES_OVERRIDE= # {firefox , epiphany , konqueror , lynx , less} /tmp/ scan - build - YYYY -MM-DD-N/index.html
On a userland program .
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/ make/
# make cleandir && make obj && make depend # scan - build make # {firefox , epiphany , konqueror , lynx , less} /tmp / scan - build - YYYY -MM-DD-N/index.html
Using the analyzer on vanilla sources
Scanning the FreeBSD sources using the static analyzer requires you to :
# svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm # cd llvm / tools && svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang # cd .. && ./ configure -- enable - optimized && gmake # cp -p tools / clang/tools/scan-build/{ccc-analyzer,scan-build,scanview.css,sorttable.js}
Release + Asserts / bin # ln - sf ccc-analyzer Release + Asserts/bin/c++-analyzer
Now you have all the necessary tools in llvm / Release + Asserts / bin .
They need to be next to each other , as we will be using the full - path to scan - build later and it must find clang - cc , which it searches in it 's own directory and $ PATH .
As $ PATH will be cleansed during buildworld , only the first option remains .
Running the analyzer is now as easy as
# cd /usr / src && / path/to/llvm/Release +Asserts/bin/scan-build
-k make buildworld
Weekly scans of buildworld and buildkernel can be studied at http://scan.freebsd.your.org/freebsd-head.
The rate of false positives is decreasing and LLVM is working actively on fixing them .
You can help by grabbing a report and working out if it 's valid or false positive .
Then send a bug report to either LLVM or FreeBSD and add it to the list below .
Here 's a list of known false positives :
Title Example report Bug Does not track * argv when ' argv += optind ( ) ; ' bin /df step 2 + 5 13974
Impossible path in if / else and if / while Multiple 13426
Patches to FreeBSD :
Title Example report PR Asserts disabled in ncurses lib.ncurses.menu misc/171777
Link Time Optimizations
LLVM supports LTO .
It can be used for kernel build by these pseudo steps :
0 ) build gold and libLLVMgold.so ( see http://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html)
1 ) CFLAGS+=-emit-llvm 2 ) setenv LD " /tmp/ld-new --plugin /tmp/libLLVMgold.so "
3 ) setenv CC clang 4 ) build the kernel
This was tested on i386 .
The resulting kernel does boot .
Automatic test generation with KLEE
KLEE is a symbolic virtual machine built on top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure .
More about KLEE here and paper here .
Building KLEE
# svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm # svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk llvm/tools/clang # svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/klee/trunk klee # cd llvm / # ./ configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable - optimized --enable-targets=host-only -- enable - bindings=none # gmake # gmake install # cd ../ klee/ # ./configure --with-llvm=$PWD/../llvm # gmake LLVMGCC=/usr/local/bin/clang # cp Release + Asserts/bin/* /usr/local/bin/ # cp Release + Asserts/lib/* /usr/local/lib/
Using KLEE

“ Have they not a shred of decency ? ”
Sen .
Joseph McCarthy ’s infamous witch hunt against alleged communists in the U.S. government relied primarily on lies , innuendo , and intimidation .
Then , at a particularly odious hearing , after McCarthy had falsely accused a young Army officer of being a communist agent , Army counsel Joseph Welch turned on the senator and shot back : " At long last , Senator McCarthy , have you not a shred of decency ? "
I am reminded of that moment as I watch the all - too - predictable smear campaign against Charles Freeman ’s appointment as chairman of the National Intelligence Council .
As soon as the appointment was announced , a bevy of allegedly “ pro-Israel ” pundits leapt to attack it , in what The Nation ’s Robert Dreyfuss called a “ thunderous , coordinated assault . ”
Freeman ’s critics were the usual suspects : Jonathan Chait of the New Republic , Michael Goldfarb at the Weekly Standard , Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic , Gabriel Schoenfeld ( writing on the op - ed page of the Wall Street Journal ) , Jonah Goldberg of National Review , Marty Peretz on his New Republic blog , and former AIPAC official Steve Rosen ( yes , the same guy who is now on trial for passing classified U.S. government information to Israel ) .
What was their objection to Freeman ?
Did they think he ’s unpatriotic , not smart enough , or that he lacks sufficient experience ?
Of course not .
Just look at his resume :
Freeman has worked with more than 100 foreign governments in East and South Asia , Africa , Latin America , the Middle East , and both Western and Eastern Europe .
He has served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs , U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs , Deputy Chief of Mission and Chargé d’Affaires in Bangkok and Beijing , Director of Chinese Affairs at U.S. State Department , and Distinguished Fellow at the United States Institute of Peace and the Institute of National Security Studies . "
What unites this narrow band of critics is only one thing : Freeman has dared to utter some rather mild public criticisms of Israeli policy .
That ’s the litmus test that Chait , Goldberg , Goldfarb , Peretz , Schoenfeld et al want to apply to all public servants : thou shalt not criticize Israeli policy nor question America ’s " special relationship " with Israel .
Never mind that this policy of unconditional support has been bad for the United States and unintentionally harmful to Israel as well .
If these pundits and lobbyists had their way , anyone who pointed that fact out would be automatically disqualified from public service .
There are three reasons why the response to Freeman has been so vociferous .
First , these critics undoubtedly hoped they could raise a sufficient stink that Obama and his director of national intelligence , Dennis Blair , might reconsider the appointment .
Or perhaps Freeman might even decide to withdraw his name , because he could n’t take the heat .
Second , even if it was too late to stop Freeman from getting the job , they want to make Obama pay a price for his choice , so that he will think twice about appointing anyone else who might be willing to criticize Israeli policy or the special relationship .
Third , and perhaps most important , attacking Freeman is intended to deter other people in the foreign policy community from speaking out on these matters .
Freeman might be too smart , too senior , and too well - qualified to stop , but there are plenty of younger people eager to rise in the foreign policy establishment and they need to be reminded that their careers could be jeopardized be if they followed in Freeman ’s footsteps and said what they thought .
Raising a stink about Freeman reminds others that it pays to back Israel to the hilt , or at least remain silent , even when it is pursuing policies — like building settlements on the West Bank — that are not in America ’s national interest .
If the issue did n’t have such harmful consequences for the United States , the ironies of this situation would be funny .
A group of amateur strategists who loudly supported the invasion of Iraq are now questioning the strategic judgment of a man who knew that war would be a catastrophic blunder .
A long - time lobbyist for Israel who is now under indictment for espionage is trying to convince us that Freeman — a true patriot — is a bad appointment for an intelligence position .
A journalist ( Jeffrey Goldberg ) whose idea of " public service " was to enlist in the Israeli army is challenging the credentials of a man who devoted decades of his life to service in the U.S. government .
Now that ’s chutzpah .
Fortunately , the screeching of Freeman ’s critics has not worked ; Freeman will be the head of the National Intelligence Council .
In fact , this heavy - handed behavior , with its McCarthy - like overtones , may even backfire , by showing just how obsessesed his critics are with their own narrow - minded vision of U.S. Middle East policy , a vision they expect all other Americans to share .
I would not be surprised if President Obama and other key figures in his administration are angry about these malicious smears , and wisely decide to pay even less attention to these individuals in the future .
And rest assured that the smearing will not end .
It ’s also encouraging that some key members of the pro-Israel community , like M.J. Rosenberg of the Israel Policy Forum , have come to Freeman ’s defense , and influential bloggers like Robert Dreyfuss , Philip Weiss , Richard Silverstein and Matthew Yglesias have also defended Freeman and pointed out what is going on .
The Likudnik wing of the Israel lobby is gradually losing influence , because more and more people understand that its policies are disastrous for both Israel and the United States , and because its repeated efforts to smear people and stifle debate are deeply damaging as well as un-American .
Healthcare is ' a privilege ... not a right ' : GOP lawmaker David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Thursday March 5 , 2009
Print This Email This President Obama is set to convene a summit on reforming healthcare Thursday , and some Republicans are already taking shots .
Rep. Zach Wamp ( Rep - Tenn ) told MSNBC 's Tamron Hall that Obama 's proposed healthcare plans would be a " fast march to socialism " , and that he believes that healthcare is not a right because many choose not to have insurance .
" This is almost class warfare in order for him to be able to say everyone now has health care .
Listen , healthcare is a privilege , " said Wamp .
The MSNBC anchor was almost taken aback by the " privilege " remark and asked Wamp to explain .
" If you have cancer right now do you see it as a privilege to get some treatment ? "
" I was just about to say , for some people it's a right but for everyone frankly it 's not necessarily a right , " he said .
" Half the people uninsured today choose to remain uninsured .
Half of them do n't have any choice , but half of them choose to what 's called ' go naked ' and take the risk of getting sick .
They end up in the emergency room costing you and me a whole lot more money . "
After Wamp finished , Hall came very close to implying that the GOP could n't come up with any viable alternatives .
" As you well know , sir , the administration disputes that , " Hall said talking over Wamp as he loudly accused Obama of seeking to cut medicare benefits to pay for the healthcare plan .
" But what we 're gonna do is let the president speak for himself . "
Hall continued , " I am not speaking for [ President Obama ] , I 'm just more intrigued by who has a right to have healthcare and who does not . "
" We better stand up and defend our system or it's going to go away , " Wamp interjected .
" I think that Americans think that we should have alternatives certainly , and that 's what we want to hear if they 're out there , thank you very much Congressman it 's certainly great to talk to you , " Hall ended the segment .
Wamp is reportedly considering running for governor of Tennessee , despite recently admitting that he was once addicted to cocaine .
Groups supportive of universal healthcare would dispute Wamp 's contention that it is n't a right .
Along with other documents , the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights , signed by all nations seeking UN membership in 1948 , including the US , contains the following article : " Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being of himself and of his family , including food , clothing , housing and medical care and necessary social services , and the right to security in the event of unemployment , sickness , disability , widowhood , old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control . "
An article published late Thursday afternoon by MSNBC included a White House response to some of Wamp 's claims .
Domenico Montanaro reports , " ' If you go around the country , you wont hear many people saying , ' I dont want health care , '' a White House source told MSNBC , adding that the point of todays summit , in fact , is to bring together people with varying views on the issue .
' Now is the time to reform health care , ' the source said , ' No one says , ' We agree with everything . 
We welcome voices from all sides of the spectrum . ' "

After reversing President George W. Bush on several environmental rules in its first month , the Obama administration let stand Friday one of Bush 's last - minute changes :
The gray wolf will be removed from the endangered species list in the Northern Rockies and the western Great Lakes region .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced the decision , saying the finding by the Fish and Wildlife Service under Bush was " a supportable one .
... Scientists have concluded that recovery has occurred . "
The regions together have a population of nearly 5,600 wolves .
He also agreed with the Bush administration 's decision to keep the wolf on the endangered species list in Wyoming , calling that state 's wolf recovery plan insufficient .
But management of the predator will be turned over to state agencies in Montana and Idaho and parts of Washington , Oregon and Utah , in addition to the Great Lakes states of Michigan , Minnesota and Wisconsin .
The delisting of the gray wolf was the latest chapter in an ongoing battle between the federal government and environmental groups , which successfully sued to keep the animal on the endangered list .
Bush 's Interior Department announced the delisting in the final days of his term , and it was n't finalized by the time President Obama took office and froze all pending rule changes .
Salazar 's announcement Friday almost assuredly means environmentalists will sue again to keep the wolf under federal protection , continuing the saga of an animal that rouses fierce debate among ranchers and conservationists in the West .
Wolves once roamed much of North America but dwindled to near - extinction before the administration of President Bill Clinton reintroduced them in Yellowstone National Park .
Populations grew quickly enough that a decade after reintroduction , Bush officials tried to remove the wolf from the endangered list , only to be blocked by the courts .
The announcement by Salazar , who grew up on a ranch in rural Colorado , came after a string of Obama administration moves to freeze or roll back Bush - era environmental decisions .
The Interior Department alone has slowed efforts to increase oil and gas development offshore and in Rocky Mountain shale .
On Tuesday , Obama marked the department 's 160th anniversary by announcing he was overruling a Bush decision to allow federal agencies to determine on their own whether construction projects would harm endangered species .
Obama restored the practice of requiring all agencies to consult with expert biologists about potential impact to protected plants or wildlife .

It ’s a dark rainy night .
Rorschach approaches the barb - wired fence surrounding the Rockefeller Military Research Center and asserts himself through the barrier using a pair of wire - cutters .
He slyly avoids the guards and breaks his way into the facility .
He approaches a large metal door and opens it .
He is immediately flooded with a bright blue light .
“ Good evening , Rorschach , ” booms a loud yet tranquil voice .
We , in the audience , thoroughly unsuspecting , watch in awe as the shot starts at two enormous glowing blue feet and slowly tilts upward .
We travel up the leg , following the enormous proportions of this mysterious huge blue man .
And then there it is .
A big blue radioactive penis .
The camera stops .
We stay staring at the penis .
The dialogue continues .
“ Good evening , Dr. Manhattan , ” Rorschach replies .
We zoom in on the penis a bit .
We hear Laurie Jupiter walk in the room .
“ What are you doing here , Rorschach ? ”
The shot tilts slightly to left , capturing the penis from a different angle , zooming in a little more and back out again .
“ Good evening , Miss Jupiter . ”
We now tilt to the right .
Zoom in and out .
All the ways to watch a glowing blue penis .
Of course this shot is n’t actually in Watchmen , but to hear some people talk , you ’d think that it might as well be .
Now , I ’m not going to deny that there is certainly a good deal of full - frontal shots of the film ’s walking A - bomb character , Dr. Manhattan , played in the film by Billy Crudup .
But I ’d like to think that if you ’re paying any attention to the film at all and are n’t a rabid homophobic or a common household douchebag , then you are n’t likely to be distracted by it and sent into a tantrum .
But is it a necessary plot device ?
Does Dr. Manhattan ’s penis hold the key to this corrupt and evil world ’s ultimate salvation ?
Will he be drowning the world in a Golden Shower of Truth ?
No .
That ’s just silly .
But you ’re out of your mind if you think that the implementation of plot devices is all there is to this movie .
In the world in which this movie exists and for the overall tone and sentiment of the picture , the presentation of Manhattan ’s genitalia is anything but gratuitous .
Friends , there ’s a way of looking at this sort of thing where you might actually think about it rather than simply passing small - minded judgment .
Watchmen is a film that challenges you to think about what it ’s depicting at every turn , and in my exploration of why this damn penis that everyone ’s so up - in - arms about has relevance , I ask you to use this same line of thinking when looking at the movie as a whole .
I forewarn you , however , that SPOILERS lay waiting in yonder paragraphs .
First off , I ’d like to do away with one of the arguments that I ’ve heard a lot of my fellow Supporters of Manhattan ’s Penis ( or SOMPs ) use and that is this : “ Well , he ’s naked in the book , too . ”
While it ’s true , that ’s no justification for it being in a film adaptation , because what if it was gratuitous in the book to begin with ?
( It was n’t , but for argument ’s sake , just go with me here . )
A lot of people seem to be of the mindset that once something from a separate medium is adapted to film , that such an act suddenly makes the source material ’s greatness an undisputable fact .
And this is not true .
Yes friends , “ The Dukes of Hazzard ” is still a stupid fucking TV show and even if the movie had accurately captured its magic , it still would have been a stupid fucking movie based on a stupid fucking TV show .
So , having gone off on a bit of a tangent there , let me simply reiterate that I am throwing that brand of argument out the window because it ’s pretty much worthless .
However , since in the book Manhattan ’s nude form had the same significance and meaning as it does in the film , I ’m not much worried about that line of thinking anyway , because they both work completely .
Now , the Underminers of Manhattan ’s Penis ( or UMPs ) will lead you to believe that Manhattan ’s full - frontal exposure is “ gratuitous ” and “ distracting . ”
Distraction , of course , is subjective , but I ’ll get to that later .
To label it gratuitous , however , is simply just not right .
For one thing , it ’s one of the many products of the transgressive nature of the film .
Everything in Watchmen seeks to give you more from what you expect out of the average American action movie to the point of near discomfort .
Director Zack Snyder knows that a lot of American moviegoers are walking into this film hoping for some good ol ’ fashioned sex and violence , in their traditionally glamorous yet subtle superhero movie moderations , of course .
And then BAM !
Bones are cracked , arms are sawed off , entrails are stuck to ceilings , and cities are nuked .
It ’s not exactly the loud noises , fist - fights , and victim - free explosions that one may have thought they were signing up for .
It ’s as if Snyder were saying “ So you want violence ?
Here !
Here ’s your precious violence ! ”
Snyder is n’t really showing the violence as realistic , but rather keeping things just as stylized as what we ’re used to , only ten times as grim .
It keeps things in the same comic - book universe where we might find a Spider - Man movie but does n’t shy away from the ugly side .
It has a sort of comic book Rashomon effect .
We ’re dealing with similar characters in similar situations , only seeing them in a much harsher light .
And the sex ?
What might have been a quick simple sex scene turns into a joyously over - the - top display , bringing straight to the table the inherent fetishism that would have to be inside of anyone who’d have it in themselves to dress up in costume and fight crime .
Somehow I feel like a normal low - key sex scene between a guy dressed up as an owl and a woman in what ’s clearly a dominatrix outfit just would n’t have worked for this movie .
And Dr. Manhattan ’s penis is just one more element in this film that keeps in with that tone and that notion that this is n’t your average superhero movie .
Sure , Watchmen gives you your precious sex and violence , only you have to take everything else that comes with it .
And friends , you ca n’t have sex without a penis .
A big blue penis .
Besides , I do n’t hear anyone complaining about the constant display of female nudity in today ’s R- rated cinema , so one measly ( blue ) penis really should n’t send us to hell any more quickly than we ’re already getting there .
But more than all that — the tone and the transgressive sentiments of the material — is the significance it has for the character .
Many Watchmen philosophizers will tell you that the display of Manhattan ’s penis is symbolic of his impotence in the face of the world ’s problems , and I can certainly see this as a valid observation .
These same SOMPs have criticized the way the film portrays it , claiming it to be much larger than it is in the book , thus undermining this sentiment .
And while it ’s true that it is larger in the film , I still maintain that a big flaccid dong is capable of being just as impotent as a small flaccid dong .
And why not give the ladies a little something , right ?
( Even if it is kinda… blue and flaccid . )
I think we owe them .
For me , what Manhattan ’s birthday suit represents is the immaculacy and perceived divinity of the character .
There is such a strong emphasis , both in the book and the movie , on Manhattan being regarded by the world as a god , or even perhaps the God , that seeing him constantly in this more pure and true form gives him the aura of a deity , which is so important to the story and its themes .
It ’s this concept that ’s played out to an even greater effect in the film , in light of the altered ending .
After the world is made to think that they have received such vicious attacks by Dr. Manhattan — the super - man they all perceived as a modern - day god — it makes all the more sense than it did even in the book for them to interpret this act as a warning and come to peace .
Manhattan ’s god - like qualities would have been undermined , especially in this version of the story that uses them so well , had someone come by and said to him “ Dude , put some pants on . ”
And finally , returning to the idea that Manhattan ’s floppy manhood is a distraction , I ’ll reiterate what I mentioned above , which is that distraction is something that ’s going to be mostly subjective .
Personally , I was not distracted by it at all .
In fact , before the movie had begun I made a mental note to myself to check out how they went about tackling Manhattan ’s penis .
And when the time came , I forgot to look .
( Too enamored with his pecks ! )
I will concede that , since I ’m very familiar with the book , I went into the film knowing that there would be big blue penis in it and had I not known , I probably would have found it a little jarring when the blue naked guy showed up .
But then I would have quickly gotten over it and re-immersed myself in the fantastic film that was playing out before me .
Sure , the last thing that I want to do is see this movie with an audience that ’s going to giggle like little kids every time he shows up , and I ’m lucky enough to have seen it three times by now and not been with those people yet ( although I ’m sure they ’re out there ) .
God knows I ’ve heard enough about it already from others I ’ve talked to about the film as well as many of the annoying hypocrites within the porn - laden internet community .
A recent post by an UMP that ’s been getting a lot of replies on IMDB ’s Watchmen message board had this to say :
Everyone under 20 giggles and laughs and whispers immature comments to their friends .
Adults squirm uncomfortably as they hope the kids they brought to the movie are n’t staring at it , and dreading the inevitable questions in the minivan on the way home from the movie .
My first issue with this is obviously “ Why the hell did you bring kids to this R - RATED MOVIE ? ” I do n’t expect an answer .
I just shrug and die a little inside .
And why this person did n’t mention the sex scene in this regard , I have no idea .
( And I ’m sure a penis is way more traumatizing to those kids than seeing two dogs chewing on the bones of a dead little girl just minutes before Rorschach slams a butcher ’s knife into the murderer ’s head over and over and over again … Yeah , I ’m sure they ’ll be fine . )
He goes on to say :
Too bad … this movie has some GREAT atmosphere , action and cinematography and could have become a real cult hit .
But right , wrong or indifferent , it just is n’t acceptable to typical American sensibilities to continually display the full monty for no reason , PARTICULARLY in a trivial comic book movie that will inevitably appeal to young people .
Sir , in reiterating my earlier argument , this movie exists to challenge typical American sensibilities , not simply regurgitate them into the same damn thing we ’re force - fed weekly by movies .
And to entirely look past the themes of the story , which come full - force quite strongly at the end , and label the movie as “ trivial ” just goes to show that there ’s something you ’re just not getting .
My UMP friend goes on :
Whoever is responsible for this has basically committed “ indecent exposure ” against the whole audience .
If a guy was in the lobby doing the same thing , he would be arrested , right ?
It should be noted that the onlookers in said lobby knowingly paid to be there because they heard that it was R - Rated Naked Lobby Day at the flicker shows .
Grow up and stop trying to mold everything in the world to fit inside your small - mindedness .
And again , I find it interesting that this guy makes no mention of the nudity in the sex scene .
I assume that the particular nudity of that scene served a purpose for him because of its presense during sex .
Because the only good the human body ever achieved was to give this guy an erection so that he can have sex with his wife and create dopey offspring that he will one day decide to take to this R - rated film when they ’re entirely too young .
And it looks like Manhattan ’s penis just ai n’t doing it for him .
However , by his logic , I guess if there were two people having sex in the lobby , that would probably be kosher .
And if I were to hack someone up with a meat cleaver in the parking lot , that ’d be cool too .
( As long as I had a really really good reason ! )
The UMP finishes by proudly stating that not only did he receive a full refund for every crying orphaned 4 - year - old that he took to the movie , but an apology as well .
This is a big thing with me .
When you pay to go see a movie , the notion that it might be something you ’re not going to like is the risk that you take .
And if you ’re going to get upset because a movie that advertises itself as “ Rated R for strong graphic violence , sexuality , nudity , and language ” contains strong graphic violence , sexuality , nudity , and language , then there ’s just no help for you .
You have no business going to the movies .
Ultimately my thoughts are that if a penis on the screen , making no effort to sing and dance and draw immediate attention to itself , is something that ’s going to offend you , let alone “ distract ” you from an endlessly fascinating and compelling story , then it ’s pretty clear that this movie just was n’t meant for you .
If people ca n’t sit still and watch intelligent movies in intelligent ways and if boobs and explosions are all that matters to anyone anymore then there simply is no hope at all for the future of film .
I ’m shocked that after a 20 - year struggle Watchmen made it to the big screen as intact as it is .
I ’m also shocked that a smart , complex , and powerful comic book film like The Dark Knight managed to become the second - highest - grossing film of all time .
Maybe there is some hope , but part of me just feels like these occurences are flukes .
I have always been a very strong believer in the medium of film as a real art form , and it has produced countless truly powerful works in the past and I believe that Watchmen is another one .
But if “ typical American sensibilities ” are to fly off the rails and demand a refund if an R - rated movie shows a naked blue guy in a nonsexual context ( while never batting an eye at the plethora of female nudity and blood - soaked carnage ) and completely ignoring the urgent and relevant thematic weight of the film , then maybe we really will just all be forced to watch the same movies pushing the same small - minded ideas in the same bland ways , devoid of any real thought or creativity over and over again for the rest of our lives .
It ’s a damn shame .
Removing the Size Header
The Problem
Another Approach
Summary
See Also
The tagged pointer representation described in Xavier Leroy 's ZINC paper is compelling in its simplicity .
Most data manipulated in typical programs is integer or pointer - based in some way , so using a 1 - bit tagged representation allows unboxed integers , resulting in an efficient representation of the most common data types .
I 've never been satisfied with the size header in heap - allocated types though , and the two bits reserved for GC pretty much forces you to use some mark - sweep variant .
Integrating something like age - oriented collection with reference counting for the old generation would require an entirely new word for every block of memory .
This is a prohibitive cost in functional programs .
Reading about BIBOP techniques used in the Streamflow allocator gave me the idea of using page masking to determine the block size .
As in Streamflow , consider an allocator where each page obtained from the OS was partitioned into a list of equally - sized blocks .
Each of these blocks does not need its size stored in an object header , since the size of the block is a property of the page it was allocated from , and we can easily obtain the page address by simply masking the pointer to the block .
So the first block of every page is dedicated to storing the size , and all subsequent blocks are placed in the free list .
This works for structured data allocated in fixed - sized blocks , but unstructured data is dynamic in extent and can span pages .
Unstructured data must also carry the GC header in the first word , even when spanning pages .
However , we know that arrays and strings are the only primitive unstructured data described in ZINC , and they must now both carry their size information as part of the structure .
We can thus easily identify " small " strings and arrays that could fit into a fixed - sized block .
As a possible space optimization , such " small " arrays and strings do n't need to be accompanied by a size field .
We can perform a simple test to distinguish " small " arrays : if the array pointer is more than one word off from a page - aligned address , it is structured data , since unstructured data that spans pages always starts on a page address + GC header size .
We now have a full 24 free bits in the block header , which we can reserve for use by the GC.
24 bits is enough to employ reference counting , or a hybrid mark - sweep for the nursery , reference counting for the old generation as in age - oriented collection .
The GC to employ is now completely at the discretion of the runtime , and can even be changed while the program is running .
There is a downside of course .
Streamflow allocates fixed - sized blocks for sizes ranging from 4 bytes up to 2kB .
Considering the above approach uses the first block to store the block size , we would waste up to 2 kB on the larger block sizes .
We could amortize this cost by allocating more pages and spreading the cost across them , but then we lose the simple page masking .
We could avoid large fixed - sized blocks , maybe cutting them off at 512 bytes , but then we would still need some way to store the size for these " medium - sized " blocks .
We can't simply use a single word of the page to store the size , as we would then have an odd number of bytes to divide into fixed size blocks .
Again , it 's only a problem for larger block sizes .
You can't split 4092 bytes into two 2 kB blocks .
As a general solution to these problems , we can eliminate the size tag on the page entirely by maintaining a sorted array of address ranges and the block size of the range .
When we need to discover the size of a block , we perform a binary search to find the address range the address falls in , and extract the size .
This operation is O ( log n ) , where n is the number of distinct address ranges , ie .
sequences of consecutive pages allocated to the same block size .
I would expect the number of such page regions to be under 50 , so the logarithmic cost should be very low in practice , though the additional indirections accessing the array can be costly due to cache misses .
A block header representation that provides for GC independence would be compelling .
The page - level size header is promising , but clearly has problems .
Hopefully , some clever person will devise a general way to handle the larger fixed sized blocks without wasting too much space .
The solution to the problems with the page - level size header using a binary search is a mixed blessing .
The additional runtime cost in discovering block size may be prohibitive , since it must be performed during GC traversal , and on every free operation .
The costs of free might possibly be amortized somehow when done in bulk , but the cost incurred by GC traversal seems much more challenging to eliminate .

Never Fear , the Feds are On the Case
We live in a world run by simpletons .
In this morning ’s paper is a front - page article describing how Japan “ wasted trillions ” on its various stimulus programs .
The International Herald Tribune :
“ Japan ’s rural areas have been paved over and filled in with roads , dams , and other big infrastructure projects , the legacy of trillions of dollars spent to lift the economy from a severe downturn caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble in the late 1980s . ”
Public spending was so aggressive , it boosted Japan ’s government debt to 180 % of GDP – more than two times the current U.S. level .
But did all that cement buy Japan out of its slump ?
You be the judge .
Housing prices in Japan are now back down to where they were in 1975 – nearly 90 % below the late - ’80s peak .
And stocks ?
The Nikkei index is back down to where it was a quarter century ago .
Stocks sell for half their book value – and they ’re still considered too expensive for beaten - down , hyper - fearful Japanese investors .
The downturn began in 1990 .
Over the following 19 years , it did more property damage than the Great Tokyo Fire of ’ 23 and the Enola Gay combined , wiping out wealth equal to three times the country ’s GDP .
This was despite interest rates at zero…and a heroic effort at Keynesian stimulation .
If America were to follow Japan ’s example , it would have to leave its interest rates near zero for the next decade … and add about $ 10 TRILLION to its public debt .
And if it got the same results , you ’ll be able to sell your house in 2026 for the same price you paid in 1992 .
But the simpletons have no other idea .
“ In a nutshell , ” continues the IHT report , “ Japan ’s experience suggests that infrastructure spending , while a blunt instrument , can help revive a developed economy , say many economists . ”
Are these , perhaps , the same economists who thought America ’s super - consumption , eternal - debt economy would never fail ?
The same economists who thought the bankers were providing a public service , by offering so many people so much credit …and then planting their debt bombs all over the planet ?
The same economists who forecast rising stock prices in 2008 ?
Probably .
The Dow gained 106 points yesterday .
The dollar gained ground too – rising to $ 1.27 to the euro .
And gold rose too… plus $ 12 to $ 914 .
In the United States , jobs are being lost at the rate of 6 million per year .
New jobless claims just rose to a 26 - year high .
Little by little , the word “ depression ” is creeping into the press .
Yesterday , GE ’s top man warned that the downturn could turn into a depression .
And Britain ’s Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , let slip the d-word during a parliamentary session .
The TIMES of London reports :
“ Gordon Brown appeared to acknowledge for the first time today that the world economy was heading for a 1930s - style ‘ depression ’ .
“ Mr Brown stumbled slightly over his words at Commons question time , just a week after admitting that Britain was facing a ‘ deep ’ recession .
“ As the financial gloom deepens , he told the Tory leader David Cameron today : ‘ We should agree , as a world , on a monetary and fiscal stimulus that will take the world out of depression . ’ ”
But not to worry … the simpletons are on the case .
The price tag on Obama ’s emergency plan had risen to nearly $ 1 trillion last time we looked .
The Senate bowed to global scorn and ridicule , taking out many of the “ Buy America ” provisions .
Of course , they did n’t do it as a matter of principle … they do n’t have principles .
Instead , someone must have warned them that if Americans insist on “ buying American ” the Chinese might insist on “ investing Chinese . ”
And then the whole game would be up .
The Ponzi scheme that is U.S. finance requires new money from foreigners in order to pay off the old money that foreigners put in last year and the year before .
The news this morning is that the senators burned the midnight oil …taking out the protectionism and putting in more boondoggles – including a $ 15,000 tax break for people who buy houses .
So , here at The Daily Reckoning , we have no worries .
The feds are on the case .
And they ’re going to spend , spend , spend … until daddy takes the T - bird away !
*** Wait a minute .
The feds are on the case … but have n’t they been on the case for the last 18 months …ever since Bear Stearns went broke ?
And was n’t Tim Geithner right there in the room when they decided to let Lehman Bros .
go broke … while saving AIG ?
Albert Einstein : “ Never expect the people who caused a problem to solve it . ”
And are n’t the feds ’ new plans to save the economy little different from their last plans ?
Bailouts , stimulus , tax breaks , new , looser credit…are n’t these the same things that were used not only for the last 18 months … but in the Great Depression in the ’30 s … and in Japan in the ’90s ?
Have they ever worked ?
Nope .
Never .
Of course , there ’s a good reason they do n’t work .
As we explained yesterday , you ca n’t really buy your way out of a depression .
Because the problem is deeper than that .
The economy is not just taking a rest .
It is dead .
It needs to be restructured , not revived .
And for that , the old structures must be destroyed .
That ’s what Schumpeter ’s ‘ creative destruction ’ is meant to do .
But the feds do n’t appreciate it .
They talk “ change , ” but the only change they want is for things to go back to the way they were .
So , they ’re trying to stop the correction .
And they ’re using every worn - out trick , every blunderbuss weapon and every claptrap theory they can think of .
Bailout the banks … create a ‘ bad bank ’… nationalize the banks … stop the foreclosures … send out checks … lower interest rates … build bridges to nowhere – they ’ll do it all .
But it wo n’t work .
All these measures are designed to encourage consumption … in order to support the old structures .
But more consumption is just what the economy does n’t need .
It is in trouble because people have spent too much .
Now , they have to cut back … and when they do , every enterprise , speculative investment , and household that depended on excess consumption is in trouble .
Ah yes , dear reader … that is where we are .
In trouble .
At the beginning of a depression .
The old structures must be swept away to make way for new ones .
Change !
Can it be stopped ?
Yes we can’t !
“ So , what ’s the solution ? ” asked a colleague this morning , after we explained why the stimulus programs cannot work .
“ The solution to a depression is a depression , ” we replied .
*** Here ’s another idea that wo n’t fly , abolish America ’s central bank , the Federal Reserve .
From our old friend , Dr. Ron Paul :
“ From the Great Depression , to the stagflation of the seventies , to the current economic crisis caused by the housing bubble , every economic downturn suffered by this country over the past century can be traced to Federal Reserve policy .
The Fed has followed a consistent policy of flooding the economy with easy money , leading to a misallocation of resources and an artificial ‘ boom ’ followed by a recession or depression when the Fed - created bubble bursts .
“ With a stable currency , American exporters will no longer be held hostage to an erratic monetary policy .
Stabilizing the currency will also give Americans new incentives to save as they will no longer have to fear inflation eroding their savings .
Those members concerned about increasing America ’s exports or the low rate of savings should be enthusiastic supporters of this legislation .
“ Though the Federal Reserve policy harms the average American , it benefits those in a position to take advantage of the cycles in monetary policy .
The main beneficiaries are those who receive access to artificially inflated money and / or credit before the inflationary effects of the policy impact the entire economy .
Federal Reserve policies also benefit big spending politicians who use the inflated currency created by the Fed to hide the true costs of the welfare - warfare state .
It is time for Congress to put the interests of the American people ahead of special interests and their own appetite for big government .
“ Abolishing the Federal Reserve will allow Congress to reassert its constitutional authority over monetary policy .
The United States Constitution grants to Congress the authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency .
The Constitution does not give Congress the authority to delegate control over monetary policy to a central bank .
Furthermore , the Constitution certainly does not empower the federal government to erode the American standard of living via an inflationary monetary policy .
“ In fact , Congress ’s constitutional mandate regarding monetary policy should only permit currency backed by stable commodities such as silver and gold to be used as legal tender .
Therefore , abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a constitutional system will enable America to return to the type of monetary system envisioned by our nation ’s founders : one where the value of money is consistent because it is tied to a commodity such as gold .
Such a monetary system is the basis of a true free - market economy .
“ In conclusion , Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to stand up for working Americans by putting an end to the manipulation of the money supply which erodes Americans ’ standard of living , enlarges big government , and enriches well - connected elites , by cosponsoring my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve . ”

The Daily Reckoning
The Maddoff ponzi scheme is fraud of the first order .
Billions have been lost , but there is an even bigger and nastier case of fraud out there .
The Independent reports , that some $ 50 billion have been lost in corruption and outright theft in Iraq .
And the culprits seem to be US Army officials .
In what could turn out to be the greatest fraud in US history , American authorities have started to investigate the alleged role of senior military officers in the misuse of $ 125 bn ( £ 88 bn ) in a US - directed effort to reconstruct Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein .
The exact sum missing may never be clear , but a report by the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( SIGIR ) suggests it may exceed $ 50bn , making it an even bigger theft than Bernard Madoff ’s notorious Ponzi scheme .
( read story )
Unlike the Madoff crime story , which affected mostly people who could lose millions and still be wealthy , this crime had more vulnerable victims .
The Iraqi people who are still not having electricity , clean water , functioning hospitals .
And American soldiers , too .
There ’s the shoddy infrastructure they were faced with and there was the anger among Iraqis that helped fuel the civil war which cost so many soldiers ’ lives .
A few made a fortune from their blood .
If I knew how , I ’d create a Bushcrimes Wiki ( if there is n’t any yet ) to keep track of all the misdeeds of your former President ’s administration .
If the Democrats refuse to look , as Paul Jamiol put so aptly in his cartoon , it ’s up to us to create the pressure necessary to get Bush / Cheney tried in a court of law .
The buck ultimately stops at their door .

Print This Email This Minister says notes will show Blair cut off discussion on Iraq war The British government has refused to release minutes of a cabinet meeting held by Prime Minister Tony Blair in the lead - up to the Iraq war , which a former cabinet member says is being done because there was " no discussion " on the merits of invading Iraq .
Former cabinet minister Clare Short , who resigned as the UK's International Development Secretary after the war began , told a UK newspaper for Sunday editions that the minutes have been withheld because there was no conversation about invading Iraq -- and in fact , says she was cut off when trying to bring it up .
Details of two meetings are being withheld : Details of cabinet meetings on Mar. 13 and Mar. 17 , 2003 .
The Iraq war began Mar. 19 , 2003 .
Short says the reason that government is n't publishing minutes of the meetings is not about confidentiality but instead to hide a " scandalous " decision not to discuss the war in the first place .
She says that when the Iraq war decision was brought up , then - Prime Minister Blair said , " That 's it . "
" It is extraordinary when you hear people like [ Blair Foreign Secretary ]
Jack Straw say that the Cabinet minutes cannot be published because you have to preserve Cabinet confidentiality and robust decision - making , " Short told the Daily Mail .
" The bitter irony is that what they are doing is concealing the fact there was no robust decision - making , " Short added .
" The minutes will reveal there was no real Cabinet discussion about the Iraq War .
That is the real scandal . "
Current Prime Minister Gordon Brown is said to have strongly opposed the war .
But , like President Barack Obama , he appears loathe to release the records of his predecessor in a possible effort to enable him to protect his own records in the future .
On Mar. 17 , two days before the Iraq invasion began , Short said that participants received a notice from then - Blair Attorney General Goldsmith , attesting to the legality of the war -- but says there was no subsequent discussion .
" When we arrived , there was a piece of paper in front of each of us , a few paragraphs written by the Attorney General saying the war was legal , there were no problems etc , " she said .
" Lord Goldsmith started reading it out but we said , ' You dont have to , we can read it . '
Then Tony said something like , ' That 's it . '
And that was it . "
" They all said , ' Clare , be quiet , stop , ' " she told the Mail .
" No one else wanted to talk about it .
I was shouted down . "
Short 's doubts about the war were not hers alone , according to the minutes of another meeting in 2002 .
The now - infamous " Downing Street Minutes , " which contained records of a meeting between British intelligence and American officials , contained a striking quip from then - M16 Director Richard Dearlove .
In summary , Dearlove told the meeting , " There was a perceptible shift in attitude .
Military action was now seen as inevitable .
Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
" But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy , " he continued .
" The NSC had no patience with the UN route , and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime 's record .
There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action . "
Short , 63 , was Secretary of State for International Development in the Blair government from 1997 to 2003 .
Currently , she is the Independent member of parliament for Birmingham Ladywood , and has been an MP since 1983 .
She is the author of An Honourable Deception ? : New Labour , Iraq , and the Misuse of Power , written about her experience in government and published in 2004 .

Faced with the continued failure of HIV - targeting microbicides , scientists have devised a radically different approach to preventing transmission of the killer virus : ignoring it .
Instead of aiming at the virus itself , they ’re focusing on the body ’s response to HIV ’s initial attack .
By muting distress signals sent by HIV ’s first cellular victims , researchers hope to prevent the white blood cells on which HIV preys from responding and becoming infected themselves .
This cutting - fuel - to - the - fire approach is highly experimental , and has only been tried with a single compound .
But it prevented infection in four of five macaque monkeys exposed to a close relative of HIV , signifying a potentially new direction in the fruitless search for a microbicide .
" If you can break one of the links in that chain , you can break the influx of target cells the virus needs , " said University of Minnesota microbiologist Ashley Haase , co-developer of the new microbicide , described Wednesday in Nature .
The science is still uncertain , but so is the entire field of anti-HIV
microbicides .
Hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of researchers have yet to produce a substance that , when applied before sex , can reliably prevent transmission of a virus that kills nearly 3 million people every year .
A growing number of scientists think the progression of the disease is driven by inflammation .
Previous research showed that exposure to
SIV — the simian equivalent of HIV — prompts the immune system to summon specialized white blood cells , which are the primary victims of both HIV and SIV .
Once under attack , they call in more white blood cells .
These also fall prey .
The cycle repeats until infection is firmly entrenched .
" We ’re trying to interfere with the host response on which the virus depends to establish infection , " Haase said .
His team previously found that glycerol monolaurate , an FDA - approved antimicrobial compound normally used in soaps and other household products , dampened the inflammato ry response in cell cultures .
Now they ’ve shown the same effect in monkeys .
Whether human immune response to HIV parallels the monkeys ’ response to SIV is unproven , but there are hints that it does :
The same mechanisms can be observed in laboratory cultures of human cells , and high levels of vaginal inflammation are linked to higher HIV infection risks .
" Whether this particular drug would work in humans , nobody knows , " said Leonid Margolis , a National Institutes of Health HIV researcher who was not involved in the study .
But its significance , he said , resides less in these early tests than in signaling a conceptually new approach to microbicides .
Haase ’s team made its microbicide from a mix of glycerol monolaurate and K - Y lubricating gel .
After testing its basic safety on macaques , they treated five monkeys who were then exposed to SIV .
Over the next two weeks , only one of the monkeys became infected .
In an unprotected control group , all five monkeys became infected .
The microbicide did n’t appear to otherwise affect the monkeys , and left their vaginal bacterial flora — important to maintaining an environment hostile to infection — fully intact .
The macaques used by Haase ’s are far from a perfect model for studying HIV treatments , but are considered useful for modeling the disease ’s transmission .
Still , said Haase , more and longer - term research is needed in monkeys before glycerol monolaurate can be tested in humans .
If it has even a small protective effect , " you could combine it with other approaches into a microbicide that targets several things the virus needs , " said Haase .
" Such an approach might be very effective — more effective than the components themselves might be . "
Should glycerol monolaurate itself not work , some other inflammation - dampening compound might do the trick .
" Inflammation is , in my mind , the engine that drives HIV infection , " said Margolis .
Other scientists , however , warn against premature optimism .
Glycerol monolaurate also has surface - tension lowering properties in liquid , which could have directly inactivated the virus independent of any anti-inflammatory effects , said Robin Shattock , an HIV transmission specialist at St. George ’s University of London and chair of the International Partnership for Microbicides .
Another surfactant microbicide candidate , nonoxynol - 9 , showed promise in monkeys but actually increased HIV transmission risk during clinical trials .
Even if glycerol monolaurate worked by reducing inflammation , said Shattock , it ’s unclear whether it could sufficiently reduce real - world inflammation , which is often caused by multiple , sexually transmitted infections , of which HIV is only one .
" Only time will tell whether this is a major breakthrough , or if it is just another flash in the pan , " he said .

Portland joined the ranks of Major League Soccer Friday .
Amid cheers from soccer fans and city officials , MLS Commissioner Don Garber and Portland Timbers and Portland Beavers owner Merritt Paulson announced that Portland has been awarded the league 's 18th team .
The world of the graphic novel is a curious one .
For every masterwork , such as “ Persepolis ” or “ Maus , ” there seem to be shelves of cod mythology and rainy dystopias , patrolled by rock - jawed heroes and their melon - breasted sidekicks .
Fans of the stuff are masonically loyal , prickling with a defensiveness and an ardor that not even Wagnerians can match .
One lord of the genre is a glowering , hairy Englishman named Alan Moore , the coauthor of “ The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ” and “ V for Vendetta . ”
Both of these have been turned into motion pictures ; the first was merely an egregious waste of money , time , and talent , whereas the second was not quite as enjoyable as tripping over barbed wire and falling nose first into a nettle patch .
In each case , the cry from readers was that the movie was doomed by its treacherous departure from the original ; Moore distanced himself from both productions , and he has done so again with the new adaptation of “ Watchmen . ”
The movie was written by David Hayter and Alex Tse , and directed by Zack Snyder , but nowhere do we see the name of Moore .
Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach in Zack Snyder ’s movie .

The bad news about “ Watchmen ” is that it grinds and squelches on for two and a half hours , like a major operation .
The good news is that you do n’t have to stay past the opening credit sequence — easily the highlight of the film .
In contrast to all that follows , it tells its tale briskly , showing how a bunch of crime - fighters formed a secret club known as the Minutemen , who in turn were succeeded by the Watchmen .
This entails a whisk through history from the nineteen - forties to the eighties , with shots of masked figures shaking hands with John F. Kennedy , posing with Andy Warhol , and so forth ; these are staged like Annie Leibovitz setups , and , indeed , just to ram home the in - joke , we later see a Leibovitz look - alike behind a camera .
But must we have “ The Times They Are A - Changin ’ ” in the background ?
How long did it take the producers to arrive at that imaginative choice ?
And was Dylan happy to lend his name to a project from which all tenderness has been excised , and which prefers to paint mankind as a bevy of brutes ?
As far as superheroes go , two ’s company but three or more is a drag , with no single character likely to secure our attention : just ask the X - Men , or the Fantastic Four , or the half - dozen Watchmen we get here .
There is Rorschach ( Jackie Earle Haley ) , a slip of a psychopath , his face often obscured by a bandagelike mask , on which inky patches constantly blot and re-form .
There is Dan ( Patrick Wilson ) , better known as Nite Owl , who keeps his old superhero outfit , rubbery and sharp - eared , locked away in his basement , presumably for fear of being sued for plagiarism by Bruce Wayne .
There is the Comedian , real name Eddie Blake ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan ) , whose tragic end , early in the film , we are invited to mourn , but who gets his revenge by popping up in innumerable flashbacks .
There is Laurie , who goes by the sobriquet of Silk Spectre , as if hoping to become a top - class shampoo ; she is played by Malin Akerman , whose line readings suggest that she is slightly defeated by the pressure of pretending to be one person , let alone two .
Then there is Adrian Veidt ( Matthew Goode ) , who likes to be called Ozymandias .
Goode played Charles Ryder in last year ’s “ Brideshead Revisited , ” and I fear that , even as Ozymandias murders millions from his Antarctic lair , which he does at the climax of “ Watchmen , ” Goode ’s floppy blond locks and swallowed consonants remain those of a young gadabout who might , at worst , twist the leg off his Teddy bear .
Last and hugest is Dr. Manhattan ( Billy Crudup ) , who is buff , buck naked , and blue , like a porn star left overnight in a meat locker .
Whether his fellow - Watchmen have true superpowers , as opposed to a pathological bent for fisticuffs , I never quite worked out , but this guy is the real deal .
He was once a physicist , but , after an unfortunate mishap , he found himself reintegrated as a radioactive being , equipped to peer into the future , nip to Mars for the afternoon , and divide into multiples of himself for nuclear - powered group sex .
I felt sorry for Crudup , a thoughtful actor forced to spout gibberish about the meaning of time and , much worse , to have that lovely shy smile of his wiped by special effects .
Dr. Manhattan is central to Moore ’s chronological conceit , which is that President Nixon ( Robert Wisden ) , having used our blue friend to annihilate the Vietcong , wins the Vietnam War and , by 1985 — the era in which the bulk of the tale takes place — is somehow serving a third term .
“ Watchmen , ” like “ V for Vendetta , ” harbors ambitions of political satire , and , to be fair , it should meet the needs of any leering nineteen - year - old who believes that America is ruled by the military - industrial complex , and whose deepest fear — deeper even than that of meeting a woman who requests intelligent conversation — is that the Warren Commission may have been right all along .
The problem is that Snyder , following Moore , is so insanely aroused by the look of vengeance , and by the stylized application of physical power , that the film ends up twice as fascistic as the forces it wishes to lampoon .
The result is perfectly calibrated for its target group : nobody over twenty - five could take any joy from the savagery that is fleshed out onscreen , just as nobody under eighteen should be allowed to witness it .
You want to see Rorschach swing a meat cleaver repeatedly into the skull of a pedophile , and two dogs wrestle over the leg bone of his young victim ?
Go ahead .
You want to see the attempted rape of a superwoman , her bright latex costume cast aside and her head banged against the baize of a pool table ?
The assault is there in Moore ’s book , one panel of which homes in on the blood that leaps from her punched mouth , but the pool table is Snyder ’s own embroidery .
You want to hear Moore ’s attempt at urban jeremiad ?
“ This awful city , it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children . ”
That line from the book may be meant as a punky retread of James Ellroy , but it sounds to me like a writer trying much , much too hard ; either way , it makes it directly into the movie , as one of Rorschach ’s voice - overs .
( And still the adaptation wo n’t be slavish enough for some . )
Amid these pompous grabs at horror , neither author nor director has much grasp of what genuine , unhyped suffering might be like , or what pity should attend it ; they are too busy fussing over the fate of the human race — a sure sign of metaphysical vulgarity — to be bothered with lesser plights .
In the end , with a gaping pit where New York used to be , most of the surviving Watchmen agree that the loss of the Eastern Seaboard was a small price to pay for global peace .
Incoherent , overblown , and grimy with misogyny , “ Watchmen ” marks the final demolition of the comic strip , and it leaves you wondering : where did the comedy go ?
At first blush , “ Leave Her to Heaven ” has no firmer purchase than “ Watchmen ” does on emotional truth .
Released in 1945 , John M. Stahl ’s melodrama is showing at Film Forum , in a restored print .
A vampiric beauty named Ellen ( Gene Tierney ) gets her talons into Harland , a vulnerable writer ( Cornel Wilde ) , and refuses to let go .
In the process , she lets his disabled brother drown , and aborts Harland ’s child by toppling down the stairs .
Catch it on TV and you will find yourself complaining , “ Please .
No one behaves like that . ”
But there ’s the rub .
Movies like Stahl ’s were not made for TV .
Their purpose unfolds only on the big screen , where the blue - velvet skies and the lethally smooth waters of “ Leave Her to Heaven ” acquire the unquestioned clarity of a fever dream .
A scornful James Agee , reviewing it at the time , said that the story might have been “ plausible enough in a dramatically lighted black - and - white picture ” ; but plausibility is not the issue , and color is the lifeblood of the film .
When Harland , fresh off a train from the East , wanders out into the New Mexico night , still wearing a dark city suit , we find ourselves at the border where noir and Western meet .
As for the brother ’s death , with Ellen looking on coolly in white robe and shades , it remains one of the most perturbing in the history of Hollywood , far scarier than anything in “ Watchmen ” ; where Snyder employs the latest tools of computer - generated imagery to jack up the foulness of his violence , and thereby renders it more absurd , Stahl takes the trouble to feel his way into the implications of three - strip Technicolor , and thus into the more vivid hues of the heart .
First used for a full - length movie ( Rouben Mamoulian ’s “ Becky Sharp ” ) a decade earlier , and brought to blooming fruition in “ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ” and “ The Wizard of Oz , ” the new technology reached its astounding apogee in the lips of Gene Tierney , as red as a witch ’s apple .
Each frame of her seems to be hand - tinted , as if she had ordered it .
Her soft voice dies to a low whisper at the close of every phrase .
“ I do n’t want anybody else to do anything for you , ” she tells her husband .
And with that , the great conservative promise of postwar domesticity — the man , newly arrived or returned , waited upon by his woman — tightens into a threat . ♦
Calling Star Wars popular is an understatement .
It ’s one of the biggest films of all - time , while also becoming the rare franchise to build a very large and devout following .
It ’s spawned six films , countless books , a few tv spin - offs , video games , cartoons , action figures , and countless other media and collectibles .
And despite George Lucas ’ best efforts , it remains popular all these years later .
If you were to ask fans who their favorite character is , the most common choices would be Darth Vader or the “ I shot Greedo first ” Han Solo .
If you limit the selection to characters new to the prequel trilogy , Darth Maul ’s name comes up often .
I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to say that the Sith Lords in general are considered the ultimate of cool among Star Wars characters .
Vader was a bad ass in the original trilogy , choking the life out of anyone who displeased him complete with James Earl Jones ’ imposing voice .
And he had great theme music , the Imperial March .
Then Episode 1 rolls around with Darth Maul and his double bladed lightsaber .
He stole the show in that movie ( not hard when your competition is a mini- Anakin and Jar Jar Binks ) even though he ’s barely on screen .
But how much do you really know about these dark lords ?
Unless you dress up like a Stormtrooper every Halloween or worship the ground that Mark Hamill walks on , your knowledge of anything Star Wars probably derives solely from the motion pictures .
But beyond the films is a whole Universe of information , ranging from books to cartoons .
These other sources help supplement the original material and form and even more in - depth look at a galaxy long ago and far , far away .
Examining the Sith is no easy task .
Their history is long and complex , spanning tens of thousands of years .
And really , we do n’t want to go into that kind of detail .
However , you might remember this exchange concerning the Sith from Episode 1 :
Yoda :
Always two there are , no more , no less .
A master and an apprentice .
Mace Windu :
But which was destroyed , the master or the apprentice ?
This brings up the Rule of Two in the Sith Order .
The idea that at any time , there are only two Sith Lords in existence .
That should make tracing their lineage somewhat easier , much like the chronology of kings and queens of Russia or France .
It ’s this segment of Sith Lord history that I wish to examine .
Who were the Sith Lords before Darth Vader ?
How far back can we trace the line ?
One problem with that logic is that the Sith did n’t always operate under the Rule of Two .
A little history is needed before the doctrine comes into play .
The Sith initially started as a humanoid species that was Force - sensitive , with their home on the planet Korriban .
A warlord named Adas managed to briefly unite the inhabitants and a culture formed .
Think of him as an ancient Genghis Khan .
This cohesion would not last , however , foreshadowing the tension that would always exist between followers of the Sith philosophy .
Sith itself became more of a religion , and the term evolved to describe those dedicated to the ancient Sith philosophy , not the people of Korriban .
Many schisms would occur among its followers , leading some to follow the Dark Side and others the Light Side of the Force .
Those on the dark side would become known as Dark Jedis , a term that soon became synonymous with Sith .
It also led to the first use of the title Dark Lord of the Sith , a title bestowed upon the Sith leader .
As the terms Dark Jedi and Sith merged into one , a Sith Order was formed representing the sect of the dark side of the Force .
In a classic tale of good an evil , the Sith became known for being bent on destroying the Jedi .
Over the years , the Sith spent much of their time battling with the Republic or biding their time in anticipation of their next strike .
One of the more famous names in Sith lore is Darth Revan .
Here ’s an amazingly in - depth article on him and his history .
The Sith were constantly fighting the Jedis of the Republic , but often found themselves on the losing end of the skirmishes .
But while the Sith often were defeated , their battles often hurt the strength of the Jedi Order as well .
This would led to certain Jedis falling to the dark side and renewed conflicts .
It was n’t all defeat , however , as at one point the Siths conquered most of known space .
But the Sith nearly proved to be their own undoing as they turned on each other , all but destroying their order .
After the Great Sith War , only one Sith Lord survived : Darth Bane .
To guard against the Sith destroying themselves or losing sight of their “ ideals ” once again , Bane took only one apprentice , restarting the tradition of the one master , one apprentice and that of passing the name Darth to each of his successors .
Thus starts the Rule of Two in the Order of the Sith , a doctrine which ushered in a new age of secrecy .
Here is the known history of the Sith Lords under the Rule of Two from Darth Bane to Darth Vader in chronological order :
Darth Bane
Born Dessel , he was raised as a poor miner on the Outer Rim planet Apatros .
After killing a Galactic Republic ensign , he was sought by the authorities .
On the run from the Republic , he was recognized as a Force - sensitive , and taken to the Sith Academy on Korriban .
He studied there for a time , quickly becoming one of the best students .
He was taught the ways of the Sith under the existing masters , and on his own initiative frequented the archives in the academy to learn more about the Dark Side and the history of the Sith .
He quickly realized true power came from knowledge , and to that end he devoted much of his life locating and studying the ancient teachings of the Sith .
These actions were something that was discouraged by the current Sith Masters who emphasized their teachings , rather than continuity to the ancient Sith .
Bane , as he was now known , would lose confidence in the Siths and its leader , Kaan .
He deserted the order for a time , studied the holocron of Darth Revan , and , armed with new knowledge , helped destroy the existing Siths at the sixth battle of Ruusan .
This allowed him to create his own Sith Order where he promulgated a harsh new directive , the Rule of Two to avoid the infighting that had plagued the Sith for millennia .
As he later stated to his apprentice Zannah , “ There are no other Sith .
There never will be , except for us .
One Master and one apprentice ; one to embody the power , the other to crave it . ”
Bane also began the teachings of patience , planning , and secrecy , and each Sith was to take on the title of Darth , a tradition that had dated back to the time before the Jedi Civil War .
Master : Various , before the Rule of Two
Apprentice : Darth Zannah
Fate : Unknown , probably killed by Darth Zannah or possibly the Jedi .
Darth Zannah
Known in her youth as Rain , Darth Zannah was born on the planet Somov Rit .
She was one of many children recruited by the Jedi to the Army of Light in order to fight the Sith .
However , she was presumed dead when she fell out of the starship that was carrying her .
She survived the fall and was rescued by the Bouncer Laa , whom she befriended .
Rain was one of the few survivors of the sixth battle of Ruusan , but soon turned to the dark side when Laa was haplessly killed by two Jedi .
Overcome with with grief , Rain lashed out and killed the Jedi .
Shortly after , she was found by Darth Bane who decided to make the young girl his apprentice in his his fledgling Order of the Sith Lords .
She once stated of her master , “ I am Darth Zannah , apprentice of Darth Bane , Dark Lord of the Sith .
And one day I will destroy my Master and choose an apprentice of my own , continuing the legacy of the dark side . ”
Master : Darth Bane
Apprentice : Unknown
Fate : Unknown
Darth Cognus
The timeline is murky between Darths Zannah and Cognus , but we know Cognus was a female Sith Master , or Dark Lady of the Sith , of the Iktotchi species that descended in the Sith lineage from Darth Zannah .
Precognition is a natural ability of her species , and her name is probably an allusion to that .
She took on an apprentice by the name of Darth Millennial , but he abandoned her teachings and she eventually took another apprentice as a replacement .
Or you could say that Cognus .
angered by the beliefs of her apprentice , drove him away .
Either way , in her mercy , she allowed Millennial to live .
Master : Unknown , somewhere down the line from Darth Zannah
Apprentice : Darth Millennial , another
Fate : Unknown
Darth Millennial
Millennial was a three - eyed mutant trained as an apprentice under Darth Cognus .
He proved to be a talented user of the Force , but often disagreed on many aspects of the Sith with his master , Darth Cognus .
She was firmly entrenched in Bane ’s philosophies , including the rule that only two Sith Lords would exist at any one time .
He was in disagreement with that principle , instead believing that there should be many Sith , with the leader being whomever was the strongest at any one time .
A true Darwinist , he insisted it was natural for the strong to rule over the weak .
Millennial eventually split from his Cognus and fled to the remote planet of Dromund Kaas , where he sought refuge from his Master ’s wrath .
He started his own Sith tradition , the Prophets of the Dark Side , while his ideas were codified into the Dark Force religion .
You might remember a line from The Phantom Menace , wherein a shocked Jedi Council member asserts that , “ The Sith have been extinct for over a millennium ! ” Darth Millennial is believed to have become a Sith close to the time the Sith were believed to have become extinct , making his name literally prophetic .
Master : Darth Cognus
Apprentice : None
Fate : Millennial became the Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side as founder of a religion outside the Order of the Sith .
Darth Vectivus
There again is a gap between Darth Cognus and where Darth Vectivus fits he .
Known as a shrewd but fair business man , he got his start as the administrator of a mine on an asteroid near Bimmiel .
I guess not every Sith can be as evil as Sidious , Vader , or Bane , although these days corporate businessmen seem pretty evil themselves .
The inherent dark side energies of the asteroid had been enhanced and as someone Force - sensitive , Vectivus could feel the energy held in the asteroid .
He began to study it , performed experiments , and started to acquire new powers .
After the dark side energies slowly began to drive his mining crews insane and the grade of the ore began to decline , Vectivus shut down the mine .
He departed to seek out the Sith and years later returned as a a full - fledged Sith Lord .
As a Sith , he was known as a master of long - distance manipulation .
Master : Unknown
Apprentice : Unknown
Fate :
He lived out the rest of his days surrounded by friends and family on the asteroid .
Darth Plagueis
Also known as Darth Plagueis the Wise , he was a Muun and a very powerful Sith Master , although little was known of his origins .
He was obsessed and spent an enormous amount of time trying to cheat death and create new life from the midi-chlorians that influence the Force .
He did manage to learn how to use the Dark Side to control the midi-chlorians , even how to manipulate the Force to extend his own life .
It is unknown how long Darth Plagueis lived , but he did not cheat death forever .
Despite his great power and discoveries with the Force , his most infamous action came when he took Palpatine as his apprentice and named him Darth Sidious , although no one is sure how he came to train Palpatine .
Master : Unknown
Apprentice : Darth Sidious
Fate : Sidious , concerned with being replaced as Plagueis ’ apprentice , eventually killed him in his sleep .
As Palpatine said to Anakin Skywalker , “ He became so powerful , the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power , which eventually , of course , he did .
Unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew .
Then , his apprentice killed him in his sleep . ”
Darth Sidious
We have now reached the part of the timeline which the movies cover .
Palpatine , aka Darth Sidious , was the last Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and after he engineered its collapse , the first Emperor of the Galactic Empire .
He was able to take control of the galaxy and bring about an age of the Sith by finally triumphing over the Jedi .
For these feats , many consider him to be the most powerful Sith Lord who ever existed .
He was a calculating man with foreknowledge of the future that slowly built his dark empire .
He was able to establish his Empire by concocting a complex master plan , which involved starting the Clone Wars , a galaxy - wide conflict that cost billions of sentient lives .
A native of the planet Naboo , Palpatine worked his way up in politics to become that sector ’s senator in the Galactic Senate , gaining political support along the way .
Unbeknownst to everyone , Palpatine also learned the ways of the Dark Side of the Force and became a Sith Lord .
He orchestrated the Invasion of Naboo to win election as Chancellor , replacing then Chancellor Valorum with a no-confidence vote .
Now Supreme Chancellor , he utilized Darth Tyranus to start the Clone Wars .
Palpatine himself headed both factions of the War , the Galactic Republic as Chancellor and the Confederacy of Independent Systems through Darth Tyranus .
This allowed him to prolong the conflict in order to gain more executive powers from the Senate .
He played both sides to gain all the power he could , and when his power as Chancellor had reached its dictatorial peak , Palpatine abolished the Republic and replaced it with the first Galactic Empire with himself as leader .
As the Clone Wars ended , Palpatine fabricated a Jedi plot to overthrow the Republic , and instigated the great Jedi Purge that all but wiped out the Jedi order .
Taking Darth Vader as his apprentice , he ruled the galaxy through fear , later disbanding the Galactic Senate all together .
It would take many years before a rebellion was organized and strong enough to rise against him .
Sidious was always planning ahead and scheming .
As an apprentice of Darth Plagueis , he began training his own apprentice , Darth Maul , without Plagueis ’ knowledge .
He may have trained other apprentices before Maul as well .
But Sidious was no fool , he would not kill his master until he understood the lessons of Plagueis and had become powerful enough to defeat him .
Although known for his scheming and great foresight , Sidious was a plenty good fighter as well :
and against Yoda …
Master : Darth Plagueis
Apprentice : Darth Maul , Darth Tyranus , Darth Vader
Fate :
He was killed by his former Sith apprentice , Darth Vader , who dropped him down a reactor shaft during the Battle of Endor .
Darth Maul
Darth Maul was a Zabrak born on Iridonia , the home planet of his species .
Much of his early life is unknown , including his real name , but it is known that his Master , Darth Sidious , took him from his family at a very early age to be trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force .
His training was complete when he was willing to kill his own Master in a duel .
It has been said that he was forged by the hateful energies of the dark side to ensure the victory of the Sith over the Jedi .
Simply put , Maul was a creature of pure evil , having no personality beyond his ultimate devotion to his Master .
And his life goal was a simple and singular one , to exact vengeance upon the Jedi .
He is a key character in the Invasion of Naboo that takes place in Episode 1 when the Sith reveal themselves after their disappearance from the galaxy for the last millennium .
The goal of the Invasion was to get Sidious , as Senator Palpatine , elected Supreme Chancellor of the Republic .
Maul scouted the galaxy for the missing Queen Amidala before returning to Naboo for a battle against Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi .
Though he killed the Jedi Master , he underestimated Kenobi ’s skill , and was slain by the Padawan .
Here ’s some video of his undeniable skill :
Maul was a master of Juyo , Jar ’Kai , and Teräs Käsi , and chose to use a red double - bladed lightsaber for combat .
Master : Darth Sidious
Apprentice : None
Fate : Cleaved in half by Obi-Wan Kenobi on Naboo .
Darth Tyranus
Following the death of Darth Maul , Lord Sidious sought out another apprentice .
With time of the essence , he was unable to train a new apprentice from birth , so he turned to the Jedi ranks .
Dooku was a powerful , yet unsatisfied Jedi Master that had grown unsettled with the restrictions the Jedi put on the studies of the Force .
Additionally , he was unsastified how the Jedi became entangled with politicians .
After nearly seventy years as a Jedi , a disastrous battle on Galidraan shook Dooku ’s faith in the Jedi and the Galactic Republic and he fell under the influence of Senator Palpatine , leaving the Jedi Order .
The heir to vast wealth and the noble title of Count on the planet Serenno , Dooku reclaimed his birthright and his vast fortune .
After learning that Senator Palpatine was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious , he turned to the dark side and became a Dark Lord of the Sith himself .
As Sidious ’s new apprentice , he was given the Sith name Darth Tyranus .
He conspired with Sidious to force the galaxy into a war that would bring the Sith to power .
He forged ties between corporations and planets discontented with the Republic , and became the leader of the Separatist movement that coalesced into the Confederacy of Independent Systems .
Thousands of star systems flocked to Dooku ’s banner and seceded from the Galactic Republic .
On Geonosis , the first battle of the Clone Wars broke out and Tyranus was confronted by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker .
As a Jedi , Dooku became a respected instructor in the Jedi Temple and more importantly one of the most renowned swordsmen in the galaxy .
Dooku had even trained Obi-Wan ’s master , Qui-Gon Jinn , as a Padawan .
He bettered the duo before Jedi Master Yoda interrupted him .
Here ’s the Sith Lord in action :
Master : Darth Sidious
Apprentice : None
Fate : Executed by Anakin Skywalker at the instigation of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine .
Such is the way of the Sith .
Darth Vader
Believed to have been conceived by midi-chlorians , Anakin Skywalker was born to Shmi Skywalker with no known father .
At age three he moved to Tatooine where he and his mother fell under the domain of the Hutts .
Anakin would win his freedom by capturing the famed Boonta Eve Pod Race , and quickly showed to be Force - sensitive .
In fact , it has been said he had the most potential of any Jedi or Sith .
Trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ways of the Light Side of the Force , he soon became good friends with Chancellor Palpatine , who was almost like a second Master for him .
His first obvious step towards the Dark Side came when he slaughtered an entire camp of Tusken Raiders over the death of his mother .
Anakin also engaged in a forbidden love with the former Queen Amidala , and he and Padme were married soon after the start of the Clone Wars .
Throughout it all , Anakin continued to carry with him a great sense of loss in addition to great anger .
He killed Count Dooku in cold blood at Palpatine ’s insistence , taking another step towards the Dark Side .
He had a vision that foresaw that Padme would die in childbirth , and became preoccupied with trying to save her .
His inability to control all these traits led to his downfall when he turned to the Dark Side .
Sadly , his fall to the Dark Side ultimately drove off the one thing he most loved in the galaxy , Padme .
Apprenticing to Darth Sidious , he became Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire was founded with Palpatine at the helm .
Vader was the Emperor ’s right hand man , constantly on the move and traveling throughout the galaxy to defeat rebel uprisings or arrest corrupt Imperials .
As a master of the Dark Side , Vader became the scourge of the Jedi , as the warriors were exterminated in the Great Jedi Purge , with only a few surviving .
In a vicious lightsaber duel on Mustafar between him and his former Master Obi-Wan , Anakin was horribly wounded and burned , which is why he wears the trademark protective black armor and breath mask .
Padme did give birth to twins , Luke and Leia , although Vader remained unaware of their existence .
It was only after Luke destroyed the first Death Star that Vader knew he survived .
Initially , he fought the Rebel Alliance while concocting a plan to turn his son to the Dark Side .
However , in his last confrontation with Luke , Vader finally returned to the Light Side by throwing Palpatine into the reactor core to save his son .
Here ’s Vader in action :
and in A New Hope …
and in Return of the Jedi …
Master : Darth Sidious
Apprentice : None
Fate :
When he tossed Sidious down a reactor shaft , he was badly wounded by the Emperor ’s Force lightning and his breathing apparatus short - circuited .
When Sidious is dropped down a reactor shaft , there was a presumed extinction of the Sith Order , thus fulfilling the Ancient Jedi Prophesy of the Chosen One .
Of course the Expanded Universe of Star Wars knowledge does n’t agree with this , as there are many stories that take place after the events of the Return of the Jedi .
And logically , anyone can become a Sith Lord with the right Force - sensitive nature and with some of the teachings .
But this ends the Rule of Two , so you ’ll have to do further research on the other Sith Lords post - Vader .
WASHINGTON — On Friday , Michelle Obama will begin digging up a patch of White House lawn to plant a vegetable garden , the first since Eleanor Roosevelt ’s victory garden in World War II .
There will be no beets ( the president does n’t like them ) but arugula will make the cut .
While the organic garden will provide food for the first family ’s meals and formal dinners , its most important role , Mrs. Obama said , will be to educate children about healthful , locally grown fruit and vegetables at time when obesity has become a national concern .
In an interview in her office , Mrs. Obama said , “ My hope is that through children , they will begin to educate their families and that will , in turn , begin to educate our communities . ”
Twenty - three fifth graders from Bancroft Elementary School in Washington will help her dig up the soil for the 1,100 - square - foot plot in a spot visible to passers - by on E Street .
( It ’s just below the Obama girls ’ swing set . )
Students from the school , which has had a garden since 2001 , will also help plant , harvest and cook the vegetables , berries and herbs .

Chris Matthews was so busy patting himself on the back for his surprisingly sharp interview with Ari Fleischer on Wednesday that he let another really BIG whopper of a neo - con lie go past uncommented on Thursday 's Hardball .
Frank Gaffney , proud Neo-con and President of the Center for Security Policy is asked if he thought Fleischer was out of line for his statement that we should all be thankful to George W. Bush because Saddam Hussein can't attack us ... again .
Someone remind me when Saddam attacked us the first time .
Gaffney tries to argue that grammatically that was n't what Fleischer was saying , but the transcript is hard to argue with .
FLEISCHER : ... and I believe this still today .
And of course , you and I disagree with it .
But after September 11 , having been hit once , how could we take a chance that Saddam might not strike again ?
And that ‘s the threat that has been removed , and I think we ‘re all safer with that threat being removed .
I 'm sure that it comes to no surprise that the latest member of the Bush Legacy PR Team thinks that not only was Fleischer right , but Saddam was far more evil than we ever knew ... right down to conspiring with those who committed the Oklahoma City bombing ?
MATTHEWS :
The polling that took place before we attacked , conducted by “ Time ” and CNN , showed that 72 percent of the American people , nearly three quarters , believed it was likely that Saddam Hussein was involved in the attack on us 9/11 .
How do you think they got that idea , that somehow going to war with Iraq was getting even for 9/11 ?
GAFFNEY : Well , as I said , he kept saying that he was going to try to get even against us for Desert Storm , so it would n‘t be unreasonable for people to conclude maybe that that ‘s what he was doing .
There ‘s also circumstantial evidence , not proven by any means , but nonetheless some pretty compelling circumstantial evidence of Saddam Hussein ‘s Iraq being involved with the people who perpetrated both the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center and even the Oklahoma City bombing .
Um , Neocon - lying - jackass - pulling - facts - from - his - posterior says what ?
" Compelling " evidence that Saddam 's Iraq had something to do with Oklahoma City ?
Were Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols secret Iraqi agents ?
And the thoroughly debunked link to the 1993 WTC bombing too ?
Where the hell does Gaffney get his " compelling evidence " ?
Why , none other than Laurie Mylroie :
Mylroie has an impressive array of credentials that certify her as an expert on the Middle East , national security , and , above all , Iraq .
She has held faculty positions at Harvard and the U.S. Naval War College and worked at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , as well as serving as an advisor on Iraq to the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign .
During the 1980s , Mylroie was an apologist for Saddam 's regime , but reversed her position upon his invasion of Kuwait in 1990 , and , with the zeal of the academic spurned , became rabidly anti-Saddam .
In the run up to the first Gulf War , Mylroie with New York Times reporter Judith Miller wrote Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf , a well - reviewed bestseller translated into more than a dozen languages .
Until this point , there was nothing controversial about Mylroie 's career .
This would change with the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 , the first act of international terrorism within the United States , which would launch Mylroie on a quixotic quest to prove that Saddam 's regime was the most important source of terrorism directed against this country .
She laid out her case in Study of Revenge : Saddam Hussein 's Unfinished War Against America , a book published by AEI in 2000 which makes it clear that Mylroie and the neocon hawks worked hand in glove to push her theory that Iraq was behind the ' 93 Trade Center bombing .
Its acknowledgements fulsomely thanked John Bolton and the staff of AEI for their assistance , while Richard Perle glowingly blurbed the book as " splendid and wholly convincing . "
Lewis " Scooter " Libby , now Vice President Cheney 's chief of staff , is thanked for his " generous and timely assistance . "
And it appears that Paul Wolfowitz himself was instrumental in the genesis of Study of Revenge :
His then - wife is credited with having " fundamentally shaped the book , " while of Wolfowitz , she says : " At critical times , he provided crucial support for a project that is inherently difficult . "
None of which was out of the ordinary , except for this : Mylroie became enamored of her theory that Saddam was the mastermind of a vast anti-U.S. terrorist conspiracy in the face of virtually all evidence and expert opinion to the contrary .
In what amounts to the discovery of a unified field theory of terrorism , Mylroie believes that Saddam was not only behind the '93 Trade Center attack , but also every anti-American terrorist incident of the past decade , from the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the leveling of the federal building in Oklahoma City to September 11 itself .
She is , in short , a crackpot , which would not be significant if she were merely advising say , Lyndon LaRouche .
But her neocon friends who went on to run the war in Iraq believed her theories , bringing her on as a consultant at the Pentagon , and they seem to continue to entertain her eccentric belief that Saddam is the fount of the entire shadow war against America .
Gaffney , in fact , cited Mylroie in 2003 when he first tried peddling this theory in the pages of the Moonie Times .
Later in the interview ( available here )
Gaffney actually has the gall to cite Douglas " the stupidest f& # ( ing man in America " Feith as credible source to the dangers that Saddam posed .
But did Tweety once -- just once -- call Frank Gaffney on such egregious and bald - faced lies ?
' Course not .
Apparently , NBC
News division employees do n't think that 's their job .
Transcript below the fold :
We begin tonight with David Corn of “ Mother Jones ” magazine and former assistance defense secretary Frank Gaffney , who ‘s with the Center for Security Policy .
Frank , let me talk to you about last night and what happened here when Ari Fleischer made that statement , which he later adjusted and said he did n‘t mean it exactly the way it came across , that Saddam Hussein had to be prevented from attacking again and that ‘s why we went to war with Iraq .
Your thoughts ?
FRANK GAFFNEY , FMR ASST .
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE :
Well , I think it ‘s important that you read it back , Chris , because he did n‘t say attack us again , so I think Ari was right in his characterization of it as Saddam Hussein could not be allowed to attack again wherever , including , as he had repeatedly promised to do in exacting revenge against the United States for the humiliation that we inflicted upon him in Desert Storm .
And as you and I have talked , sometimes with David , sometimes without him , in the past , we know on the basis of the investigation that was conducted inside Iraq after the place was liberated that he had plans to put chemical and biological agent in aerosol sprayers and perfume sprayers for shipment to the United States and Europe .
That ‘s the kind of terrorist threat that I think President Bush was right in preemptively stopping and removing Saddam Hussein .
MATTHEWS :
The polling that took place before we attacked , conducted by “ Time ” and CNN , showed that 72 percent of the American people , nearly three quarters , believed it was likely that Saddam Hussein was involved in the attack on us 9/11 .
How do you think they got that idea , that somehow going to war with Iraq was getting even for 9/11 ?
GAFFNEY : Well , as I said , he kept saying that he was going to try to get even against us for Desert Storm , so it would n‘t be unreasonable for people to conclude maybe that that ‘s what he was doing .
There ‘s also circumstantial evidence , not proven by any means , but nonetheless some pretty compelling circumstantial evidence of Saddam Hussein ‘s Iraq being involved with the people who perpetrated both the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center and even the Oklahoma City bombing .
So the American people , I think , are not stupid .
I think that they were looking at a threat environment in which a guy like Saddam Hussein , who was repeatedly talking about exacting revenge against the United States , who was trying to shoot down our aircraft , who was actively supporting terrorism around the world , was a guy that you do n‘t want to have an opportunity to act on his threats .
That may be what they were concluding .
MATTHEWS : OK .
Well , before we hear from David Corn , let ‘s show right now the compilation we have of clips by — comments made on the record , on the air by President Bush and by Vice President Dick Cheney about Iraq and its role in 9/11 .
Let ‘s take a look at them , beginning with Vice President Dick Cheney on “ Meet the Press ” talking a meeting he described between 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague , a meeting which the 9/11 commission said never took place .

Stevens wo n’t be allowed to vote for his own reelection because dude is a felon as of half an hour ago .
The longest serving Republican in the Senate and a man many consider to be the most corrupt politician in Washington DC was found guilty earlier today of making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms .
The seven felony counts could put Stevens behind bars for as many as 35 years , though that seems unlikely .
Alaska state law prohibits felons from voting until their time is served .
( No word on whether Stevens will get to vote in the event he is sentenced to no jail time . )
Stevens is currently neck and neck in his Senate race against Anchorage mayor Mark Begich .
We ’ll soon see if Alaska is red enough that a Republican can win reelection despite being a convicted felon and despite being unable , by law , to support his own cause .

The Washington Post reports this morning that the long - awaited Senate confirmation of Presidential Science Adviser John Holdren and NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco has been put “ on hold ” by Senator Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) over an unrelated matter .
We wrote a letter to the Senator urging him to withdraw his objection , contacted his office by phone , and encourage our colleagues to do likewise .
Contact information follows , see details ….
Juliet Eilperin ’s article reports ;
Sen. Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) has placed a “ hold ” that blocks votes on confirming Harvard University physicist John Holdren , who is in line to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , and Oregon State University marine biologist Jane Lubchenco , Obama ’s nominee to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . ….
Menendez is [ allegedly ] using the holds as leverage to get Senate leaders ’ attention for a matter related to Cuba …
Anyone wishing to urge the Senator to release his hold immediately so we can get down to the business of dealing with climate disruption — including the eventual inundation of the New Jersey shore as a result of sea level rise — can do so by placing a phone call to his office and / or sending a note :
Menendez , Robert – ( D – NJ ) 528 HART SENATE OFFICE BUILDING WASHINGTON DC 20510 ( 202 ) 224-4744 http://www.menendez.senate.gov/contact/contact.cfm
We are seeing that grassroots democracy is an increasingly powerful means for advancing our civic responsibilities in dealing with climate disruption .
We see no reason why his phone should not be ringing off the hook and his email flooded today over this matter .
Here is our letter to the Senator :

1612 K Street , Suite 1100
Washington , DC 20006 Senator Robert Menendez
528 Hart Senate Office Building
US Senate
Washington , DC 20510 Dear Sen. Menendez :
We read in today ’s Washington Post ( ‘ Nominations on Hold For 2 Top Science Posts ’ by Juliet Eilperin ) that you have , allegedly , placed a hold on the Senate confirmation votes for Dr. John Holdren for Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , and Dr. Jane Lubchenco to run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Both were named nearly three months ago , and the non-controversial nomination hearing was held three weeks ago .
There is no excuse for further delay , as climate disruption poses serious threats to our economy , our environment , and our overall security .
Much important work is stalled because of your actions ; we urge you to withdraw your objection and resolve your unrelated issues independently of this matter .
Drs. Holdren and Lubchenco are widely recognized experts on climate change ; both hold national and international notoriety for their life - long achievements .
In the interest of responsibly dealing with one of the biggest challenges of our time — not to mention a looming threat to your own constituents in New Jersey who face the prospect of coastal flooding and more dangerous storm surges as a result of sea level rise and other myriad impacts – we respectfully appeal to your good judgment and ask you to release the hold on the Senate confirmation .
Thank you .
Sincerely , Rick Piltz , Director

Skin is spectacular stuff .
Nick it with a razor or scrape it on the sidewalk , and it heals itself quickly .
Synthetic materials are another story , although it ’s not for lack of effort on the part of scientists .
Chemists have tried for years to develop self - healing polymer coatings for use on cars , furniture and other objects .
Recent efforts use microspheres containing bonding chemicals .
These tiny capsules are embedded in the coating .
When a crack or scratch occurs , the spheres break and the chemicals flow into the void , patching it .

Biswajit Ghosh and Marek W. Urban of the University of Southern Mississippi have come up with another approach , which they describe in a paper in Science .
With their method , what breaks is not a sphere , but a ring - shaped chemical , oxetane , that is incorporated in the polyurethane polymer .
Another compound in the polymer , chitosan , forms cross -links at the places where the oxetane breaks , healing the scratch .
The township of Marysville in central Victoria has been almost completely destroyed by bushfires and there are grave fears for the town of Kinglake , where at least 12 people are known to have died .
Survivors in Marysville told ABC reporter Jane Cowan of seeing house after house go up in flames as the fire hit , with exploding gas canisters hurled through walls , and said at least one woman had been killed .
Aerial pictures taken by the ABC show street after street of completely destroyed homes in Marysville .
Most are just piles of rubble .
Some still have walls standing and a handful appear to be mostly intact .
In all 35 people are now confirmed to have died in the fires north of Melbourne and this morning there are unconfirmed reports of bodies being found in cars overtaken by the fires in Gippsland in the state 's east .
Six of the confirmed dead have been found at Kinglake , six at Kinglake West and four each at St Andrews and Wandong , all north of Melbourne .
More bodies have been found at Humevale , Bendigo , and Arthurs Creek and there are reports of at least one death in Marysville .
Authorities are unable to get into Kinglake to confirm the level of destruction but yesterday ABC Local Radio listener Peter Mitchell said the entire town was on fire .
" The whole of Kinglake is ablaze , " he said .
" I live a couple of kilometres out of town and when I heard explosions I went to the end of my road to see what was going on and by the time I got there I saw fires everywhere . "
' Ceased to exist '
Jane Cowan visited Marysville this morning and says the township has " virtually ceased to exist " .
" We were in the main street and it's like a warzone , like a bomb has been dropped on the entire township , " she said .
" People there are in an absolute state of shock .
Most people had already left , but the people , I 'd say about 30 people that are still left and had spent the night sheltering on the Football Oval there , are just completely dazed .
" [ They are ] walking around the streets with rugs around their shoulders because it 's actually getting cold here now if you can believe it .
" And they tell stories of how fast everything turned bad there yesterday , about five or six o'clock in the evening .
" They say they actually thought the fire was going to go around the town of Marysville and then in a matter of minutes the sky went black and they knew they were in big trouble .
" People are talking about sheltering in their homes seeing every single house in their street go up in flames in a row , one by one ... of narrow escapes ... houses that managed to survive .
" There 's a handful of houses that miraculously are still standing in Marysville .
" One lady whose house actually made it said she thought she was going to lose hers as well as she watched all the others go up around her .
" Then one of their windows cracked and she thought that was it theirs going as well .
But somehow they made it .
" There are stories of households that sheltered three families in one house .
Of gas bottles from nearby houses exploding and then piercing their houses and then those houses catching fire as well .
It 's an absolute warzone .
" They 're just in a state of shock John .
It 's way too early [ to talk about rebuilding ] .
" The people who are there are being very generous with their emotions .
Everything 's very raw , there are lives that have been lost in Marysville .
Fatalities
" People are saying that there are bodies in the town , terrible stories of for instance a woman who was found in her car this morning , obviously , was trying to escape .
She did n't make it .
She had her crockery on the seat beside her in the car .
" That 's where their heads are at the moment .
It 's way too early to start thinking about rebuilding .
" They 've got no power , no water , no phone coverage .
And they 've all actually just left the town , abandoned the town this morning , in a convoy .
" They 've been driven out by the emergency services now who are cutting trees off the road to get them out because it 's just not safe to be there even now because they 've absolultely no services . "
' Cattle burning '
But there were conflicting reports from the nearby township of Narbethong , south - west of Marysville .
Resident Raylene Kincaide lost her home and says the whole township is gone .
" It 's just devastating .
We 've lost everything .
It 's not good , " she said .
" Our little town had gone 20 minutes after we left .
Probably 95 per cent of the houses are gone .
She said they are worried that some residents are missing and have not been accounted for .
" My partner was up there and he left when he saw the cattle burning .
I 've been in Ash Wednesday , but this is worse , " she said .
But Jane Cowan said she believed " probably three houses have been lost " in Narbethong .
" It 's very difficult to tell at the moment , we 're still getting a handle on the damage there , " she said .
" It 's nowhere near the same damage as places like Marysville .
It looks like there would have been a lot of damage to stock , paddocks are blackened , but it 's still very difficult to get a handle on it .
" Homes have been lost all over the place out here but I could n't give you too much information about Narbethong now . "
About 700 firefighters are working around Kinglake , Kilmore , Murrindindi and Marysville .
The SES number is 132 500 .
In a life - threatening emergency or to report a fire , call 000 .
Grim day ahead
Eighteen people are being treated for burns at Melbourne 's Alfred Hospital , eight of whom are in intensive care .
Emergency physician John Coleridge says it is going to be grim day for those searching for others caught out by the fires
" There are apparently cars along the roadside just abandoned , " he said .
" Unfortunately they 'll probably find many more people , many of whom may not survive . "
Hospital workers say the injuries suffered by victims are the worst they have seen since the Bali bombings .
In total , the blazes are thought to have burnt through more than 100,000 hectares and caused extensive property damage .

ABERYSTWYTH , Wales , March 1 ( UPI ) -- Monty Python 's " Life of Brian , " a spoof of religious movies , is to be shown openly in a Welsh town this month for the first time in 30 years .
The movie -- which tells the story of a boy born in the next stable over from Jesus Christ and ends up crucified while singing " Always look on the bright side of life " -- was banned in Aberystwyth soon after its release in 1979 .
As near as anyone can remember , a committee of local religious leaders decided the film was blasphemous .
As it happens , the town 's current mayor , Sue Jones - Davies , was in the film , the BBC reported .
She played Judith Iscariot , Brian 's girlfriend .
" They 've been banned from so many places I 'm not sure they 'd heard about what was happening in Aberystwyth , " Jones - Davies said .
Two of the surviving Pythons , Terry Jones and Michael Palin , will join Jones - Davies for a charity showing March 28 , followed by a question and answer session on the film .
Graham Chapman , who played Brian , died at 48 in 1989 .
Blu -ray 's star is rising fast , for good reason .
The high - def video format remains the best and most consistent way to take full advantage of a 1080 p high - definition television .
Armed with a capable player and an HDTV with a surround - sound system , you can create your own home theater paradise .
In the ever - evolving world of electronics , it can be hard to tell when to leap into the fray .
While Blu-ray Disc players are not exempt from that rule , the ten current models we tested illustrate why now is a good time to jump .
Lower prices , a greater movie selection ( 1000 titles and counting ) , and a wider array of extra features make Blu-ray more attractive than ever before .
There 's a reason why Blu-ray has enjoyed notable momentum from late 2008 and into this year , even as the full impact of the economic downturn hit .
Indeed , what a difference a year makes .
The models we tested for our previous Blu-ray player review roundup cost $ 400 to $ 1000 .
Now , Blu-ray Disc players are also coming from Chinese manufacturers and other OEMs that specialize in producing midrange and budget - priced electronics .
The trend has led to a more diverse selection of Blu-ray players , and has contributed directly to Blu-ray 's breaching the $ 200 barrier -- the point that often marks when a new technology has gone mainstream .
This time the cheapest model we tested was the $ 175 Memorex MVBD2510 , with the $ 220 Sharp BD - HP21U close on its heels .
The most expensive model we evaluated was Panasonic 's DMP - BD55 K , which was $ 400 at the time of this writing ( close to the end of the model 's life ) .
Industry analysts expect to see a $ 150 Blu-ray Disc player this year -- and that 's not just assuming that aging 2008 models will drop in price to make room for new stock .
Among the ten models we evaluated in the PC World Test Center , we noticed a surprising trend :
Yes , an inexpensive player can produce great - looking high - definition images .
However , all three of the low - cost models we tried -- the Insignia NS - 2BRDVD , the Memorex , and the Sherwood America BDP - 5003 -- had serious issues with upscaling standard - definition DVDs .
If you plan to use your Blu-ray player for standard - def DVDs , too , you should choose a more expensive model .
Future Directions
The obituaries written for packaged media still appear to be premature .
Blu-ray
Discs not only offer a tangible good -- which many consumers still appreciate -- but also provide optimal visual quality .
Take , for example , what we saw from the LG BD300 and Samsung BD - P2500 Blu-ray players , both of which stream movies from Netflix .
The image quality of the streams over our office 's T1 connection was not even remotely comparable to that of a Blu-ray Disc .
For all of the talk about streaming content from the Internet , the technology simply is not ready for mass consumption .
Industry experts agree : Recent estimates from research firm Media Control GfK International note that sales revenue from Blu-ray titles is projected to increase this year by 150 percent , to $ 2.9 billion .
That represents about 11 percent of the packaged media sold in 2009 , nearly triple Blu-ray 's piece of the pie back in 2008 .
More people are aware of Blu-ray as a format , which has translated into sales and into more discs being released .
According to DisplaySearch , 10.7 million Blu-ray players ( including Sony PlayStation 3 game consoles ) shipped in the format 's first two and a half years .
In comparison , DVD had shipped 5.4 million players ( per the Consumer Electronics Association 's numbers ) .
In addition to lowering prices , manufacturers are eliminating some of the more confusing points of differentiation among players .
For example , a whopping 14 of the 19 Blu-ray Disc players introduced so far for 2009 -- including models from LG , Memorex , Pioneer , and Samsung - - have BD - Live support for interactive content .
More players these days offer on - board high - end audio decoders for Dolby TrueHD and DTS - HD Master Audio .
And more models are serving as a conduit for streaming Internet - based entertainment to your HDTV : Aside from the LG BD300 and the Samsung BD - P2500 , look for other streaming - enabled Blu-ray players from LG , Panasonic , and Samsung to arrive later this year .
Clearly , as prices continue to fall , the step - up cost of going Blu is less of an obstacle to shoppers , even those who are watching their budget .

El presidente Obama autorizó enviar soldados y armamento para la guerra en México .
Mientras , en su país , tratará las drogas con una perspectiva de salud pública y prevención .
600 mil norteamericanos son adictos a la heroína inhalada e inyectada ; 9.8 millones fuman mariguana y 4.7 millones usan metanfetaminas hechas en Estados Unidos .
Allá salud ; aquí soldados .
El 4 de junio de 2008 Amnistía Internacional y defensoras de derechos humanos de México y EU urgieron al Congreso de ese país poner salvaguardias de derechos humanos en la Iniciativa Mérida , un paquete de cooperación para la seguridad entre EU , México y Centroamérica .
Pero el gobierno de México se negó a aceptar que las denuncias de violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas por militares fueran transferidas a fiscales y vigiladas por tribunales civiles .
A estas alturas , dada la corrupción e incapacidad de los gobernadores , la sociedad desesperada acepta que es mejor estar rodeada de 10 mil soldados que en manos de narcos , policías cómplices o ineficientes .
Chihuahua , patria de los feminicidios mexicanos , vive un estado de excepción .
Un experto en inteligencia militar asegura que el gobernador ha cedido el mando al Ejército .
Y aunque parte de ese Ejército hace un buen trabajo , otra no .
Es la guerra .
Quizá no hubo más opción que recurrir al Ejército , por la pasividad y corrupción de nuestros cuerpos policiacos .
Pero eso no significa que la sociedad , y en particular las mujeres , deban ser “ entregadas ” como población ocupada , exenta de derechos .
Más de 7 mil soldados controlan ciudades sin orden en la frontera .
Lejos de sus familias , entrenados para someter y desconfiar , convencidos de que su fuero militar les da poder sobre cualquiera .
Muchos ejercen violencia doméstica ; viven al día , con miedo de morir , dispuestos a matar y a violar para desahogarse .
Cuando 19 soldados “ se equivocaron ” y masacraron en Sinaloa a la familia de Adán Esparza , las ONG exigieron más control .
Sólo en Chiapas , 79 mujeres y niñas fueron violadas por militares enviados a proteger a la comunidad .
En Chihuahua , las organizaciones de derechos humanos reciben a mujeres torturadas y violadas por soldados , sicarios y policías .
A una , tras violarla , le quemaron los pies y le cortaron tres dedos , para que no denunciara .
¿ Ante quién denuncian ?
Los Estados autoritarios se construyen sobre la complicidad pasiva de pueblos que “ prefieren ” mano dura que “ el desorden ” .
Pero esa es una falsa elección planteada por políticos .
Las y los mexicanos tenemos derecho a una vida libre donde la ley actúe contra la delincuencia y proteja y defienda las garantías de la sociedad .
El espionaje de Estado , las violaciones sistemáticas a garantías constitucionales , a derechos humanos , no pueden ser perdonadas porque hay una guerra contra el crimen .
Si los militares llegaron para quedarse en labores policiacas urge crear mecanismos de protección y vigilancia civil .
Si no seremos un pueblo bajo la ocupación de nuestro propio Ejército .
Y como históricamente ha sido , las mujeres serán el botín de guerra .
Urge una conspiración por los derechos humanos .
Assailants threw an explosive at a Jewish community center in Caracas , but nobody was hurt in the blast .
No one claimed responsibility for the attack , which immediately reignited fears of rising anti-Semitism in Venezuela .
It was the second attack against a Jewish institution in Caracas this year .
A synagogue was ransacked and vandalized last month .
The assailants shattered religious objects , spray - painted “ Jews , get out ” on the walls and stole a computer database containing names and addresses of Jews living in Venezuela .
The authorities have arrested 11 people , including 8 police officers , suspected of participation .
When War broke out in September 1939 , Neville Chamberlain was Prime Minster .
Winston Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty , and was also a member of the War Cabinet .
On the 10th May 1940 , in recognition of the fact that he had for many years seen Hitler as a threat , George VI invited Winston Churchill to Buckingham Palace , and asked him to form a government and become Prime Minster .
In his first speech to the House of Commons after becoming Prime Minister , on the 10th May 1940 , Churchill set out the truth as he saw it .
Churchill was a man whose hour had come .
He had been irrelevant in politics in the 1920s and 30s , but cometh the hour , cometh the man , and Churchill became the great war leader .
Churchill offered no magic bullets , no miracle solutions , and no false hope .
Instead , as he himself said on 13th May , shortly after forming his government :
I would say to the House , as I said to those who have joined this government : " I have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat . "
Perversely , this seemed to cheer the population up a bit .
Someone was telling it to them as it was , and that did n't seem all bad .
Speech in the House of Commons , 13th June 1940 :
... the Battle of France is over .
I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin .
Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization .
Upon it depends our own British life , and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire .
The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us .
Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war .
If we can stand up to him , all Europe may be freed and the life of the world may move forward into broad , sunlit uplands .
But if we fail , then the whole world , including the United States , including all that we have known and cared for , will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister , and perhaps more protracted , by the lights of perverted science .
Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties , and so bear ourselves , that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years , men will still say , " This was their finest hour .
And on 4th June 1940 :
We shall go on to the end , we shall fight in France , we shall fight on the seas and oceans , we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air , we shall defend our Island , whatever the cost may be , we shall fight on the beaches , we shall fight on the landing grounds , we shall fight in the fields and in the streets , we shall fight in the hills ; we shall never surrender ....
Steiner , Brenner and Neo-Marxism : The Marcusean Component
By Adam Haig
2 January 2009
As a supporter of the International Committee of the Fourth International ( ICFI ) who has been following the political and philosophical charges of Alex Steiner and Frank Brenner , the author of this paper is interested in addressing their embrace of critical theorist Herbert Marcuse ( 1898 -1979 ) .
While the said opponents of the ICFI present their ideas as Marxism and Trotskyism , their thought is more in line with the attempts of numerous middle - class intellectual radicals who have tried to innovate Marxism with cultural theory .
These figures range widely from Theodor Adorno to Slavoj Zizek .
The author 's formal background is in literary and cultural studies , academic fields in which the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory has been influential and where it has undergone various theoretical hybridizations .
* * *
On November 9 , 2008 , Alex Steiner , a political opponent of the International Committee of the Fourth International ( ICFI ) , published a public statement on his Permanent Revolution website denouncing David North 's three - part series , " The Frankfurt School vs. Marxism : The Political and Intellectual Odyssey of Alex Steiner , " and Ann Talbot and Chris Talbot 's addendum , " Marxism and Science . "
These documents were written in response to earlier articles by Steiner and his political associate , Frank Brenner .
Steiner charges that the North and Talbot works are " ad hominem , " " dishonest , " " lies , " " half - truths , " " a smear campaign , " and " armchair psychologizing . " [ 1 ]
The ICFI maintains that Steiner and Brenner , who left the Workers League ( the predecessor of the Socialist Equality Party ) thirty years ago , have drifted into the anti-Marxist orbit of the petty - bourgeois Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and that they cannot be regarded as Marxist - Trotskyists .
This is not demonization , but a well - grounded assessment of their theoretical and political conceptions .
Their polemics — e.g , " Objectivism or Marxism " ( 2006 ) , Marxism without Its Head or Its Heart ( 2007 ) , and " On the Vulgar Critique of Vulgar Materialism " ( 2008 ) — betray an eclectic radical intellectual tradition that is decisively non-Marxist in political and philosophical orientation .
Steiner and Brenner 's perspective is an emphatic rejection of the materialist conception of history , which ascribes a decisive and determining role to objective socioeconomic processes in the development of social consciousness .
Like many petty - bourgeois ex-Marxists , they are convinced that the central issues of revolutionary consciousness relate to individual psychology and sexuality .
Deeply skeptical about the possibility of mass revolutionary radicalism being produced by the objective crisis of capitalist society , Steiner and Brenner argue that the revival of socialist consciousness requires the allure of Utopia . [ 2 ]
These conceptions are not original .
There is too much authority invested in the academic neo-Marxist Frankfurt School , in general , and Herbert Marcuse , in particular , and too little acknowledgment of the distortive and disorienting political - philosophical trajectory and outcome of this petty - bourgeois radical intellectual tendency , as seen in such writings as Marcuse 's demoralized and demoralizing Eros and Civilization : A Philosophical Inquiry into Freud ( 1955 ) and One- Dimensional Man : Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society ( 1964 ) .
Steiner and Brenner , to be sure , do invoke other critical theorists , such as the psychoanalysts Erich Fromm and Wilhelm Reich .
That , however , does not strengthen but rather weakens their case .
One of the arguments Steiner and Brenner make is that despite the incompatibilities of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory with orthodox Marxism , not everything by the critical theorists is worthless .
That is beside the point .
The question is whether or not Frankfurt School critical theory is Marxism .
The turn to the neo -Marxist ( or , perhaps more accurately , pseudo - Marxist ) tradition becomes a justification for anti-Marxist revisionism when Steiner and Brenner unoriginally invoke the concept of Utopia and when they embrace Marcuse 's Eros and Civilization .
Fundamentally , they dismiss Leon Trotsky 's important political admonishment in Results and Prospects ( 1906 ) that genuine Marxists have no business summoning Utopia .
Chapter seven , " The Prerequisites of Socialism , " begins , " Marxism converted socialism into a science , but this does not prevent some ‘ Marxists ' from converting Marxism into a Utopia , " and ends , " If socialism aimed at creating a new human nature within the limits of the old society it would be nothing more than a new edition of the moralistic utopias .
Socialism does not aim at creating a socialist psychology as a pre-requisite to socialism , but at creating socialist conditions of life as a pre-requisite to socialist psychology . " [ 3 ]
Trotsky was well informed of the subjective idealist tendencies of his day , and his writings anticipate the psychodynamic Utopianism that Steiner and Brenner appropriate from Herbert Marcuse .
Eros and Civilization and Marcusean method
Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse is a non-empirical work in speculative " depth psychology " that has no grounding in therapy or clinical observation .
Based on Sigmund Freud 's tentative " metapsychology , " Marcuse reasserts Freud 's instinct and sex - based libido theory and conjectural notions of Eros , the death instinct and the primal father .
Marcuse is not concerned with " psychoanalysis itself " nor with the " technical discipline which psychoanalysis has become , " but with the " philosophy of psychoanalysis . " [ 4 ]
Marcuse defends orthodox Freudianism , reinterprets Freud 's pessimistic conclusions in Civilization and Its Discontents ( 1929 ) in Utopian terms , and believes that psychoanalysis is sociological in its substance and that " no new cultural or sociological orientation is needed to reveal this substance . "
That is an excuse for sociological ignorance .
Marcuse adds , " Freud 's ‘ biologism ' is social theory in a depth dimension . " [ 5 ]
These were not original views when they were published in 1955 .
Thirty years before Eros and Civilization , the Trotskyist critic Aleksandr Voronsky wrote an essay titled " Freudianism and Art " in which he outlined the Marxist position on the problem .
Steiner and Brenner completely ignore this work in their polemics .
Noteworthy is Voronsky 's observation on the sociologization of Freudianism :
" As long as Freud 's psychoanalysis is limited to an investigation of the psychology and even the psychopathology of individual people , examining them from the point of view of natural science , then he is , as they say , just the right man for the job .
But Freudians , unfortunately , do n't restrict themselves to this investigation ; they try to analyze social intentions , feelings , views , ideas and images .
From psychology they pass over to sociology , yet they remain on the foundation of studying man who is isolated from society .
Acting in this way , the Freudians drag us backwards , in the best of cases , to the so - called abstract scientific point of view , which is salutary in biology , physiology and psychology , but justly condemned in sociology as far back as Marx .
This is the usual mistake made by scientists when they pass from the field of science into the field of social science . " [ 6 ]
Voronsky is talking about Freudians , and that makes Marcuse 's sociologization of Freud more problematic than in the above case .
Firstly , Marcuse was not a scientist , therapist or analyst , but a left - Heideggerian academic philosopher .
( Marcuse studied with Heidegger from 1928 to 1933 . )
Secondly , the Freudian metapsychology Marcuse embraced had little relation to clinical data .
Psychology links social science and natural science .
Psychoanalysis , however , is not an experimental or quantitative field .
As to the claims by some commentators that Eros and Civilization is a synthesis of Freud and Marx , that is not corroborated by an examination of the text , which offers no analysis of capitalism .
Besides some Marxist - sounding phraseology ( alienation , alienated labor , labor power , labor time , dialectic ) , Marcuse makes no citations of Marx , Engels , Lenin , or Trotsky . [ 7 ]
He does not refer to Marxism , materialism , the materialist conception of history , materialist dialectics , scientific socialism , socialist consciousness , or , for that matter , any of the critical categories of Marxist analysis , such as surplus value .
Nor does Marcuse apply objective Marxist methods of research .
Rather than seeing the state , law , and morals as historically mediated products of socioeconomic relations , and all mental and imaginative creations as ( indirectly and mediately ) determined by these same relations , Marcuse focuses on ideological - instinctual dynamics and structures ( e.g. , performance principle , pleasure principle , reality principle ) and the repression of human instinctual needs and drives .
On the basis of Freud 's highly debatable theories of psychosexual drives and instincts , not material social life itself , Marcuse extrapolates a hypothesis of a non-repressive civilization .
In Marcuse 's own words : " The vision of a non-repressive culture , which we have lifted from a marginal trend in mythology and philosophy , aims at a new relation between instincts and reason . " [ 8 ]
Marcuse 's Utopian idealist method is contradicted by Marxist scientific materialist method .
In the 1897 pamphlet The Materialist Conception of History , Georgi Plekhanov explains the basis of human needs and their satisfaction as follows :
" The methods by which social man satisfies his needs , and to a large extent these needs themselves , are determined by the nature of the implements with which he subjugates nature in one degree or another ; in other words , they are determined by the state of his productive forces .
Every considerable change in the state of these forces is reflected in man 's social relations , and , therefore , in his economic relations , as part of these social relations .
The idealists of all species and varieties held that economic relations were functions of human nature ; the dialectical materialists hold that these relations are functions of the social productive forces . " [ 9 ]
The Marxist approach to studying human needs in society is bound up with an analysis of the historical state of the productive forces , social relations , and economic relations .
Marxism is a method of social analysis .
The Marxist procedural approach , which Marcuse misses entirely , is elaborated by Trotsky in the speech " Dialectical Materialism and Science , " written in 1925 when he was the chairman of the Scientific - Technical Board of Industry of the Soviet Union :
" The essence of Marxism consists in this , that it approaches society concretely , as a subject for objective research , and analyzes human history as one would a colossal laboratory record .
Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the material social structure .
Marxism examines the class structure of society as a historically conditioned form of the development of the productive forces ; Marxism deduces from the productive forces of society the inter-relations between human society and surrounding nature , and these , in turn , are determined at each historical stage by man 's technology , his instruments and weapons , his capacities and methods for struggle with nature .
Precisely this objective approach arms Marxism with the insuperable power of historical foresight . " [ 10 ]
Trotsky , who was of the opinion that psychoanalysis could be reconciled with materialism , nevertheless cautioned in his writings that psychoanalysis is a vague and unstable field that is open to fanciful and arbitrary ideas . [ 11 ]
Eros and Civilization , which is uninterested in " technical " psychoanalytic practice and the socio- psychology of living people and social classes , confirms the admonishment .
Marcuse 's metapsychoanalytics amount to what Trotsky described as " pure psychology , " that is , a belletristic parlor psychology that employs the terminology of Freud and does so more for literary adornment than for real analysis . [ 12 ]
Freudian terminology originates in Freudian methodology , and Marcuse does not depart all that significantly from Freud 's ahistorical subjective idealist orientation .
Freudian individual psychoanalysis was based on mechanical materialism and had no socioeconomic theory of history .
That vacuum was filled with biological determinism — the unconscious , repression , sexual instincts , and life and death drives — unconnected to the historical development of the social productive forces and relations of production .
Eros and Civilization likewise neglects historical materialism for psychosexual guesstimates and sociological impressionism .
The work adds nothing to scientific thought or socialist theory .
One should permit Marcuse to speak for himself :
* " This essay [ Eros and Civilization ] employs psychological categories because they have become political categories . [. . .] formerly autonomous and identifiable psychical processes are being absorbed by the function of the individual in the state — by his public existence .
Psychological problems therefore turn into political problems . [. . .]
The [ present ] era tends to be totalitarian even where it has not produced totalitarian states . " [ 13 ]
* " Totalitarianism spreads over late industrial civilization wherever the interests of domination prevail upon productivity , arresting and diverting potentialities .
The people have to be kept in a state of permanent mobilization , internal and external . " [ 14 ]
* " The manipulation of consciousness which has occurred throughout the orbit of contemporary industrial civilization has been described in the various interpretations of totalitarian and ‘ popular cultures ' : coordination of the private and public existence , of spontaneous and required actions .
The promotion of thoughtless leisure activities , the triumph of anti-intellectual ideologies , exemplify the trend . " [ 15 ]
* " With the decline in consciousness , with the control of information , with the absorption of the individual into mass communication , knowledge is administered and confined .
The individual does not really know what is going on ; the overpowering machine of education and entertainment unites him with all the others in a state of anaesthesia from which all detrimental ideas tend to be excluded .
And since knowledge of the whole truth is hardly conducive to happiness , such general anaesthesia makes individuals happy . " [ 16 ]
* " The collapse of the liberal era and of its promises , the spreading totalitarian trend and the efforts to counteract this trend , are reflected in the position of psychoanalysis . " [ 17 ]
* " At the present stage , the personality tends toward a standardized reaction pattern established by the hierarchy of power and functions and by its technical , intellectual and cultural apparatus , " and " the expressions of personality fit and sustain perfectly the socially desired pattern of behavior and thought .
They thus tend to cancel individuality .
This process , which has been completed in the ‘ mass culture ' of late industrial civilization , vitiates the concept of interpersonal relations [. . . ] . " [ 18 ]
* " In a period of totalitarianism [ . . .] the individual has so entirely become the subject - object of manipulation that , for the ‘ healthy and normal ' person , even the idea of a distinction between being ‘ for himself ' and ‘ for others ' has become meaningless , in a period when the omnipotent apparatus punishes real non-conformity with ridicule and defeat [. . . ] . " [ 19 ]
The claim that " Western civilization " or " late industrial civilization " ( i.e. , North America and Western Europe ) in the post - Second World War epoch is omnipotently totalitarian , even in the absence of totalitarian states , is a claim that has no basis in objective reality .
Marcuse resorts to an a priori mental construction — a " pure ideology " in the terms of Friedrich Engels ' Anti-Dühring ( 1878 ) [ 20 ] — that is not empirically validated in scientific research .
Eros and Civilization , moreover , does not make a Marxist analysis of the socioeconomic situation and balance of class forces in the postwar period .
The overall perspective suggests that Marcuse , who was lecturing at major American universities in the 1950s , was writing in disillusioned and disoriented response to the Cold War and the rightwing upsurge of McCarthyism , which virtually criminalized the Marxist critique of US capitalism .
The anticommunist witch hunts in the late 1940s to late 1950s , which took the name of Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy , are notable for having caused widespread disorientation among intellectuals and within the left - radical social milieu .
In the case of Marcuse , he resorted to the wildest idealism by hypothesizing a postwar totalitarian " Western civilization " where psychology is politics .
Deeply pessimistic as this is , he claimed that it had an optimistic prognosis .
But noticeably absent from Eros and Civilization is the role of Marxist political leadership and the revolutionary subject who will overthrow capitalism , namely , the international working class .
Marcuse speaks of revolutionary defeats , for example , and says , " Neither the prevailing constellation of power , nor immaturity of the productive forces , nor absence of class consciousness provides an adequate answer . " [ 21 ]
In his view , revolutions are passing moments of victory against a ruling group , events of " self - defeat " that unleash " guilt feelings . "
Consequently , " every revolution has also been a betrayed revolution . " [ 22 ]
There could not be a more non-Marxist statement of the problem .
These abstract psychoanalytic notions lie outside the theory of the class struggle and have nothing to do with Marxism .
Should one accept Marcuse 's theory of guilt feelings , the Stalinist betrayal of the Russian Revolution would be seen as a product of the post - revolutionary compunction of the Russian worker and peasant masses .
Josef Stalin 's inner-party coup in 1924 would not be understood as a bureaucratic reaction that resulted from the defeat of the socialist revolutions in the West , the political and moral exhaustion of the Russian masses after the Civil War and foreign intervention , the masses ' unfamiliarity with state administration , and the prolonged confinement of the Russian Revolution in conditions of economic and cultural backwardness .
In a subsequent discussion on " phantasy " ( imagination ) and Utopia , Marcuse says , " No matter how justly and rationally the material production may be organized , it can never be a realm of freedom and gratification [. . .]
It is the sphere outside labor which defines freedom and fulfillment . " [ 23 ]
Here , Marcuse fails to state that rational economic organization by the associated producers of the world and common ownership of the means of production are the preconditions of genuine freedom .
As Marx explains in the third volume of Capital , " [ T ] he true realm of freedom [. . .] can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis . " [ 24 ]
Socialism subjects society to reason and conscious human control .
Contrary to this Marxist principle are the mantras in Eros and Civilization such as the " tyranny of reason " and " libidinal rationality . "
Marcuse 's rejection of the working class
The 1966 " Political Preface " of Eros and Civilization crystallizes the political content of Marcuse 's false conception of Western totalitarian civilization : " When , in the more or less affluent societies , productivity has a reached a level at which the masses participate in its benefits , and at which the opposition is effectively and democratically ‘ contained , ' then the conflict between master and slave is also effectively contained . " [ 25 ]
As far as Marcuse is concerned , the working masses in Western " affluent society , " " advanced industrial society , " " overdeveloped society , " are impotent .
He proceeds to claim that the location of genuine social struggle has changed ; he valorizes the " revolt of the backward countries ; " and he disingenuously invokes the " Marxian concept [. . .] that only those who were free from the blessings of capitalism could possibly change it into a free society : those whose existence was the very negation of capitalist property could become the historical agents of liberation . " [ 26 ]
The language is intentionally vague and opens the door to non-proletarian class tendencies .
Marcuse characterizes the 1960s middle - class radical youth protests as a " [ r ] evolt against the false fathers , teachers , and heroes — solidarity with the wretched of the earth , " but adds that since this is in the advanced Western countries , it is nothing more than an " instinctual solidarity , " that " the political machine , the corporate machine , the cultural and educational machine [. . .] has become too big , its cohesion too strong , its function too efficient . " [ 27 ]
Radical protest , therefore , " assume[s ] a childlike , ridiculous immaturity . " [ 28 ]
Satisfied with neither the working class nor the radicalized middle - class youth , Marcuse poses a rhetorical question : " The body against the machine : men , women and children fighting , with the most primitive tools , the most brutal and destructive machine of all times and keeping it in check — does guerrilla warfare define the revolution of our time ? " [ 29 ]
He adds that historical backwardness will turn the wheel of progress , and he later says , " The spread of guerrilla warfare at the height of the technological century is a symbolic event . " [ 30 ]
Eros and Civilization establishes an ideological basis for the rejection of the working class as a revolutionary force , and Marcuse 's endorsement of " third - world " guerrillaism is not unrelated to his 1955 consignment of Western societies to a monolithic totalitarian civilization — at a time when the more rightly totalitarian Stalinist Soviet Union was still in existence .
Writing off the workers of the advanced capitalist countries , Marcuse romanticizes " backward peoples , " their poverty , and the guerrilla and terrorist tactics of petty - bourgeois nationalist movements .
This is not Marxist internationalism .
Marcuse , as is known , sympathized with Frantz Fanon , Fidel Castro , and Che Guevara .
Steiner and Brenner have not lauded the petty - bourgeois nationalists ; however , they assume a high - handed position with regard to the working class .
That owes something to Marcuse 's subjective idealist notion that psychology is politics and to his idea that " [t ] he autonomous personality [. . .] has always been the privilege of a very few . " [ 31 ]
In the polemical defense of Utopia titled " To Know a Things Is to Know Its End , " Brenner sets up a binary opposition of self - emancipating masses vis -à - vis society - running socialists .
He also conflates the specific and technical Marxist political categories dictatorship of the proletariat ( a workers ' state ) and socialist society ( an international , non-class , non-state system ) .
Socialism and communism are interchangeable terms that refer to the international classless society based on planned production for the satisfaction of human needs . [ 32 ]
Saying , " There is no contradiction between the masses emancipating themselves and socialists running society , " Brenner adds , " [ F ] or a considerable period of time , the running of socialist society will be in the hands [. . .] of that section of the class ( necessarily a large portion of it and hopefully a majority ) whose political consciousness has been shaped by the revolutionary socialist movement . "
These socialist administrators , he argues , do not represent " a small clique of party bureaucrats but a broad section of workers imbued with socialist consciousness .
And that very consciousness is itself the best guarantee against bureaucratization . " [ 33 ]
The point is reasserted in chapter eight of Marxism without Its Head or Its Heart . [ 34 ]
Firstly , it is misleading to state that consciousness is a " guarantee " against bureaucratization .
Political consciousness is one of the weapons to combat bureaucracy , the roots of which are material and social , not psychological .
Bureaucracy is a socioeconomic - structural question and arises from the isolation of a revolution , as was the case in the Soviet Union .
Even an isolated workers ' state in America can degenerate into a bureaucratic system .
Secondly , a workers ' state does not entail " a large portion " of socialists ( party cadres ) administering society .
The party is an agency of workers ' power , a medium to organize on the basis of a socialist program and seize power .
Political leadership does not replace the working class or make the workers ' revolution .
Moreover , the dictatorship of the proletariat is not a dictatorship of the party .
It is not a party - state .
Working people of all strata , professions , political beliefs , and levels of social consciousness will enter the process of democratic self - rule and competition of their views , as the forces of production are concentrated in their hands .
The party guides workers with its political experience and historical memory , but it cannot tell workers what to do .
The transition from capitalism to socialism must be based on the popular will of the workers themselves in their own self - organized committees and councils .
The system of workers ' councils — not the party — is the ruling apparatus of the workers ' state .
That is how workers are organized as the ruling class .
Thirdly , if classes and states still exist under socialism , then socialism does not exist .
But all of this is unacceptable to Steiner and Brenner , since they are convinced that " Marxist leadership " and " socialist consciousness in the working class " amount to the same thing . [ 35 ]
Contrary to what Steiner and Brenner assume , Lenin and Trotsky never held the view that " the dictatorship of the proletariat [. . .] was always understood to mean the dictatorship of the class conscious proletariat . " [ 36 ]
The workers ' state is not the province of Marxist political leaders or psychologically advanced sections of the working class , but of the whole working class .
Considering Marcuse 's abstract speculative method in Eros and Civilization and its anti-working class orientation , it is stunning that Steiner and Brenner accord such a methodologically flawed and politically misguided work so much guiding importance .
They appeal to the authority of a pseudo - Marxist critical theorist and a non-specialist in psychoanalysis , making a case for the infusion of the Marcusean conception of Eros into the political program of the Marxist party , which will supposedly " eroticize " the social life of the working class .
In Frank Brenner 's unforgettable words :
" Leaving aside the feasibility ( or desirability ) of guaranteeing orgasm , there remains a vital point here : ending the tyranny of the genitals is as essential as ending the tyranny of economics if a genuinely human existence is to be possible .
In Eros and Civilization , Marcuse would explore much the same territory , only this time incorporating the advances of Freudian psychology : his vision of a non-repressive civilization entailed a redirecting of libido to ‘ eroticize normally non- and anti-erotic relationships between individuals , and between them and their environment . '
In communism , eros replaces cash as the primary nexus between human beings . " [ 37 ]
This is , to say the least , a total rejection of the materialist conception of history .
One cannot help but wonder what practical measures would flow from Brenner 's analysis .
If the " tyranny of the genitals " is as great a barrier to " a genuinely human existence " as " the tyranny of economics , " it would follow that the Marxist party must devote at least as much time to combating the former as to fighting the latter .
What precisely would that entail ?
Brenner 's bizarre and disoriented project flows from his elevation of Marcuse 's speculative and even dubious psychoanalytic propositions above Marx 's scientifically grounded analysis of capitalism and the driving forces of social development .
Psychoanalysis , even when done properly , does not explain things like the declining world position of American capitalism , the eruption of neo-colonialism and militarism , the bursting of the United States housing bubble , the subprime mortgage crisis , the problem of rising unemployment , and the global financial meltdown , all of which are the outcome of objective structural processes that operate independently of people 's private parts .
In another document , the title of which borrows a phrase from the Marcusean social historian Russell Jacoby , Brenner applauds the Frankfurt School for its interpretation of dialectics :
" It was the strength of the Critical Theorists that they brought dialectical analysis to bear on the subjective factor , i.e. , on psychology , the culture industry , consumerism , etc .
( A notable example of this is Marcuse 's brilliant reading of Freud in Eros and Civilization . )
Marxism in the 21st century is neither conceivable nor viable without assimilating the best insights of these thinkers . [. . .]
The only way to preserve the heritage of Marxism is to renew and develop it — and that means , among other things , assimilating the insights into subjectivity that can be gained from Critical Theory . " [ 38 ]
This statement is a complete repudiation of Trotskyism .
To state that Marxism is not viable in the twenty first century without the insights of the Frankfurt School is another way of saying that the Marxism defended for decades by the ICFI — i.e. , Trotskyism — was flawed and inadequate .
If it proves nothing else , the said statement makes clear that the pretense under which Steiner and Brenner launched their attack on David North and the ICFI was politically and intellectually dishonest .
Both men claimed they were defending the heritage of the ICFI against North 's abandonment of Marxism and the traditions of the ICFI .
But in the course of their polemics , Steiner and Brenner openly declare that this heritage is not viable .
They insist that it is necessary to incorporate the petty - bourgeois Frankfurt School into the politics of the internationalist socialist movement , that is , the Trotskyist movement .
Steiner and Brenner fail to explain how the " heritage of Marxism " can be preserved by a class politics , philosophy , and ideology that is alien to it .
Moreover , Steiner and Brenner mix up subjective factors and objective factors .
The objective source of the subjective element , its objective components , and its dependence on socioeconomic factors are either minimized or ignored in Marcuse 's Eros and Civilization .
Likewise , in Steiner and Brenner 's Marcusean - influenced psychodynamic Utopianism , the subjective factor is decisive .
The ideal determines the material .
Subjective factors and objective factors
Following Marcuse , Brenner incorrectly identifies and confuses objective and subjective factors .
The latter is not simply psychology , the culture industry , and consumerism , as Brenner defines it .
The first of these is a collection of human mental states and processes .
Psychology , moreover , is ultimately determined by social conditions , which are themselves determined by the state of the productive forces and social relations of production .
More specifically , the psychology of the working class at any given point is a subjective factor that is conditioned by objective factors .
As for the culture industry and consumerism , these arise on the basis of capitalist relations and are among the several objective factors that influence workers ' social and political conceptions .
Steiner and Brenner have forgotten the ABCs of Marxism .
Trotsky clearly states the distinction between subjective factors and objective factors in his 1906 Results and Prospects : " Besides the subjective factors — consciousness , preparedness and initiative , the development of which also have their own logic — the proletariat in carrying out its policy comes up against a number of objective factors such as the policy of the ruling classes and the existing state institutions ( such as the army , the class schools , the State church ) , international relations , etc . " [ 39 ]
Other writings by Trotsky throughout his career as a professional revolutionary yield several more scientific Marxist definitions of the subjective factor that are consistent with the teachings of Lenin :
* parties and their programs

The World Socialist Web Site , the online center of the International Committee of the Fourth International , has consistently defined the subjective factor in these orthodox Marxist terms .
Besides the above definitions , there is also the following helpful schematic by Trotsky through which one can readily comprehend the role of the subjective factor in the actuation of the working class socialist revolution :
" Marxism teaches us that in order for the proletarian revolution to become possible there must be given , schematically speaking , three premises or conditions .
The first premise is the conditions of production .
Productive technique must have attained such heights as to provide economic gains from the replacement of capitalism by socialism .
Secondly , there must be a class interested in effecting this change and sufficiently strong to achieve it , that is , a class numerically large enough and playing a sufficiently important role in economy to introduce this change .
The reference here is , of course , to the working class .
And thirdly , this class must be prepared to carry out the revolution .
It must have the will to carry it out , and must be sufficiently organized and conscious to be capable of carrying it out .
We pass here into the domain of the so - called subjective factors and subjective premises for the proletarian revolution .
If with these three criteria — productive - technological , social - class and subjective - political — we approach the three spheres indicated by me , then the difference between them becomes strikingly apparent . " [ 40 ]
Psychology in the more specific sense of proletarian class consciousness is a subjective factor .
Marcusean Eros and Utopia are not .
Steiner and Brenner make a few references to the subjective factor as the " revolutionary vanguard " ; however , their neo -Marxist critical theory denatures such terms of their Marxist political content .
The Frankfurt School — with its pessimistic theory of the " culture industry " ( Adorno , Horkheimer , Marcuse ) — was not a socialist workers ' organization , much less a revolutionary party , but an eclectic academic leftist research institute .
Since the Frankfurt School existed above the struggles of workers , did not lead mass social movements , and does not have a history of organized opposition to Stalinism and Pabloism ( pseudo - Trotskyism ) , the school fails as a center of Marxist political leadership , whose task is " to raise the subjective factor to the level of the objective and to bring the consciousness of the masses closer to the understanding of the historical necessity — in simpler terms , to explain to the masses their own interests , which they do not yet understand . " [ 41 ]
The Marxist party is not the Frankfurt School , and Marxists are not Marcuseans .
Confirming their anti-Marxism , Steiner and Brenner say things like " [ David ]
North 's attacks on ‘ neo- utopianism ' are part and parcel of his objectivism , of his capitulation to spontaneous consciousness .
Confronting anti-utopianism is an essential part of confronting the problems of the development of political consciousness in the working class , " and " anti-utopianism that is the real expression of political pessimism . " [ 42 ]
There is no precedent in Marxist political practice for the infusion of Utopian ideas and impulses — to say nothing of the sexual - libidinal conception of Eros — into the working class through the agency of workers ' power ( i.e. , the revolutionary party ) .
That was not a fundamental political necessity of the scientific socialist program outlined in the Communist Manifesto , nor of the struggle waged by the Bolsheviks , nor of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917 , nor of the struggle of the Left Opposition , nor of the struggle of the Fourth International , and it is not a political necessity in the work of the ICFI .
If Steiner and Brenner do not believe that their false petty - bourgeois ideology is antithetical to Marxism , they can read , along with chapter seven of Results and Prospects , Trotsky 's 1908 literary sketch " On Death and Eros , " which is set in a Parisian café and whose main characters are a Marxist journalist , a professor of philology , and a shy young man .
The two antagonists accuse the Marxist of denying that much of life is taken up by sex and death , and they speculate on the sexually harmonious " new man " of the future .
The protagonist comes to his own defense :
" First of all , you were wrong to interrupt me .
Secondly , you very unskillfully construct the man of the future in your own image .
Thirdly , let me tell you frankly that I have yet to spend one sleepless night thinking of the feelings of the man of the future .
Let him make his own order within himself : as for us [ historical materialists ] , we shall be content with having left to him a good economy outside himself . " [ 43 ]
Subsequently :
" You want harmony ?
Whether or not you can set this longing of yours for personal harmony in a social perspective , you must admit that harmony without completeness , without retention of all that we have won through the torments of historical development , harmony attained through surgically removing all contradictions and through psychological oversimplification is absolutely unacceptable , even if it were n't a hopeless utopia .
Dans le véritable amour c'est l'âme qui enveloppe le corps ( in true love , it is the soul that envelops the body ) .
On the stem of sexual love such psychological flowers have grown as we neither want nor dare give up .
For otherwise what we should get would be the ‘ harmony ' of the cattle - yard . " [ 44 ]
Self - reflective Utopias , psychological oversimplifications , and pseudo - psychoanalysis that dictate Eros , love , and sex are " absolutely unacceptable " in the political perspective , program , and principles of revolutionary Marxism ( Trotskyism ) and the present - day embodiment of Trotsky 's Fourth International , the International Committee of the Fourth International .
Frommism is not a political alternative
Erich Fromm , a member of the Frankfurt School from 1928 to 1938 and Marcuse 's intellectual rival , whom Steiner and Brenner occasionally invoke , said that Marcuse 's praise of sadism as an expression of human sexual freedom , and the idea that the goal of happiness is achieved through unlimited expression of sexual instincts , betrayed his ignorance of Freud . [ 45 ]
But Fromm did call Marcuse 's Reason and Revolution : Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory ( 1941 ) a " brilliant and profound book , " a " brilliant and penetrating book , " " the most important work [ in the United States ] which has opened up an understanding of Marx 's humanism , " and Fromm recommended it with Soviet Marxism : A Critical Analysis ( 1958 ) to understand the philosophical basis of Marx 's thought . [ 46 ]
Despite emphasizing the misunderstandings , misinterpretations , and distortions of psychoanalysis in Eros and Civilization , Fromm made the following statement in " The Alleged Radicalism of Herbert Marcuse : " " [ H ] is position is exactly opposite the one presented in my books , although in some respects there are affinities to the line of critical thought that I expressed not only in my early writings at the beginning of the 1930s but also in Escape from Freedom ( 1941 ) and in subsequent books . " [ 47 ]
This admission of the " affinities to the line of critical thought " in Fromm 's own " early writings " and " subsequent books " points to the fact that Fromm and Marcuse were not fundamentally divergent thinkers , but figures whose intellectual tendencies had parallel and converging points of development .
Their differences were real , but not decisive enough to render their views philosophically and politically incompatible .
Fromm may have been disowned by the family of neo -Marxism , but he was still related to it .
Fromm 's revision of psychoanalysis , termed " humanist psychoanalysis " or " humanistic psychoanalysis , " is not an alternative to Marcusean " left " Freudianism , nor is it is wise to adopt Fromm 's socio- psychoanalytic categories in Marxist analysis for the fundamental reason that entrenched in Fromm 's neo -Marxist / neo-Freudian social psychology is a theory of politics and society that is indebted to the non-Marxist theory of " state capitalism " and to the politically reformist Socialist Party of America ( SPA ) .
Fromm joined the SPA in the mid-1950s , drafted its revised program in 1960 , and retained membership in the reorganized Socialist Party USA after the 1972 - 1973 SPA split .
Fromm rejected Lenin 's position on consciousness and spontaneity ; he believed Lenin had " no faith in man ; " he saw the revolutionary party ( contrary to the historical evidence ) as an elitist organization ; and he said the " destruction of Socialism " began with Lenin . [ 48 ]
Making Lenin responsible for Stalin , Fromm added that Lenin " had not believed that quality of character was important for a person 's function . "
The psychoanalyst also brushed off the dictatorship of the proletariat as " nebulous and misleading , " saying the " great weakness " of Marx and Lenin was that they " had no concrete plans for a socialist or communist society . " [ 49 ]
The hopeless Utopianism of Fromm is seen not only in his rejection of Marxism , but also in his rejection of the masses of workers .
As far as he was concerned , the middle class was the more alienated class ( psychologically speaking ) , workers were only " manual workers , " and , as the argument goes , an ever decreasing minority of the population . [ 50 ]
The essence of Fromm 's so - called " humanistic socialism " is thus :
" Today [ 1976 ] , the appeal of the new society goes to all who suffer alienation , who are employed , and whose property is not threatened .
In other words , it concerns the majority of the population , not merely a minority .
It does not threaten to take anybody 's property , and as far as income is concerned , it would raise the standard of living of those who are poor .
High salaries for the top executives would not have to be lowered , but if the system worked , they would not want to be symbols of time past .
" Furthermore , the ideals of the new society cross all party lines : many conservatives have not lost their ethical and religious ideals [. . . ] , and the same holds true of many liberals and leftists .
Each political party exploits the voters by persuading them that it represents the true values of humanism .
Yet behind all political parties are only two camps : those who care and those who do n't care .
If all those in the camp that cares could rid themselves of party clichés and realize that they have the same goals , the possibility of change would seem to be considerably greater ; especially so since most citizens have become less and less interested in party loyalty and party slogans .
People today are yearning for human beings who have wisdom and convictions and the courage to act according to their convictions .
" Given even these hopeful factors , however , the chances for necessary human and social changes remain slim .
Our only hope lies in the energizing attraction of a new vision .
To propose this or that reform that does not change the system is useless in the long run because it does not carry with it the impelling force of a strong motivation .
The ‘ utopian ' goal is more realistic than the ‘ realism ' of today 's leaders .
The realization of the new society and new Man is possible only if the old motivations of profit and power are replaced by new ones : being , sharing , understanding ; if the marketing character is replaced by the productive , loving character ; if cybernetic religion is replaced by a new radical - humanistic spirit . " [ 51 ]
No working class struggle , no political parties , no expropriation of the capitalist class , no abolition of the profit system — but ethical and religious ideals , wisdom , convictions , courage , hope , a new vision , a Utopian goal , a productive loving character , and a new radical - humanistic spirit .
This is not scientific socialism but the superstitious belief in prayers and miracles .
In a revealing display of Frommism in practice , eight years before the above - cited lines were published , Fromm supported Democrat Eugene McCarthy for the 1968 presidential nomination .
A decade earlier , Fromm helped organize the liberal nuclear - pacifist pressure group SANE , now called Peace Action .
McCarthy , who died in 2005 at the age of 89 , played a critical role in the political crisis of 1968 .
Patrick Martin of the World Socialist Web Site writes :
" McCarthy was quite conscious that his overriding task was to block the development of an independent political movement against the Vietnam War that would break with the two main capitalist parties .
In announcing his candidacy on November 30 , 1967 , he declared his intention to combat any tendency ‘ to make threats of support for third parties or fourth parties or other irregular political movements . '
This defense of the two - party political monopoly , at the moment of its greatest crisis in the post - World War II period , was a vital service to the American ruling elite . " [ 52 ]
Fromm had no grasp of Marxism either as philosophy or politics .
This is seen in the incorporation of religious mysticism into his work — particularly Talmudism and Zen Buddhism — despite his declared atheism .
A neo -Marxist like Marcuse , Fromm ultimately did not understand materialist dialectics .
He falsely described Marx 's philosophy as " spiritual existentialism in secular language " and " prophetic messianism , " and he said Marx 's socialism is " the realization of the deepest religious impulses common to the great humanistic religions . " [ 53 ]
Marxism is a science and has nothing to do with religion and religious impulses .
Frommism , in contrast , is penetrated by liberal bourgeois humanism , petty - bourgeois subjectivism , and religious ideologies .
Despite Marcuse 's charge that Fromm was a conformist and revisionist , Marcuse himself does not fare well against the politics of modern Marxism ( i.e. , orthodox Trotskyism ) .
He was a professorial idealist and Utopian academic leftist .
Steiner and Brenner may not place as much faith in Fromm as they do in Marcuse ; however , their various citations of Fromm 's writings indicate philosophical affinities with certain of his perspectives .
Consequently , in spite of their leanings to Marcusean psychoanalysis , Steiner and Brenner select what they want from Frommism and eclectically incorporate it into their Utopian socialist project .
Neo -Marxism and post- modern Marxism
The intellectual line of development of neo-Marxism , including its petty - bourgeois politics and non-dialectical materialism , has made it assimilable into the reactionary subjective idealist school of post - modernism , whose leading representatives include Blanchot , Baudrillard , Deleuze , Derrida , Foucault , Lacan , Levinas , and Lyotard .
Critical theorists like the American academic Fredric Jameson , for example , are on the borderline between the neo-Marxists and post - modernists .
Steiner and Brenner are not too far from this borderline social milieu .
" By the 1990s , critical theory had expanded in meaning from the original Frankfurt School work to represent a broader body of scholarship in post - modern , post - colonial and cultural studies . [. . .]
The Frankfurt School had been transformed from a relatively obscure network of scholars to become an influential school of thought on the margins of the academy , " says one commentator . [ 54 ]
Neo -Marxism has turned into post - modern Marxism , or , in the more fashionable academic terminology , post -Marxism .
It is outside the scope of this essay to address post - Marxism in any detail .
Suffice it to say that when Ann Talbot and Chris Talbot speak of " Steiner 's light - minded approach of picking up books and ideas as and where he can , " and continue , " His theories are a melange of such objets trouvés [ found items ] .
He is always eclectic , ungrounded and erratic .
His work reveals a mind in chaos .
The one theme that binds it together is a constant hostility to objective thought and resistance to its liberation from the authority of dogma , " [ 55 ] their characterization could as well be applied to Slavoj Zizek , a leading figure in post -Marxism .
Despite Zizek 's formal criticisms of post - modernism , an article in the inaugural issue of the International Journal of Zizek Studies describes him in the following terms : " Slavoj Zizek represents the new post - modernist left in all the energy and conceptual audacity of its effort to formulate strikingly new concepts and boldly go where we could not as long as our thought was hedged in by the need to preserve the guarantees .
Zizek is ( arguably ) the most important theorist on the left today . " [ 56 ]
The Slovenian philosopher sits on the editorial board of the journal named after him .
Zizek , who is not unlike Steiner and Brenner in their Utopian project to synthesize Marcusean psychoanalysis and Marxism , combines Lacanian psychoanalysis and something that passes for Marxism .
This eclecticism is seen in the book that launched Zizek 's name , The Sublime Object of Ideology ( 1989 ) , which is prefaced by the political opportunist Ernesto Laclau , co-author with Chantel Mouffe of Hegemony and Socialist Strategy ( 1985 ) .
Zizek is a haphazard and pretentious thinker , and his politics leaves much to be desired .
He is not a Marxist .
This does not mean neo-Marxism and post - Marxism are synonyms .
Zizek , in his rambling postface to Georg Lukacs ' Tailism and the Dialectic ( 2002 ) , criticizes the Frankfurt School for its tradition of " almost total absence of theoretical confrontation with Stalinism . "
The school maintained " the official mask of its ‘ radical ' leftist critique " and did not acknowledge its solidarity with liberal bourgeois democracy , as that would have deprived the critical theorists of " their ‘ radical ' aura . " [ 57 ]
But it is precisely this pseudo - Marxist aura that both the neo- and post - Marxists share .
Ironically , Steiner claims that " feelings of ‘ party - patriotism ' will blind many members and supporters " from seeing " the [ Socialist Equality ] party 's abstentionism and estrangement from the working class , " and that " the SEP 's theoretical degeneration " has been laid bare in Marxism without Its Head or Its Heart . [ 58 ]
Steiner has a very low opinion of the ability of SEP members and supporters to seriously think through theoretical , political , and historical questions .
In relation to the historical development of Marxism , it is especially important to note Steiner and Brenner 's denunciations of Georgi Plekhanov , the founder of Russian Marxism .
Their attack on this outstanding theoretician is another example of their contemptuous attitude toward the heritage of the Marxist movement .
Steiner and Brenner would have their readers believe that their assessment of Plekhanov is in keeping with Lenin 's critique of the leaders of the Second International in the aftermath of the outbreak of the first imperialist world war in 1914 .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Steiner and Brenner 's repudiation of Plekhanov 's theoretical work reproduces not the attitude of Lenin and Trotsky , but that of the petty - bourgeois intellectuals of the Frankfurt School .
Notwithstanding Lenin and Trotsky 's bitter opposition to Plekhanov 's politics after 1914 , the co-leaders of the Russian Revolution continued to view him as a great Marxist theoretician .
Steiner began his series of attacks on David North by denouncing the latter 's appraisal of Plekhanov 's theoretical work ; however , Steiner conveniently ignores what the Bolsheviks wrote about the Russian Marxist .
Steiner and Brenner say that " Plekhanov 's version of the dialectic was superficial and fatally flawed , " [ 59 ] and that he was a " mechanical materialist who believed in the inevitability of socialism emerging as a result of the maturation of objective conditions . " [ 60 ]
But Voronsky , writing in 1920 , explained that " Plekhanov completely mastered both the spirit and method of Marx 's teachings .
Under his pen the revolutionary doctrine became animated with all its flexibility , profundity and merciless severity . " [ 61 ]
Aside from the falsification of history undertaken by Steiner and Brenner , the fundamental substance of their allegations is that the ICFI has adopted Plekhanov 's " objectivism " and that " dialectics is a dead letter " in the ICFI . [ 62 ]
For the record , the Marxist party does not create mass working class struggles .
The inevitability of revolutionary events is the outcome of the structural contradictions and crisis of capitalism .
Steiner and Brenner 's criticism reproduces the basic objections of the Frankfurt School to the Marxist insistence that objective social being determines subjective social consciousness , that social revolution is the historically determined outcome of objective socioeconomic processes , and that the principal pedagogical task of the revolutionary party is to develop within the working class a scientifically grounded understanding of capitalist society and the class struggle .
The attack on " objectivism " — whether of Plekhanov or , for that matter , North — is , in essence , a rejection of historical materialism .
The era of social revolution develops out of the objective situation .
Through no fault of their own , workers do not spontaneously develop socialist consciousness from objective conditions .
The political consciousness of workers is , however , radicalized by the force of the objective , that is , by the material and economic .
As Marx said , " It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence , but their social existence that determines their consciousness . " [ 63 ]
Material life has a material impact on consciousness , and thereupon arises social opposition by the workers themselves .
This has been seen , for example , in the courageous but limited struggle of the 250 laid - off workers at Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago , Illinois .
When the company folded up , the workers occupied their factory for six days , beginning on December 5 , 2008 , winning wages and benefits they were legally entitled to .
The mass social struggle in Greece is also testimony to the self - action of the working class .
When Athens police murdered fifteen - year - old student Alexis Grigoropoulos on December 6 , Greek society exploded with tens of thousands of students , youth , and workers taking to the streets nationwide in protests , strikes , and battles against armed riot police .
The ongoing struggle is fundamentally underlain by deteriorating social conditions in the midst of the world financial crisis .
The Marxist party fights for an independent perspective — an understanding of the nature of the objective situation and its revolutionary implications — political authority in the international working class , and the tasks that will confront workers in the era of social revolution , in the era of the workers ' self - emancipation .
As a revolutionary mood begins to develop among workers , intellectuals , and youth , they will utilize internet and communication technologies to organize their struggle ; they will become increasingly aware of the presence and interventions of the World Socialist Web Site and the ICFI ; and they will determine on their own if the ICFI is the party and leadership that defends and serves their class interests .
In closing , the psychodynamic Utopianism of Herbert Marcuse and the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory has a had a profound impact on the political orientation of Alex Steiner and Frank Brenner .
Both men provide sufficient indication of their departure from revolutionary Marxism and materialist dialectics into the realm of neo-Marxist subjective idealism and the post - Marxist borderline .
Their assertions cannot be taken seriously on political and logical grounds .
There is too much middle - class radicalism , too much impatience , too much reductio ad absurdum , and too much that is foreign to Marxism in their entire line of argumentation .

March 19 , 2009 : Real News Network report of the FMLN 's presidential election win .
March 15 , 2009 -- Telesur --
The president - elect of El Salvador Mauricio Funes , together with his supporters , celebrated the victory in the elections held today in this Central American country , giving a speech in which he said that with their vote the people had signed " a new accord on peace and reconciliation " .
Shortly after the Supreme Electoral Tribunal ( TSE ) issued its second bulletin that officially confirmed the FMLN 's lead , Funes addressed the nation , congratulating all the citizens who participated in the elections .
" I want to thank all who voted for me , all who defeated fear , all who chose the path of hope " , he said .
Funes added : " Today , the public who believed in hope and defeated fear have triumphed .
This is a victory for all the Salvadoran people . "
Funes made a phone call to congratulate the rival party for their work , emphasising that " ARENA ( Nationalist Republican Alliance ) will become the opposition from now on , and in that capacity , rest assured that the party will be respected and heard " .
He invited various social and political groups to build a new welfare state for the people .
" I want to appeal to the other political forces to work toward unity " , Funes said , as he promised to carry out " preferential actions " to benefit the poor rather than the rich , in order to solidify an efficient and competitive economy and a broad business base .
Funes said that , beginning with his inauguration , he will work to make El Salvador " the most dynamic economy in Central America " .
" I want to be the president of social change and reconstruction .
It 's time to move forward to the future and leave behind the revenges of the past " , he added .
Funes also said that he will collaborate with former president Elías Saca in the last days of his administration .
With the victory of the Salvadoran left , the country breaks with 20 years of the rule of the ARENA party , which in these elections depended on a victory of its candidate Rodrigo Ávila .
According to the TSE 's report , 8654 certified election results containing 90.68 % of the votes were scrutinised .
The victory of the FMLN was confirmed by 51.27 % of the votes that it won , more than the 48.73 % that went to the conservative ARENA party .

Caracas , March 15 , 2009 -- ABN --
The President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , Hugo Chavez Frias , through a statement released by the Ministry of People 's Power for Foreign Affairs , congratulated the President - elect of the Republic of El Salvador , Mauricio Funes , who obtained more than 51 per cent of the votes thanks to the massive participation of the Salvadoran people .
Following the full statement :
The President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , Hugo Chavez , on behalf of the people of Bolivar , welcomes the unquestionable and resounding victory of brave journalist Mauricio Funes and the Farabando Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) in presidential elections that took place in El Salvador on Sunday , March 15 , 2009 .
This victory strengthens the historic wave that , in this first decade of the 21st century , has arisen in all of Latin America and the Caribbean , and opens its doors to other sibling peoples in the challenges they will face .
Today , the Salvadorian people did not waver ; they stepped forward and displayed their clarity and courage , defeating a campaign of lies , trash and manipulations unleashed against the Bolivarian Republic and against progressive and dignified leaders of Latin America and the Caribbean .
These disgraceful campaigns fomented by the international right wing in our continent were destroyed today by the consciousness of the majority of the Salvadorian people .
President Hugo Chávez congratulates President - elect Mauricio Funes , reminding him that the unity of our peoples is the only path to overcome the crisis unleashed from the heart of capitalism in the North .
In this crucial moment , the children of Bolivar offer our hands in solidarity to President Mauricio Funes , so that together we may advance in the strengthening of this new era we are living through , together overcoming underdevelopment and poverty .
Today we Venezuelans are happy , and in this hour of happiness we recognise the leader of peace , Shafik Handal , and the many men and women who gave their lives for the rebirth of the Salvadorian people .
We recognise them with a song by Ali Primera : “ Go Salvadorians , for there are no small birds that stop flying after taking off . ”
Let us fly together , El Salvador and Venezuela , towards our great homeland of the Americas in the time of the people .
El Salvador May Join ALBA
ZoomHavana , March 18 ( Prensa Latina ) -- he newly - elected government of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador is interested in strengthening ties with ALBA countries , FMLN representative in Cuba Alfredo Elias said .
According to Elias , El Salvador has already been benefitting from the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) by getting oil , fertilisers and medical aid Venezuela and Cuba , ALBA 's two main pillars .
`` We should establish relations with all nations ' ' , Elias said on Cuba´s national television .
He also said reestablishing diplomatic ties with Cuba should be a priority for the future government .
" For us , Cubans are blood brothers " , said the FMLN representative , who recalled Cuba 's solidarity to El Salvador .
`` In the past , Cuban hospitals were open to our war victims , while right now , many Salvadorans are having free eye surgery here , or are studying at Cuban universities ' ' , Elias said .
According to Elias , the FMLN will inherit a complex social panorama in El Salvador , characterised by extreme violence and emigration to the United States , as well as a free trade agreement with the US government that resulted in layoffs , a devastated agriculture , increased tariffs and the dollarisation of the economy of one of the poorest countries in the region .
``Based on that , we asked all social organisations and the people for support to design an action program that will prioritise the reactivation of agriculture '' , he explained .
Sunday FMLN 's victory in El Salvador put an end to 20 years of administration by the rightwing National Republican Alliance ( ARENA ) .
The new government will be sworn in on June 1 .
ALBA is made up of Cuba , Nicaragua , Honduras , Bolivia , Dominica and Venezuela .
So -called " slasher " flicks may never be the same , thanks to an innovative Japanese company 's new " knife proof " T - shirts .
The owner of Nihon Uni , a uniform maker based in Osaka , Japan , was inspired to create a super - strong yet practical shirt by watching news reports of knife attacks against children and convenience store clerks .
Gun ownership ( and gun crime ) is extremely rare in Japan so bullet - stopping clothing used by the world 's armies is unnecessary .
Instead , knives are attackers ' usual weapons of choice and Nihon Uni acted on that premise when designing the new anti-knife T - shirts .
Nihon Uni first looked at the tough aramid fiber ( often referred to by DuPont 's brand name , " Kevlar " ) used in military body armor , then reduced the thickness and density of the ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber so that it could be flexible enough to serve as everyday clothing .
The resulting T - shirts are about three times as strong as those made from cotton fibers , yet are still light enough to be comfortable and machine washable .
Now there are some downsides to the new protective T - shirts , one of them being the very un - T - shirt - like price ... 19,000 to 52,000 yen ( approx . $ 195 to $ 535 ) for the short - sleeve version and from 22,000 - 59,000 yen ( approx . $ 225 to $ 610 ) for the long - sleeved design .
Somehow I do n't think 7 - 11 is about to pony up that kind of dough .
Nihon Uni also says that while the new T - shirts are slash - resistant , the fabric cannot withstand a direct thrust from the point of a knife .
Umm , guys ... you might want to keep that little infobit under your hats - robbers can read too .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Ernie Casillas lived the good life as he doled out millions of dollars in loans in California .
The former banker drove fancy cars and took extravagant vacations .
Ernie Casillas says that being unemployed has grounded him from his high - flying days in the banking sector .
But with the banking industry in crisis , his job is gone -- as is his lavish lifestyle .
Desperate for work , he recently swallowed his pride and posted a message on Craigslist : " Unemployed I need a job . "
" It took a lot for me to put that ad on Craigslist , because I had to change what I was before , " he said , breaking down in tears .
" I was n't this rich little yuppie anymore , driving expensive cars , having expensive suits .
I 'm in this just like everybody else looking for work .
It humbles you .
This is real . "
Casillas , 46 , is like tens of thousands of out - of - work Americans turning to Craigslist , the online classified ad Web site where people can post information for free .
The site says it has 50 million users , most of them in the United States .
More than 2 million new jobs are posted each month , according to Craigslist .

Many have begun posting messages of desperation seeking work .
Some post their résumé and phone number ; others swap goods online .
iReport :
Tell us how you 're getting by
Casillas said it was a humbling experience to finally post his message on the site .
Once responsible for bringing in $ 400,000 in cash per month for a credit union , he has been out of work for the past four months and now lives with his mother in suburban Los Angeles .
He had tried newspaper ads and other online job sites , with no great success .
Then one night , he posted a simple message on Craigslist .
Watch as jobless search for work , food , clothes on the Internet »
" I have over 20 years of experience in sales , telephone sales in a call center , customer service , administrative assistant , cash handling , teller , and many more skills and abilities .
Great personality , very friendly , hard worker , very responsible , " it said .
" I will be happy to e-mail you my resume .
I need a job now .
Please call my cell phone . "
Watch a humbled banker describe " this is real " »
Casillas said he teared up when he first began typing the message -- that his life had come unraveled so hard and so fast .
But ultimately , he said , he decided , " I 'm just going to put it out there .
I 'm not going to be embarrassed .
I 'm just going to tell the whole world : I 'm unemployed , and I need a job today .
And the response was great . "
" My phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing with people interested in my ability to think outside the box , " he said , adding that he now has three good leads on potential jobs .

The whole experience has given him a dose of humility .
He is a self - described former yuppie going through turbulent times .
When he sees homeless people these days , he wants to help them .
The son of a Mexican immigrant , Casillas says , he was successful , making about $ 70,000 a year in the banking industry .
Adding to his hard times , he and his wife have recently separated .

" I was just living a very good life , " he said .
" My daughter would ask me to take her to Las Vegas for her birthday , and we would stay at the most expensive hotels .
Every year , this is what she wanted . "
His daughter is now 11 .
He takes her to the mall every now and then .
They do n't buy anything on the trips , he says .
He tells her , maybe next time .
He says that living with his 75 - year - old mother has helped ground him again .
" She has brought me down to Earth , being very humble . "
Across town , in the coastal community of Redondo Beach , Craigslist and the down economy have brought together two strangers .
Jill Gardner has been unemployed after being laid off from her job at a refinery in June .
She 's now trying to get into the hospitality field , but with her cash running low , she could n't afford new clothes for job interviews .
So she posted a message for clothes .
" I just decided to swallow my pride and try it and see what happens , " she said .
" It 's not easy , because I 've never had to ask for things like that before , and it's hard not to provide for myself . "
She said some creepy men called saying they would buy her clothes for " favors . "
However , two women responded with genuine help .
One of those was Bonny Sue Robbins , a paralegal who brought Gardner an array of business suits , cocktail dresses and summer clothes .
" I felt that I owed it to another sister to help her on her way .
I also was struck by the positiveness of her request .
It was n't just ' give me , give me . '
It was ' help me help myself , ' and I thought that was worth rewarding , " Robbins said shortly after handing over the goods .
Robbins said that a few years back , she went through a tough divorce .
" I was lucky that there were people there when I needed it , and I feel it 's kind of my chance to pay back . "
Both women hugged before parting .
" You 're an angel , " Gardner said .
Robbins responded , " We 'll keep in touch so that I can go out and celebrate when you get your new job . "
" Definitely .
And I 'll buy ! "
Gardner said .
Back at her home , Gardner tried on one of her new business suits .
" I'm very grateful , " she said .
" I 'm just going to go forward with my plan and get a job . "

j Query UI 1.7
Posted on by
We ’re excited to announce that we ’ve finalized version 1.7 of the jQuery UI library ; we think this is a momentous release and a major leap forward on a host of fronts .
What ’s new ?
There ’s a ton of new stuff in 1.7 .
We ’ve fixed hundreds of bugs since 1.5.3 and are introducing many new features , a better core architecture , and major theming improvements .
We blogged about it already for the rc’s , but here is quick list of the highlights :
Getting Started with 1.7
If you ’re brand new to jQuery UI , or if you ’ve worked with a version posted before [ January 2009 ] , there are some changes to the API and directory structures that would be helpful to understand .
To get everyone up to speed fast , we ’ve created a Getting Started Guide that walks through the basics of what jQuery UI 1.7 can do , how to use themes , and how to download and use the new jQuery UI for the first time .
Upgrading to 1.7 from previous versions
To ease the transition to version 1.7 , we ’ve created a detailed Upgrade Guide that summarizes what has changed for each plugin .
If you want to dig into the details , you can view the full 1.7 Changelog which lists every change made in this release .
What about jQuery 1.2.6 compatibility ?
As we announced earlier , jQuery UI 1.7 is only compatible with the latest jQuery 1.3+ .
Now that 1.7 is out the door , we ’re turning our attention to creating a jQuery 1.6 legacy release ( based on 1.6r c2 ) that will roll as many bug fixes as possible into the 1.5.3 codebase and be compatible with jQuery 1.2.6 .
We ’re hoping to have this complete within the next month .
To learn more about this split release approach , please see jQuery UI 1.7 is the new 1.6 .
Get involved : Join us on the planning wiki !
We welcome your participation and feedback as we grow into a larger project .
To keep us organized and make planning transparent to the community , we ’ve created a new design and planning wiki at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/, where we ’re refining and detailing our processes for growing the team and the project , accepting and reviewing contributions , and prioritizing new plugins into a roadmap .
By channeling ideas and decisions made on the jQuery UI Dev google group conversations into the wiki , we hope to provide a single , unified view of our current thinking .
To see what we ’re up to , check the summary of the current development status at the top of the wiki homepage .
Thanks !
Last but not least , we really want to thank all of the ( nearly 300 ) contributors that helped make this release what it is .

Sayed Pervez Kambaksh , the student journalist sentenced to death for blasphemy in Afghanistan , has been told he will spend the next 20 years in jail after the country 's highest court ruled against him – without even hearing his defence .
The 23 - year - old , brought to worldwide attention after an Independent campaign , was praying that Afghanistan 's top judges would quash his conviction for lack of evidence , or because he was tried in secret and convicted without a defence lawyer .
Instead , almost 18 months after he was arrested for allegedly circulating an article about women 's rights , any hope of justice and due process evaporated amid gross irregularities , allegations of corruption and coercion at the Supreme Court .
Justices issued their decision in secret , without letting Mr Kambaksh 's lawyer submit so much as a word in his defence .
Afzal Nooristani , the legal campaigner representing Mr Kambaksh , accused the judges of behaving " no better than the Taliban " .
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into Afghanistan 's legal system and 149 British soldiers have died there since 2001 , but experts admit that state justice is still beyond the reach of most ordinary Afghans .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
President Hamid Karzai promised last year that justice would be done " in the right way " , after worldwide protests at how Mr Kambaksh was convicted .
But Mr Nooristani claimed yesterday that there was " no respect for the law " , even in the highest court in Afghanistan .
" They have ignored the principle of crime and punishment , they have ignored the principle of innocent until proven guilty .
They have got the same mindset as the Taliban . "
The Supreme Court 's decision means Mr Kambaksh 's best hope is now a presidential pardon , which will force Mr Karzai to choose between fundamentalists in his government and the rule of law .
It has also raised serious questions over the millions of dollars spent on Afghan justice reforms since 2001 , which appear to have been wasted .
Mr Nooristani said : " The whole system is corrupt .
Even with more investment , the system wo n't work . "
Mr Kambaksh was found guilty of blasphemy and sentenced to death last year for circulating an essay on women 's rights which questioned verses in the Koran .
It later emerged he was convicted by three mullahs , in secret , without access to a lawyer .
The sentence was commuted to 20 years on appeal .
At that appeal , in October , the key prosecution witness withdrew his testimony , claiming he had been forced to lie on pain of death .
The prosecution then appealed to the Supreme Court to reinstate the death sentence .
The defence appealed to quash his conviction altogether .
Meanwhile , the student has been languishing in a Kabul jail , fearing for his life .
Islamic fundamentalists have been baying for his blood while moderate groups have led marches countrywide demanding his release .
In February , the Supreme Court Judge Bahauddin Baha vowed the appeal would be held in " a very open court " but that promise has proved hollow .
Mr Nooristani said he was told of the verdict when he arrived to submit his written defence .
And Mr Nooristani has himself been threatened .
Prosecutors have warned him they are gathering evidence against him for " defending infidels " .
Western diplomats insist they have been lobbying hard to have the case reviewed .
But critics say their softly - softly tactic has n't worked .
" The Afghans know the money just keeps coming no matter what they do , " said an American lawyer in Kabul .
Even if Mr Kambaksh wins an 11th - hour pardon , there are thousands of people just like him , convicted illegally , with no recourse , support or international scrutiny .
Mr Kambaksh's case has been passed to the prosecutors ' office for " execution of the sentence " , which means he could be moved to Kabul 's notorious Pul-e Charkhi prison , or north to Mazar - i- Sharif , where he was first found guilty .
Both hold murderers , rapists and violent Taliban sympathisers .
Conditions inside are grim and both are prone to deadly riots .
A spokesman for the Supreme Court claimed there had been no irregularities in the case .
But a spokesman for the British embassy said : " We have serious concerns about the fairness of Mr Kambaksh 's trial .
We continue to call on the Afghan state to comply with the international human rights standards , to which it is a party – this includes the right to a fair trial . "
Our Pervez campaign
Worldwide outrage over Pervez Kambaksh's death sentence was sparked after The Independent reported his plight in January 2008 .
Our campaign led to the Afghan President Hamid Karzai being inundated with appeals , while political figures including the former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice lent their support .
The Government raised the matter directly with Afghanistan after more than 100,000 Independent readers signed the petition and in October 2008 a Kabul appeals court lifted the death sentence .
The court ruled however that he should serve 20 years , which his lawyers contested on the grounds that it was unconstitutional .
Has the latest fad , “ positive psychology , ” increased our happiness ?
Not according to a British author and cultural historian .
Positive psychology , defined as “ the study of optimal human functioning , ” has gained enormous popularity in the past decade .
But Richard Schoch , professor of the history of culture at Queen Mary , University of London and author of The Secrets of Happiness : Three Thousand Years of Searching for the Good Life , said there is more to be learned instead from the wisdom of the ancients .
In an April 2007 lecture at the University of London , he said that “ in ancient Athens , happiness was a civic virtue that demanded a lifetime ’s cultivation .
Now , it ’s everybody ’s birthright .
Somewhere between Plato and Prozac , happiness stopped being a lofty achievement and became an entitlement . ”
So in a journey across cultures and centuries , Schoch contemplated exactly what it takes to be happy .
And it ’s not “ positive psychology . ”
So many of its recommendations sound trivial or just confused , Schoch said , because it is based on a flawed premise .
The assumption that happiness equals positive emotion and the avoidance of pain and suffering may make happiness measurable , but it is “ a woefully insufficient model , ” Schoch said .
Positive emotions usually are temporary and it is impossible to feel good all the time .
So if we give up on the idea that to be happy is to feel good , what ’s left ?
A deeper , more subtle and more profoundly satisfying happiness , Schoch said .
Releasing our attachment to positive emotions means we can enjoy them without worrying about if and when they will end .
What ’s more , we can explore new ideas of what happiness can mean .
For example , in his book , Schoch relates the story of an 11th - century Iraqi scholar named al - Ghazali .
Rather than trying to think positively or improve his lifestyle , al - Ghazali explored what his distress could teach him .
He found that he had been valuing material possessions too highly , was ruled by his pride , and had reached a spiritual emergency .
Continued thought brought him to a new philosophy : “ cultivate the most precious form possible from the rough matter of your life . ”
His book , The Alchemy of Happiness , guided readers to transform their vices into virtues .
Research has shown that nations with higher mean incomes rate lower in happiness than poorer nations do .
This suggests that a minimum of material comfort is necessary .
True happiness requires a shift of focus from instant to delayed gratification and to helping others as well as ourselves .
Psychologists also highlight the importance of “ flow , ” a term to describe the common denominator among people who label themselves happy .
The most obvious component is intense concentration , which probably is why music , art , literature , sports and other forms of leisure have survived .
The essential ingredient for such concentration is a challenge to match one ’s ability in areas such as music , art , literature , and sports .

' Cheating husband tried to kill wife by rigging heat gun booby trap in their home ' , court hears
Ian Price leaves Birmingham Crown Court and stands accused of trying to murder his wife
A cheating husband plotted to murder his wife by using a timeswitch to burn their house down - while he was spending the night with his mistress , a court heard .
Kitchen planner Ian Price , 30 , plugged a heat gun normally used to strip wallpaper into a timer on an electrical socket and set it to come on in the middle of the night while his wife Joanne slept , it was claimed .
The improvised incendiary device worked as planned , sparking a blaze in the spare room of the Prices ' marital home , the jury heard .
Fortunately , Mrs Price woke in time to call the fire brigade and escaped unscathed - wrecking her husband 's alleged plan to murder her , and pay off his debts with £ 190,000 in life insurance and pension payouts .
Prosecutor Gordon Aspden told Birmingham Crown Court that Mr Price 's ' premeditated and well - planned ' attempt to kill his wife in November 2007 would have ' freed him from the double life he had been living for several months ' if successful .
Mr Aspden said : ' In order to keep himself out of harm 's way , Mr Price pretended he had to go out on business that night so he would not be at home .
' In truth , ladies and gentlemen , he spent the night with a lady with whom he had secretly been having an affair with for some time .
' The prosecution case is that this was a premeditated and well - planned attempt to kill an entirely innocent woman for entirely selfish reasons .
' Mr Price staged the whole thing to make it look like an accident . '
Mr Aspden said Mr Price had plugged the heat gun into the timeswitch behind a pile of wicker furniture and Christmas decorations , that hid them for view - and ' for good measure ' left a blow torch and gas cylinder nearby to help fuel the blaze .
Heat guns can produce temperatures of up to 1,200 degree farenheit , and should only be used with great care .
Mrs Price told the court how firemen showed her the device , which was set to midnight , after she escaped the fire .
She said : ' I was shocked and I just remember thinking , " I need to get in touch with Ian to find out what 's gone on " . '
He did not respond to calls or texts until the following morning .
The court was also told that Mrs Price was hoping to have a baby - and that her husband had previously tried to poison her by replacing the contents of her medicinal iron capsules with a nicotine mixture .
Nicotine can be fatal in even small doses .
Price allegedly set up an elaborate fire starting device , which he hoped would kill Joanne Price , in the home they shared , above
Mrs Price , who worked as a nurse at Lincoln County Hospital , discovered the tub of tablets and questioned him , but he told her that he had planned to take them himself .
Mr Aspden told the court that Mr Price , who worked as a kitchen planner for MFI , researched poisoning methods on the internet .
An investigation of his laptop found searches using the phrases ' untraceable poison ' , ' how to poison a person ' , and ' nicotine poison deaths ' dating back to 2006 , the court heard .
And in August 2006 , the jury was told , Mr Price began experimenting with poisons .
Mr Aspden said : ' Not only was Mr Price making home - made poisons , but he began to experiment with these poisons on his wife . '
Mrs Price noted that his behaviour was ' odd ' , and began to notice a strange taste in her food and drink , the court heard .
' Eventually she confronted her husband about it , and he denied putting anything in her food , ' Mr Aspden said .
A month after the confrontation , it was claimed , Mrs Price found in the kitchen a tub of ' thick brown treacle substance ' , which turned out to be a mixture of nicotine and caffeine .
The jury was told that Mr Price 's computer research into poisons resumed in September 2007 - two months before the fire .
During a police search of the couple 's property , nicotine residue was found on a bowl , a bread board and a milk pan in the kitchen .
The court was told that Price began his affair with another woman in March 2007 .
Price , who lived with his wife in Willoughton , near Gainsborough , Lincolnshire , denies attempted murder .
The case continues .

Everything has pros and cons .
So what am I writing this ?
Because I know many people would like to freelance 24/7 and get money from their chairs at home , working on what they love and being paid for stuff they really like to do !
As an advice , I 'll tell you about my own drama in the last months lol .
The goods :
Your own time and good $ $ $ Since I 've worked online for a big advertising company in Kuwait , another in US and another in Spain , most of my day I was sitting working and designing and designing and ... designing .
I loved it !
It was like a dream lolI had to quit my job as university teacher and part - time consultor on a local agency .
I was at home , with my family and my girl , and she handled all my accounts and balance pretty good .
BUT .
BUT .
BUTT .
The bads .
Most of the projects were small enough to give me the chance to handle everything with responsability , accurate timing and great quality .
The bad thing about it ( and I did n't consider that part ) was the fact my brain was n't doing a good job after some months with that workflow .
My ideas got stuck , my designs started to feel recursive and out of shape , and I started to spend more and more time on the same things I used to rush in only a few minutes .
How can it be possible ?
Because you need to take a break sometimes .
Talking about art can be subjetive , since many conceptual ideas can't be expressed accurately if you do n't have a clear idea of how to handle the technique and the communication concepts through your designs .
Imagine your brain is working at less speed and spreadage ... RIGHT !
you suck .
LOLSo ...
On a normal day my schedule was : I get up in the morning to work .
I take breakfast .
I get back to work .
I have lunch .
I get back to work .
I go to university .
I get back home and do homeworks and assignments .
I get back to work .
I go to bed and sleep .
Next day the same .
5 days a week .
4 weeks a month .
Around 11 months per year .
Yes !
Money can be really good ( more than you can even expect , sometimes ) .
But then I felt like I was working too much and I felt really tired .
Not physically , but more in a spiritual and mind - state context .
Since I did n't handle my own schedule in a proper way ( because everything came to me too quick and I was a complete newbie ) I got really sick and depressive , etc .
A few months ago I decided to stop freelancing like a whoreand now I 'm focusing on other things while I keep designing to earn a decent budget to mantain my family and pay my unviersity .
My savings will do ther restMy honest advice for the new freelancers !
Freelancing is good !
It can be great !
But always step on the ground with 2 feet and give enough time to your family , your girl , your man , your dogs , your car , your parties , your orgies , etc .
Everything needs attention , and once you can handle it all , you wo n't ever feel the pressure and stress because of your daily rythm .
What 's coming up next ?
I have a partnership already with PixelFuze and IconBlock , and I 'll release soon many exclusive goodies through them .
Also , I 'll open my own online studio in a couple of weeks and I 'll recruit some good people that will converge in a strong and sexy design team that you will love .
Stay tuned for more information in the next weeks !
So ... that 's it .
Sorry for the long read and thanks for the time you take for this guy called manicho .
Cheers , Moi.p.S.
Guess which company called CoolIris wants me .
Yep ! that one !
High stakes poker games , a " cow eating club " , brutal sackings and a team - building exercise in which an executive was strapped into a mock electric chair .
This was at the heart of this week 's legal battles over tax avoidance , according to whistleblowers .
They paint a picture of life in which summary dismissal , ritual humiliation , and social events to match the tales of famous banking excesses in the 1980s , are the norm .
The sources say this management culture has been integral to creating what is in effect a tax avoidance factory at Barclays headquarters at Canary Wharf .
Avoiding tax by exploiting legal loopholes was not seen as something questionable but rather the raison d'etre of the Structured Capital Markets department .
" There 's such a macho culture in SCM and the deals are so big you never say billion or million , you just say 16 bucks or 16 quid which meant billion , " one source said .
" The tax avoidance was so big it became the engine of growth for the whole of the investment banking arm . "
The energy to keep creating new trades that could allegedly generate hundreds of millions in tax profits came in part from fear .
Roger Jenkins , the chief executive of the SCM division , is said to have called in senior directors to announce that he was about to fire one of themon the basis of what deals they went out to do next .
" It was n't a joke , he meant it , " the source said .
On several occasions , the sources allege , staff have come in to work to find an email from Jenkins saying a colleague no longer worked there .
Sackings , which might be provoked by nothing more than failure to understand the unwritten rules of deference to the hierarchy , involved being marched out of the building by security guards .
The office is reportedly rife with internal politics .
In one example , a managing director who bought himself a Bentley was told by Jenkins that it was a very nice car , too nice in fact for Jenkins to want to see it outside the office .
Thereafter the executive 's chauffeur would drop him out of sight around the corner .
According to one whistleblower , a secretary was fired by another executive for booking a taxi that was a Volvo rather than an S class Mercedes .
While Jenkins excels at corporate politics , he is now increasingly taken up with Middle Eastern operations .
The brains of the SCM division are said to be Iain Abrahams .
A tall Scot , Abrahams has recently been elevated to chief risk officer .
Insiders refer to him as " Abes ' ' and describe him as " very , very clever , with an encyclopaedic knowledge of tax and accounting law " .
The most lurid tales come from team - building away - days .
Free cigars and champagne would apparently flow and at night poker tables would be set up .
" There 's a babies ' table and a big boys ' table .
The big boys ' table was all about showing who has got the biggest dick .
Jenkins and Abes were said to have a couple of hundred thousand pounds on a hand between them .
One executive made the mistake of beating Jenkins .
He later said his bonus was reduced by the amount of his poker winnings . "
On one away day , according to sources , Abrahams came on to the platform dressed in a Las Vegas showman 's costume .
Behind him were a series of props hidden behind sheets .
One was an electric chair .
As he strapped a director in , he had the line from the rock song that goes ' I hate you and I hope you die ' playing .
It was part humiliation , part making the point that anyone who gives away Barclays ' secret ' know - how ' on these deals would get it . "
Abrahams , according to one whistleblower , was also responsible for running projects that were kept completely under wraps , even from other members of the team .
" A couple of executors would go missing for a while to work on them and were always very reluctant to talk when they came back .
They were said to be deals for huge amounts , but it was all very secretive .
The SCM file room has a locked file and you never find out what is in it . "
Some aspects of this culture were not exclusive to Barclays .
One source has described the activities of the Cow Eating Club , a group of structured financiers across the industry who would get together for lunch on occasions at a French restaurant near Smithfield market in London called Le Café du Marche .
Here the bankerswould each order a whole cote de boeuf , marked on the menu as for a minimum of two people , and wash it down with a bottle of vintage red wine .
One source estimated that the SCM group had up to 70 tax trades in action each year .
He said that government efforts to crack down on tax avoidance had in fact stimulated new forms of it .
" There were two kinds of deals : the Accruals ones which brought in income over an extended period , and the Pop ones , which made money instantly .
We had moved away from Pop , but then as more anti-avoidance rules came in , the deals that did work got bigger and bigger to make up for the ones we'd lost and we started moving back towards Pop , do it quick , before it 's closed down . "
The Guardian put these whistleblower allegations to Barclays .
It did not respond to individual points but said in a statement that it complies with taxation laws in the UK and in all the countries where it does business .
It added that financing often has tax implications and both it and its clients have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to manage their tax affairs legally and efficiently .
It voluntarily discloses all transactions with a tax implication to HMRC with supporting papers and explanations , and provides them with further explanations and documentation as required .
" We place great emphasis on filing and meeting our HMRC ( HM Revenue and Customs ) compliance obligations in a prompt , transparent and timely manner .
This has enabled HMRC to carry out detailed and robust assessments of our tax affairs with an emphasis on our structured capital market transactions . "
It also said that Barclays was one of the UK 's largest taxpayers , contributing just under £ 10bn to the exchequer in the last five years .
an interview with charles simonyi
Space tourism is n't just a distant dream .
Some people actually managed to visit space just to see what it 's like .
It seems that when it comes to space travel , once just is n’t enough which is why the fifth space tourist to visit the ISS , Charles Simonyi , is currently training for his second trip into orbit .
And while this blog does n’t have a worldwide network of correspondents to catch up with Charles in Star City , the Russian aeronautics complex on the outskirts of Moscow ( maybe one day , but for the time being it ’s just me , a phone and a laptop ) , thanks to the team at Space Adventures , we got to discuss how he decided to venture into space and his views on this emerging industry .
Q : What inspired you to become a space tourist ?
A : I was amazed it was even possible for a physically normal person like me to take part in this kind of venture .
I took the first two week training course which was n’t in Star City but at a resort in Spain , and I was very impressed by all the experts and their level of knowledge .
After that , the next step was a thorough physical and I was pleasantly surprised that the doctors declared me as fit to go into space .
So at that time , any doubts I had were erased by professionals and I was very excited to go .
Q : What does your training consist of and what is it like to go through it again ?
A : My training is quite a bit shorter now , down from 8 months from the first flight to 3 months now .
There ’s a lot of Russian , a lot of re-familiarization of the technical aspects of flight .
There is a final exam coming up very soon so right now we ’re all getting ready for it .
Q : Do you feel the price tag for the trip was worth it ?
Where do you see prices for orbital space tourism going ?
A : The real question is n’t what it costs but whether you should go into space to begin with .
The prices [ for orbital tourism flights ] are going up right now , but they ’re just a fraction of the cost of what it takes to travel into space if you look at shuttle launches for example .
So really , there ’s no price gouging going on here .
I think that space programs are very important and I ’m happy to support them with my taxes but if there ’s a person willing to pay to fly , it ’s great too .
From a scientific standpoint , a professional astronaut or someone like me are the same .
My blood is as red as the professionals ’ so a study of early onset osteoporosis can be done on both of us and be scientifically valid , does n’t matter who pays to get a person in space in this regard .
Q : What do you think of space tourism as an industry ?
Do you think it ’s a viable business and if so , how and why ?
A : Well , viable compared to what is an important consideration .
I would say that space tourism is the only profitable proposition for manned flight .
Communications and scientific research can be done by unmanned craft with no risk to human life and they do a great job .
I think that we ’re overselling human spaceflight when we talk about Tang - like benefits .
Q : What do you think would be the ultimate trip for a space tourist in the next 5 to 10 years ?
A : I think weightless flights will be the most common space experience and I think that they will be very popular .
The next step will be sub-orbital flights and they ’ll be very popular too .
I think a really fantastic trip would be in an elliptical orbit around the Moon .
Just to see the Moon close up would be very exiting but for space tourists but a landing on the moon is very unrealistic .
It would be an exciting thing to do a spacewalk while in orbit .
You ’d have to get a younger person than me to do it though .
Q : What do you think of sub-orbital space tourism ventures like XCOR and Virgin Galactic ?
A : I think it ’s fantastic .
It will be like the internet .
Some business models [ for space tourism ] will succeed and others will fail .
I hope that nobody gets hurt in the process though because space is not a benign place .
Weightlessness for a few minutes is very pleasant but for the long term it has a risk attached .
There ’s also radiation which you have to take into account .
So before we go into space we need to learn a lot about it .
Q : How did you deal with space sickness while in orbit ?
A : I actually did n’t get space sick and I think that ’s great because I ’m a data point which can be used to figure out what causes space sickness , who gets it and how to mitigate it .
So that ’s my contribution ; to be an experimental subject .

[ Editor 's Note :
If you want to understand how modern propagandists ply their trade , you need to understand that disinformation agents and their skewed " explanations " are sequestered into the American culture usually years before the disinformation is called upon to bolster the propaganda that the Illuminated Luciferian Boys are trying to engender in the public 's mind .
In this case , we have web sites and military manuals explaining the reason behind the reversed star field orientation on a soldier 's Left sleeve flag and a Right sleeve flag being dependent on the flag 's star field 's physical proximity to the wearer 's heart .
You see , the star field , we are told , always has to be closest to the heart and therefore if a flag is sewn on the right sleeve of a US soldier 's uniform , the stars must be reversed in order to be physically closest to the heart .
Now that is certainly a lovely and sentimental ' explanation ' , however , it is also patently illogical and unjustified .
Whenever we change the normal orientation of a flag such as flying it upside down or flying it at half mast , it means something symbolically beyond the representation of the country 's origin .
The purpose of a flag sewn on a soldier 's sleeve is to identify the country of origin .
To sew it on in anything but the correct orientation is intended to send a hidden and symbolic message
Now if you know anything about the satanic New World Order Gang , you know that they are virtual slaves to symbolism , ritual , time and dates .
For example , the usual appearance for a five pointed star shows the vertical point going up with the two ' side arms ' and the two ' legs ' at 30 degree angles shown below .
However , if we take the vertical point and direct it downwards , we now have the satanic pentagram with the lower vertical point representing the face of the satanic goat ( Baphomet ) and the two ' legs ' above representing the horns .
The REVERSAL of ordinary symbols , even religious symbols , to represent a destructive , satanic meaning is seen everywhere in American life - if you know what you are looking for .
Jordan Maxwell and David Icke have done a good job in their lectures and books to illustrate the pervasive Illuminati ( satanic ) symbolism that 's plastered all over America .
In a separate article , I want to cover in greater detail the use of the satanic " X " symbol which has been slipped into American life in everything from Christmas greetings to TV shows and can even be seen as chemtrail ' satellite ' markings ... Ken Adachi ]

Hello Ken .
I am a big fan of your site , and am part of the c -b and eff forums .
I was catching up on some reading on your site today and was amazed at the June 28th article titled , " Why Do US Troops in Iraq Have the US Flag Sewn Backwards on Their Uniforms ? "
So , I did a little digging , just a little , and found two websites that seem to contradict themselves , but offer
* interesting * explanations .
http://slate.msn.com/?id=2080338
http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/flagetiq.html
( quoted from the above website )
What is the proper way to wear a flag patch on one 's shoulder sleeve ?
Left Flag Right or " reversed field " flag " To wear our country 's flag properly , the field of stars should be worn closest to your heart .
Thus , if your patch is to be worn on your LEFT sleeve , use a left flag .
For patches worn on your RIGHT sleeve , use a " right " or " reversed field " flag .
Since the law does not specifically address the positioning of the patch , a decision is left to the discretion of the organization prescribing the wear .
Some elect to use the " left "
flag on both sleeves .
[ Note : many states and cities have ordinances pertaining to the use of the flag ; you may wish to contact the Attorney General of your state or the City Attorney ’s office regarding this matter . ]
If you are planning to wear only one patch , it is recommended that you wear a " left " flag on your left sleeve .
Military guidelines specify that in support of joint or multi-national operations , the " right " flag is worn on the right sleeve , 1/ 4 " below the shoulder seam or 1/8 " below any required unit patches . "

Hi Mandie ,
Thanks for taking the time to look .
My gut feeling is that this info about wearing it closest to the heart is a disinfo cover .
We had a bunch of GI 's wearing the American flag on their uniforms in WW2 , and Korea and they always presented the flag in the traditional orientation on their sleeve .
It 's probably the satanic thing where they always REVERSE the original meaning or symbol to mean something satanic while the PJ people are unaware of the true meaning .
E.g. white dove , a rose , etc .
Regards ,
Ken

Hi Ken ,
The US flag photo essay from David Icke was a new revelation for me !
I had no idea !
Ken , does n't it fit with the satanic expression of distorting and reversing symbols to activate it 's opposite energy ?
The upsidedown stars on the Republican logo ( since 1995 ) come to mind .
Did n't the Swastika originally mean the " Creative Force " ( the sun symbol ) in ancient Phoenician history before the Nazis reversed it ?
It 's new energy therefore was destructive rather than creative .
I guess we can all agree they were certainly destructive .
Following that train of thought , if our flag normally symbolizes freedom , the reverse would be oppression and domination .
What do you think ?
With much respect , Rey

Josh Schmidt
Kalamazoo , MI
Hello Josh ,
I considered that possibility first , but if you look at the photos , the flags are sewn on with the star field to the right of the flag and not to the left .
You can't reverse the impression as you suggest .
The star field is closest to the front of the body on the right arm .
If you reverse the negative as you suggest , the person would be pointing in the opposite direction .
Try it yourself .
Take a digital photo of a flag on the right arm with the full body being seen and then reverse it .
You can't make the left arm appear to be the right arm and vice versa .
You 're doing it in your head and you 're getting confused .

Hello Ken ,
I 've been reading this article for lately and I can't help but be amused at some of your reader 's comments .
I was in the Army , stationed in Germany , and we had to put the reversed flags on our uniforms for a deployment to Kosovo .
I 've done a little research and I may be able to help shed some light on the subject .
Army Regulation AR 670- 1 " Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia " states :
" 28 - 18 .
Wear of full - color US flag cloth replica a. General .
During joint or multi-nation operations , soldiers are authorized to wear the full - color US flag cloth replica on utility and organizational uniforms .
Wear of the full - color US flag cloth replica is at the discretion of the organizational commander , when the distinguishing of individual national soldiers is desired , and overrides the tactical consideration of full - color insignia on uniforms .
During joint operations , the joint commander normally will prescribe the policy for wear .
Soldiers are not authorized to wear the full - color US flag cloth replica upon their return to home station ... ... ( 2) The full - color US flag cloth replica is worn so that the star field faces forward , or to the flag ’s own right .
When worn in this manner , the flag is facing to the observer ’s right , and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward .
The appropriate replica for the right shoulder sleeve is identified as the reverse side flag . "
This is the most recent change to the AR 670 - 1 updated on 5 Sept , 2003 .
The US Army Board Study guide gives us a little more insight as to why the flag is worn , but it does n't say why the it is only worn on the right sleeve instead of the left , which would give it the same " flying in the breeze " effect without having to be reversed .
I 'll try to do a little more research to find
out why .
A couple things have raised my suspicions though .
The AR 670 - 1 says " Wear of the full - color US flag cloth replica is at the discretion of the organizational commander , when the distinguishing of individual national soldiers is desired ... " , but the Army Study guide says " ... however the mandatory wear date of the US Flag Insignia on the Utility Uniforms is No Later Than 01 Oct , 2005 . "
Interestingly enough , the Army 's answer to this is " The Nation is at war and will be for the foreseeable future .
As an expeditionary Army , our Soldiers ' commitment to fight and win our Nation 's War , at home and abroad , is best exemplified by permanently wearing the US Flag insignia on the utility uniforms . "
So now all US Soldiers are required to wear the reversed flag patch , permanently , rather than soldiers actively involved in joint or multi-nation operations , and not upon return to their home station as prescribed by the AR 670 - 1 .
AR 670 - 1 states : " During joint or multi-nation operations , Soldiers are authorized to wear the full - color US flag cloth replica on utility and organizational uniforms ... ... Soldiers are not authorized to wear the full - color US flag cloth replica upon their return to home station . "
Could this also have something to do with the UN and the Illuminati's plan for a one world government ?
( see Myron Fagan 's Expose ' on The Illuminati and Council on Foreign Relations )
It seems odd that before only a select few ( Kosovo , Bosnia , Haiti deployments etc. ) would wear the reversed flag , but now ALL Soldiers in the US Army are now required to wear it .
Could this be the start of WWIII ?
It seems to me that it 's a definite possibility at this point .
I 'll keep digging to see what else I can find .
I 'll keep you updated as well but in the meantime , as always , keep up the good work , Good Luck and Godspeed .
Sincerely ,
Ken W .

Hi Ken ,
I was perusing the e-mails in regards to the symbolic signifigance of the reversed flags .
While I can not be sure as to their true purpose , I did find it interesting to come across these flags on buses .
You see , I ride the North County Transit buses to and from work here in North County San Diego [ California ] and just about every one of them has backwards flag stickers on the side towards the drivers ' mirrors in the front .
They are approximately 4 " X5 " .
I wish I had a digital camera but I do n't .
But they 're there , plain as day , along with those lovely chemtrails and ELF towers !!!
Freakin ' satanic bastards !
Man , those towers give me strange , strange vibes sometimes .
People think I 'm absolutely out of my mind when I just begin to attempt to launch into an explanation as to true nature of this truly horrifying agenda .
But my eyes are open , and I 'm trying to pry open the collective eyes of these sheeple as well .
Thank you for your time .

Actually the answer to this has n't been listed anywhere on your site yet and was in all the army manuals I read while I was in .
The flag is always shown as if it were flown on a staff .
The staff is on the side with the stars .
So , if you are walking forward while the flag is being flown , that is how the flag would appear from that side .
If you take a " left " flag and a " right " flag and sew them together , you have a " whole " flag .
The idea is that both patches are the same " flag " and you are seeing both sides of it .

Legally , the altering of the flag changes the law .
Entering a courtroom with an altered flag -- which 90 % of them now have , a gold tassel outline , etc , means you are no longer under U.S Constitutional rights .
I 'll give you the addy of my post , and the legal addy explaining the meaning of an altered flag .

First of all , the soldiers are not wearing the our flag backwards .
For example :
If you are looking forward at a flag pole and the wind is blowing from your right to your left , is the flag being flow backwards ?
Of course not .
This is the same rule that is being applied to the wearing of the flag .
AR 670 - 1 , states it in a different manner but with the same effect .
The flag is worn as it would fly .
( see responses )
To wear the flag facing the other way , what some consider the correct way , would be incorrect and disrespectful .
Secondly , and this is a valid point , if you want to get technical the soldiers are not wearing our flag backwards , heck , they are not even wearing our flag but in fact are wearing the " military national colors " .
I am sure that every one can see the gold boarder on the flag that they are wearing , signifying that it is the " military national colors .
One thing that I would like to know is why it was chosen to wear full color instead of a subdued version .
To me this is like wearing a colorful target on your uniform and totally reduces the effect that camouflage is supposed to entail .

Hi Leonard ,
I 'll publish your opinion on this topic .
I understand that you are giving me the explanation that was given to you for the backward flag on the uniform , however , I 'm claiming that the given explanation is a red herring ; a bogus claim and a bogus juistification .
I presume that you are in the military yourself .
You been given a crock of horse manure and you have bought it hook , line , and sinker
The flag is reversed because the people who run the military are under the control of corporate satanists and satanists reverse every symbol that stands for something good and wholesome in this country .
The red rose , the white dove , etc. - all Illuminati symbols .
Read David
Icke 's books if you want to know the real deal .
Believe what you wish .
You 're being duped .
Regards , Ken .
PS You 're not a flagpole .
You 're a human being .

Wow , thank you for responding .
Although I am not in the military I was at one time and my last assignment was in a unit that wore the nation military colors on the other shoulder .
What some consider the correct way .
It was the non -UN mission in Egypt called the MFO .
They still wear it this way .
As pointed out in an earlier letter , AR 670 - 1 leaves this up to the local Commander . ??
This is there a home page : http://www.mfo.org/homepage/homepage.asp
I 'm sure you are aware of this unit since they use the white dove in their organizational symbol .
I do not know if you intended your reply this way , but I find you telling me that I have been duped and the language used somewhat hostile .
But please understand that I am not saying that my opinion is the correct one .
Technically , when you are displaying any colors this way you are a flagpole , you just happen to be a living , breathing and animated version .
Do you think you could address the issue to me that they are in fact not wearing our flag at all , but the national military colors ?
I would like to know what you think .
Because to me this issue is really not an issue at all .
On another note ; the U.S. Flag is and has been displayed like this for many years .
In the late 60's and early 70's I did a lot of traveling .
When I entered a greyhound bus or an airliner from it right side I always saw the Flag , as what appeared to me at the time , to be displayed backwards .
So I bothered to ask , and as explained to me then , that when the vehicle is moving forward , as is almost always the case , the Flag is being displayed as if it were an actual cloth flag and flying in the wind .
For some reason this makes sense to me .
Then later in the military I found out the Flag should be worn as it would fly .
Again , this makes sense to me .
The U.S. Flag is still displayed this way on Greyhound buses and on many U.S. airliners , if not all , whether it is located near the forward entrance or on its vertical stabilizer .
And it is displayed on both sides of these vehicles .
Let me say that I really like educate - yourself.org and I feel it is beneficial to all whom seek out knowledge on their own .
And in no way did I intend for my letter to be taken as gospel or even as discrediting anyone else 's opinion , I was just relaying what I know of the subject .
Actually I wish I had more friends that had opinions like yours , or those that would be willing to inform me of such .
There is just so much information to be learned and I find most people to be uniformed .
It occurs to me that since this is an issue with many people and since there is no law that needs to be changed in regards to how our soldiers wear our Flag or the national military colors ( the one with the gold border ) , that this should be easier to get the regulations regarding such to be changed so that the Flag would be displayed the way most consider the correct way , secondly I would try to have it include that the Flag also be displayed above the unit patch , which is not always the case .
Some kind of campaign / petition that would entail contacting our senators , congressmen , the Commander in Chief , Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chief of Staff and the Armed Service 's Committee .
Anyone of these could implement a regulation change .
Just an Idea .
Thank you for the suggested reading material , unfortunately being on a non-connected VA pension ( fighting to get it to connected status ) , I am on a very limited budget and can not afford to make these purchases .
If my situation changes in the future ( hopefully ) , I look forward to reading them .
Best regards ,

Hi Leonard ,
Forgive my shortness .
I answered the way I did out of frustration because the vast majority of Americans , especially young Americans , do not realize that they are being led , day by day and step by step , towards their final demise by their own government , or more accurately , by the traitors at the highest levels of the government and military who are toiling on behalf of a satanic globalist cabal whose plan is to destroy America and most of its population in order to bring in the one world government .
They not only are bringing about the destruction of America by employing a very systematic and preplanned script , but they are using the American people themselves - truck drivers , policemen , firefighters , government employees , school personnel , postal workers , military people , etc. and the money of the American people to carry out the destruction agenda for them .
If you have ever seen film footage of Nazi troops at the beginning of the Holocaust in Europe , you saw that they forced the Jewish victims to first dig their own graves as a long continuous trench and then had them kneel down along the edge of the grave and they went down the line shooting them in the back of the head as each victim tumbled into the trench .
That 's exactly what 's happening to the American people .
They are digging their own graves with each pasing day and THEY DON'T KNOW IT .
And the least aware group of all , the most gullible and the easiest to deceive , are young 18 year old American kids coming out of high school who are suckered into joining the military with a lot of carefully planned psycho- bable designed to manipulate their emotions and appeal to their sense of ' duty ' with ' training ' and ' education ' bringing up the rear .
But when they get over to Iraq , they discover that the ' training ' has everything to do with killing - mostly innocent civilians - and nothing to do with ' liberation and freedom ' .
And they soon realize that they are aggressors , members of an invading , occupying army who are hated to the core by the people whose country they have invaded .
People who only want to live in peace and raise their children , but are forced to live the daily
Hell of a war zone because of young American soldiers who were put there to ' liberate ' them by an Alfred E. Newman look - a- like with a room temperature I.Q. .
They are hated in exactly the same way that Czechs hated the Nazi soldiers when they invaded and occupied the " Sudatenland " in order to ' liberate ' it ( claimed der Fuhrer ) .
Just like the Phillipinos hated the Americans when they came over to ' liberate ' them from the Spanish during the Spanish - American War which was orchestrated into existence by the American self sabotage / sinking of the battleship " Maine " moored in Havana Harbor in 1898 .
Remember , we would never have gone into Iraq if we did n't first go into Afghanistan .
And we would n't have invaded Afghanistan if we did n't have the excuse of ' getting ' Osama , who did n't have a damn thing to do with the orchestrated American / Israeli sabotage / demolition of the WTC towers and the military missile that plowed into the pentagon .
How many of those 1000 + kids who lost their lives in Iraq knew they were being used as dupes , just like so many pawns in the game ?
How many of them believed the utter lies and deceptive crap they were being told by this administration and their vest pocket media ?
How many policemen do you think realize that they are being militarized because they will eventually be used as SS troops and an adjunct to foreign military forces who will round up and transport MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of American citizens into readied concentration camps dotted all over north America after martial law is declared ?
I am now so keenly aware of the full breadth of the NWO takeover agenda to destroy America that every news story I see on TV or hear on the radio is instantly recognized for its deception and propaganda spin .
When you know the script in advance , the " news " is completely transparent .
Every single news item in mainstream media and every single daytime & evening talk show host whether TV or radio , is mostly engaged in wholesale propaganda and deception .
There are some moments of light when you hear David Icke or Alec Jones being interviewed on AM radio , but those are the rare exceptions .
Today , the Illuminti controls not only the executive branch - which they have had control of since Woodrow Wilson ( perhaps earlier as they certainly arranged for Garfield 's assassination ) , but they also control both houses of congress and the judiciary ( the supreme court 's involvement in the 2000 selection of Bush was flat out treason ) .
The pentagon , the CIA , the FBI , the NSA , the ONI , etc. , etc. are all under Illuminati control .
Following World War I ( another Illuminati orchestrated war ) , the Illuminati tried to use Wilson to get America to join the League of Nations , but there were enough thinking and independent American patriots still remaining in congress to thwart that deception and they kept us out of Illuminati wars until world war 2 and FDR , an Illuminati front man , who set up Japan to be cut off from oil and rubber and then let Pearl Harbor happen even though he knew weeks in advance of the attack .
The Iraq war and the coming invasion of Iran are just continuations of the Illuminati War - for Profit Machine that 's been repeating itself in America since the Civil War .
They use their well black - mailed dragoons in congress , and their baby - killing satanists in the administration to carry out their orders and they use the flower of American youth as chum bait for their military meat grinder .
When they put in the Draft next Spring , they will now force America 's daughters to also be a part of the Army 's Slaughter Machinery .
How proud will American father 's feel when their sons AND their daughters comes back in body bags ?
Is this the America that Americans want or the one being forced down our throats by a government riddled with satanic traitors ?
So the reversed flag on American troops is a minor story , just one of a thousand satanic symbot reversals seen in America .
Yes , I agree that the flag orientation on a bus or airplane is logical .
In earlier days , they actually did have real flags flanking cars and prop planes and boats , so to use the decal in the same way makes sense , but to carry over that ' explanation ' to a military uniform is bogus .
Their explanation that the star field of the flag " must " be closest to the wearer 's heart is also pure horsecrap .
The Illuminati always has a cover story to justify their deceptions .
They have teams of experts who concoct a story line that will provide ' pluasible denial ' for every possible lie or contradiciton that they may be caught in .
The explanations given in military manuals for reversed flags is one such story line concoction .
Regards ,
Ken
PS .
You might be right about the full color version making a real bright target .
Is n't that the idea when using chum bait ?

I could n't help but notice your apparent belief that the reversed flags are some sort of symbol of satanic intentions .
I just want to point out that American flags are also reversed on the right side of all aeroplanes that carry it .
The effect is to show the flag moving forward or blowing in the wind .
The military can be a superstitious bunch , just as any other team of men ( football , baseball )
And I do n't think they would feel very good about a flag blowing in a fashion that would imply retreat .
My personal opinion : after reading your replies to other e-mails regarding this subject , the only thing that needs to be reversed is your way of thinking .

China offers no fix for global slump
21 March 2009
Any prospect that China could be the growth engine to pull the world economy out of deep recession has been laid to rest by the latest World Bank forecast .
At the recently completed annual National Peoples Congress ( NPC ) , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao promised the regime 's policies would ensure 8 percent growth in 2009 .
The World Bank , however , cut its projection for this year to 6.5 percent , down from the previous 7.5 percent .
With the US , Europe and Japan all in recession , 6.5 percent sounds very positive .
Reflecting the generally upbeat tone of the bank 's outlook , World Bank country director David Dollar , described China as " a relative bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economy " .
The real situation and the scale of the economic slowdown in China , however , are underscored by the fact that 4.9 percentage points of the estimated growth will come from a massive government stimulus package .
In other words , without the stimulus measures , the predicted growth rate would be just 1.6 percent — compared to 13 percent in 2007 .
The World Bank 's assumptions about China 's $ 585 billion stimulus package are unlikely to be fulfilled .
New state bank lending surged to $ 147 billion in February , up 24 percent from a year earlier , following a 21.3 percent rise in January .
Yet industrial growth continues to slow and private investment is virtually stagnant .
Lacking confidence about the future , many firms are using cheap loans to speculate on the stock market .
The only growth areas are capital expenditure by large state enterprises and infrastructure spending .
These are all signs that much of China 's vast export machine — the main motor for its spectacular economic growth — is rapidly grinding to a halt .
In February , despite tax breaks and other government assistance , exports plunged 25.7 percent from a year earlier , far worse than the expected 1 percent growth .
Moreover , imports fell by 24.1 percent in February , on top of a 43.1 percent decline in January , indicating that businesses regard economic prospects as bleak and are drastically cutting purchases of machinery , parts and raw materials .
The World Bank projection also assumes that China 's export decline bottomed in February and will pick up as the global economy rebounds in the second half of 2009 .
This is little more than a stab in the dark .
In its latest forecast for the world economy in 2009 , released this week , the International Monetary Fund predicted a contraction of between 0.5 and 1 percent .
For the advanced economies , which are China 's main markets , the outlook was worse — an overall fall of between 3 and 3.5 percent .
It was the fourth time in less than six months that the IMF has issued downward revisions .
For more than a decade , China has been held up as a shining example of the miracle of the capitalist market , particularly for the so - called emerging economies of Asia , Africa and Latin America .
Its rise appeared to be unstoppable .
In 2007 , it became the third largest economy in the world , behind the US and Japan , with huge trade surpluses and foreign currency reserves .
When the sub - prime crisis hit the US in 2007 , Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan declared there would be only a " mild effect " on Chinese exports .
Last October , as the world financial system appeared on the brink of meltdown , the Financial Times outlined " a master plan " for China to " bailout America " and speculated on the political conditions Beijing might impose .
All this is based , however , on the flawed assumption that " China " functions as an independent economic entity .
The Chinese economy is an integral component of the world economy .
The globalisation of production over the past three decades transformed the country into a giant cheap labour platform for transnational corporations .
A significant portion of China 's " exports " simply involves shifting goods geographically within the same company .
On closer inspection , the orgy of financial speculation in the US and the transformation of China into the sweatshop of the world were intimately related — two sides of the same coin .
Driven by declining profit rates , US corporations turned to China to cut production costs .
In turn , cheap goods from China kept real wages and inflation in the US low and allowed the Federal Reserve to operate a low interest rate regime that was the basis for the vast expansion of speculative profiteering .
Consumer debt expanded , maintaining a market for Chinese goods .
China 's trade surpluses were invested back in the US to prevent the value of the yuan from rising and helped to prop up America 's massive debt .
It appeared that the process would go on forever .
The US Fed responded to the collapse of each speculative bubble by pumping more money into the financial system , confident that the continuing flow of cheap goods would prevent soaring inflation .
Massive profits were made , based on mountains of fictitious capital in the form of exotic financial derivatives and packages .
This whole precarious house of cards has now come crashing down .
For China , the collapse has resulted in a disastrous fall in exports as consumer spending in the US and Europe has contracted sharply .
And China is not alone .
All the export - driven economies of Asia are in the same predicament .
The once booming intra-Asia trade , which supplied Chinese factories with components , raw materials and capital goods , is also imploding .
Japan , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore and South Korea are all formally in recession .
Now doubts are being raised about China 's huge investments in US bonds and other securities .
A new study by the US Council on Foreign Relations estimates that China 's foreign currency reserves may be as high as $ 2.4 trillion — with $ 1.5 to $ 1.7 trillion held in various dollar assets .
Last week , Premier Wen publicly expressed concerns about the security of China 's investments if the US dollar dropped .
This week , the US Fed compounded those fears with a plan , in essence , to print $ 300 billion to fund the US debt .
China is caught in a bind .
If the US dollar plunges , Beijing faces losses that will destabilise its own financial and banking system .
However , if it winds back its US investments , Beijing could trigger a global stampede to dump US assets , with potentially catastrophic consequences for the US and global financial system .
Addressing the National Peoples Congress , China 's leaders attempted to put the best possible face on the deepening economic crisis .
Wen assured delegates that 8 percent growth was achievable , promoted the regime 's stimulus measures and announced new social welfare measures .
Everyone present was well aware that anything less than 8 percent would mean rising unemployment and social unrest .
Already 20 million rural migrant workers have lost their jobs and a growing army of urban workers , college graduates and demobilised soldiers are unable to find work .
Buried in the budget presented to the NPC was a significant item — a massive increase in spending on public security , by 20.5 percent to more than $ 71 billion .
The figure is larger than China 's total military budget of $ 70.2 billion for 2009 .
" We will improve the early warning system for social stability to actively prevent and properly handle all types of mass incidents , " Wen blandly told the delegates .
The purpose is all too evident — the linchpin of the " Chinese miracle " has been a pervasive police - state apparatus to suppress all criticism , political opposition , protests and strikes .
US , European and Japanese commentators routinely call into question the purpose of China 's expanding military spending .
None of them had anything to say about the public security budget .
It is understood only too well in international financial circles that a social upheaval in China would reverberate around the world — politically and economically .

The example we have an image of is pretty egregious , but using the same technology the ISP could be inserting its own ads alongside the legitimate ads that the website owners have been paid for .
Can you tell which ads are inserted at which point as the page travels to you ?
What is far worse , this same tech also enables alteration of news stories , search results , and other content , and it would be hard to tell whether we 're getting what the publisher intended , or edited or rewritten text instead .
This has to be outlawed before it goes any further .

I would say that this probably wo n't last long .
Not only are they forcing content to their customers , they are also injecting it into any site .
This probably violates many site 's TOS .
If not , then it probably will soon since some sites have strict guidelines on editing the site and of what content goes on their site .
Having ads that violate their company policy injected into their sites by ISP most likely will not fly .

It 's not an infringement of the site owner 's copyright .
What the ISP is monkeying with is the customer 's copy , which the customer is entitled to do as he wishes with , and the ISP 's " Terms of Service " probably say that the customer gives permission for the ISP to do this .
It 's offensive and ought to be prohibited , but not for the copyright reason .
------------
Edit :
This is the same principle that allows each of us to run software that filter ads out of pages , or save a local copy and change the font or whatever .
The site owner is not entitled to have everyone see it the way he / she intends ; the site owner has a right to control what 's in the published version , and then the viewer gets a copy and is entitled to do as he wishes with it , other than republishing .
The ISP can claim to be acting as the agent of its subscriber in this situation .
There is an indirect wrong against the site owner , but the real evil is that the ISP can require the customer to allow the page alteration as a condition of service .
This is what needs to be prohibited by law .
SDottie
@rcn.com SDottie Anon Re : WOW IANAL , but copyright violation is always spoken with respect to distribution .
Thus , end users can modify copyrighted works without legal repercussions because they are end users .
However , anyone who is retransmitting the copyrighted webpage would be violating copyright if they modify it .
And if they 're using it to make a money , it 's a criminal violation .
Injecting advertisements is definitely illegal for this reason .
Injecting status messages is a gray area .
Any revenue made from the injection of status messages is likely to be indirect .
Hence , while Google can sue for copyright violation , it would be in a civil court , and only for lost revenue , possibly for defamation , defacement , what have you .
Also , there are agreements between providers that prohibit discrimination of data .
So if data goes through a certain provider from Google to your ISP before getting to your computer , there 's likely a violation of that agreement .
It 's not a net neutrality issue per se , but there are still legal issues to consider .

That is n't what happens .
Rogers using Preftech 's methods has to modify Google 's HTML to insert the instruction to execute the script .
The browser receives the modified HTML with the added SCRIPT line which executes Roger 's Preftech doc write - ins filled script which then adds all the crap you see added to Google 's page .
Without the original modification of Google 's copyrighted HTML to insert the execution line , the execution of Preftech 's javascript can't occur .
This is nothing new , this Preftech has been around for years .
But in an age where ISPs with break whatever they want or mooch after whoever they want , I see ads coming next .
And Preftech advertises their stuff as such .
There is also nothing stopping Rogers from just inserting HTML banner ads instead of java execution commands , making those banners impossible or virtually impossible to circumvent .. since you can't tell who added it if it was added at all .
This is just bad all around .

They have to modify the HTML to insert the Javascript .
It 's javascript that obtains and displays the usage data , but the HTML is what contains the instructions on executing the javascript and where it goes on the page .
The ISP is taking it upon itself to inspect , intercept and then modify the HTML page to include their javascript .
The modified page then runs the javascript and you get the giant banner .
Google 's HTML is copyrighted so I do n't see how this can be legal .

There are better ways to do this .
When you connect to WiFi hot spots , they redirect your request to a login page .
After you login , you proceed to your original destination .
The bandwidth limit warning could be handled in exactly the same manner without any net neutrality objections .

They should probably just use a DNS redirect or a temporary port 80 filter to do this sort of thing ( much like a Wifi hotspot provider intercepts traffic until authentication or payment is made ) .
That method seeems to be just about as effective , and far less panic - inducing to neutrality purists .
Alerting users to their bandwidth use is a good thing for sure , but they should make it disableable and also offer email alerts and an online status page .

There is a SMTP Server log to show that the message was retrieved ( although there is no way to insure that the message will actually be viewed or to acknowledge its viewing [ DNT can be turned off or bypassed ] ) .
On second thought , the suggestion of the WiFi Hotspot intercept might be a better way .
The first time you connect to the Web each day , present it ( or maybe on some other timed basis so long as it is NOT every new first connect ) .

It is the next logical step to inject advertising and the greedy suck ass providers will do it .
We have already seen them charge QoS fees and break DNS .
They are already trying to charge twice for content delivery .
Cox is running ads claiming that net neutrality is a scheme of Silicon Valley fat cats .
We see more and more that net neutrality would do quite the opposite and stop the stupid get rich quick schemes of the telcos and cable companies he 'll bent on providing only their own version of the Internet .
And like the cable shills tell us that price increases are good for consumers and that ISPs should be charging twice to deliver the same content , they 'll come up with some lame logic justifying the modification of another company 's copyrighted work .

USA 1 recommendation TechyDad Premium Member Phishing possibility Leaving aside the bad ramifications of ISPs injecting content ( possibly ads ) into other websites , I can see great potential in this for Phishing .
To use the Google example that was shown in the summary , a Phisher could make a Google clone site ( perhaps that even pulled search results from the real Google ) but put a " you 're going over your bandwidth " message at the top .
Include a free offer to up the user 's bandwidth .
The user , having been accustomed to content being injected by their ISP , assumes that this is legit .
Once the user clicks to accept the offer , standard phishing ensues ( prompts to enter usernames , passwords , SSNs , etc ) .
The user is then given a " Congrats !
You have more bandwidth ! " message and the phisher laughs maniacally .

If they can inject it ... we can " uninject " it .
I 'm not against being told when I 'm reaching my bandwidth cap , but to be honest , I 'd rather get an email .
I concur with an earlier commenter who shared their concerns regarding the possible " slippery slope " syndrome this technology could introduce .
To be honest though , most of us should be running some form of packet - inspection / IPS capable gateway in our homes .
The gateway I run has the option to dynamically strip javascript or other code from websites as they load .
And as someone else mentioned , simply blocking javascript in your browser will fix the issue regardless .
Thats not to say Net Neutrality is n't important , just that until we convince ISPs to change their ways , there are things you can do to minimize the crap you have to put up with .

Not easily .
In this instance they modify the HTML to run their own javascript but they could just as easily inject their own HTML to display traditional banners which would be virtually impossible to undo ' cause you could n't tell if it was the ISP or the site operator .
Even in this instance , we only know it 's Rogers ' cause the banner says it is .
If it were just an ad , you would n't know unless you had a second ISP that did n't display the banner .

Will this force the net to HTTPS ?
A potential solution is for sites to use HTTPS for ALL of their traffic ( including images because that 's probably the next target ! )
This would represent a burden for all but the consumer .
I 'm reasonably sure my computer does n't care one bit if the second CPU has to spend a few cycles decrypting an HTTPS web page or image before displaying it .
Would n't this really hammer content providers and ISPs though ?
Do n't ISPs use proxy caches to minimize Internet bandwidth and keep requests local ?
Is n't HTTPS traffic also difficult to compress if they employ compression to minimize bandwidth ?
Wo n't providers get hammered by the extra cycles the HTTPS traffic requires ?
I know there are reverse - proxy appliances that can off - load HTTPS encryption demands but it 's still extra infrastructure and cost .
Should we all buy Akmai stock ?
If I was an advertiser and I paid to have my banner first , I 'd be upset if my banner is suddenly second .
If ISPs continue down this road , content providers will be forced to use HTTPS .
Regarding HTTPS , I know it 's reasonably secure given the 128 bit key length but if it was possible to decrypt and use deep packet inspection on HTTPS traffic , can the ISP do that legally ?
For that matter , the more I think about this , how is what they are already doing legal ?
Why is n't this treated like a telephone conversation ?
Eves dropping is n't legal without a court order , right ?
I know 9/11 changed that for foreign calls but this is n't just eves dropping to gather information .
Hell , the ISPs and content providers have been doing THAT for YEARS !
( That 's B.S too but we seem willing to tolerate if we remain anonymous ... )
This new tactic is almost James Bondish in that the ISP is modifying the content to provide it 's own message on top of the original source .
I thought DNS redirection was borderline .
In my opinion , this crosses the line .

If everyone goes to HTTPS , expect the cost of a broadband connection to go up by about 30 % and the speed of fetching Web pages to go down .
Why ?
Because HTTPS can't be cached .
It 's a tremendous waste of bandwidth for anything that does not truly need to be encrypted .

They definitely intend to deliver ads
So instead of just easily setting up an automated email system to inform users they are close to their cap , they spend time and money testing this system ?
Just to deliver a message about the status of an account ?
Yeah right .
They have every intention of using this for delivering ads later on .
They are introducing this tech gradually though to get people used to the idea .
They are trying fly beneath the radar .
They cant possibly hope to justify this as the best method for informing a customer .
What about if I dont open my browser for a few days whilst im reading binary newsgroups or downloading via bittorrent ?
How do I get warned then ?
This has nothing to do with helping customers stay informed , and everything to do with plastering the screen with ads at some point later .
No doubt about it .

For example , an AT&T customer visits a Comcast page , clicks " Sign up " and gets redirected to an AT&T page explaining how great AT&T is and how much Comcast blows ( or vice - versa ) .

What about web 2.0 ?
Putting aside the morality / legality of this practice , what about the technical impact ?
This could potentially have adverse effects on some new style web site operation .
Sites using XMLHttpRequest may have to change some practices on the server side to ensure that anything returned that is n't a full HTML page does n't have the text / html header , otherwise the behavior of thier website could be broken .
That is , assuming the ISP is only modifying / injecting HTML pages , what is next ?
XML ? JSON ?
Binary files such as images ?
In my view this is simply a man - in - the - middle attack on my use of the web which I have already paid for .

Waterborne diseases are the second largest killer of children under five .
Each day , 4,200 children die from water - related diseases , and 900 million people around the world are without access to safe drinking water1 .
UNICEF ’s Tap Project is working to change that by raising money to support clean water programs with a simple $ 1 donation .
That single dollar can provide a child with safe drinking water for 40 days .
Photo by hdptcar
The Tap Project was started in 2007 in New York City , with participating restaurants asking their customers to donate $ 1 for the tap water they would usually get for free , with all of the funds going to support UNICEFâ€™s projects to give clean water to the millions of children around the world without it .
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0zBxDFg7YM
The initial project in 2007 involved 300 restaurants in New York City , but has now grown to over 2,300 across the US in 2008 .
Corporations , restaurants , volunteers , community groups , and local governments worked together to save millions of childrenâ€™s lives through the Tap Project .
This year , during World Water Week ( March 22 - 28 , 2009 ) , the Tap Project is once again raising both funds and awareness for UNICEFâ€™s clean water and sanitation efforts .
For each dollar donated , one child can have clean drinking water for 40 days .
That ’s amazing to me .
One dollar wo n’t even buy a cup of coffee in the US , so to imagine providing a kid with clean water for 40 days , preventing waterborne illnesses from taking another life , is simply awesome .
Here is a heart - wrenching video that attempts to personalize the desperate situation of mothers and fathers whose children do n’t have access to drinking water :
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrKzvHdsq3I
You can help by becoming a Tap Project Campaign Volunteer , by patronizing a participating restaurant , or by simply donating to the Tap Project .
Tap Project donations will be used to support UNICEF ’s clean water programs .
“ UNICEF works in more than 90 countries around the world to improve access to safe water and sanitation facilities in schools and communities , and to promote safe hygiene practices .
Every dollar donated to the Tap Project will be used to support these programs .
Funds collected will be allocated to the countries and areas UNICEF has identified as most in need . ”

The new season starts with the Australian Grand Prix on 29 March
Formula 1 has axed plans for a new scoring system in 2009 , just nine days before the start of the season .
The sport 's governing body , FIA , announced earlier this week that the driver with the most wins would be crowned world champion .
But following a protest from F1 teams , FIA says it will defer the introduction of the new system until 2010 .
The traditional points system will be used when the 2009 season begins on 29 March with the Australian Grand Prix .
The teams wish to reaffirm their willingness to collaborate with the FIA in order to jointly define a new point system for the 2010 season
Fota statement A FIA spokesman told BBC Sport : " The new scoring system has been deferred until 2010 , but I 'm sure this will be reviewed throughout the course of the season as any new rule changes have to have teams approval before we proceed .
" We 're slightly surprised that the teams have taken this long to come forward as we were under the impression that they were happy with the rule changes . "
FIA had argued that the new scoring system would make racing more exciting by encouraging drivers to chase wins .
But several drivers , among them defending champion Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso , criticised the change .
That prompted Friday 's statement from Formula One Teams ' Association ( Fota ) , which claimed the amendment was invalid because the proper protocol had not been observed .
" It is too late for FIA to impose a change for the 2009 season that has not obtained the unanimous agreement of all the competitors properly entered into the 2009 Formula 1 Championship , " it read .
Fota had put forward its own scoring system , with the top three drivers earning 12 , nine and seven , rather than 10 , eight and six points respectively .
606 : DEBATE
The ideal scenario for me would be to cancel this for this season , and then agree to next season implement FOTA 's proposed points system changes of increasing the winners margin from 2nd place to 3
roversalias
But that was unanimously rejected by the World Motorsport Council ( WMSC ) .
Instead , the WMSC opted for a variant of an earlier idea proposed by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone , who had suggested an Olympic - style medals system , with the champion the driver with most golds .
The WMSC approved the " race - wins " plan , albeit with no provision to award medals .
Fota , which insists its own plan has widespread backing , hopes common ground can be reached with the FIA .
" The teams wish to reaffirm their willingness to collaborate with the FIA in order to jointly define a new point system for the 2010 season within a comprehensive set of measures aimed at further stimulating the attractiveness of the F1 sport , " added the statement .
Hamilton would have finished second behind Ferrari's Felipe Massa had the new system applied last year .
The McLaren driver clinched the title after overtaking on the final bend of the final lap of the final race .

Advertisement A former French aircraft carrier - rejected by India and Egypt as being too toxic to be broken up - has arrived at its final resting place in Teesside .
The Clemenceau is to be dismantled and recycled at Graythorp , Hartlepool .
Campaigners say asbestos on board will damage the environment and the health of workers , but the Environment Agency says it has rigorous controls in place .
Last year , a local firm won a long legal battle to scrap four former US naval vessels , dubbed " ghost ships " .
Able UK says the project to dismantle the 32,700 - tonne Clemenceau is one of the largest of its kind in Europe .
Environmental concerns
Work on the Clemenceau will take place alongside existing contracts to scrap the four US vessels which arrived on Teesside in 2004 .
Able overcame environmental concerns over its recycling plans last year and claims operating in a dry dock is the easiest and most environmentally sound way of carrying out the work .
We 've now got a ticking , toxic time bomb and we 're going to live in a nightmare haze of toxicity for the rest of our lives
Jean Kennedy
Friends of Hartlepool
Controversial end to the Clem History of ghost ships
The company is due to begin recycling work on the 255 - metre Clemenceau after Easter , in a 10 m euro ( £ 8.75 m ) project which will create an additional 200 jobs .
The vessel contains 700 tonnes of asbestos - contaminated materials and was recalled to France from India in 2006 amid concerns over its toxic elements .
Jean Kennedy , leader of the Friends of Hartlepool , a local community group which led the fight over the issue , said : " Here was a ship laden with the worst possible toxins and they want to bring it to this country to get rid of it .
" We 've now got a ticking , toxic time bomb and we 're going to live in a nightmare haze of toxicity for the rest of our lives .
We live in a town where we 're breathing it every day of our lives . "
Peter Stephenson , the chairman of Able UK , dismissed the objections of Ms Kennedy and others .
Sanctioned
He told the BBC : " The protestors had all the opportunities over the last five years .
There was a public inquiry .
It 's been looked at by all the proper authorities .
It 's been all sanctioned .
" What we 're going to do is what we were going to do in the first place - same methods we 've used for years .
So I do n't see any problem with that . "
He said it would take up to two weeks to investigate what work is required , then five months of " remediation works " before the actual dismantling begins in the summer .
We have taken into account the concerns of people and factored into the permits regulatory controls to allay those concerns
The Environment Agency 's Bob Pailor The Environment Agency says it will ensure the ship is recycled in a safe and environmentally sound manner .

We probably should have talked more about what ’s been going on with Unreal Tournament 3 over the last couple of weeks .
Why did n’t we ?
Because it ’s not a game any of us feel particularly strongly about one way or another , and from earlier comments it did n’t look like you lot did either .
Having a famous name and being reasonably fun is no longer enough for a technically adept but fundamentally unambitious multiplayer shooter to grab the attention it once would have done .
Last weekend , that changed dramatically .
Unreal Tournament is back , baby , back .
And no matter how you or we or anyone else might personally feel about UT3 , its unexpected resurgence may signal colossal change for PC games .
The popular perception is that UT3 bombed .
Did it ?
Well , at first it certainly seemed as much – reportedly it shifted just 33,995 US copies during its first month on sale .
Epic later claimed that it had shipped 1.2 million copies worldwide in four months , but that includes the US PS3 release and , of course , ‘ shipped ’ and ‘ sold ’ are far from the same .
While there was probably a good deal of exaggeration from both sides of the debate , certainly the half - decade old Unreal Tournament 2004 continued to enjoy a visibly larger regular playerbase than its higher - tech sequel .
Now , traditionally it ’s the case that when a multiplayer game stumbles , it does n’t get back up again .
UT3 seemed destined to go gently into that good night , save for the occasional antagonistic comment about PC gaming from Cliffy “ Cliffy B ” B and Mark Rein .
And yet , as we coast into the Spring of 2009 , a game released in 2007 is suddenly the talk of town all over again .
On the weekend before last , its players jumped by some 2000 % .
The key to it all was taking a leaf out of Valve ’s book .
There may not be such a thing as a free lunch , but that truism does n’t mean hungry folk wo n’t turn up in droves if you stick up a poster promising complimentary punch and pie .
The Team Fortress 2 free weekends , many timed to coincide with major updates , drew hordes of players who were delighted to get something for nothing .
Come the end of each weekend , a fair few were charmed enough to splash out for a permanent copy of the game .
Epic have done exactly that with UT3 , releasing a major patch ( complete with new maps and modes as well as more fundamental changes based on player feedback ) then offering it free via Steam to all comers for a long weekend .
Once the first free weekend was over , its 2000 % extra players did n’t all disappear – the game ( heavily discounted ) jumped straight to the top of Steam ’s bestseller list .
It did so well that there ’s just been another free weekend , though observers reckon that ’s partially by way of apology to the people who , as a result of higher - than - anticipated interest , could n’t download the game first time around .
Who knows if it ’ll truly reverse UT3 ’s long - term fortunes , but it ’s almost definitely earned a big pile of money from a game we all thought had died in the water a year ago .
It ’s an incredible precedent to set : making a game a success almost 18 months after a poor launch .
It ’s something that could only have happened now , and with a system like Steam .
Something that can go far beyond a mere demo by delivering a complete game straight to your hard drive and automatically deactivating it at the distributor ’s discretion .
Something that silently updates a purchase with patches and extra content automatically , so you do n’t have to make the decision to seek out some exciting new feature : it ’s just there anyway .
Something that , if you do n’t already own it , advertises that game to you at an agreeably reduced price whenever it loads .
Something that enjoys a vast community who are in turn plugged into a sea of smaller relevant communities .
It ’s incredibly sinister .
It ’s also incredibly exciting .
UT3 may never be a cult classic – or indeed any sort of classic – but it ’s no longer a failure .
Think about what this could mean for other , better future games in similar danger of being lost to uncaring history .
There is now a mechanism to save them : if something with as negative a reputation as UT3 can come back from the dead , surely anything can .
The next Planescape : Torment or Beyond Good & Evil will be less of a risk , less of a tragedy waiting to happen .
It ’s not Steam or Impulse specifically as much as it is game distributors finally realising how to leverage the internet , and that a game does n’t stop existing once its initial print run disappears from store shelves .
Game retail and traditional advertising alike have never seemed such dinosaurs .
I mean , really .
How any other platform could possibly think it can rival PC gaming ’s staggeringly vast , fast - evolving , hyper - connected community in the long - term is beyond me .
SAN SALVADOR , Jan 19 ( Reuters ) - El Salvador ’s leftists had a strong showing in congressional elections , boosting momentum for the party of former Marxist guerrillas that is seeking the presidency , vote tallies showed on Monday .
With nearly 70 percent of the ballots counted from Sunday ’s polls , the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front had 49.5 percent of the vote in the National Assembly , versus 40 percent for the ruling right - wing Nationalist Republican Alliance , or ARENA .
The results give FMLN presidential candidate Mauricio Funes , a former TV journalist , a better chance of taking the presidency in a March election .
The latest survey in December gave the center - left former CNN journalist a 16 percentage point lead over ruling ARENA candidate Rodrigo Avila , El Salvador ’s former police chief .
Funes reported on El Salvador ’s 12 - year civil war but never fought in it and was not a Marxist guerrilla .
Since the Cold War era conflict ended with 1992 peace accords , the FMLN has lost three presidential elections to ARENA .
The FMLN ’s violent past has kept it from winning the presidency , analysts say .
But ARENA has struggled to curb gang violence and convert economic growth into gains for the poor .
It is also unpopular for supporting the U.S. - led war in Iraq and sending troops there .
Funes promises to pursue market - friendly policies and get on well with Washington if he wins .
He appeals to pro-U.S. voters who never before supported the FMLN .
Funes ’ opponents fear El Salvador will join a left - wing bloc of Latin American countries led by Venezuela if he wins , but he dismisses the claims and the party faithful have dropped much of the anti-American rhetoric of the past .

The Pentagon has announced intentions to launch an entire fleet of giant 450 - foot - long airships which will act as a massive airborne radar system providing perpetual surveillance of vehicles , planes and people on the ground .
The Pentagon said Thursday that it intends to spend $ 400 million to develop a giant dirigible that will operate on hydrogen fuel cells and solar panels , floating 65,000 feet above the Earth for 10 years , reports the LA Times .
The airships will be around twenty times larger than the Goodyear Blimp , giving ground operators the capability of monitoring an area hundreds of miles in diameter at a time with surveillance equipment , such as high - resolution cameras , in addition to the football - field - sized radar antenna .
[ efoods ]
Although very large , the airships will be invisible to both the naked eye and ground radar because of their distance from the earth , hovering around 12 miles above the ground .
The craft would also operate beyond the range of any hand - held missile , many surface - to - air missiles and most fighter planes .
The airship , named ISIS ( Integrated Sensor Is the Structure ) , no doubt after the Ancient Egyptian goddess , is being developed under an agreement between the Air Force and DARPA , the Pentagon ’s semi-secret research arm .
Werner J.A. Dahm , chief scientist for the Air Force describes the airship as “ constant surveillance , uninterrupted ” .
“ When you only have a short - time view — whether it is a few hours or a few days — that is not enough to put the picture together . ”
Dahm said .
The Pentagon has described the project as a tool to be used over urban battlegrounds abroad .
But , like DARPA ’S ” Combat Zones That See ” project , there ’s no reason ISIS could n’t float over major cities such as New York or Chicago without anyone knowing .
A similar program known as WALRUS was effectively killed off by Congress in 2006 .
However , the ISIS program has been floating around ( pun intended ) since 2004 .
“ We will apply this technology to track people emerging from buildings of interest and follow them as they move to new locations , ” announced DARPA ’s Paul Benda at a conference in March 2004 .
“ Imagine the impact it will have if ISIS tracks the movement of individuals for months .
Hidden webs of connections between people and facilities will be revealed . ”
In 2006 , reports regarding the project resurfaced as DARPA courted defense contractors Raytheon , Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman to develop the airships .
The Air Force has signed an agreement with DARPA to develop a demonstration dirigible by 2014 .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Chicago 's landmark Sears Tower , the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere , will be renamed Willis Tower after insurance broker Willis Group Holdings , the company announced Thursday .
" Willis Tower will make us a household name among our clients , prospective clients and in the larger business community , " said Don Bailey , chairman and chief executive of Willis HRH , the company 's North American business .
The London , England - based company said it will rent 140,000 square feet of the building at a cost of $ 14.50 per square foot .
The move , which involves 500 employees and consolidating five area offices , is expected to be completed by late summer .
" We found a great opportunity , a great deal , in the Sears Tower , " Joseph Plumeri , chairman and chief executive of the Willis Group , told CNN .
Willis Group Holdings ( WSH ) provides insurance , risk management , financial and human resource consulting to corporations and public institutions around the world .
" This key new tenant underscores the importance of the building as a destination for successful businesses , " said John Huston , of American Landmark Properties , Ltd. , one of the investors that owns the tower , in a written statement .
Rita Athas , executive director of World Business Chicago , a not - for - profit economic development corporation , said the move demonstrates the Willis Group 's commitment to the city and could boost the labor market there .
" Their decision speaks to the quality of Chicago 's workforce , and our vibrant and supportive business community , " Athas said in a written statement .
While the company expects to rechristen the building sometime this summer , it 's not clear whether the new name will stick with native Chicagoans .
" The Sears Tower has been an icon here for the last quarter of a century , " said John Russick , senior curator at the Chicago Historical Society .
" For the generation that grew up calling it the Sears Tower , it 'll be hard for people to shift and start calling it something else , " he said .
Indeed , many long - time Chicago residents still refer to the Standard Oil Building , now know as the Aon Center , as " Big Stan " Russick said .
That building 's name has been changed twice since it was built in 1973 .
The Sears Tower was opened in 1973 and is 1,729 feet tall , including its antenna .
It was originally named for retailer Sears , Roebuck & Co. , which moved its headquarters to Hoffman Estates , Ill. in 1992 .

Quake Engine code review : Network ( 2/4 )
QuakeWorld network architecture was considered a ground breaking innovation at the time .
All network game successor used the same approach .
Here are the details .
This article is in four parts :
Architecture section
Network section
Prediction section
Rendition section
Network stack
Quake 's elementary unit of communication is the command .
They are used to update a player position , orientation , health , damage , etc. TCP / IP features a lot of great functionalities that would be nice to have in a real time simulation ( flow - control , reliability , packet sequencing ) but could not be used for Quake World Engine ( it was in the original Quake ) .
In a FPS , information that is not received ASAP is not worth re-sending .
So UDP / IP was selected and in order to implement reliability and packet sequencing , the network abstraction layer " NetChannel " was created .
From an OSI perspective , NetChannel sits very nicely on top of UDP :
So , to summarize :
The engine deals mostly with commands .
When it needs to send or receive , it delegates the task to methods Netchan_Transmit and Netchan_Process from netchan .c ( those methods are the same on client and server ) .
NetChannel Header
Here is the structure of a NetChannel header :
Bit offset Bits 0 - 15 16-31 0 Sequence 32 ACK Sequence 64 QPort Commands 94 ...
Sequence is an int initialized by the sender and incremented by one every times a packet is sent .
The purpose of sequence is multiple but the most important is to provide the receiver with a way to recognized lost / duplicate / out of order UDP packets .
The strongest bit of the int is not part of the sequence but a flag indicated that the payload ( commands ) contains reliable data ( more about this later ) .
initialized by the sender and incremented by one every times a packet is sent .
The purpose of is multiple but the most important is to provide the receiver with a way to recognized lost / duplicate / out of order UDP packets .
The strongest bit of the int is not part of the sequence but a flag indicated that the payload ( ) contains ( more about this later ) .
ACK
Sequence is also an int , it is equal to the last sequence number received .
With this , the other end of the NetChannel can see if a packet was lost .
, it is equal to the last sequence number received .
With this , the other end of the NetChannel can see if a packet was lost .
QPort is here to circumvent a bug with NAT routers ( Read more at the end of this page ) .
The value is a random number set when the client starts up .
Commands :
Is the payload
Reliable messages
Unreliable commands are grouped in a UDP packet , marked with the last outgoing sequence number and sent ; it does n't matter to the sender if they get lost .
Reliable commands are dealt with differently , the key is to understand that there can be only one reliable UDP packet unacknowledged between a sender and a receiver .
Every game loops , if a new reliable command is generated it is added to the message_buf array ( piloted via the message variable ) ( 1 ) .
The set of reliable commands is then moved from message to the reliable_buf array ( 2 ) .
This happens only if reliable_buf is empty ( if it is not empty , this means that an other set of commands was sent before and has not yet been acknowledged ) .
The final UDP datagram is then created : NetChannel header is added ( 3 ) then reliable_buf content and unreliable commands of the moment , if there is enough space available .
On the receiving end , the UDP message is parsed , the incoming sequence number is transfered to the outgoing sequence ACK ( 4 ) , ( along with the bit flag indicating the packet contained reliable data ) .
On the next message received :
If the reliable bit flag is set to true , the UDP packet made it to the receiver .
NetChannel can clean reliable_buf ( 5 ) and is ready to send a new set of commands .
( ) and is ready to send a new set of commands .
If the reliable bit flag is set to false , the UDP did not made it to the receiver .
NetChannel will try to send the content of reliable_buf again .
New commands will pile up in message_buf , if this array overflows , the client is dropped .
Flow - Control
As far as I could read , there is flow - control on server side only ; A client sends its state updates as fast as it can .
The first flow control rule , active on the server is to send a datagram only if a datagram was received from the client .
The second form of control flow is " choke " , a parameter the client is able to set via the rate command in the console .
This will make the server skip update messages , lowering the amount of data sent to the client .
Important commands
Commands have a type code stored in a byte , followed by the payload of the command .
Probably the most important are the commands giving information about the state of the game ( frame_t ) :
svc_packetentities and svc_deltapacketentities :
Update entities such as rocket trail , explosion , particles etc ...
and :
Update entities such as rocket trail , explosion , particles etc ... svc_playerinfo :
Send update about players position , last command and command duration in msec
More on the qport
Qport was added to the NetChannel header to fix a bug .
Before the qport , Quake server identified a client by the combination ( remote IP , remote UDP port ) .
This worked fine most of the time but certain NAT router can change their schema of port translation ( remote UDP port ) sporadically .
UDP port being unreliable , John Carmack explained in one of his plans that he decided to identify a client by ( remote IP , Qport in NetChannel header ) .
This fixed the confusion and also allowed the server to adjust the target UDP response port on the fly .
Latency calculation
Quake engine stores the 64 last sent commands ( in a frame_t array : frames ) along with the senttime , they are directly accessible via the sequence number used to transfer them ( outgoing_sequence ) .
frame = &cl.frames[cls.netchan.outgoing_sequence & UPDATE_MASK ] ; frame -> senttime = realtime ; // Send packet to server
Upon aknowledgment from the server , the time the command was sent is retrieved via sequenceACK .
Latency is calculated as follows :
// Receive response from server frame = &cl.frames[cls.netchan.incoming_acknowledged & UPDATE_MASK ] ; frame -> receivedtime = realtime ; latency = frame -> receivedtime - frame -> senttime ;
Some elegant things
Array index cycling
The network part of the engine stores the 64 last received UDP datagrams .
The naive approach to cycle through the array would have been to use the modulo operator :
arrayIndex = ( oldArrayIndex +1 ) % 64 ;
Instead the new value is calculated with an " AND " binary operation on an UPDATE_MASK , UPDATE_MASK being equal to 64 - 1 .
arrayIndex = ( oldArrayIndex +1 ) & UPDATE_MASK ;
The real code is actually :
frame_t * newpacket ; newpacket = & frames[cls.netchan.incoming_sequence&UPDATE_MASK
] ;
Update :
Here is a response I received from " Dietrich Epp " , regarding modulo optimization :
There is a problem with the final section where using the modulo operator is called " naive " .
Here is an example of the difference between the modulo and the " and " operator : Create a file .c : unsigned int modulo ( unsigned int x ) { return x % 64 ; } unsigned int and ( unsigned int x ) { return x & 63 ; } Run gcc - S file.c , and look at the output file .s .
You 'll see that the functions are line for line identical -- even though optimization is turned off !
Same things go for " clever " things like doing << 5 instead of * 32 .
These changes make the code less readable with no benefit whatsoever , so I 've taken to considering the << 5 or & 63 versions to be " naive " and the * 32 or % 64 versions to be more intelligent .

He is the disc jockey politician , a charismatic , fresh - faced entrepreneur who swapped the turntables and nightclubs of Antananarivo for a movement that this week has culminated in the ousting of Madagascar 's twice - elected president .
So when Andry Rajoelina , 34 , is inaugurated as Africa 's youngest president today , expect a carnival of sound .
His supporters have taken to blaring out Malagasy pop music to get crowds in the mood .
This may even be the first African coup with its own soundtrack .
Images of the man this week have appeared incongruous : a sharp suit and baby face amid the sharpshooters in army fatigues , an unlikely alliance between the soldiers who have seen it all before and the 34 - year - old who has got it all to come .
But behind the boyish good looks lies a ruthless ambition that has surprised many .
" When he became mayor I had never heard of him before .
But he was a charming person , he was easy to be around , " says a former adviser to Rajoelina , who wished to remain anonymous .
" In fact , he seemed quite shy and very polite .
I never believed he could become what he is today - now it is very hard to know who this man really is . "
Born to a relatively wealthy but unexceptional family and privately educated , Rajoelina was working the ramshackle clubs and bars of Antananarivo as a DJ by the time he was 20 .
" He would play wherever he could , " says Liana Herisoa , chief editor of Rajoelina 's privately owned television station .
" For friends , in clubs , all over Antananarivo . "
The snappy young DJ then moved into promoting other performers , and had soon set up his own radio station .
And as Viva radio pumped out a hugely popular foot - tapping mix of international hits , pop music and love ballads , Rajoelina 's profile began to rise .
Ultimately establishing himself as a successful entrepreneur at the helm of Injet , an advertising company , his appeal was instant .
Just as that of former president Marc Ravalomanana - a self - made dairy tycoon - had been when he came to power after elections in 2001 .
Early political aspirations were realised in Rajoelina 's TGV ( Tanora Malagasy Vonona - Young Malagasy 's Determined ) movement , the party platform from which he launched his mayoral campaign .
Rajoelina soon earned himself the nickname TGV - as much a reference to his movement , as to the French high - speed train - a reflection of his unstoppable and feisty character .
The train finally arrived this week .
With the support of a powerful core of rebellious troops , within an army that had tried to remain neutral until the bitter end , Rajoelina has spearheaded a dramatic regime change .
Always immaculately dressed , Rajoelina 's rise has been as remarkable as it has been controversial .
And his mayoral election campaign was an early indication of what he was capable of .
He swept on to the political scene in December 2007 , voted in as the mayor of the capital , beating the preferred candidate of Ravalomanana and sweeping the city 's female voters off their feet .
In Antananarivo , Rajoelina made himself a superstar - a vibrant symbol of youthfulness and success .
His youth is a double - edged sword .
At 34 he is still technically six years too young to hold the presidency , according to the constitution .
But youth is a powerful commodity for those who want to see energetic efforts to bring about change .
" We need someone young , we need someone who understands how we think , " says Thomas , a restaurant worker in Antananarivo .
From the beginning , Rajoelina 's relationship with Ravalomanana was defined by tension .
Rajoelina positioned himself as one of the former president 's most vociferous critics , tapping into a growing vein of anti-government sentiment .
But despite his popularity in Antananarivo , Rajoelina has less support elsewhere in the country .
Rajoelina has said he will hold presidential elections in 18 to 24 months .
Until then , Madagascar 's new leader is going to have to work hard to convince the international community of the legitimacy of his army - backed rise to power .
Lind 's later work on the cure and prevention of scurvy was prompted by the round - the - world voyage of Cdr. George Anson in the early 1740s , in which only 145 men out of 1,300 arrived back home , the majority of them dying of scurvy .

Israeli leaders have voted to halt an offensive that has left nearly 1,200 in the Gaza Strip dead .
In announcing the unilateral ceasefire , Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert claimed that Israel had achieved its goals .
He said in a televised address : " Hamas was hit hard , in its military arms and in its government institutions . "
Fighting will stop at 2 am local time ( midnight GMT ) , but Israel will keep troops on the ground for the time being , Olmert said .
Israeli insistence on keeping troops in Gaza raises the spectre of a stalemate with Hamas , which has repeated that it will not respect any ceasefire until Israel pulls out of the territory .
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum in Gaza said today that a unilateral ceasefire was not enough to end Hamas ' resistance .
" The occupier must halt his fire immediately and withdraw from our land and lift his blockade and open all crossings and we will not accept any one Zionist soldier on our land , regardless of the price that it costs , " Barhoum said .
More than 1,100 Palestinians have been killed in the three weeks of violence , according to Palestinian and UN officials .
Thirteen Israelis have also died .
A summit aimed at giving international backing to the ceasefire will be held in Egypt tomorrow .
It is to be attended by the leaders of Germany , France , Spain , Britain , Italy , Turkey and the Czech Republic - which holds the rotating EU presidency - as well as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , Mubarak and UN secretary - general Ban-ki Moon .

McGillicutty Power and Light was a small utilities company with a big problem :
Their customer base was growing by leaps and bounds but the supposed - to - be simple task of printing a batch of invoices was taking a glacial age to complete .
Things got to be so bad in fact that each of the accounting clerks needed two PC's – one dedicated to everyday tasks like email and spreadsheets and the other for printing invoices .
It was n't as if the printing workstation was maxed - out on resources , it 's just that generating customer invoices was a delicate process .
If one were to , say , compose an email while printing invoices , then the printer would be full of email print - outs instead of invoices , meaning that the batch print would need to be run from scratch .
Hired on as one of the " big guns " to help address the grim situation , John Reese was not surprised when he saw how the company 's business " logic " was being executed .
Written in Microsoft Access , invoices were created by running a macro that sent a complex series of " sendKey " commands to the UI that simulated scrolling through the records and clicking the " Print Report " button .
This was not only time - consuming , but it was what made the workstation off - limits to the user while the process was running .
The only thing missing was the duct tape .
Another developer on John 's team solved the printing part of Rube Goldberg Invoicing process and sent the process behind the scenes instead of using the dreaded sendKey commands .
John 's job was to tackle the performance problem .
First , he converted the macros to VBA so that the errors could be logged somewhere other than the invoice 's output and could be diagnosed by someone other than the customer .
John 's next task was to painstakenly identify and address the application 's unnecessary and inefficient operations , mostly by utilizing pass - through queries to SQL Server ( where the data was slowly being migrated ) rather than using the agonizingly slow JET database engine to process the data on the local machine .
While the end result was admittedly a " hack " at best , it was workable and resulted in an invoice run taking only 30 - 45 minutes .
The accountants were overjoyed , but their happiness was short lived - the invoices were now printing out of sequence and not grouping by end cusotmer .
Not a huge deal until one considers that a single run resulted in several hundred individual printouts being generated and a sorting nightmare for the poor accounting intern who had to group output by customer ... one ... by... one .
Sorting FAIL !
There 's no freaking way - I KNOW that I tested for this !
John thought out loud .
He ran his test run of 30 invoices and everything was grouped fine in the output .
Armed with his test cases , John told management that there was no way this could be the application 's fault - it had to be somewhere in the network .
The powers - that - be countered with everything was fine until YOU came along and broke it .
You 're the developer , now go and WRITE SOME CODE TO FIX IT !
Out of ideas , John had no choice but to follow an actual invoice print run all the way through which meant monitoring both the application and its printer queue .
At first , everything was coming out fine .
Just as tested .
However , once the application had placed about 100 print jobs in the printer queue , things got a little strange .
Subsequent print jobs were skipping ahead and going directly to the printer .
Suddenly it was as if a light bulb went off in John 's head .
Before the performance improvements , the printer was able to spit out paper faster than the dusty old report generation process could send requests .
Now , the creation process was much faster than the printer , so jobs started to pile up in the queue .
Just Following Orders ...
If a coded solution was what the big wigs wanted , then that was exactly what they were going to get ... and it was going to be an ugly one at that .
John 's fix was that , after sending out 100 print requests , a message box would pop up saying " Click OK to continue . "
Waiting for the user to press " OK " paused things long enough to allow the printer to catch up to the backlog of jobs in the queue .
Upon seeing this fix , management was elated .
In fact , they were so impressed by this genius solution that when the invoicing application was rewritten in VB.
NET years later , John learned that the message box still was there , just to make sure that the invoices did n't skip ahead in the printer queue .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska , March 24 ( UPI ) --
Alaska 's snow - covered Mount Redoubt was steamy but quiet Tuesday , after two days of eruptions sent plumes of ash and steam about 11 miles above Cook Inlet .
While the volcano was till releasing some steam into the morning 's mostly cloudy sky , passenger flights in the region were able to resume , the Anchorage Daily News reported .

The volcanic eruptions started Sunday night and continued Monday , forcing the cancellation of 35 Alaska Airlines flights , the Los Angeles Times reported .
Aircraft were wrapped in a protective plastic sealant and stationed overnight in Anchorage to protect them from the abrasive ash particles , the Daily News said .
" We are continuing to closely ( monitor ) the weather and ash from Mount Redoubt to assess our ability to safely operate flights in and out of Alaska , and may make further adjustments to our schedule if conditions change , " said airline Chief Executive Officer Ben Minicucci .
Alaska Volcano Observatory geophysicist John Power said the largest ash cloud rose 60,000 feet high .
" That 's about as high as they go , " he was quoted by the newspaper as saying .
The National Weather Service had declared an ash fall advisory for Susitna Valley and the Bristol Bay area to the west .
A Denver sheriff ’s deputy who pleaded guilty to a charge of animal cruelty for using Mace on a rabbit continues to oversee inmates at the Denver County Jail .
Alvin Perez , 41 , was suspended for two months without pay and then was reinstated , said people familiar with the case .
The date of his reinstatement was not available Monday .
A criminal complaint says that on May 28 , Perez saw a rabbit near where he was standing outside the Denver County Jail during his break .
He got a can of Mace and sprayed the rabbit for no apparent reason .
Perez pleaded guilty to one count of animal cruelty and was sentenced in December to one year of supervised probation , a one - year suspended jail sentence and a $ 500 fine .
Perez declined to comment .

STAMFORD , Conn . --
The family of a Connecticut woman mauled by a chimpanzee last month has filed preliminary legal papers seeking $ 50 million in damages against the primate 's owner .
Relatives of Charla Nash filed legal papers against Sandra Herold late Monday in Superior Court in Stamford .
The papers are prelude to an expected lawsuit .
They seek an accounting of Herold 's assets and an order that would prevent her from liquidating assets .
Nash is being treated at the Cleveland Clinic .
The hospital says the 55 - year - old woman lost her hands , nose , lips and eyelids and may be blind and suffering brain damage after the Feb. 16 attack in Stamford .
The 200 - pound chimp was shot and killed by police .
Herold did not immediately return a message seeking comment .
Police are weighing whether to file criminal charges against her .

Recently , a single mother lost her job in a central Florida town and was about to lose her house , too .
But then she made a seemingly simple request of the bank :
Show me the original mortgage paperwork .
And just like that , the foreclosure proceedings came to a standstill .
This homeowner , and others like her around the country , are managing to stave off foreclosure by employing a strategy that goes to the heart of the whole nationwide mess .
During the real estate frenzy of the past decade , mortgages were sold and resold , bundled into securities and peddled to investors .
In many cases , the original note signed by the homeowner was lost , stored away in a distant warehouse or destroyed .
Persuading a judge to compel production of hard - to - find or nonexistent documents can , at the very least , delay foreclosure , buying the homeowner some time and turning up the pressure on the lender to renegotiate the mortgage .
In recent interviews with The Associated Press , lawyers , homeowners and advocates outlined the produce - the - note strategy .
Exactly how many homeowners have employed it is unknown .
Nor is it clear how successful it has been ; some judges are more sympathetic than others .
A Tampa lawyer , whose Consumer Warning Network
Web site offers the free court documents this woman used to file her request , has played a major role in promoting the produce - the - note strategy .
Conversely , the deputy executive director of the American Securitization Forum , a group that represents banks , law firms and investors , dismissed the strategy as merely a stalling tactic .
He said homeowners are “ making lawyers jump through procedural hoops to delay what ’s likely to be inevitable . ”
In his opinion , the original note is almost always electronically retained and can eventually be found .
Although Judges MAY be willing to accept electronic documentation ; and , lenders are sometimes allowed to produce other paperwork to establish they are the holder of a loan , assembling such documents , to a judge ’s satisfaction , takes time , which to homeowners is the point .
A University of Iowa study last year suggested that companies servicing mortgages are often negligent when it comes to producing the documentation to support foreclosure .
In the study of more than 1,700 bankruptcy cases stemming from home foreclosures , the original note was missing more than 40 percent of the time , and other pieces of required documentation also were routinely left out .
The first big success of the produce - the - note movement came in 2007 when a federal judge in Cleveland threw out 14 foreclosures by Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. because the bank failed to produce the original notes .
Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio endorsed the strategy in a fiery speech on the House floor during debate on the federal bank bailout last month .
“ Do n’t leave your home , ” she said .
“ Because you know what ?
When those companies say they have your mortgage , unless you have a lawyer that can put his or her finger on that mortgage , you do n’t have that mortgage , and you are going to find they ca n’t find the paper up there on Wall Street . ”
April Charney , head of foreclosure defense for Jacksonville Area Legal Aid in Florida , said the strategy has been so successful for her that she now travels around the country to train other lawyers in how to use it .
She said she has gotten cases delayed for years by demanding that lenders produce paperwork they cannot find .
“ This is an army of lawyers getting out there to stop foreclosures so we can get to the serious business of creating solutions , ” Charney said .
“ Nothing good is going to happen as long as we continue to bleed homeowners . ”
So , what about that central Floridian single mother ’s case ?
Well , she filed her “ produce - the - note demand ” last fall after the bank acknowledged that her original mortgage document had been lost or destroyed .
Since then , there has been no activity on the foreclosure – no letters from the lender , and no court filings .
The Amazon appearance of a Japanese " rape game " has elicited shock and outrage and has U.K. Parliamentarian Keith Vaz , known for his staunch opposition to videogames , up in arms and promising to bring the matter before the government .
Amazon recently advertised two copies of RapeLay for sale , a game by Japanese hentai developer Illusion that puts players in the role of a rapist who stalks and attacks a single mother and her two teenage daughters .
The game also includes a " freeform mode " in which players can assault any woman in the game and get other male characters to join in , and pregnancy and abortion are actually listed as " key features . "
The whole thing is absolutely mind - boggling , and as you would expect , gamers and gaming sites that have commented on it have been universally appalled .
And although Amazon has since pulled the ad and the game is n't intended for sale or use outside Japan , it seems nonetheless that U.K. Member of Parliament Keith Vaz will use its existence to further his anti-videogame crusade .
" It is intolerable that anyone would purchase a game that simulates the criminal offense of rape , " Vaz told the Belfast Telegraph .
" To know that this widely available through a major online retailer is utterly shocking , I do not see how this can be allowed .
I will be raising this matter in Parliament and hope that action is taken to prevent the game from being sold . "
Vaz , part of the " Big Three " of videogame haters that also includes Jack Thompson and Michael Atkinson , famously claimed last year that rape was a feature in some videogames .
" When people play these things , they can interact , " he said at the time .
" They can shoot people ; they can kill people ...
They can rape women . "
Vaz 's assertion was called out not only by gamers but by a fellow MP , who checked with the BBFC and " found it to be completely unaware of any such videogame . "
Since then , the statement has been used to illustrate Vaz 's widely perceived reactionary ignorance toward videogames ; but GamePolitics suggests that the discovery of this game has given him some sense of " vindication . "
The fact that this thing is a product of the " unique " Japanese game industry does n't seem to be of great concern to Vaz .
He wanted its sale prevented and it has been , but he will almost certainly do his best to stir up a furor in Parliament anyway .
At most , Amazon made a mistake in advertising this game for sale in Western markets , and Amazon should be held accountable for it ; unfortunately , it 's far more likely that it will be the videogame industry that ultimately bears the brunt of the backlash .
Apart from being UNESCO World Heritage site , Halong Bay or Vinh Ha Long in Vietnam is well known as one of the most beautiful natural attraction in the world .
The descending dragon bay consists with thousands of isles and limestone karsts of different sizes and shapes , on which will definitely mesmerize anybody who watch them .

Wikipedia has a great legend story to add :
Local legend has it that long ago , when the Vietnamese were fighting Chinese invaders , the gods sent a family of dragons to help defend the land .
This family of dragons began spitting out jewels and jade .
These jewels turned into the islands and islets dotting the bay , linking together to form a great wall against the invaders .
The people kept their land safe and formed what later became the country of Vietnam .
After that , dragons were interested in peaceful sightseeing of the Earth and decided to live here then .
The place where Mother Dragon flew down was named Hạ Long , the place where the dragon children attended upon their mother was called Bai Tu Long island and the place where the dragon children wriggled their tails violently was called Bach Long Vy island .
Whether the local legend is true or not , Halong Bay is undeniably the most beautiful place in the world I have ever seen .
Please do enjoy my compilation of Halong Bay magnificent photos . 😀

Last Tuesday , Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , predicted that 2010 “ will be a year of recovery . ”
On Friday , Americans learned that the gross domestic product fell 6.2 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , suggesting that the recession may be deeper than anticipated .
So when , exactly , will the misery end ?
When can we expect to see the economy turn around ?

A survey has found 44 per cent of baby boomers are postponing their retirement because of the global financial crisis .
The survey by research firm TNS shows that compares to only 23 per cent in the United Kingdom and 40 per cent in the United States .
It shows most respondents also believe stock markets in Australia , and around the world , will get worse before they get better .
TNS director John Shearer says more Australian baby boomers say they are putting off their retirement than their French or German counterparts as well .
" It 's probably just because we 've had more of a focus on saving yourself for retirement than they have , in the UK particularly , " he said .
" People are much more au fait with their superannuation balance and tend to actually look at it at least once a year when their statements come in . "
Mr Shearer says Australians are more aware of how much they have saved because of compulsory superannuation .
" What we 're seeing now is suddenly with people 's superannuation balances taking a real hit of 20 or 30 per cent , people are really having to just reconsider and rethink a lot of their plans for retirement , " he said .
" Postponing your retirement is the way to put a little bit more money into that super fund balance for when you do . "
Yesterday marked the 40th anniversary of the death of Nadya Rusheva ( 1952-1969 ) .
The Mongolian - born Russian illustrator died just a month past her 17th birthday , yet she managed to produce at least 10,000 drawings in her short life .
While Rusheva is not well - known in the U.S. ( her Wikipedia entry is just two sentences ) , she has a devout following in Russia .
1. Like most children , Nadya Rusheva began drawing around the age of 5 .
It was n't until she was 7 , though , that her family began to take her artistic endeavors seriously .
She began to paint every day , and once drew 36 illustrations of " The Tale of Tsar Saltan "  in a single evening while her father read the story to her .
2. Rusheva reportedly made no preparatory drawings or sketches , nor even erased much .
According to the artist herself , " I live the life of those I draw .
I first see them " ¦ they appear on paper as watermarks , and I need to do something to lead around them " ¦ " 
She brought her characters to life in clean , flowing lines .
3 . In 1964 , Rusheva 's works were first exhibited in the offices of the opposition magazine Yunost ( Youth ) ; the magazine also published her illustrations for the first time shortly after .
Over the course of the next 5 years , Rusheva had 15 personal exhibitions around Russia , Poland , and the Ukraine .
According to an expert at the Pushkin museum , " People queued for hours to see her drawings .
Back in those times they were a gulp of fresh air , a portion of intellectual and spiritual food . " 
4. Rusheva is most famous for her illustrations of Mikhail Bulgakov 's Master and Margarita .
Originally banned in the Soviet Union , the book contains two parallel stories : the story of Master and Margarita and the story of Jesus Christ 's final days as written by the Master .
Rusheva 's illustrations of Margarita are said to bear a strong resemblance to Bulgakov 's wife , whom Rusheva never met .
Yelena Bulgakova later said , " I wish I knew this amazing and subtle creature , Nadya Rusheva . " 
5. Academics and fellow artists have praised the young illustrator , saying , " Her paintings went far beyond the limits of children 's creativity " ¦ "  and that " her sharp mind penetrated into the depths of human spirit . " 
6. Rusheva's first name has been said to mean " hope "  or " living eternally . " 
Her name and spirit will live on as close to home as the Caucasus and as far away as outer space : a pass in the Caucasus mountains is named after her , as is Asteroid 3516 Rusheva .
The third - generation iPod shuffle is here , and not a soul saw it coming .
( These days , that 's a rarity . )
Apple 's new buttonless wonder has been making waves and ruffling feathers in the days since its introduction , so we took some time with it to really see whether the hype — and the hate — was warranted .
Unlike the 2G shuffle , which came in a variety of colors , the third - gen iPod shuffle now comes in only two " colors " ( if you can even call them that ) — black and silver .
This is sure to disappoint color enthusiasts and parents who love giving shuffles as stocking stuffers , but we would n't be surprised to see colors return to the shuffle line in time .
More importantly , however , the new shuffle now comes with 4GB of storage space for the same price ( $ 79 ) as the 2G shuffle 's 1GB .
That 's half of an iPhone 3G , or a low - end 4G iPod nano .
What your $ 79 gets you
The 3G iPod shuffle comes in a square plastic box designed along the same lines as the packaging for other iPods .
The shuffle and headphone clicker are suspended front and center , while the USB 2.0 cable , remainder of the headphones , and a small instruction booklet are nestled underneath .
Compared to the previous shuffle ...
Compared to the previous shuffle , the new version obviously has no buttons , which is its main selling point , of course .
We 'll elaborate on this further into the review .
Other than the lack of buttons , the new shuffle is also smaller and more stick - like , though it 's still much tinier than the original gum - pack - sized shuffle .
It 's just a hair thinner than the second - gen shuffle ( 0.3 " thick versus the 2G's 0.41 " ) .
CONSIDERING all the projects he ’s working on , David Cross generally does n’t take to the stand - up stage unless it ’s for a good cause .
Well , that time has finally come .
On Tuesday , Cross , along with John Oliver , Zack Galifianakis , Janeane Garofalo and others , will perform at Carolines in a benefit for the Brooklyn Autism Center .
The Emmy - winning comedian , actor and writer , best known for his work on “ Mr. Show ” and “ Arrested Development , ” is currently preparing to film a series for Britain ’s Channel 4 , in which he will co-star with Will Arnett .
He ’s also putting the finishing touches on a book set to come out in August called “ I Drink for a Reason . ”
There ’s been talk about a possible “ Arrested Development ” movie .
Is it a go ?
I ’ll tell you what I know , which is , I do n’t know .
But that ’s better than what it was prior to the last four months , which was , It ’s not gonna happen .
[ Series creator ]
Mitch [ Hurwitz ] called everybody to sound out whether people were interested , and if they thought it was a good idea .
I was like , “ Yeah .
That ’ll be fun .
That ’ll be great .
Of course . ”
I ’m not trying to be flip or anything , but I really do get my “ Arrested Development ” information from whoever posts something on Defamer or wherever .
What would be the next step for Tobias Funke ?
One would hope for – and I ’m saying this as myself – a lot of comfortable silk pajamas and lounging and soft round beds , and being fed various cheeses by really hot women while getting a massage .
But that ’s probably not gonna happen .
I ’m probably gonna end up in some embarrassing situation with most of my clothes off , covered in some sort of goo .
“ Mr. Show ” fans were very excited to hear that you and Bob Odenkirk were doing a new show , and now it ’s not happening .
Why ?
Bob and I wrote some stuff , had a great time writing and shooting it and everybody was psyched .
Then we spent the next 10 days with the editors trying to cut it together , and unfortunately , no matter how we cut it – we did five completely different versions – we could never capture that feeling we had in the studio .
Do you do as much stand - up as you ’d like ?
I do exactly as much stand - up as I ’d like .
[ Fresh material ] was n’t coming naturally , so I tapered off from the hectic , consistent schedule of doing stand - up .
I ’m quite happy with doing it every once in a while , just getting up for a half - hour and f – – – ing around .
Now that Bush is out of office , what ’s there to talk about onstage ?
Some of it is , for lack of a better word , just sillier and lighter .
There ’s still plenty of stuff that will get a reaction , a gasp or something , but I ’m not doing a lot of politics .
I still do plenty of religious stuff , but I was never a political comic .
I was a comic who talked about stuff that was happening .
What ’s next for you ?
Thanks to a little something called contractual obligation , I ’m heading to Los Angeles to do the sequel . . .
I ’m sorry , did I say sequel ?
I meant squeak - quel . . . to “ Alvin and the Chipmunks , ” which I was not interested in at all until I heard they were calling it a “ squeak - quel . ”
Then I said , “ f – – – ing sign me up . ”
But yeah , that is a contractual obligation that I ca n’t get out of , so I will be doing that .
PICKING HIS BRAIN
* “ I ’m very excited about the finale of ‘ Battlestar Galactica ' ” “ I went into that show kicking and screaming .
I absolutely refused to believe it was any good – I ’ve never been a science fiction guy – and it ’s easily one of the top five shows in the last 10 years . ”
* “ After many , many years , Topps Baseball Cards is reintroducing their Stadium Club line , and I really like the new cards .
I think the photography ’s beautiful .
The emphasis is on interesting photography , not posed shots .
I miss the old Stadium Club cards , and I ’m glad to have them back . ”
* “ I got , as a present , a cookbook for The Grit , a relatively well - known vegetarian restaurant in Athens ( Ga. ) , and I ’ve been making a lot of recipes from that .
I want to cook everything in that book .
It ’s pretty amazing . ”
* ” ‘ The Best of Bootie ’ put together the best mash - ups of the year , and there ’s some amazing , amazing stuff on there .
Really cool and clever . ”
* “ I ’m way into ‘ Synecdoche , New York . ’
I love that movie , I was disappointed to see how many people did n’t quite care for it , but I thought it was great .
Completely unique .
I ’ve never seen a movie like that , and that ’s always a plus . ”
* “ For a housewarming present , my sister bought me a slow cooker , which I never used before .
That thing is f—ing amazing .
It ’s so ridiculously good .
It ’s the first time I ’ve ever cooked anything – and ‘ cooking ’ is a bit grand for what I do , I just dump a bunch of meat and vegetables into a thing and turn a switch on and leave – but it ’s literally the first stuff I ’ve ever been able to make where I go , ‘ I would pay $ 17 for bowl of this in a restaurant . ' ”
A Sudanese official said Thursday that hundreds of people were killed early this year when foreign warplanes bombed three convoys smuggling African migrants through Sudan along with weapons that apparently were destined for the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert hinted at his air force ’s possible involvement in the attacks .
They came after Israel ended a 22 - day assault on Gaza without fully achieving one of its aims : to choke off Hamas ’ weapons supply .
Israeli officials have said that the militant Islamic group is seeking more powerful weapons than the crude Kassam rockets and Grad missiles it fires at Israeli towns .
An Israeli role in the bombings , if confirmed , would underscore the Jewish state ’s determination to strike far beyond its borders to protect its security .
It also would be seen as a warning to Hamas ’ most powerful patron , Iran , which Israel alleges is developing a nuclear weapon .

The bombings brought a new layer of tragedy to Sudan , a country in the grip of an armed insurgency .
The victims were migrants from Sudan , Ethiopia and other African countries seeking a better life in Israel or Europe , and young men and boys working as porters and drivers for the smugglers .
Fatih Mahmoud Awad , a spokesman for Sudan ’s Transport Ministry , said as many as 800 people died in the attacks in January and early February .
He said each convoy had more than a dozen vehicles .
The Associated Press quoted a Sudanese Foreign Ministry official , Ali Youssef , as saying there were conflicting reports of the number of casualties .
Transport Minister Mubarak Mabrook Saleem discussed the attacks at a news conference this week in Khartoum .

The attacks were not reported in the country ’s newspapers , suggesting that the government was embarrassed to acknowledge that its sovereignty and air space could be violated so easily .
Saleem told the Associated Press that he believed the planes were American , but other officials said they were not identifiable .
The U.S. military Thursday denied having made any recent airstrikes on Sudan .
CBS News reported Wednesday that Israel carried out the bombing in January .
The network said Israel had learned of plans to move weapons north through Sudan to Egypt , then across the Sinai and through tunnels into Gaza .

Salah Bardawil , a senior Hamas official , denied that the vehicles hit were bearing weapons for Gaza .
Thirty - nine people in the 17 - truck convoy were killed , CBS said .
Awad , the Transport Ministry spokesman , put the death toll at 14 .
Reuters news agency said two warplanes hit the convoy in a desert region northwest of Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast .
Awad said 17 people were killed three weeks later in a second strike .
The third attack caused many of the smuggled weapons to explode and was by far the deadliest , he said .
The weapons were “ modern and expensive - looking , ” he said , and “ were headed for Gaza probably . ”

Israel ’s military refused to confirm or deny a role in any of the bombings .
But Olmert , speaking at an academic conference , said :
“ We operate everywhere we can hit terror infrastructure -- in close places and in places farther away .
Wherever we can hit terror infrastructure , we hit them and we hit them in a way that increases deterrence . ”
Olmert , who is scheduled to step down as prime minister next week , made the remark during a speech summing up his accomplishments .
He said Israel had acted beyond its borders in “ a series of incidents , ” a reference widely understood to include the bombing of an alleged Syrian nuclear facility in 2007 and the assassination of a top Hezbollah warlord in the Syrian capital last year .
Advertisement
Experts said Israeli warplanes had the range to fly the 1,680 - mile round trip to Sudan .
Before ending the Gaza assault Jan. 18 , Israel secured pledges from the United States and other Western nations to share intelligence on arms smuggling into Gaza and cooperate in blocking it .
Amnon Lipkin - Shahak , a former Israeli army chief of staff , said Israel would have needed such help to locate smuggling convoys in Sudan .
Israeli officials say some Gaza - bound weapons move by sea from Iran to Yemen and others are purchased in Sudan ’s flourishing arms market .

Both routes converge over land through Sudan into Egypt and are used for smuggling migrants as well as weapons .
Reva Bhalla , a Washington - based analyst with the private intelligence firm Stratfor , said Iran pays for the weapons and often sends agents of Hezbollah , the Lebanese militia , to buy them in Sudan and to hire the smugglers .
Sudanese official Awad blamed the government for neglecting eastern Sudan , driving youths into the smuggling trade .
Those killed “ were boys , many 12 or 13 years old , looking to earn some money , ” he said .
After the attacks , relatives and tribesmen began searching for loved ones , he said .

“ We missed our people and started investigating .
We eventually found the wreckage . ”

Important news here .
AP just ran a story :
" When you bring a case like this you can't stop to make political judgments as to how it might affect bilateral relations between countries , " he told the AP . "
It 's too important for that . "
Boye noted that the case was brought not against interrogators who might have committed crimes but by the lawyers and other high - placed officials who gave cover for their actions .
" Our case is a denunciation of lawyers , by lawyers , because we do n't believe our profession should be used to help commit such barbarities , " he said .
Another lawyer with detailed knowledge of the case told the AP that Garzon 's decision to consider the charges was " a significant first step . "
The lawyer spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media .
The case may well be strengthened by the DOJ 's own internal review of the Yoo and Bybee and Bradbury " legal " opinions , which were transparently abuses of the law to allow Cheney to get on with torturing .
Britain is also investigating allegations of torture against Binyam Mohammed , as Greenwald explains here .
The Brits seem to have some kind of idea that the West is governned by something called the rule of law - a state of affairs suspended for seven years under Bush and Cheney .
The US can hardly complain .
Washington invoked the same right to prosecute foreign leaders for torture last year :
This year for the first time , the United States used a law that allows for the prosecution in the United States of torture in other countries .
On Jan. 10 , a Miami court sentenced Chuckie Taylor , the son of the former Liberian president , to 97 years in a federal prison for torture , even though the crimes were committed in Liberia .
Last October , when the Miami court handed down the conviction , Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey applauded the ruling and said : “ This is the first case in the United States to charge an individual with criminal torture .
I hope this case will serve as a model to future prosecutions of this type . ”
Me too .
E.D. Kain :
The question is , at what point do symbolic gestures metamophosize into real action ?
At what point does ad hoc justice take shape and become real justice ?
When will this gain momentum ?
These investigations and proceedings should be happening in the United States .
Maybe someday they will be .
The lawyers are the beginning .
Bush and Cheney are - and must be - the ultimate targets .
They belong in jail .
And there are no statutes of limitations on war crimes .

After coming across this lovely image depicting the construction of a fly powered matchstick airplane , I had to try it for myself .
Here are the flies , trapped within their impenetrable polyethylene terephthalate dungeon of doom .
As difficult as it may be , avoid pouring the hydrochloric acid in with them .
They find it very unpleasant , and may refuse to fly for you .
Wait until after you get bored with the plane before you decide to bathe them .
Here is my luxury matchstick plane .
It features a pine body , oak tail , and an antimony sulfide nose .
The entire surface has been coated in a nitrocellulose lacquer for waterproofing and fire inducing .
As you can see , it weighs about .4 grams .
" Thirty seconds in the cooler ! "
Do n't worry , it wo n't hurt them .
They 're just sleeping .
They 'll be fine as long as you do n't forget about them .
No , that 's not a hand you see on the shelf below .
It 's a foot .
While they are chilling out , fetch your favorite adhesive .
I used a nice thick cyanoacrylic resin .
It 's fast acting and dries strong .
They certainly are n't heavyweights .
All four of them weigh less than a tenth of a gram .
They sure are ugly little buggers .
The one on the left has security issues , which is why he keeps hugging himself .
Put down a drop of glue and paste them on .
Stand them upright and try not to get glue on their wings .
Nobody likes sticky wings .
Let them warm up , and watch it fly .
Pretty soon , all airplanes will be powered by flies .
Hmmmmm ... I seem to have a little problem here .
Either I froze them too long or they are allergic to cyanoacrylate because they wo n't wake up .
Pity .
They would have been international internet superstars .
Oh well , I 'll try it again , this time using bees .
These are the bees I caught for the second trial .
Four nice big hornets , each with wings twice as long as the now obsolete flies .
See the one clinging alone in the corner ?
That 's Johnny .
I did n't bother to name the others .
I have a special sentiment towards Johnny .
You see , I watched her being born .
I was watching the nest , waiting for the return of the elders , when I noticed something moving .
One of the honeycomb cells was pulsating ; a circular opening was slowly circumscribed in the seal .
Moments later , Johnny crawled out .
Her wings glistened in the noonday sun as she took her first steps , credulously walking into my net .
Immediately upon her birth , she is cast into the throws captivity .
It was almost poetic .
You might have noticed the ironically honeycomb shaped fabric mesh sealing the jar .
It 's primary purpose is to retain the bees , but it also serves to aid in the sedation of the now irritated insidious insects .
The chilling method proving fatal , I rendered them unconscious my means of gaseous intoxication .
I filled another jar with carbon dioxide gas from my convenient compression cylinder and gently poured it through the mesh .
The effects were immediate .
The bees dropped to the bottom of the jar , twitching as the gas saturated their hemoglobin , depriving their tiny brains of viable oxygen .
Due to the density of the gas and the upright position of the jar , it remains in the presence of the bees until they are removed .
Seeing how the volatile cyanoacrylate adhesive was likely responsible for the demise of the previous subjects , I opted to use a relatively inert hot melt glue .
The bees were a bit less than cooperative , despite their lack of consciousness .
I eventually managed to secure them to the wings , albeit a little unevenly .
They regained their senses rather quickly , and nearly managed to escape their form - fitting bonds .
Now , you 'd think after all that trouble I went through I would get some spectacular results .
Sadly , this was not the case .
The bees moved about , attempting to crawl away , but flatly refused to fly .
Not even a half - hearted beat of the wings did I get from these indolent creatures .
Busy as a bee ?
More like slothful as a slug .
I guess it 's back to flies for me .
Update 19 - Jan-2007 : I 've gotten several emails explaining why the insects wo n't fly .
Apparently when their legs are touching something , it supresses their urge to fly .
If they are glued by their body segments instead , it simulates falling through the air , triggering the flight reflex .
Thus they start beating their wings .
Unfortuanately , this being the middle of winter , there are very few insects to be found .
I 'll repeat my experiment once again in the spring .

Ravenous clock runs backward , scares children .
Photo : James Day
At first glance , it does n't look like a clock .
There 's the giant fanged insect on top .
And instead of hands , it uses glowing blue LEDs to tell the time .
Called the Corpus Clock — it 's installed at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge , England — the timepiece was designed by John Taylor , an alumnus , clock collector , and lifelong inventor who wanted to blend 18th - century tech with a hypermodern aesthetic .
The bug is called a Chronophage , or time - eater , and it 's actually a scarier version of the grasshopper escapement , a 1720s breakthrough that transformed clock making .
But in this case the pendulum - driven heart is wedded to a silicon brain , which lets the device do surprisingly un-clocklike things — slow down , stop , even run backward .
" I wanted a clock that would play with you , " Taylor says .
How steampunkeriffic .
Dr. John C. Taylor describes the Corpus Clock and the Chronophage .
For more , visit wired.com / video . ### How It Works
1// Clock face
Five feet across and plated in gold , the face was molded from a single sheet of stainless steel using controlled explosions .
The hours , minutes , and seconds are displayed on the three concentric rings .
Here it 's 2:49:11 .
2// Chronophage
Articulated hinges and weights let the Chronophage rock back and forth to regulate the spring - driven escape wheel , causing it to advance once per second .

Inside the Corpus Clock are 2,736 LEDs arranged into strips that line up with the apertures in the clock face .
These LEDs do n't blink on and off — instead , three independently rotating steel rings , all driven by the escape wheel , block and unblock the LEDs .
4// Pendulum
By marrying a spring 's power to a pendulum 's swing , the Corpus Clock runs on a basic innovation first hit on by Galileo .
But the clock 's digital brain plays with the amplitude of the pendulum 's swing , making time appear to stop or even run backward .
Then the Chronophage rushes forward to catch up .

I recently wrote about the Chief of Land Forces for the Canadian Forces , Lt. - Gen. Andrew Leslie , commenting on the need for the military to take a year long ‘ operational break ’ to rebuild after our commitment in Afghanistan .
I failed to mention that it is partly because Canada is suffering 4 times the casualty rate of American troops in Afghanistan because Canada is in one of the most dangerous provinces of Afghanistan .
Apparently the late - night Fox show , “ Red Eye ” with Greg Gutfeld , thought this was something to mock .
They started by suggesting the Lt. - General ’s name , Andrew Leslie , was “ an unusual name for a man . ”
Then host Greg Gutfeld said the time off was necessary to “ do some yoga , paint landscapes , and run on the beach in gorgeous white capri pants . ”
Columnist and comedian Doug Benson was asked to weigh in : “ I did n’t even know they were in the war .
I thought that was where you go if you do n’t want to fight – go chill in Canada . ”
As Ian Welsh of the Huffington Post pointed out , “ No , Fox and the Republican party is where people go who avoid fighting .
None of the panelists on the show appear to have ever served in the military . ”
It was hard to continue watching the video , but they go on to say we are ‘ not a smart culture ’ , the time off is for ‘ manicures and pedicures ’ , and Canada would not be able to take this time off if they did n’t share a border with “ the most powerful country in the universe . ”
This is exactly the kind of selfish and contemptuously typical American frame of thought that repeatedly warranted them the title of ‘ greatest threat to world peace ’ in international polls ( here , here , here , here , here , here … ) .
Maybe if more people had a Canadian frame of thought , humanity would be a lot better off .
There would n’t be a need for massive armies and military spending – that money and effort could go to better use …
Many public figures spoke out about the piece .
Conservative commentator Geoff Norquay called it “ insulting and beneath contempt . ”
Steve Staples of the Rideau Institute called it a “ shameful display ” to laugh it up at the expense of families who have lost loved ones .
“ The dismissal of Canadian efforts in Afghanistan simply rubs salt in the wounds of Canadian families whose sons and daughters have been injured or killed in the war . ”
Calling Canada ’s military “ the best little army in the world , ” retired Gen .
Lewis MacKenzie blasted the American panelists as “ distasteful ” and showing an “ appalling ignorance . ”

A mystery Belfast woman who cared for a baby elephant in her back garden during the war years has finally been identified .
The ‘ elephant angel ’ was Denise Weston Austin , who was one of the first female zoo keepers in Belfast Zoo .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Along with her mother Irene , Denise took baby elephant Sheila in to her north Belfast home after it escaped an order to euthanize some of the more dangerous animals at the zoo .
Nine lions , two tigers and a number of bears and wolves were killed on the orders of the Ministry of Public Security because of fears that they would escape and threaten the public if the zoo was damaged in a German bombing raid .
Earlier this week the zoo - which is celebrating its 75th anniversary - launched a campaign to find the mystery owner and , through a surviving relative , have found more information on her identity .
Her second cousin , David Ramsey from Belfast , described her as an “ eccentric ” lady who lived in an exotic home in north Belfast called Loughview House .
Mr Ramsey also said that Sheila the elephant only lived with Ms Austin in the evening .
He said : “ When the Head Keeper , Dick Foster , left work , Denise took Sheila from her enclosure , walked her a short distance to her house at Whitewell Road , and walked her back up to the zoo in the morning , sometimes stopping at a shop , the Thrones Stores , on the Whitewell road for stale bread .
“ It was also known in the area that she took Sheila for evening walks .
During the night Sheila slept in the Austin ’s garage .
“ Sheila was given hay from the family farm , which was of a much better quality than the zoo could provide during an era of rationing . ”

Sheila managed to stay hidden due to the large walls which surrounded the house , and zoo staff were not aware of her second home until she chased a dog into a neighbours garden , breaking the fence .
Neighbours brought the incident to the attention of the Head Keeper , whereupon Sheila had to remain in the zoo .
Denise continued to visit Sheila in the zoo , particularly at night during Luftwaffe air raids , when she rubbed her ears to keep her calm .
Ms Austin died in 1997 , but her cousin said he believed she would have been “ tickled pink with all the attention ” .

When the Rev. Tomasito Veneracion arrived in this Muslim nation seven years ago , his Roman Catholic parishioners prayed in small groups scattered in apartments , schools , and one tiny makeshift chapel .
At Easter , Indian Catholics gathered in one place , Filipinos in another , Arabs in yet another .
But with last year 's opening of Our Lady of the Rosary Church , his congregants for the first time had a recognized , central place to worship .
On Christmas Eve , 15,000 attended a midnight mass , with those who could n't cram into the 2,700 - seat church watching on video screens outside .
" When I first came here , the church was not recognized .
But now we are enjoying this gift , " Father Veneracion says .
" It 's a tremendous feeling of relief that we can breathe , worship , and pray in a place without fear and without disturbance . "
The decision to permit church building is widely seen as part of an effort by Qatar 's leader , Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani , to modernize the tiny emirate , made wealthy by its natural - gas reserves , and demonstrate traditional Islam 's flexibility and tolerance .
" It 's showing the world they are open to new ideas , and I guess it 's part of growing up as a nation , " said Veneracion .
Our Lady of the Rosary will soon be joined by several churches under construction in what is informally known as " Church City , " a 99 - acre site leased to Christian denominations by the Qatar government .
Qatar 's Christians , estimated at 70,000 to 80,000 , are almost entirely expatriate workers , principally from India and the Philippines .
The move gave Qatar its first church since Islam took root here in the 7th century .
It also brought Qatar into line with most of its Gulf neighbors , which have all had at least one church for decades .
The one exception is Saudi Arabia , whose inflexible strain of Islam still bans worship of another faith .
Diplomats in Riyadh say , however , that a more relaxed atmosphere has emerged in recent years .
Private services in homes are disrupted far less often , and fewer Christians are arrested , diplomats report .
Customs agents no longer confiscate Bibles and crucifixes from arriving foreigners .
Though Qatar is not a pioneer in permitting an open Christian presence in the Gulf , it is bucking a massive ultraconservative drift in contemporary Islam around the world that rejects cooperation with other faiths .
Al Qaeda spokesmen have berated Qatar for authorizing church construction .
Qatar 's 200,000 citizens , who enjoyed the world 's highest per capita income as of 2007 , adhere to the same Islamic legal tradition as Saudi Arabians .
But they differ in practice , being far more relaxed about publicly enforcing a strict social and moral code .
Most Qataris " are happy with what we 're doing because they are devout Muslims and they want their Christian employees to be able to pray , " said the Rev. Canon Bill Schwartz , Anglican rector of Doha 's Church of the Epiphany .
Mr. Schwartz is overseeing construction of the Anglican church complex going up next door to the Catholic compound .
Under an agreement with the government , the facility will also be used by several other Protestant and Evangelical denominations .
Schwartz anticipates that it will serve 20,000 worshipers in any given week .
The complex , likely to cost around $ 12 million and take years to complete , is being built in stages .
Schwartz is hopeful the first phase can be ready for use by the end of 2009 .
" We 're asking for money from anybody who'll give it to us , " he says .
" It is very much a work of faith , including on the part of the contractor . "
Schwartz ministers to a dispersed congregation of about 30 nationalities .
On Fridays , the day of worship for all faiths in Qatar , he presides at services in a school gym .
But scores of other services are held in villas , hotels , and restaurants , he says .
Besides the Anglican and Roman Catholic compounds , buildings are also under construction for Copts , Greek Orthodox , and Indian Protestants at the leased site about eight miles from downtown Doha .
The government 's move to permit church building , which began to surface after it established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 2002 , was controversial among Qataris .
A final decision was taken only after a 2003 referendum approving the country 's new Constitution , which guarantees freedom of worship .
Also , Qatar - based Muslim cleric
Yusuf al - Qaradawi , who has wide influence in the Middle East , ruled that Christians have a right to build a church in Muslim lands , just as Muslims are permitted to construct mosques in non-Muslim countries .
Both Schwartz and Veneracion , who wear their clerical collars when visiting government offices , but not elsewhere , say that they have not encountered hostility .
" The government asks us to be discreet , " says Schwartz , which is why none of the churches have exterior bells or crosses .
Christian proselytizing is forbidden .
Veneracion said that Qatar 's prime minister attended last March 's ribbon - cutting ceremony at his church , whose $ 15 million cost was financed mostly by Catholics living in the Gulf states .
The next day 's consecration of the building was attended by six bishops , 40 priests , and congregants from 67 nations , who carried their flags in a parade .
" We have 16 masses on Friday alone " with an average attendance of about 8,000 , said Veneracion , who is Filipino and has a staff of five other priests .
Masses are said in Konkani , English , Tagalog , Sinhala , Arabic , Malayalan , Urdu , Tamil , French , and Italian .
During a recent visit to the church , a police car was stationed outside .
It is there 24 hours a day , Veneracion says , to protect against any untoward incident .
A group of young Lebanese Catholics socializing in the sun-filled plaza said they were thrilled to have a worship place of their own .
" You know , the church is first a community before being a stone place , " said Maroun Nassar , an electrical engineer who runs the Arabic catechism classes .
" But now , we can gather officially without offending the Qataris . "
The next day , Indonesian Catholics gathered in one of the small church halls for a belated Christmas service .
There were two decorated trees , and the choir , accompanied by an electric keyboard , sang " It Came Upon a Midnight Clear . "
" You cannot imagine , " said engineer Adi Dwinanto when asked how he felt about the new church .
" It 's just amazing , that here in this country we can do this freely ....
All of us are happy , for sure . "

It 's easy and modern and I love it , " Zaeef said as he pinched and pulled his fingers across the iPhone 's touch screen last week .
" This is necessary in the world today .
People want to progress . "
Beyond making life easier , some say the country 's embrace of technology could help break the cycle of 30 years of relentless warfare .
It puts at the tip of a finger many things that were strictly outlawed by Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar - music , movies , pictures of people and games like chess .
Young Afghans see the world differently from older Afghans because of their use of the Internet and mobile phones , and their participation in sports , said Shukria Barakzai , a female lawmaker and former newspaper editor .
Afghanistan 's youth are not caught up in " the old circle of war , " she said .
" They are engaging with the rest of the world .
That 's why technology is so important for Afghanistan . "
As an example she uses the popular television show Afghan Star , a version of the American Idol - style singing contest , which draws millions of viewers each week , both young and old .
Viewers vote for a winner by text messaging , helping to promote democratic practices , she said .
Eight years ago Afghanistan had only a few hundred cell phone users , mostly members of the Taliban government .
Today it has more than 8 million , meaning roughly one in four Afghans uses a mobile phone , according to government figures .
NATO Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said in a speech earlier this year that Afghanistan was " in the Middle Ages " when the Taliban was toppled .
Today , he said , half the country is at peace and access to education and health care are up 10 - fold .
" When I saw an Afghan fellow pull out his Apple iPhone in Kabul , while I was talking on my five - year - old NATO mobile , I saw another symbol of progress , " he said of a recent trip to Afghanistan .
The Afghan capital has one gleaming mall , with glass elevators and escalators and a rare European - style coffee shop .
Electronic stores stocked with GPS units , Sony PlayStations , flat screen TVs and iPods fill the shopping center .
Faridullah , the owner of an electronics store who like many Afghans goes by one name , said he sells about four iPhones a month to wealthy Afghans .
The price in Kabul has dropped from $ US1100 one month ago to about $ US800 today , he said .
" The country is really progressing now .
Nine years ago the country did n't know about mobile phones .
We can't compare today to nine years ago , " he said .
" It 's like a custom now in Afghanistan that even if someone does n't have enough money to eat he 'll still carry an expensive cell phone . "
The nation 's leading mobile phone company , Roshan , added 1 million customers between June and early February , when it surpassed 3 million users .
Roshan offers mobile banking services so users can send money to others through their phones , and it began offering BlackBerry service in August , the first company in Afghanistan to do so .
Still , the average annual income in Afghanistan is just $ US800 , so shop owners must target the ultra - wealthy and foreigners .
Most Afghans never have heard of an iPhone , and Roshan reaches only 56 percent of the population .
" It 's still pretty expensive , " Jawid , the owner of another electronics store , said of iPhones and other modern gadgets .
" The problem is the economy , otherwise people are very interested in the new technologies . "
Many shops in Kabul sell a Chinese - made iPhone copy that shop owners say can do most things a real iPhone can .
The fake sells for $ US300 .
" People use the internet on it and it goes for a reasonable price , " Orash said .
Zaeef , the former Taliban official , said he has always been interested in technology despite his militant links .
He used a laptop and satellite phone to access the internet in the late 1990s , and now he surfs the web an hour a day , he said .
Zaeef said he tried to persuade top Taliban officials to let Afghans have more access to modern electronics in the late 1990s , and he noted that the Taliban itself now embraces technology .
Militants use remote control devices to set off roadside bombs , and they produce high - quality videos of attacks that they post on militant Web sites .
The Taliban movement is highly fractured and is essentially a loose knitting of commanders who wield ultimate authority in their regions .
As a result , some commanders have relaxed strict social rules against technology and now allow TVs and music .
But others have ripped down satellites from homes and thrown out TVs from village barber shops and tea houses .
" All the time with the technology I tried to get them to investigate about the negative and the positive .
I thought the positive outweighed the negative , " he said .
" I tried , but unfortunately I was not successful . "

Vote fraud at issue in YR race
Here 's an interesting entry in the long - running , partisan battle over ( usually , Republican ) allegations of widespread ( Democratic ) voter fraud :
A leading candidate to head the Young Republican National Federation is also one of the few people actually charged and convicted for voting shenanigans in recent years .
The candidate , Rachel Hoff , pled guilty to the misdemeanor of notarizing absentee ballot signatures without actually witnessing them during the 2004 South Dakota Senate race , when she was working for the state Republican Party on behalf of John Thune , who went on to beat Tom Daschle .
Local authorities charged six Republicans with violating the rules , and the State Attorney General , Larry Long , explained the rare decision to prosecute notary violations on the grounds that they had invalidated the ballots of students who intended to vote .
Long said at the time that " there 's no indication that any unqualified voter tried to cast an absentee ballot , " the Argus Leader reported .
The lack of indication of actual fraudulent voting did n't get in the way of a large - scale GOP effort to claim voting fraud in the run-up to last year 's election , but Hoff said in an interview that she did n't see a connection .
" It 's certainly an issue and it's got to be taken seriously , " she said of voting fraud , saying that her goal as chair would be to help " young people make sure they 're not cogs in the wheel of an unethical process " as she had been .
She called the misdemeanor , made when she was just 22 and in the process of " cutting corners , " a mistake , and said it had taught her a " harsh lesson . "
Perks : Disgraced banker Peter Cummings has left HBOS with an estimated £ 10 m pension pot
The disgraced banker who helped bring Halifax Bank of Scotland to its knees was given a £ 600,000 pay - off and is likely to receive a pension of more than £ 400,000 a year .
Peter Cummings , who masterminded many of the stricken bank 's high - profile deals , has left with a pension pot estimated at £ 10 million - plus .
The one - time tea boy was sacked last month following the merger with profitable Lloyds TSB but details of his extraordinary golden goodbye emerged only last night .
Cummings , 53 , was in charge of the ill - fated HBOS corporate lending division which is now being blamed for piling up a mountain of toxic debts .
His reckless practices have returned to haunt HBOS 's new owner Lloyds .
Losses on its corporate loans rose tenfold to £ 6.7 billion after a raft of its deals with property and construction companies blew up .
The latest ' fat cat failure ' row echoes the furore generated by former RBS chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin - who is insisting that he will take a £ 693,000 - a- year pension deal after his exit in October .
Last night , government officials asked Lloyds Banking Group - created as a result of a rushed merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS last autumn and 43 per cent state owned - to review pay - offs to Cummings and other executives .
A spokesman for UK Financial Investments - which manages the taxpayer stakes in part - nationalised banks - said Lloyds had agreed to ensure ex-directors had got ' no more than was legally necessary ' .
Beleaguered HBOS announced catastrophic annual losses of £ 10.8 billion yesterday as its new owner Lloyds warned it would mean a slide into the red for the combined organisation this year .
Catastrophic : HBOS has just announced annual losses of £ 10.8 billion
The news saw shares in Lloyds Banking Group close down 22 per cent in a day , at 58.3 p .
The losses will fuel growing calls for an inquiry into the ' shotgun marriage ' between the once - strong Lloyds TSB and the ailing HBOS .
Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank has revealed that the Prime Minister offered to suspend competition law to allow the takeover during talks at a City cocktail party .
But yesterday Mr Brown attempted to distance himself from the deal , insisting : ' That was a decision that was made by Lloyds and HBOS - it was a merger that they decided .
' The Government made possible the arrangements that followed their decision , but of course it was their decision to do so . '
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said : ' Gordon Brown has a reputation for acting like Macavity when things go wrong , but even by his standards attempting to claim he had nothing to do with the Lloyds / HBOS merger is staggering .
' He claimed the credit last year for pushing these two banks together .
He should demonstrate the leadership required to take responsibility for the consequences . '
More than 20,000 staff are likely to lose their jobs because of the merger .
And the spiralling losses at HBOS mean the so - called ' Bank of Britain ' - already 43 per cent owned by the taxpayer - might have to come back to the Government for another handout .
Talks with the Treasury over dumping the worst of its bad loans on the taxpayer remained deadlocked last night , but analysts believe the lender will seek guarantees worth £ 250 billion .
Controversy will be stoked by Cummings 's retirement deal , which experts said would be worth more than £ 400,000 a year .
Cummings , who was sacked in January , was paid more than £ 2.5 million in salary and bonuses in 2007 - more than HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby .
Banking analyst Alex Potter said : ' The scale of the deterioration in the HBOS book has shocked us . '
Almost 50,000 Halifax Bank of Scotland mortgage customers are more than three months behind in their repayments , the bank revealed yesterday .
More worrying is the fact that nearly one in five HBOS borrowers has plunged into negative equity - where the size of the loan is greater than the value of the home .

AUSTIN – The Texas Department of Transportation announced this morning that it has officially killed the Trans Texas Corridor , saying that despite the project ’s visionary aspects , “ it is clearly not the choice of Texans . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The announcement comes six years after Gov. Rick Perry shook up the state ’s transportation and political circles by unveiling an ambitious plan to stretch highways , rail lines and utilities for hundreds of miles along the Interstate 35 and Interstate 69 corridors .
The plan , which would have cost tens of billions of dollars and relied heavily on private toll roads , was hugely controversial .
Amadeo Saenz , executive director of TxDOT , made the announcement that the agency was giving up on the idea at the annual Transportation Forum in Austin .
“ Make no mistake , the Trans Texas Corridor as we have known it no longer exists , ” he said .

Andrew Ross Sorkin Explains
Today 's New York Times features a fascinating front - page article by Andrew Ross Sorkin , entitled " The Case for Paying Out Bonuses at A.I.G. " .
Sorkin argues that if we do not pay $ 165 million in performance bonuses to executives at the failed insurer , we risk chipping at the very foundations of the rule of law :
If you think this economy is a mess now , imagine what it would look like if the business community started to worry that the government would start abrogating contracts left and right .
As much as we might want to void those A.I.G. pay contracts , Pearl Meyer , a compensation consultant at Steven Hall & Partners , says it would put American business on a worse slippery slope than it already is .
Business agreements of other companies that have taken taxpayer money might fall into question .
Even companies that have not turned to Washington might seize the opportunity to break inconvenient contracts .
If government officials were to break the contracts , they would be “ breaking a bond , ” Ms. Meyer says .
“ They are raising a whole new question about the trust and commitment organizations have to their employees . ”
It may be worth recalling why taxpayers now own 80 % of American International Group .
AIG 's business model for the past few years was make expensive promises about the creditworthiness of third parties .
In exchange for a fee , AIG would guarantee to pay you in the event someone else defaulted .
When those third parties began to run into trouble , AIG discovered that it actually could n't meet its obligations .
Without massive government assistance , the company announced , it would have to start abrogating contracts left and right .
This is nice work if you can get it .
I personally would also like to offer insurance on the creditworthiness of large corporations , backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
Treasury , and I bet I could do it at lower rates than even AIG .
In fact , if readers will PayPal me the money , I will happily insure the creditworthiness of any listed or unlisted corporation for one penny per dollar per year .
As we computer programmers put it , if it does n't have to work , I can make it run as fast as you want .
When a small company does what AIG did , it is called ' fraud ' and people are sent to jail .
However , since AIG had signed contracts with most of the biggest financial institutions in the world , it instead received a very large sum of money ( $ 170 billion so far ) .
This also makes sense .
When a teenage kid breaks your storefront window , you chase him down and give him a pounding .
But when the local mafia breaks your window , you sweep up the glass and make sure to increase the heft of your next monthly envelope .
Mr. Sorkin is now arguing that contracts AIG signed with the financial " brainiacs " who bankrupted the company also need to be honored , however distasteful it seems to us .
This makes it particularly instructive to read an article of Mr. Sorkin 's from three months ago , discussing the future of General Motors , in which he advocates that the company be taken into bankruptcy so that its contracts with " gold - plated " employees can be renegotiated , or nullified :
G.M. currently employs about 8,000 people who actually do n’t come to work .
Those who do go to work are paid about $ 10 to $ 20 an hour more than people who do the same job building cars in the United States for foreign makers like Toyota .
At G.M. , as of 2007 , the average worker was paid about $ 70 an hour , including health care and pension costs .
Those costs are already coming down slightly because of a renegotiated deal with U.A.W. last year , but not nearly enough
....
Part of the problem is summed up by comments like this one in The Detroit Free Press , made by Kandy O’Neill , 39 , an assembler at G.M. ’s plant in Lake Orion , Mich. , where she builds the Chevy Malibu and Pontiac G6 .
“ I think we ’ve given enough , ” she said about the cuts to her salary and pension plan .
“ Everybody wants to come down hard on the workers , ” she said .
“ Nobody knows what we do inside there but the people who work there .
It ’s hard .
It is not an easy job . ”
When you read a line like that you might sympathize with her , but then you realize that nothing can be accomplished without bankruptcy .
Ms. O’Neill : your company is asking the taxpayers — many of whom do n’t have health care coverage — to pay your salary and health insurance . "
This second article is full of interest .
It 's worth explaining that Mr. Sorkin 's figure of $ 70 / hr is not actually the hourly wage of an auto worker - that is between $ 14 and $ 33/ hr , based on the type of work performed .
GM 's figure comes from adding in such things as payroll taxes and health insurance .
But breaking it down to an hourly figure serves the helpful propaganda purpose of making it sound like Kandy O'Neill and others like her are taking home half a grand a day in cold , hard cash , rather than living a modest middle - class life in Michigan .
The notion that a livable wage with basic health insurance ( five free doctor visits a year ) and some vacation and sick days represent " gold - plated benefits " says a lot about Mr. Sorkin and his view of the world .
But even using GM 's cost figures , a single $ 3 million rentention bonus for one AIG " moneymaker " is enough to cover the cost of 1200 skilled union auto workers .
Yet according to Sorkin , contracts with the former are bulletproof , while contracts with the latter need to be renegotiated posthaste from a position of strength , or broken if necessary through bankruptcy .
The simple idea that the egregious AIG bonuses could also be nullified through bankruptcy does not enter into the equation .
And I cannot seem to find a quote from Pearl Meyer or other compensation professionals about the trust and committment companies need to show their blue - collar employees , though I will continue looking .
Sorkin 's second argument for paying out the AIG bonuses is much stronger , and perfectly explains the difference between the two situations :
A.I.G. employees concocted complex derivatives that then wormed their way through the global financial system .
If they leave — the buzz on Wall Street is that some have , and more are ready to — they might simply turn around and trade against A.I.G. ’s book .
Why not ?
They know how bad it is .
They built it .
Future GM employees , if there are any , would do well to learn from this , and build self - destruct circuits into their vehicles .
And Mr. Sorkin should stop avoiding simple words like " extortion " and " ransom " if he is so concerned about defending the rule of law .
Chinese officials say that potentially deadly radioactive material lost in north - western Shaanxi province may have been found at a steel mill .
Officials told the BBC that they had detected what may be the missing Caesium - 137 , adding that it may have been melted down .
The Caesium - 137 , encased in lead , was lost this week when workers at a cement plant demolished an old factory .
The material was part of a measuring instrument and is extremely dangerous .
Caesium - 137 is a radioactive isotope , formed mainly through nuclear fission .
The smallest amount can cause infertility , cancer and even death .
Eight trucks worth of scrap gathered at the disused factory in Tongchuan city were sold to a local steel mill , according to official news agency Xinhua .
Local environmental officials told the BBC they were mounting a clean - up operation at the mill in Fuping county .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Beijing says China has an appalling record on industrial safety - there are around 30 cases of radioactive material being lost every year .
Last July , a farmer in Shaanxi province was arrested after he stole a similar radioactive container and attempted to sell it for scrap .

Skydiving is the single most exciting sport there is .
Nothing even comes close to the exhilaration you feel when floating on a cushion of air , and flying your canopy safely to the ground .
It ’s also very misunderstood , and filled with many common fallacies and misconceptions that keep most people from trying this beautiful sport .
It ’s heavily regulated by national organizations and in comparison to past decades and studying statistics , it ’s surprisingly safe !
To participate in it regularly , you ’re required to obtain sufficient training and a license .
It can be a long , expensive process to get your license , but once you do , the feeling of accomplishment is like no other .
I highly suggest you try it at least once in your life .
10 Rip Cord
Skydiving Myth : Skydivers pull a rip cord
Actually , rip cords pretty much went out with the round chute back in the early 1980’s .
Skydivers using modern day “ rigs ” ( the entire contraption of harness , container and canopies ) , throw out a pilot chute which is tucked into a pocket on the bottom of the container , just above your butt .
The pilot chute is a small parachute attached to a “ bridle ” which is attached to the main chute .
As the pilot chute is deployed , it catches the wind and pulls the closing pin which releases the packed main chute , pulling it from the container , so it will inflate … we hope .
You can find a more detailed description of this process here .
There are some dropzones who still use rip-cord gear when teaching their students .
Once they ’re properly trained however , they graduate to the common bottom of container design .
A reserve deployment does use a rip cord to activate the chute , but this is an entirely different design and we hope we never have to pull that handle .
9 Freefall Chatter
Skydiving Myth :
You can talk or yell to each other during freefall
Despite what you ’ve seen in movies like Point Break and Cutaway , you cannot hear another skydiver during freefall .
Perhaps if you were to yell into his year , you may hear a little but you certainly can’t have any type of conversation .
The wind traveling past your ears at well over 100 mph pretty much makes you deaf to all sounds .
Additionally , it would be very hard to fight during freefall as well .
8 Chute Deployment
Skydiving Myth :
When you deploy your chute , you go back up .
This is a common fallacy .
One thing a skydiver cannot do is go back up .
What you ’re seeing when a skydiver deploys and goes up is an optical illusion .
You ’re actually seeing the videographer shooting the skydiver continue falling away from the one deploying who is obviously slowing down .
By the way , that ’s me you see deploying !
7 Unconscious Drop
Skydiving Myth :
If you ’re ever knocked unconscious in free fall , you ’re dead
Another common fallacy ; it ’s understandable how this could be perceived however .
Think about it … if you ’re ever knocked out by a mid-air collision with a fellow skydiver , who ’s going to deploy your chute ?
Well , most skydivers jump with a device known as an Automatic Activation Device ( AAD ) .
It ’s a small , air - pressure and speed sensitive unit that will cut the closing loop of your reserve chute so that it deploys automatically .
They are usually set so that if you drop below 750 feet above ground level at over 78 mph , it goes off .
If you are unconscious , your landing will likely be rough and you may injure yourself or perhaps still die , but landing without any chute at all would be far worse .
Some skydivers choose to jump without one because they are a mechanical device that can fail and possibly misfire , although they rarely do .
The odds of it working when needed far outweigh the odds of it malfunctioning and deploying your reserve when you do n’t want it to .
You can read more about how these amazing units work here .
6 Fall Speed
Skydiving Myth : Everyone falls at the same speed .
Despite what some people think , everyone falls at a different rate and the speeds will vary depending on weight ( heavier people fall faster ) , body position and clothing ( baggy jumpsuits slow you down , tight fitting suits go faster ) .
The average terminal velocity in the belly down position is around 120 mph .
Some of the more advanced freeflying positions like “ Head Down ” or “ Sit Fly ” can push a jumper to over 200 mph !
Essentially the less amount of surface area to the wind , the faster you go .
It takes a lot of work to contort the body in an arch ( to speed up ) and cup ( to slow down ) in order to catch up and stay with a group .
5 Chute Packing
Skydiving Myth : A skydiver always packs his own chute
A good skydiver learns to pack his own chute early on in his / her skydiving career and continues to do so .
However , there is no legal obligation to pack your own chute .
There are trained packers who work at drop zones and will pack your chute for you .
Generally the cost is around 5 to 7 dollars per pack .
Many skydivers however , choose to stick to packing their own chutes because they know how they like it packed ( there are small variations for smoother openings ) and ultimately , who are you going to trust with your life ?
Yourself or some kid working the summer for 6 bucks a pack ?
If you choose to use the packer , be sure to tip them well !!
4 Deployment Altitude
Skydiving Myth :
You can deploy your chute at any altitude
I had an argument with a friend who was reading about military HALO operations , ( High Altitude , Low Opening ) and insisted that these military skydivers would freefall all the way down to between 100 and 50 feet then deploy their chute and land safely , this of course , is simply not possible .
Freefall speeds can be anywhere from 100 to 160 mph depending on varying scenarios ; that ’s over 170 feet per second !
A good main parachute needs about 600 to 800 feet to open for two reasons .
First , it needs to inflate .
The cells are closed end and a great deal of air needs to fill the cells before the chute is operational .
Second , it needs to opens fairly slowly to keep from injuring or even killing the skydiver .
A hard opening chute can kill a person when they go from 120 mph to 18 mph in only two or three seconds .
Hard openings are usually a result of packing error .
Fatal hard openings are extremely rare but a ‘ normal ’ hard opening can make you see stars , and bruises !
Minimum opening altitudes ( as regulated by the USPA and CSPA ) are 2500 feet for A licensed skydivers and 2200 feet for B , C , and D. Reserve chutes are designed to open much faster due to their necessity to do so quickly .

3 Oxygen Masks
Skydiving Myth :
You need to wear oxygen masks at very high altitudes
Only on the plane .
Hypoxia can set in quickly at 18,000 feet , so it ’s necessary for planes to supply it when climbing to that altitude and beyond .
The most common high altitude jumps are between 10,500 and 14,000 feet .
Some larger drop zones with larger planes , will offer special “ extra - high ” jumps of 22,000 feet .
This of course costs “ extra- cash ” .
Some fancier planes offer masks , but more often it consists of a small hose coming out of the ceiling of the plane and you simply put it in your mouth up until you jump .
Once you ’re out , you ’re only at that altitude for a short time , so extra oxygen on the jump itself is n’t necessary .
2 Altitude Dangers
Skydiving Myth :
The higher the altitude , the more dangerous the jump .
Actually it ’s the opposite .
Skydivers want as much altitude as possible .
Not just for the extra freefall time , but also it gives us extra time correct a correctable problem that may arise .
It takes about 1480 feet to reach terminal velocity ( around 120 mph ) .
Whether it ’s a 1500 foot fall or 15,000 foot fall , having a bad chute or no chute at all – the outcome is not going to be good .
Ultimately , there is no “ safer ” altitude for a high speed impact .
And considering the 600 to 800 feet it takes for a chute to open , I ’ll stay above 3000 feet when I jump , anything lower would just be crazy !
1 Terminal Velocity
Skydiving Myth :
It ’s possible to survive a terminal velocity impact
Everyone has heard the story : A skydiver jumped from 15,000 feet , his chute did n’t open and he landed in a muddy field and only broke his leg , or his back , or only ended up in a wheelchair , but he survived !
There ’s always something wrong with the story however .
Many times it ’s completely made up .
But in almost all these cases , there was “ something ” out , meaning there was a tangled mess of a chute ( malfunction ) or both chutes ( double malfunction – extremely rare ! ) trailing behind the jumper .
This can slow your descent down considerably .
An impact into soft ground or trees at 45 mph is certainly survivable .
You wo n’t enjoy it , but you have a better chance of survival .

Gov. Mark Sanford ( R - SC ) continues to try to give a rise to his 2012 presidential hopes by waging war against the stimulus package .
Today on the Glenn Beck show , Sanford said that accepting stimulus money was the equivalent of fiscal child abuse .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
Host Glenn
Beck sought to clarify Sanford ’s point that it was better for the future of the children in his state not to take the federal stimulus money .
Sanford said , “ Since we do n’t have any of this money that ’s now being dispensed from Washington , DC ; since we ’re going out and printing money and we ’re issuing debt to solve a problem that was created by too much debt ; since that ’s taking place , and since those costs will be borne by the next generation , in fact it is sort of fiscal child abuse to do what we ’re doing . ”
Let ’s give Gov. Sanford a little straight talk about poor children in his state .
According to the most recent data available from National Center for Children in Poverty , compiled before the recession , 19 % of the children in his state live in poverty , and 39 % of those children have only one parent that is employed either part year or part time , while 33 % of the children do n’t have an employed parent .
According to South Carolina Kids Count , 14 % of First Graders are not ready for first grade , and 13 % of students in the state have to repeat one of the first three grades .
Thirty three percent of all tenth graders fail one part of their exit exam on their first try , and 32 % of students do n’t graduate high school .
The real child abuse comes in healthcare .
According to a November 2008 study by FamiliesUSA , South Carolina has the 13th highest percentage of uninsured children in the country at 12.2 % , and even worse , 88.5 % of these uninsured children come from homes where at least one parent works year round .
As bad as these numbers are , I suspect that all have gotten worse during this recession .
The state ’s unemployment rate is already at 11 % , and is expected to peak at 14 % , yet Sanford thinks it is child abuse to help poor families with stimulus money .
We all know that Sanford is just one of the Republican governors who are throwing their states under the bus in the hope of being the 2012 GOP nominee .
However , to compare the taking of federal stimulus money to child abuse when the governor is turning down money that would help the poor children of his state , for the sole purpose of advancing his own political ambitions is wrong .
Sanford is trying to build his rep as real conservative off of turning down stimulus money .
While this may appeal to some Republicans , I ca n’t see how it helps his political star with the rest of the country .
Comments
Friends , by now you know the story .
Uncle Moneybags has given $ 170 Bn to AIG to prevent them from going under because of mismanagement .
They in turn are paying bonuses to the very executives who mismanaged them in the first place .
They say they ’re contractually obligated .
Well , if they ’d gone bankrupt , these same executives would n’t have gotten a dime .
They do n’t get it .
They just –don ’ t–get it .
They really do n’t understand that we ’re no longer in “ business as usual mode . ”
That they ca n’t buy expensive drapes or parchment wastebaskets on the taxpayer ’s nickel .
But –I ’m owed this money –it ’s in my contract .
Jumpin ’ Jehosophat , did n’t it ever occur to the lawyers who drew up these contracts to write in –” If the company tanks , no bonuses will be paid ” ?
Even if AIG did n’t go bankrupt , why should anyone want to pay these guys for screwing up so bad ?
In the words of one dope earlier this year , “ Well , if we do n’t pay our best people , we wo n’t be able to keep them . ”
Best people ???
You want to keep these jerks ?
No , let them join the ranks of the unemployed .
Let them suffer the utter humiliation of driving to the unemployment office in last year ’s BMW .
“ Well , ” said the lawyers , “ if we do n’t pay them , we might be subject to litigation . ”
Let ‘em sue .
You say , “ the government of the United States gave us orders not to pay these bonuses . ”
Then let them sue the US Government .
But you say–it ’s only a couple of hundred million –compared to the $ 170 BILLION we bailed them out with , that ’s a drop in the bucket .
True , but that ’s not the point .
It ’s the principle of the thing–people should n’t be paid for screwing up .
If you pay a plumber to unstop your drain , and he fixes it by removing the clogged pipe and letting the water out all over the floor , are you going to pay him ?
Hell , no–he screwed up .
So why then should these dopes be rewarded for crashing our economy ?
And why should it be US that pays them .
The kind of reward these guys really deserve cannot be expressed on a general audience website , but I have it on good authority that Pongo and his gorilla buddies are all hot to give it to them .
WASHINGTON
About 50 years ago , a young Phoenix lawyer broke the code of silence that is still almost universally observed by former law clerks for Supreme Court justices .
The lawyer wanted to sound an alarm .
Most of his fellow clerks , the lawyer said , had been leftists with “ extreme solicitude for the claims of Communists and other criminal defendants ” and “ great sympathy toward any government regulation of business . ”
The Phoenix lawyer was William H. Rehnquist , who had clerked for Justice Robert H. Jackson in 1952 and 1953 and who would go on to serve on the Supreme Court for more than 30 years , including 19 as chief justice .
In his essay , published in U.S. News & World Report in 1957 , he expressed fear that the political views of Supreme Court law clerks were shifting the court to the left .
When his essay provoked an angry response , Mr. Rehnquist retreated , a little .
“ The resolution of these disagreements , ” he wrote in a second U.S. News article , “ must await a thorough , impartial study of the matter . ”
California employers led the nation in mass layoffs in February as the state ’s unemployment rate hit 10.5 % , the highest level since April 1983 , state and federal labor agencies reported Friday .
The reductions cascaded across all areas of the Golden State ’s economy , hitting major corporations that included Circuit City Stores Inc. , Yahoo Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. bank , Ralphs Grocery Co. and the Los Angeles law firm of Latham & Watkins , among others .
Big companies , which must file mandatory government reports every time they lay off at least 50 employees , gave pink slips to 45,557 Californians last month .
Nationally , mass layoff events reached a record high in February , affecting 295,477 jobs in all industries tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

The biggest portion , about a third , were in manufacturing , followed by retail trade and transportation and warehousing .
California ’s losses were far higher than Illinois ’ , with 19,469 jobs lost .
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were third and fourth .
But the mass layoffs were only a modest portion of the damage done to the Golden State ’s economy because the bulk of jobs are at small and medium - size businesses .
In all , California lost 116,000 jobs in February , bringing the 12 - month total to 605,900 .
Advertisement
Layoffs began 18 months ago in residential construction and moved to finance and wholesale and retail trade .
Now , the state numbers show that cutbacks are hitting the once - secure bastions of healthcare , education and government services , sending new waves of unemployed workers to job - hunting centers .
“ The job losses are intensifying and becoming more broad - based , ” said Esmael Adibi , an economist at Chapman University in Orange .
Construction , which continues to weaken , suffered the most in February , shedding 30,900 jobs .
All other industries reported declines , with the exception of information , which includes television and movie production .
“ Even the sectors that were considered recession - proof are losing steam , ” Adibi said .

California ’s jobless rate rose four - tenths of a percentage point in February , from 10.1 % in January .
A year earlier the rate was 6.2 % .
Unemployment in Los Angeles County increased by a slightly larger margin , to 10.9 % in February from a revised 10.4 % in January and 6.1 % a year earlier .
Last month ’s national rate was 8.1 % .
Both federal and California laws require employers to report large layoffs , though details of the mandates differ .
The tempo of layoffs is speeding up , state government officials warn .
Advertisement
“ Since October , we ’ve been getting these increasingly larger losses of jobs , ” said Howard Roth , chief economist for the California Department of Finance .
He noted that February job losses were the heaviest in a single month since at least 1990 .
What ’s more , the pace of disappearing jobs is hitting California disproportionately hard , compared with the other 49 states .
California , which accounts for 11 % of the national workforce , has suffered 18 % of U.S. job losses .
California in recent years has been plagued by average job growth , a reversal from the superheated dot - com boom of the late 1990s , said Stephen Levy , director and senior economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
Levy attributes the state ’s high unemployment rate to a combination of sharp job losses and a workforce that ’s ballooned by 350,000 people .
Advertisement
Growth , he said , “ obviously depends on the success of national policies to boost employment and stabilize the housing and banking sectors . ”
That ’s what California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who met with President Obama on Friday at the White House , is counting on .
“ My administration is working tirelessly with the federal government to pump federal economic stimulus funding into our economy to create jobs as quickly as possible , ” Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
But , he cautioned , “ the road to economic recovery will not be short . ”
The good economic news , meager as it might seem , is the assurance of federal aid from the Obama stimulus package and the Federal Reserve ’s move this week to ease credit , said Sung Won Sohn , an economist and Asian trade expert at Cal State Channel Islands .

“ The federal help will not turn the economy around , ” he said , “ but it will prevent the economy from getting worse . ”

Cameos are often used in movies to add a touch of humor – and as the contributor of this list ( That Guy ) pointed out , listverse is presently lacking a list of the best .
So , here is our first ( and hopefully not last ) list of the best ( and funniest ) cameos in movie history .
If you can think of other great cameos , be sure to tell us in the comments ( include a youtube link if you can ) .
10 Scream 3 Jay and Silent Bob
What really makes this cameo funny is not necessarily the lewd dialogue , it ’s the story behind how the slacker duo got involved in Scream 3 .
They were both given 300 dollars per diem while on set , and a free shirt .
Jason Mewes ( Jay ) was a bit more excited about it than Kevin Smith ( Silent Bob ) , saying : “ We should do this all the time .
We can pop up in every horror movie , and get three hundred bucks a day and a shirt ! ”
Smith told him he could make a lot more money in a starring role , and Mewes respectfully pondered the idea .
9 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Hunter S. Thompson
Dr. Gonzo appears very briefly in Terry Gilliam ’s classic film that is based off Thompson ’s book .
During the flashback / Jefferson Airplane scene .
Depp walks by him and narrates : “ There I was …
Mother of God , there I am .
Holy fuck . ”
Fear and Loathing is known for many great cameos , including Gary Busey , Tobey Maguire , and director Gilliam .
8 Dodgeball Chuck Norris
There is n’t much I can say besides Thank You Chuck Norris .
7 Hot Shots !
Part Deux Martin Sheen
In this war film parody , Martin Sheen steals his son Charlie ’s thunder by interrupting his narration with a little voice - over of his own .
It concludes with one of the funniest lines in spoof history .
6 Grindhouse Nicolas Cage
Nick Cage appears as Fu Manchu in the fake trailer “ Werewolf Women of the S.S. ” directed by Rob Zombie for the movie Grindhouse .
I do n’t think I am alone when I say that the fake trailers were probably the best part of Grindhouse , and include such gems as Machete , Thanksgiving , and Don’t !
Cage ’s cameo is short and sweet , and it gets me every time .
5 Cabin Boy David Letterman
This film is both greatly loved and severely detested .
Those who support it point out its campy qualities , and claim that it ’s so bad it ’s good ( like the Wicker Man remake , right ?
Or does it just suck ? )
Letterman ’s cameo was his first role in a feature film and it is a lot like the rest of the movie , so bad it ’s good .
See for yourself .
4 The Muppet Movie Steve Martin
The Muppet Movie is known for its parade of cameos , but Martin ’s role as the ‘ insolent waiter ’ combines his bizarre sense of humor with the universal appeal of the muppets .
What ensues is a fantastic fusion of dry humor and soaking wet slapstick .
3 Happy Gilmore Bob Barker
The best part about this cameo is how Bob is in great shape .
You really believe that he could kick some ass if taunted .
Apparently Barker accepted the role after learning that he would win the fight .
I ’m sure he felt even more vindication after winning the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight .
The best part of the clip begins around 00:58 .
2 The Princess Bride Billy Crystal and Carol Kane
This cameo is as perfect as the movie itself .
I would n’t say that Crystal and Kane make the movie , but they do serve as the cherry - on - top of a hilarious sundae .
The decrepit yet spry married couple were so funny that Rob Reiner had to leave the set because he was laughing so hard .
1 Extras Every celebrity
Extras , a sitcom created by Ricky Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant , is one of the funniest TV shows of all time .
It was hard to believe that they could live up to the comedic brilliance that was The Office , but they did it with Extras , which aired on HBO .
Every episode has at least one celebrity appearance , all of them playing themselves .
The words that Gervais puts in their mouths are usually so insensitive and vain that it is unfathomable how they all agreed to it .
To name a few : David Bowie , Ian McKellen , Kate Winslet , Ben Stiller , Chris Martin , Daniel Radcliffe , Robert De Niro .
This clip shows David Bowie ’s hilarious cameo .
My personal favorite has to be Ian McKellen explaining his stage play to Gervais .
The timing and delivery is so spot - on it brought me to tears the first time I saw it .
If you have not seen this show please , please , PLEASE try and watch it .
It does not disappoint .

After years of seemingly endless research , scientists have completed a first draft of the Neanderthal genome .
Nature reports that a team of scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Germany has sequenced 60 percent of the genome of a Neanderthal , the closest relative of modern humans .
After analyzing more than a billion fragments of ancient DNA , the researchers constructed the genome mostly with DNA strands from a 38,000 - year - old fossilized leg bone found in a cave in Croatia .
They also used material from older remains , some up to 70,000 years old .
Neanderthals are thought to have been proficient at crafting basic tools and weapons , and died out shortly after Homo sapiens migrated to Europe , but the precise connection between the species has always been unclear .
The Neanderthal genome sequence will clarify the evolutionary relationship between humans and Neanderthals as well as help identify those genetic changes that enabled modern humans to leave Africa and rapidly spread around the world , starting around 100,000 years ago [ PhysOrg ] .
The rough draft of the genome has already turned up some fascinating tidbits , such as the revelation that Neanderthals shared the gene associated with speech and language in modern humans .
Says lead researcher Svante Pääbo :
" There 's no reason to think they [ could n't ] articulate as we do , although there are many more genes related to speech " [ Wired News ] .
Comparing the genomes of Neanderthals and humans should answer some long - debated questions , such as whether Neanderthals and modern humans continued to mate with each other after separating along the path of evolution [ The Guardian ] .
Some anthropologists have suggested that as the two groups of early humans lived close to each other in Europe , they must have interbred ; while others have taken a quite opposite stance , arguing that modern humans probably killed off the Neanderthals .
While researchers are eager to learn more about Neanderthals ' lives and capacities , researchers say the larger goal is reaching a better understanding of how we humans came into our own .
Says Pääbo : " It was always a dream to look at the DNA of our closest evolutionary relatives .
Now that we have the Neanderthal genome , we can look for areas in the human genome where a change seems to have swept rapidly through us since we separated from Neanderthals " [ BBC ] .

It seems Philadelphia 's drug cops have adopted a nasty habit of raiding corner stores accused of selling paraphernalia , then smashing security cameras and just straight - up stealing cash and merchandise .
The accused officers are denying everything , of course , but the Philadelphia Daily News found multiple former informants who acknowledge being paid with cigarettes .
Hmm , I wonder where those came from .
It 's truly remarkable how often the soldiers in the war on drugs can be found committing worse crimes than the people they 're investigating .

In honor of Benjamin Button — which raked in an impressive 13 Oscar nominations — we've decided to pay homage to movies with really impressive makeup effects .
Makeup effects so impressive that , be honest , you did n't realize who the actors were the first time you saw them .
We 'll start you off easy with more recent films and stars that did n't have their entire face emaciated or covered .
On that note - we promise to minimize the number of stars whose faces are completely and unrecognizably changed .
For the film buffs among us , this might not be the most difficult test ; but I assure you , there were some in here that even I had no idea of until just an hour ago .
Kinda cool .
Try to name the Actor and the Film .
If you can name the character as well , we bow to your film knowledge .
Answers after every 5 .
1 . This one should be easy enough .
I mean hell -
for an entire year there was nothing but talk about how
" well " this actress changed her appearance .
2 . Here we have yet another startling change .
Do you remember
which movie this one 's from ?
Okay , and the actress is ?
If you 're finding this too easy , do n't worry it'll start getting
harder real soon .
But first ...
3 . Did you miss this one ?
If you saw the movie this is
from you know just how good this performance was
( in fact , this performance is nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar ) .
4. Anyone ?
This one 's going back a few years , but you should all
at least know the actor .
5 . While not muchmore than a sideshow in a recent buddy - roadtrip - stoner
flick , this actor 's malformed face — warts and all — still
manages to betray a pretty fair amount of the actor 's facial features .
Answers 1 - 5
1. Nicole Kidman as " Virginia Woolf " in The Hours
2. Charlize Theron as " Aileen " in Monster
3. Robert Downey Jr. as " Kirk Lazarus " in Tropic Thunder
4. Jeff Goldblum as " Seth Brundle " in The Fly
5. Christopher Meloni as " Freakshow " in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
Alright , that first batch should have been relatively easy .
I tried to give you 4 snapshots that did n't stray too far from the faces of the original actors while keeping the movie selection newer and on the more famous end .
Now they 'll start to get harder .
Ready ?
6 . A famous actor impersonating another famous
actor known for his numerous roles as a famous Transylvanian .
7 . Do n't feel stupid if you can't get this one , because when
the credits rolled and this actor 's name was revealed I heard
audible gasps from about 20 different people in the theater .
8 . If you can get past this honkin ' shnoz and
unibrow , you might be able to recognize this British actress .
9 . This well - known comedian donned so much makeup
for his role in this beloved cult - classic that most people
do n't recognize him until he speaks .
10 . Now , if you ignore everything about this picture except
for the face , you might be able to figure out who
the actor is .
But even then , it 's pretty well
hidden underneath all the prosthetic skin .
Answers 6-10
6. Martin Landau as " Bela Lugosi " in Ed Wood
7. Tom Cruise as " Len Grossmann " in Tropic Thunder
8. Emma Thompson as " Nanny McPhee " in Nanny McPhee
9. Billy Crystal as " Miracle Max " in Princess Bride
10 . John Leguizamo as " Clown / Violator " in Spawn
I do n't know if you got 10 , or if being a movie buff you just knew ( the actor 's voice is pretty distinctive ) , but coming up are 5 which I 'm not sure many are aware of — but hey , maybe I 'm wrong .
11 . If after watching the first Hellboy you want to say
this is David Hyde Pierce in makeup , that would be
understandable .
But it would also be wrong
( there 's a whole voice - over conflict that occurred ) .
So who is it ?
12 . Am I the only one amazed that despite " losing " half
his face , this actor is still quite recognizable ?
13 .
If you find this one too hard , I 'd recommend concentrating
on the mouth and eyes as they seem to give this actor away
more often than not .
14 .
If you do n't get this one , it 's because there 's so much
about this character that distracts from the actor 's face , and
also because it's another one of those cult classic flicks
you might never have heard of .
15 . I feel somewhat cheap for using this one as the performer
in question did n't actually look like this for the entire film .
In fact ,
the majority of this film was about flaunting their sexuality .
So if you know this one - kudos to you .
11 . Doug Jones as " Abe Sapien " in Hellboy II
12 . Liam Neeson as " Darkman " in Darkman
13 . Willem Dafoe as " Schreck " in Shadow of the Vampire
14 . Tim Curry as " The Lord of Darkness " in Legend
15 . Salma Hayek as " Lola Cirillo " in After the Sunset
These 5 will require at least one of two things : an expansive film knowledge or a really keen eye .
I leave both of those things up to you .
Here we go .
16 .
This actor made ( and eventually ruined ) a name
for himself by starring in multiple films as multiple
characters .
17 .
This actor 's most famous role is one he has also
claimed , in many interviews , to detest for distracting people
from acknowledging the rest of his work
— this film and role among them .
18 . I know , I know .
How are you supposed to recognize
the actor when his face is covered in fur ?
Well , actually ,
if you know the actor you 'll know that by looking at
everything from the eyes down , his face is quite recognizable .
19 .
As a lover of this movie , I was shocked to learn who
this was .
Once you know , you 'll be able to see it
immediately .
But when trying to identify the performer
playing this pirate — goddamn , you 'd never know it watching the movie .
20 .
Here it is , the creme de la creme .
An actor everyone
knows and respects in a role so disfigured you 'd never know it was them .
16 . Eddie Murphy as " Saul " in Coming to America
17 . Alec Guinness as " Fagin " in Oliver Twist
18 . Peter Sellers as " The March Hare " in Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland
19 . Glenn Close as " Gutless " in Hook
20 . Gary Oldman as " Mason Verger " in Hannibal
The federal agencies that are supposed to safeguard the nation ’s food have long resisted calls , including those from us , for merging into a single food authority .
Amid the peanut - product salmonella outbreak , though , it ’s hard to imagine how their objections can stand .
The Food and Drug Administration , in charge of produce and processed foods , had primary responsibility for Peanut Corp. of America , accused of knowingly shipping salmonella - tainted products that ended up in a list of foodstuffs almost too long to comprehend .
But the FDA had contracted out the inspection work to Georgia ’s food - safety agency .
There has been criticism that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moved too slowly in analyzing the problem ; meanwhile , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , which oversees foods sold for school lunches , also was looking into the Georgia plant .
Georgia ’s inspectors failed at their job repeatedly .
That does n’t remotely exonerate the FDA , which learned in April , when Canada returned a shipment of foul goods , that there were signs of filth and disregard for public health .
And the FDA bears responsibility for ensuring that its contractors are doing adequate inspections .
But then , the FDA itself , which oversees 80 % of our food , has n’t done adequate inspections for years .
Farm fields are checked once in a decade .
In addition , each food agency has multiple missions .
The FDA ’s drug - approval job tends to supersede its responsibilities for food .
The USDA , which receives 80 % of the food - safety budget , is supposed to promote the U.S. beef industry while protecting consumers from the worst meat and dairy producers .
Countries that have reformed their food - safety oversight -- Canada and Japan , for instance -- switched to a single agency .
They also gave their food regulators more authority , and technology that allows quick tracking of food from farm to table .
Yet such transformations wo n’t help unless the agency is properly funded and required to perform regular inspections .
The tainted peanut products , which have sickened hundreds and may have caused nine deaths , represent a new level of food outrage , more serious than even the salmonella salsa and downer - cow beef recalls of 2008 .
In this case , the plant ’s management allegedly knew it was shipping food products that could kill , and then lied about it .
The ongoing criminal investigation is an appropriate response ; this should be treated as seriously as a multiple homicide .
What , you might wonder , were these people thinking ?
Possibly that food inspection is so lax , and the responses to mass poisonings so predictable -- official indignation followed by complacency -- that nothing much would be done about it .
Graduates who have lost their jobs in the recession are to be offered personalised support to retrain as science teachers in a drive to improve education in secondary schools , Gordon Brown has announced .
The initiative seeks to encourage people with degrees in science , maths or IT who have recently joined the ranks of the unemployed to consider a new career in teaching .
In a speech at Oxford University today , the prime minister said the move would help achieve the government 's target of ensuring almost all state schools offer physics , chemistry and biology as separate subjects within the next five years .
At present , fewer than a third of state schools offer " triple science " – the option to learn the three major sciences as separate subjects – although progress has been made since 2005 , when only 22 % of schools offered all three .
In the speech , Brown acknowledged that mainstream comprehensive schools have suffered from a lack of specialist science teachers able to take single - subject classes and stretch the brightest pupils .
The drive aims to double the number of children taking three science subjects to 17 % by 2014 , and raise the number of students taking A - level maths from 56,000 to 80,000 over the same period .
Brown used the speech to set out a " national ambition " for Britain to educate " the great scientists of tomorrow " who were " more inspired by those who give to the world than by those who take from it . "
The big question facing the nation today was how to make Britain " the best country in the world in which to be a scientist in the months and years to come " .
He said the answer lay in entrenching investment in science as a " national priority " .
The speech received a broad welcome from scientists , who were encouraged by a vow to ring - fence science funding in order to protect research and development budgets from being raided during the downturn .
The government will be hoping the measures are enough to deter British scientists from leaving for the US , where the Obama administration has embraced science and is about to boost research and development funding with an $ 18bn stimulus package .
" Just maintaining current spending commitments will mean that we are losing ground against countries like the US that are giving science a huge boost within their stimulus packages , " said Nick Dusic , director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering in the UK .
" The government has got the UK back in the race to be a world leader in science , but unless it keeps pace we will lose talent and investment to other countries that are following up fine words with hard cash . "
Beth Taylor at the Institute of Physics said : " We need to be more ambitious in the present climate .
We would love to see the UK emulate Barack Obama 's science plan for the USA .
The US , along with every other G8 country , is going for increased investment in research as a way to address the immediate problems of recession and at the same time create a great basis for new growth when recovery begins .
If the UK does n't join in , there is a real risk that good scientists will start gravitating to the States or elsewhere , and that companies with a strong R&D element will do the same . "
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz , chief executive of the Medical Research Council , said : " UK science is a global success story , punching way above its weight not just in terms of the knowledge it produces , but in economic , health and social benefits .
Investment in science is vital , not only to sustain the country in a downturn , but to provide the footholds for our recovery in the future . "
organic approaches .
The universe got here from the great Bang , which exchange right into a speedy strengthen of area / time .
in case you do no longer understand that , provide up criticizing the assumption until you have some thought what that 's approximately .
Why might a god who 's supposedly the two all - powerful and everywhere would desire to hop in an area deliver to get to earth ?
If each person with continual or terminal ailments have been cured on the comparable time i might have faith that some thing supernatural did it .
If a substantial hand got here out of the sky and stopped a tsunami until now it hit land , i might have faith .
despite the fact that , all you may desire to grant is " See this gorgeous flower ?
is n't that data that my god made it ? "
No , that 's not .

Some 40,000 people in the US state of Utah live in illegal polygamous families in which a man takes more than one wife .
These fundamentalist Mormons have now begun a campaign for a change in the law they regard as discriminatory and unfair .
Humphrey Hawksley met some of the families involved .
" All right everyone , listen up , " shouted Kody Brown , brushing his shoulder - length hair clear of his face .
He put both hands out in front of him , pointing towards 12 children aged between four and 14 gathered around a square table in the middle of a huge kitchen .
Six were on one end .
One all alone in the middle and five with their mother stood at the other end .
" Those belonging to Janelle identify yourselves , " instructed Kody who is 41 .
Six pairs of hands shot up with screams of " wahoo " .
" And the child belonging to Meri , " said Kody .
Thirteen - year - old Mariah raised her hand .
" Now Christine 's kids , " said Kody .
A show of five pairs of hands with a loud " wahoo " from everyone including Christine herself , one of Kody Brown 's three wives .
The other two were out at work .
' Love them all '
After the introductions , the kitchen returned to a kind of controlled mayhem .
The boys played a board game .
Three teenage girls chatted at the kitchen counter .
The very young scampered around .
Kody Brown 's daughter Mariah is the same age as one of her half - sisters Mariah got her guitar and her half - sister Madison , who at 13 was the same age , played a song on the piano .
" So do you consider all of them to be your children ? " I asked Christine .
" Well my children are my children , " she answered .
" But , yeah , I love them all to bits and this is all my family .
It 's awesome . "
Kody and Christine Brown live in a polygamous relationship .
The house is divided into three adjoining apartments for each of the mothers and their children and as for where Kody lives .
" Well , " as Christine put it , " he 's everywhere . "
Suprising message I had met the Browns a few hours earlier at the Utah State Legislature where they had joined a campaign to legalise polygamy .
Under US law it is a felony , and technically the adults could be jailed and the children taken into care .
But there are simply too many .
Up to 40,000 people in Utah live in polygamous families and it is a way of life that they insist is based on religious belief .
The campaign is called Principle Voices and one of the organisers was Anne Wilde , now a widow after a 33 - year marriage .
In her basement she keeps religious books that she used to publish with her husband .

" This was our best selling one , " she said , pulling out a slim paperback called Jesus was Married .
" This is Martha and Mary , " explained Anne pointing to a picture at the front .
" And then , of course , there was Mary Magdelene .
You see , Jesus said follow me .
He did n't say follow me in all things except marriage . "
I had met
Anne the evening before her big campaigning day and she was worried as to how many would turn up for fear of being identified for future prosecution .
But she need not have worried .
Walking across the snow in brilliant sunshine , dozens and dozens of people living in polygamous families arrived at the legislative building .
Nestled in a snow - capped valley , Salt Lake City is the historic capital of the Mormon church .
But in 1890 , the mainstream church outlawed polygamy .
Those piling into a conference room to hear from the state 's politicians were from a breakaway group that had refused to opt for monogamy .
" I see myself as a free man in a free society , " said one father , who came with his two daughters , both aged 12 .
On the podium was Republican politician Ric Cantrel who had a surprising message for people seen to be openly breaking the law .
" Your patriotism is unquestionable , " he said , " and your faith inspiring .
" You have no hesitation to put God 's law above the law of the state with a propensity toward civil disobedience and I find that very American . "
Death threats Afterwards , Kody Brown and Anne Wilde mingled with Mr Cantrel and with Mark Shurtleff , Utah 's larger - than - life attorney general , his suit jacket bulging because of the sidearm he carried after getting death threats from a much more extreme group of polygamists .
" I 'm not being soft on them , " he said .
" But I do n't have the resources to throw them all in jail .
I hope they now work through the process of changing the law if they disagree with it . "
Kody Brown 's family are close - knit and his wives support each other
It became clear that Utah 's polygamous communities would be safe from the police as long as they stuck to other laws and , for example , did not indulge in child marriages or paedophilia .
But something was gnawing at me .
Given that sexual infidelity so often leads to bitterness , even violence , how did the wives cope with that natural emotion of human jealousy ?
" My relationship with my husband is only going to be great if his relationship with his other wives is great , " said Christine .
And what about the widowed Anne Wilde ?
" I had such a wonderful man as a husband , " she said .
" I was so privileged .
He was such a blessing that I was willing to share him with other good women . "

Rebecca Jeshke from the Electronic Frontier Foundation sez , " Most Americans know very little about how the law protects them from searches , seizures , and surveillance .
EFF launched Surveillance Self - Defense today — a practical , online how - to guide for protecting your private data against government spying .
The guide includes tips on assessing the security risks to your personal computer files and communications , strategies for interacting with law enforcement , and articles on specific defensive technologies such as encryption that can help protect the privacy of your data . "
Surveillance Self - Defense ( SSD ) exists to answer two main questions :
What can the government legally do to spy on your computer data and communications ?
And what can you legally do to protect yourself against such spying ?
After an introductory discussion of how you should think about making security decisions – it's all about risk management – we 'll be answering those two questions for three types of data :
First , we 're going to talk about the threat to the data stored on your computer posed by searches and seizures by law enforcement , as well as subpoenas demanding your records .
Second , we 're going to talk about the threat to your data on the wire – that is , your data as it's being transmitted – posed by wiretapping and other real - time surveillance of your telephone and Internet communications by law enforcement .
Third , we 're going to describe the information about you that is stored by third parties like your phone company and your Internet service provider , and how law enforcement officials can get it .
In each of these three sections , we 're going to give you practical advice about how to protect your private data against law enforcement agents .

Most Persuasive , Scary Examples of Negative Advertising .
Just 36 when he became president in 2004 , Mr. Saakashvili set out to become a historic figure : a model he has often cited is David the Builder , a 12th - century king who drove the Turks out of Georgia and is worshiped as a saint .
Mr. Saakashvili won his first election with 97 percent of the vote and , buoyed by passion and adrenaline , pressed to amend Georgia ’s Constitution , granting himself extraordinary power .
His advocates say this was the only way to wrench a corrupt post - Soviet state into the modern age ; critics say he created an autocracy , surrounding himself with a clique of loyalists .
Either way , no comparable figure has yet emerged from Georgia ’s fractured opposition .
Mr. Saakashvili called this “ very sad . ”
“ If I had been in the opposition , I would have destroyed this government in three months , ” especially given the economic crisis , he said .
Asked how , his answer was almost teasing : “ I know how to do it , ” he said , “ but I do n’t want to teach them how to do it . ”
Mr. Saakashvili thinks , talks and moves at a high rate of speed .
When he decides that an event has ended , his aides often break into a full run , lest they be stranded , panting , in his wake .
His appetite is legend : on a 45 - minute flight , he ordered three cups of tea , a glass of wine and a cognac , and gave a flight attendant a genial hard time for not stocking up on cheese .
He is easily bored .
For reading material on the same flight , he had a glossy magazine , a biography of Marshal Henri Philippe Pétain , the disgraced French general ; architectural plans for a cargo airport that he had sketched himself when 20 submissions fell short ( “ I hate to confess it , ” he said ) ; and a Georgian newspaper , which he glanced through and put aside .
“ Every Georgian newspaper hates me ; what ’s the difference ? ” he said .
“ If you can find me one that likes me , I ’ll read it all the time . ”
From the beginning , Mr. Saakashvili ’s presidency has been marked by audacious gestures .
Months after his swearing - in , he dismissed all 13,000 of Georgia ’s GAI  the Soviet - era traffic police notorious for low - level corruption  replacing them with 1,600 officers modeled on American state troopers .
He also promised to reclaim South Ossetia and Abkhazia , stoking Georgian nationalism and inflaming tensions with Moscow .
" Hello Americans ! " Paul Harvey ... Good Night !
Paul Harvey , the last of the great national radio commentators and the archetype for today 's news pundits , died Saturday at 90 .
Here 's my profile of Harvey from a few years back ....
( And here 's some sound of Harvey from The Post 's Post Mortem blog ... )
Paul Harvey sits directly across the broadcast desk from me as he prepares for his big , 15 - minute midday newscast .
Even seated , he is erect , almost military in his bearing .
He has spread his script before him , each page of yellow copy paper containing a single story , a few lines typed in the early light of a day that begins at 3:30 a.m. in the cream - carpeted offices of ``Paul Harvey News " here on Paul Harvey Drive in the heart of Chicago .
In the spare , black - and - white studio , the man with the million dollar voice , a true Voice of America , wears a starched white shirt and tie under a royal blue lab coat emblazoned with the ABC logo .
We chat amiably as the engineer in the control room issues the 10 - second warning .
Harvey and I continue talking .
I hold back so as not to disturb his countdown .
But he appears to pay the clock no mind , chatting on , stopping only about one - and - a - half ticks before the second hand sweeps past the 12 .
A brief silence .
Then a suddenly booming voice nearly rocks me out of my chair : ``HELLO AMERICANS !
THIS IS PAUL HARVEY !
SSTTAANNDD BYYY FOR NEEEEEWS !!!! "
I very nearly stand to cheer .
Dismissed decades ago as a clichéd relic of Richard Nixon 's Silent Majority , derided by the media elite as a flag - waving , red - bashing dispensary of easy bromides and patriotic pap , ``Paul Harvey News & Comment " remains by leaps and bounds the most popular program on American radio , a daily presence in people 's lives , a reminder in these multi-culti times of a society that used to think of itself as one .
Five of the 10 biggest radio audiences each week gather to hear Paul Harvey , whose newscasts air mornings and middays in addition to his recitations of `` The Rest of the Story , " those dramatic , if formulaic , historical vignettes in which that failed painter turns out to be ... Adolf Hitler , or that 13 - year - old boy who got a cash gift from Franklin Roosevelt grows up to be ... Fidel Castro .
Sixteen stories above a rundown section of Michigan Avenue , on a block of shuttered storefronts and homeless men buffeted by winds off the lake , Harvey , now 80 , hones his homilies and sifts the wires and newspapers for the arch , the outrageous and the heartwarming , items he will deliver in his staccato , telegraphic style to more than 1,300 radio stations from rural backwaters to the largest cities .
``Paul Harvey is the Energizer Bunny of this business , " says John Butler , operations manager of WMAL , the Washington , D.C. , station that sandwiches Harvey 's noontime report between the reigning queen and king of talk radio , Laura Schlessinger and Rush Limbaugh .
`` There is not a program director in this country who would n't kiss you for having Paul Harvey in your lineup .
Like Limbaugh , he has an explosive quality on the radio that just does not exist on television . "
Harvey 's career and influence span the history of radio :
He is the last of the wartime generation of radio commentators , a handful of men who wielded the kind of influence that Walter Cronkite would hold over the first TV generation .
But Harvey is also a bridge to the new era of radio talkers , people such as Limbaugh , Don Imus , Howard Stern and countless imitators who have stretched the concept of radio commentary from minutes to hours , but remained true to Harvey 's basic formula of personalizing the news , turning the events of the day into a longform diary of American life .
The Paul Harvey that sticks in the American mind is the rigid figure of the '60s , the man who defended middle America against the fraying morality of hippies , intellectuals and the Eastern Establishment .
Harvey 's offices are a shrine to his fame , his Goldwater conservatism and his 1960s role as defender of the flag and stalwart against the counterculture .
There 's a framed tribute from Bil Keane , who draws the ``Family Circus " comic panel :
In this cartoon , the dad closes a book after reading to his kids , and the caption reads , ``and they lived happily ever after .
And now you know ... the REST of the story . "
Harvey has risen above basic announcing and mere punditry by treating the news as both entertainment and parable .
Descended from five generations of Reformed Church ministers , Harvey wonders if he perhaps inherited ``an overdose of righteousness . "
The pulpit ``is a responsibility infinitely higher than any I aspire to , " he says .
But his church heritage has had a strong impact on Harvey 's journalism : ``I can't separate goodness and badness from any day 's news and make sense of it . "
``Paul Harvey is such a case unto himself -- somebody who tells stories under the guise of giving the news , " says fellow radio storyteller Garrison Keillor , of public radio's ` `A Prairie Home Companion . "
`` He is a man after my own heart .
I could n't agree less with his politics , but he really keeps going , completely undiminished .
He has a sense of whimsy and of oddity , but his storytelling pretty much does serve his philosophy .
It edges close to propaganda . "
To be sure , Harvey stays loyal to his Midwestern ideals and conservative politics .
`` Our major media , being home - based on Manhattan Island , inevitably distort American reality , " he says in his large office overlooking the Tribune Tower and the Chicago River .
` `I can stand on Times Square and know this is not America . "
And Harvey still sees the culture being sucked down , ripped from its good heartland roots .
`` We 're not yet spewing vomit in our news , but other TV programs that now dominate the networks are a disservice to Loxahatchee , Kokomo , Kalamazoo and Sioux City .
They inevitably corrupt .
I do n't know of anything that 's had a more deleterious effect on our society than the excesses of television -- mud , blood and chicanery . "
All is not lost , however .
Harvey keeps waiting for the ``stomach - turning point , " the moment when people will demand a halt to the dumbing down , the greed , the cynicism .
For now , the offices of ``Paul Harvey News " remain an island in a shifting culture .
From the Gothic lettering announcing the proprietor 's name on the entrance wall to the correct staff of older women whom Harvey still addresses as ``Mrs. , " there is a courtly manner to this newsroom perhaps unmatched anywhere else in the industry .
Paul Harvey 's America is on the run , cornered in a few country clubs and golf communities , chased onto virtual reservations by the forces of coarseness , informality , suburban anonymity and ethnic heterogeneity .
Harvey himself -- now slightly stooped and down to a horseshoe of hair but still lean of build and muscular of voice -- is a wealthy man who has palled around with the chief executives of his only - in - America success story sponsors -- Wal - Mart , Amway , ADM .
But Harvey 's message resonates at far more humble levels , among the police officers he regularly lavishes with praise and trust , among the veterans he remembers when most of the nation forgets , and among the Scouts , Legionnaires , Ladies '
Auxiliaries , gun clubs and history buffs who feel themselves resolutely ignored by a pop culture that insists on edge , cool and novelty .
Like Keillor 's ` `A Prairie Home Companion , " the rise of the mega- churches , the resurgence of the phonics movement and nostalgia for the Reagan administration , the continued popularity of ``Paul Harvey News " reflects an American craving for belonging , an insistent desire for community in a nation that has grown , like its new media darling , the Internet , scattered and rootless .
Like Billy Graham and Muhammad Ali , Harvey is one of the last universals in a mass culture that , but for the occasional Hollywood blockbuster , has frayed into a thousand and one strands .
When Harvey turns off the microphone , an era of media simplicity will have come to an end .
A few years back , Harvey dropped his daily TV commentary , and earlier this year he quit his thrice - weekly newspaper column .
` `I did n't have anything to say , " he readily concedes .
`` We 're between wars , between crises .
It was 600 words , three times a week .
I feel like I 'm out of jail now . "
But Harvey has no plans to quit radio , his first love .
``I have never seen anything ever on television that matches the pictures painted on the mirror of my mind by a really good wordsmith , " he says .
No lewd Lewinsky lines will be heard on Harvey 's newscast , no leering over the latest sex story to snare saturation coverage on sensation - seeking cable news channels .
` `I have never pretended to objectivity .
I have a strong point of view , and I share it with my listeners .
I have no illusions of changing the world , but to the extent I can , I 'd like to shelter your and my little corner of it . "

`` Mae - mi - ma - ma - mu , mae - mi - ma - ma - mu , teetleee , teetleee , too . "
From his voice warm - ups to his patented summons to listeners coast to coast -- `` Stand by for news ! " -- Harvey is a throwback to the newsreel announcers , a reliquary of a time when the American language was far more colorful , richer in both formal expression and slang .
Harvey is perhaps the only great broadcaster as well known for his silence as for what he says .
He uses daringly long pauses -- he says they developed as ``a lazy broadcaster 's way of waiting for the second hand to reach the top of the clock " -- to turn even pedestrian prose into a sometimes urgent , sometimes lyrical form of word jazz .
``I 've always felt the pregnant pause is more useful for emphasis than shouting , but it can't be done deliberately .
It has to just happen . "
Spiced in with the pauses , quirky news items and telling anecdotes , Harvey types into his scripts -- he still bangs out every word on an IBM Selectric rather than the ``confuser " that sits idle in his office -- classic stock phrases , radio headlines that at once alert and charm : ``Stateside Politics !
Sportlight on Louisville !
Today 's Golden Rose ...
Agronomics ! Shop Talk ! "
Foreign stories get an aural dateline : ``Manila , Philippines ! "
Harvey is credited with inventing words such as ``guesstimate , " ``trendency " and ``snoopervision . "
`` It 's sad , but radio has homogenized the country in our pronunciation of words , " Harvey says .
``People from Memphis , for example , used to taste our language with such succulence , oh my ! "
With Charles Kuralt gone , only CBS Radio's Charles Osgood , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann and some of Dan Rather 's curious Texas formulations enrich broadcast news English with anything beyond standard phrasing .
If Harvey sounds as if he is selling the news , that 's no accident .
News never comes first on a Harvey broadcast ; the sponsor does .
His sales spots -- delivered live , often almost entirely ad - libbed - - have a personal , honest feel about them , a freshness that stands in stark contrast to the cynicism and irony that Madison Avenue specializes in these days .
`` If the father in your family owns a truck , " Harvey tells his audience , ``have I got a Father 's Day gift for you .
Get him a load handler .
A LLooaad - HANDLER .
I know it ; I 've done it . "
Even off the air , Harvey sells .
He has removed his ABC work coat and donned a burgundy sport jacket with a pink pocket square .
No one else is in the room , we 're chatting before lunch , and I ask about his sales philosophy .
No microphone is hot , but he launches into a hard sell nonetheless :
``I have never been able to sell with anything other than left - brain logic .
Some of these television commercials now are so cute , you have no idea when they 're over what they 're trying to sell .
But I have to believe in , I have to use , I have to be enthusiastic about anything I sell .
I found a bread now that I hope will sponsor ` Paul Harvey News . '
God , it 's good ; everybody should try this bread .
It 's a multi-nut , nutritious bread .
Just look on the label " -- he rises , steps to his desk and fishes around for a label he 's brought from home -- ``and there 's everything you could possibly want in a slice of bread , or anything you 'd want in a breakfast .
Some people go out for breakfast and just order toast and coffee , but that 's all right , if your bread is this Brownberry Nut Bread .
Good grrrracious , two slices of that and your coffee , and it's as good as a bowl of oatmeal . "
The baker of this particular bread has no financial relationship with Harvey whatsoever .
No matter .
Harvey is , for all his political passion and newsman 's energy , a natural pitchman , a combination that was as common in his day as it is anomalous now .
``Some of the best news some days is in the body of a commercial , " Harvey says .
`` There really is a battery that will outlast your car .
There really is a preventative for osteoporosis .
There really is a way to fill your home with symphonic sound from a gadget the size of a bread box . "
Harvey is a believer in great products , great ideas , great men .
He has surrounded himself over the years with iconoclasts and individualists such as financier Warren Buffett , retailing revolutionary Sam Walton , Billy Graham and even Ronald Reagan -- a decision Harvey readily admits was a violation of a career - long refusal to socialize with political figures .
``I always felt that a newsman should keep a little airspace between himself and the newsmakers , " he says .
`` It 's hard enough to be objective about people from a distance .
It 's utterly impossible if you call that person by his first name .
But I was so appreciative of Ronald Reagan that I abandoned that reservation for the duration of his administrations .
Our home in Phoenix is just across the golf course from where he and Nancy used to stay with her parents , where he would walk over to the Little Shop , the drug store counter at the Biltmore , and just be one of us .
I never felt I had to be objective with Reagan .
That great grin just said , ` Everything 's OK , do n't worry . '
``I mentioned that to our current president , and he tried to get that grin , but every time he uses it , some media person erases it . "

PAGE THREE !
Heroes have always won top billing on ``Paul Harvey News , " especially heroes in uniform .
Ever since 1946 , when Harvey hosted ``Jobs for GI Joe , " a phone - in employment service program on CBS Radio in Chicago , soldiers , firefighters and police officers have showered Harvey with awards and plaques as he has showcased their accomplishments .
To his critics , Harvey 's knee - jerk support of men in uniform is of a piece with his rejection of the forces of modernity - - a simplistic , boosterish approach that hearkens back to the era of American Babbitry , a Calvin Coolidge view of the world from the top down .
And Harvey would n't find much to disagree with in that analysis -- older , simpler times were just better , he says .
But there 's more to his politics than mere hero worship .
And as he ages , his views have evolved and the country has moved to the right , leaving Paul Harvey - - once the definition of arch - conservative -- smack in the middle of the road .
Cops can still do little wrong in Harvey 's mind .
That 's in good part a legacy of the tragedy that struck 3 - year - old Paul Aurandt ( Harvey was his middle name until he moved to Chicago ) .
His father was a police officer in Tulsa when he and the chief of police were hijacked and Harvey 's father was killed by assailants who were never caught .
``I 've never known a policeman who was paid enough money for what we expect them to do , " Harvey says now .
But if his benign view of law enforcement is unblemished by time , Harvey 's politics have softened considerably .
In the '50s , he was an unapologetic McCarthyist until be broke with the Wisconsin senator over his hysteria .
In the ' 60s , he proudly called himself a ``native - born American " who ``never left my country .
It left me . "
In 1968 , he came in a close second to Gen. Curtis LeMay in the race to be George Wallace 's running mate on a third - party presidential ticket .
Hardcore Harvey railed against homosexuality , left - wing radicals and black militants .
( When a civil rights activist accused police of trying to ``get the Black Panthers , " Harvey responded , ` `I should hope so ! " )
But in 1970 , he began his broadcast one day with ``Mr.
President , I love you ... but you 're wrong , " a harsh attack on Richard Nixon 's war policies that triggered an avalanche of more than 24,000 letters and cries of outrage from veterans who considered Harvey a traitor to the cause .
Some said Harvey 's about - face was cynical , a personal decision driven by his wife 's opposition to the war .
Over the years , Harvey would prove there was more to his evolution than family concerns .
He became an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights , and he criticized the Christian right for seeking to impose its views on others .
`` Things get less black and white as we mature , " he says now .
``I believe that men and women of honor seeking ultimate truth inevitably gravitate toward middle ground .
I believe there is less left - right polarization now than at any time in our history . "
Harvey still believes the United States has devolved since the 1960s , that education has diminished , along with morality and community .
But he says he has grown ``less dogmatic . "
He considers Bill Clinton ``like a repentant drunk .
They 're the nicest guys in the world when they 're trying to make up for their excesses . "
But Harvey also thinks the president is a smart , assiduous fellow who has done an excellent job -- a conclusion he likely would not have permitted himself to make about a Democrat earlier in his life .
That said , Harvey remains true to the notion that the business of America is business .
He laments the loss of the Mom and Pop pharmacy to a chain drug store in his suburb of River Forest , but says , ``Some truths are inexorable .
Big fish eat little fish . "
Harvey 's wife Angel - - a sight to behold in a canary suit with matching shoes and her blond hair teased into a sweeping bowl -- is producer of the radio show and business manager of the couple 's various projects .
Over a lunch of calves ' liver ( `` How would you like it done ? " the waiter asks .
Harvey : `` Do it .
Done . " ) and Senegalese soup with mango chutney , the Harveys debate America 's progress .
`` Do n't you think you 'd like to go back to Smalltown USA with the little family - owned shops ? "
Angel asks .
``I 'm glad we still enjoy it on reruns , " Harvey quips .

PAGE FOUR !
After their ritual lunch at the Tavern Club , atop the building from which he broadcasts , the Harveys return to the office , check in with their assistant and summon their chauffeur .
``Come on , little one , " Paul Harvey says to his wife , and they step out into the sunshine .
They 'll be home by 2 .
Harvey plans a round of golf .
Later on they 'll watch some TV before turning in around nightfall .
At 3 a.m. , the alarm will sound , and the newsman will begin work on another edition of ``Paul Harvey News & Comment . "
If all goes well , Harvey says , newspaper editors across the belly of the nation will have called in or faxed ``the kind of Main Street USA stories that Paul Harvey likes to use . "
Harvey will fire up his Selectric , scan the wires and pick out just the right item for his trademark closer .
The rest is in the delivery .
``For what it 's worth , Mark Hatterer of York , Pennsylvania , gave mouth - to - mouth resuscitation to a dog .
I said , Mr. Hatterer gave mouth - to- mouth resuscitation ....
To a dog , after the dog had nearly drowned ... in a septic tank .
The dog was drowning in a septic tank when Mr. Hatterer rescued it .
After a veterinary doctor pronounced the Scottish terrier out of danger , Mr. Hatterer said , ` You know ... I , I hope I do n't ever have to do that again .'...

Drinking Games
Have fun with The Webtender 's collection of drinking games , but be extremely careful if you play any these games , especially the ones with high buzz factors .
The collection was created as an aid to responsible adults who know their limits ( and not to cross them ) when it comes to drinking , and not to promote this kind of drinking behavior .
You should of course be of legal drinking age if you want to play these games with beer or drinks , but anyone can play these games with non-alcoholic beverages as well .
For more fun , visit the Web Site Index and go to one of the sites listed there .
You should also take a look at ' The Complete Book of Beer Drinking Games ' .
Gin and its Lowlands cousin Genever ( Jenever in Belgium ) are white spirits that are flavored with juniper berries and so - called botanicals ( a varied assortment of herbs and spices ) .
The spirit base of Gin is primarily grain ( usually wheat or rye ) , which results in a light - bodied spirit .
Genever is made primarily from " malt wine " ( a mixture of malted barley , wheat , corn , and rye ) , which produces a fuller - bodied spirit similar to raw malt whisky .
A small number of genevers in Holland and Belgium are distilled directly from fermented juniper berries , producing a particularly intensely flavored spirit .
The chief flavoring agent in both Gin and Genever is the highly aromatic blue - green berry of the juniper , a low - slung evergreen bush ( genus Juniperus ) that is commercially grown in northern Italy , Croatia , the United States and Canada .
Additional botanicals can include anise , angelica root , cinnamon , orange peel , coriander , and cassia bark .
All Gin and Genever makers have their own secret combination of botanicals , the number of which can range from as few as four to as many as 15 .
Distillation of Gin
Most Gin is initially distilled in efficient column stills .
The resulting spirit is high - proof , light - bodied , and clean with a minimal amount of congeners ( flavor compounds ) and flavoring agents .
Genever is distilled in less - efficient pot stills , which results in a lower - proof , more flavorful spirit .
Low - quality " compound " gins are made by simply mixing the base spirit with juniper and botanical extracts .
Mass - market gins are produced by soaking juniper berries and botanicals in the base spirit and then redistilling the mixture .
Top -quality gins and genevers are flavored in a unique manner .
After one or more distillations the base spirit is redistilled one last time .
During this final distillation the alcohol vapor wafts through a chamber in which the dried juniper berries and botanicals are suspended .
The vapor gently extracts aromatic and flavoring oils and compounds from the berries and spices as it travels through the chamber on its way to the condenser .
The resulting flavored spirit has a noticeable degree of complexity .
Classifications of Gin
London Dry Gin is the dominant English style of Gin .
As a style it lends itself particularly well to mixing .
London Dry Gin is the dominant Gin style in the United Kingdom , former British colonies , the United States , and Spain .
Plymouth Gin is relatively full - bodied ( when compared to London Dry Gin ) .
It is clear , slightly fruity , and very aromatic .
Originally the local Gin style of the English Channel port of Plymouth , modern Plymouth Gin is nowadays made only by one distillery in Plymouth , Coates & Co. , which also controls the right to the term Plymouth Gin .
Old Tom Gin is the last remaining example of the original lightly sweetened gins that were so popular in 18th - century England .
The name comes from what may be the first example of a beverage vending machine .
In the 1700s some pubs in England would have a wooden plaque shaped like a black cat ( an " Old Tom " ) mounted on the outside wall .
Thirsty passersby would deposit a penny in the cat ’s mouth and place their lips around a small tube between the cat ’s paws .
The bartender inside would then pour a shot of Gin through the tube and into the customer ’s waiting mouth .
Until fairly recently limited quantities of Old Tom - style Gin were still being made by a few British distillers , but they were , at best , curiosity items .
Genever or Hollands is the Dutch style of Gin. Genever is distilled from a malted grain mash similar to that used for whisky .
Oude ( " old " )
Genever is the original style .
It is straw - hued , relatively sweet and aromatic .
Jonge ( " young " )
Genever has a drier palate and lighter body .
Some genevers are aged for one to three years in oak casks .
Genevers tend to be lower proof than English gins ( 72 - 80 proof or 36 - 40 % ABV is typical ) .
They are usually served straight up and chilled .
The classic accompaniment to a shot of Genever is a dried green herring .
Genever is traditionally sold in a cylindrical stoneware crock .
Genever - style gins are produced in Holland , Belgium , and Germany .
Gin Regions
The United Kingdom produces mostly dry Gin , primarily from column stills .
British gins tend to be high proof ( 90° or 45 % ABV ) and citrus - accented from the use of dried lemon and Seville orange peels in the mix of botanicals .
British gins are usually combined into mixed drinks .
Holland and Belgium produce Genever , mostly from pot stills .
Genevers are distilled at lower proof levels than English gins and are generally fuller in body .
Many of these gins are aged for one to three years in oak casks .
Some Genever producers now market fruit - flavored genevers , the best known being black currant .
Dutch and Belgian genevers are usually chilled and served neat .
Germany produces a Genever - style Gin called Dornkaat in the North Sea coast region of Frisia .
This spirit is lighter in body and more delicate in flavor than both Dutch Genever and English dry Gin. German Gin is usually served straight up and cold .
Spain produces a substantial amount of Gin , all of it in the London Dry style from column stills .
Most of it is sold for mixing with cola .
The United States is the world ’s largest Gin market .
London Dry Gin accounts for the bulk of domestic Gin production , with most of it being produced in column stills .
American
Dry gins ( often termed " soft " gins ) tend to be lower proof ( 80° or 40 % ABV ) and less flavorful than their English counterparts ( " hard " gins ) .
This rule applies even to brands such as Gordon ’s and Gilbey ’s , which originated in England .
America ’s best - selling Gin , Seagram ’s Extra Dry , is a rare cask - aged Dry Gin .
Three months of aging in charred oak barrels gives the Gin a pale straw color and a smooth palate .
The Martini and the Meaning of LifeThe best known of hundreds of Gin-based mixed drinks is the Gin and white vermouth combination called the Martini .
As is usually the case with most popular mixed drinks , the origins of the martini are disputed .
One school of thought holds that it evolved from the late - 19th - century Martinez cocktail , a rather cloying mixture of Old Tom - style Gin and sweet vermouth .
A dissenting sect holds that it was created in the bar of the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in the early 20th century .
The ratio of Gin to vermouth started out at about 2 to 1 , and it has been getting drier ever since .
The great British statesman Winston Churchill , who devoted a great deal of thought and time to drinking , was of the opinion that passing the cork from the vermouth bottle over the glass of Gin was sufficient .
The martini has frequently served as a metaphor for some of the great social and political issues of our times .
President Jimmy Carter denounced the " three martini lunch " in a thinly - veiled attempt at class warfare during his election campaign .
He was not reelected .
Gin - Origins and HistoryGin is a juniper berry - flavored grain spirit .
The word is an English shortening of Genever , the Dutch word for juniper .
The origins of Gin are rather murky .
In the late 1580s a juniper - flavored spirit of some sort was found in Holland by British troops who were fighting against the Spanish in the Dutch War of Independence .
They gratefully drank it to give them what they soon came to call " Dutch courage " in battle .
The Dutch themselves were encouraged by their government to favor such grain spirits over imported wine and brandy by lack of excise taxes on such local drinks .
A clearer beginning was a few decades later in the 1600s when a Dr. Franciscus de la Boë in the university town of Leiden created a juniper and spice - flavored medicinal spirit that he promoted as a diuretic .
Genever soon found favor across the English Channel ; first as a medicine ( Samuel Pepys wrote in 1660 of curing a case of " colic " with a dose of " strong water made with juniper " ) and then as a beverage .
When the Dutch Protestant William of Orange and his English wife Mary became co-rulers of England after the " Glorious Revolution " drove James II from the throne , he moved to discourage the importation of brandy from the Catholic wine - making countries by setting high tariffs .
As a replacement he promoted the production of grain spirits ( " corn brandy " as it was known at the time ) by abolishing taxes and licensing fees for the manufacture of such local products as Gin .
History has shown that prohibition never works , but unfettered production of alcohol has its problems too .
By the 1720s it was estimated that a quarter of the households in London were used for the production or sale of Gin .
Mass drunkenness became a serious problem .
The cartoonist Hogarth ’s famous depiction of such behavior in " Gin Lane " shows a sign above a Gin shop that states , " Drunk for a penny / Dead drunk for twopence / Clean straw for Nothing . "
Panicky attempts by the government to prohibit Gin production , such as the Gin Act of 1736 , resulted in massive illicit distilling and the cynical marketing of " medicinal " spirits with such fanciful names as Cuckold ’s Comfort and My Lady ’s Eye Water .
A combination of reimposed government controls , the growth of high - quality commercial Gin distillers , the increasing popularity of imported rum , and a general feeling of public exhaustion gradually brought this mass hysteria under control , although the problems caused by the combination of cheap Gin and extreme poverty extended well into the 19th century .
Fagin ’s irritable comment to a child in the film Oliver — " Shut up and drink your Gin ! " — had a basis in historical fact .
Starting in the 18th century the British Empire began its worldwide growth ; and wherever the Union Jack went , English - style gins followed .
In British North American colonies such celebrated Americans as Paul Revere and George Washington were notably fond of Gin , and the Quakers were well - known for their habit of drinking Gin toddies after funerals .
The arrival of the Victorian era in England in the mid-19th century ushered in a low - key rehabilitation of Gin ’s reputation .
The harsh , sweetened " Old Tom " styles of Gin of the early 1700s slowly gave way to a new cleaner style called Dry Gin .
This style of Gin became identified with the city of London to the extent that the term " London Dry " Gin became a generic term for the style , regardless of where it was actually produced .
Genteel middle - class ladies sipped their sloe Gin ( Gin flavored with sloe berries ) while consulting Mrs. Beeton ’s Book of Household Management ( a wildly popular Victorian cross between the Joy of Cooking and Martha Stewart lifestyle books ) for Gin-based mixed drink recipes .
The British military , particularly the officer corps , became a hotbed of Gin consumption .
Hundreds of Gin-based mixed drinks were invented and the mastery of their making was considered part of a young officer ’s training .
The best known of these cocktails , the Gin and Tonic , was created as a way for Englishmen in tropical colonies to take their daily dose of quinine , a very bitter medicine used to ward off malaria .
Modern tonic water still contains quinine , though as a flavoring rather than a medicine .
In Holland the production of Genever was quickly integrated into the vast Dutch trading system .
The port of Rotterdam became the center of Genever distilling , as distilleries opened there to take advantage of the abundance of needed spices that were arriving from the Dutch colonies in the East Indies ( present - day Indonesia ) .
Many of today ’s leading Dutch Genever distillers can trace their origins back to the 16th and 17th centuries .
Examples include such firms as Bols ( founded 1575 ) and de Kuyper ( 1695 ) .
Belgium developed its own juniper - flavored spirit , called Jenever ( with a " j " ) , in a manner similar to that in Holland ( which controlled Belgium for a time in the early 19th century ) .
The two German invasions of Belgium in World Wars I and II had a particularly hard effect on Jenever producers , as the occupying Germans stripped the distilleries of their copper stills and piping for use in the production of shell casings .
The remaining handful of present - day Belgian Jenever distillers produce Jenever primarily for the local domestic market .
Gin may have originated in Holland and developed into its most popular style in England , but its most enthusiastic modern - day consumers are to be found in Spain , which has the highest per capita consumption in the world .
Production of London Dry-style Gin began in the 1930s , but serious consumption did not begin until the mix of Gin and Cola became inexplicably popular in the 1960s .
Gin production in the United States dates back to colonial times , but the great boost to Gin production was the advent of National Prohibition in 1920 .
Moonshining quickly moved in to fill the gap left by the shutdown of commercial distilleries , but the furtive nature of illicit distilling worked against the production of the then - dominant whiskies , all of which required some aging in oak casks .
Bootleggers were not in a position to store and age illegal whisky , and the caramel - colored , prune - juice - dosed grain alcohol substitutes were generally considered to be vile .
Gin , on the other hand , did not require any aging , and was relatively easy to make by mixing raw alcohol with juniper berry extract and other flavorings and spices in a large container such as a bathtub ( thus the origin of the term " Bathtub Gin " ) .
These gins were generally of poor quality and taste , a fact that gave rise to the popularity of cocktails in which the mixers served to disguise the taste of the base Gin.
Repeal of Prohibition at the end of 1933 ended the production of bootleg Gin , but Gin remained a part of the American beverage scene .
It was the dominant white spirit in the United States until the rise of Vodka in the 1960s .
It still remains popular , helped along recently by the revived popularity of the Martini .

The ICRC says it is increasingly concerned over the plight of civilians The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) has warned of an impending humanitarian catastrophe in north - eastern Sri Lanka .
Up to 150,000 people may be trapped in the area by fighting between government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels .
The ICRC has reiterated calls for a mass evacuation of civilians and for far more aid to be allowed in .
The ICRC's Jacques de Maio said the situation was one of the worst disasters he had experienced .
Desperate scenes
Mr de Maio , head of operations for South Asia , said it would be possible " quite easily to avoid all of the unnecessary suffering and death which is taking place right now , and to allow for an immediate and massive evacuation " .
See map of the region
He said it should also be possible to allow " significant and meaningful humanitarian assistance " into the war - affected areas .
Some aid has arrived in recent weeks , but the government has allowed in far less than is needed , the ICRC says .
Troops are pushing the Tigers into a shrinking territory Government estimates put the number of civilians caught up in the fighting at about half the level calculated by the ICRC , but the truth is that nobody really knows .
Aid workers have spoken of desperate scenes where there has been contact with those civilians .
Thousands of people have run from the jungle towards the coast , where there is no clean water or shelter .
In one place , the ICRC has succeeded in landing a boat to take off the wounded .
About 2,000 people have been taken off this beach , but many more have been left behind .
Mr de Maio described the complex moral choices being made by those deciding who should be saved .
" When we reach the beach with the ferry there are exchanges of fire , there are thousands of people on this beach , they are stranded on basically sand and salty water , " he said .
" When we evacuate them , our people have to select the ones eligible ... meaning we have to exclude many others .
And this is very difficult to handle for people on the ground . "
Tamil
Tiger rebels have been unwilling to let the civilian population leave because they fear that would leave the government with the opportunity to level the area with more ferocity .
The ICRC has been lobbying European governments to exert pressure to improve the humanitarian situation , as the long and bloody struggle for Sri Lanka moves into a decisive phase .

BROWNSVILLE , Texas , March 17 ( UPI ) --
Authorities say a Fort Worth , Texas , man was charged after customs officials allegedly found his Mexican wife hiding in a speaker box in their car 's back seat .
Customs officers " routinely find narcotics hidden in a vehicle but in this case , it was the driver 's wife , " Michael Freeman , a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection , said to the San Antonio Express - News .

Christopher Sean Protho , 36 , was charged with alien smuggling after his arrest Sunday at the Brownsville and Matamoros International Bridge , the Express - News reported Tuesday .
Protho's wife , 33 , from Matamoros , did n't have immigration papers to enter the United States and is in federal custody pending deportation proceedings , Freeman told the newspaper .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A special court ruled Thursday that evidence presented in three cases by parents of children with autism did not prove a link between autism and certain early childhood vaccines .
A special court denied Mike and Theresa Cedillo 's claim that vaccines caused autism in their daughter , Michelle .
The ruling came from a panel of " special masters " who began hearing three test cases in 2007 involving children with autism -- a disorder that their parents contend was triggered by the vaccine against measles , mumps and rubella combined with vaccines containing thimerosal , a preservative containing mercury .
Three families -- the Cedillos , the Hazelhursts and the Snyders -- sought compensation from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , but the panel ruled that they had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that the childhood vaccines caused autism in their children .
" I feel deep sympathy and admiration for the Cedillo family , " Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. wrote in his ruling in the case involving 14 - year - old Michelle Cedillo , who cannot speak , wears a diaper and requires round - the - clock monitoring in case she has a seizure .
" And I have no doubt that the families of countless other autistic children , families that cope every day with the tremendous challenges of caring for autistic children , are similarly deserving of sympathy and admiration .
However , I must decide this case not on sentiment , but by analyzing the evidence , " Hastings wrote .
" In this case the evidence advanced by the petitioners has fallen far short of demonstrating such a link . "
Dr. Gupta :
A look at the life of Michelle Cedillo »
In a statement shortly after the release of the decisions , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it continues to support research " to better understand the cause of autistic disorders and develop more effective methods of treatment . "
However , " the medical and scientific communities ... have found no association between vaccines and autism . "
" Hopefully , the determination by the Special Masters will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism , " the statement said .
Since 2001 , thousands of parents of autistic children have filed petitions seeking compensation from the VICP at HHS .

By mid-2008 , more than 5,300 cases had been filed in the program -- and 5,000 of those were still awaiting adjudication , according to the agency .
Watch Dr. Gupta discuss how court reached its decision »
A litigation steering committee is representing thousands of families that fall into three categories : those that claim that the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine can combine with thimerosal - containing vaccines to cause autism ; those who claim thimerosal - containing vaccines alone can cause autism ; and those who claim that MMR vaccines , without any link to thimerosal , can cause autism .
Prior to the release of Thursday 's rulings , an attorney for the families , Thomas Powers , said the expected rulings would affect only the families that fall under the first category .
CNN 's Miriam Falco contributed to this report .
All About Autism • Vaccines
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.NBRKb.N sits on $ 25.54 billion ( 17.8 billion pounds ) of cash , said worried investors are making a costly mistake by buying up U.S. Treasuries that yield almost nothing .
In his widely read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders , the man many consider the world ’s most revered investor said investors are engulfed by a “ paralyzing fear ” stemming from the credit crisis and falling housing and stock prices .
Treasury prices have benefited as investors flocked to the perceived safety of the “ triple - A ” rated debt .
But Buffett said that with the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury Department going “ all in ” to jump - start an economy shrinking at the fastest pace since 1982 , “ once- unthinkable dosages ” of stimulus will likely spur an “ onslaught ” of inflation , an enemy of fixed - income investors .
“ The investment world has gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it , ” Buffett wrote .
“ Cash is earning close to nothing and will surely find its purchasing power eroded over time . ”
“ When the financial history of this decade is written , it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s , ” he went on .
“ But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost equally extraordinary . ”
DISMAY OVER MORTGAGE PRACTICES
Investors ’ flight to quality followed years of excessive borrowing , especially in housing , and Buffett used his letter to make plain his dismay with a variety of mortgage lenders .
He said many ignored Lending 101 by not checking customers ’ ability to pay off home loans , or foisting “ teaser ” rates that reset to higher unaffordable levels .
In contrast , Buffett said , Berkshire ’s manufactured housing unit Clayton Homes had a 3.6 percent foreclosure rate at year end on loans it made , up from 2.9 percent in 2006 , though more than one in three borrowers had “ subprime ” credit scores .
The unit was profitable in 2008 , earning $ 206 million before taxes , though earnings fell 61 percent , Berkshire said .
“ The present housing debacle should teach home buyers , lenders , brokers and government some simple lessons that will ensure stability , ” Buffett wrote .
“ Home purchases should involve an honest - to - God down payment of at least 10 percent and monthly payments that can be comfortably handled by the borrower ’s income .
That income should be carefully verified . ”
INVESTMENT YAWNS
Omaha , Nebraska - based Berkshire reduced its cash stake from $ 44.33 billion a year earlier largely by investing in preferred , convertible and fixed - income securities yielding 10 percent or more , and issued by familiar companies including General Electric Co GE.N and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N .
Still , Buffett has said he would be comfortable taking Berkshire ’s cash stake down to $ 10 billion .
“ It is curious how dismissive he is about cash , and yet Berkshire has a large cash position , ” said Bill Bergman , a senior equity analyst at Morningstar Inc .
“ The Berkshire enterprise is attractive in part because of the large cash positions .
So maybe Buffett ’s prescriptions for the rest of us do n’t apply as generally to Berkshire . ”
Indeed , Buffett said that to fund new investments , he sold parts of some equity holdings he wanted to keep -- among them , oil company ConocoPhillips COP.N , drug company Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co PG.N .
Buffett said he “ will not trade even a night ’s sleep for the chance of extra profits , ” and wanted Berkshire to have more than ample cash .
He also cautioned Treasury investors not to feel “ smug ” when they see commentators endorsing their investments .
“ Beware the investment activity that produces applause , ” Buffett wrote , “ the great moves are usually greeted by yawns . ”
MAHARAJGANJ , India ( Reuters ) -
To earn a living , Kiran dresses up in women ’s clothes , dances at wedding parties in the Indian countryside and tries not to struggle when he is raped at knifepoint by drunken male wedding guests .
The pay , he says , is pretty good .
He is one of thousands of launda dancers working the wedding scene in the villages of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh states , leading the groom ’s raucous marching - band procession to the bride ’s house .
They put up with routine violence because , they say , it is the only way they are free to live as “ kothis ” , a South Asian term for effeminate and transsexual gay men .
Most dancers soon get used to being bitten , burnt with cigarettes and cut with knives and broken bottles .
In one common “ party trick ” , a wedding guest will hide a razor blade in his fingers and then bloodily caress the dancer ’s cheek .
And while most laundas make extra money selling sex , too often they end up brutalized .
Most know of dancers who were shot dead or strangled for resisting sex with gangs of men from the wedding in nearby buildings or fields .
“ They like to have sex with pain .
They like to give us pain .
They take pleasure in this violence , ” said 20 - year - old Kiran , who declined to give his full name , as he plucked stubble from his cheeks with tweezers , readying for work .
Bappa , an older launda , said one of his worst days at work was when a drunk man took a knife in a boast of virility and slit Bappa ’s anus open wide before raping him .
But another launda , Bobby said their current neighborhood -- Uttar Pradesh ’s Maharajganj district -- was relatively safe , and argued the freedom granted by the job outweighed the violence .
“ All our desires are filled , ” he said , dressed in a canary - yellow salwar kameez over a padded bra , his long hair dyed auburn .
“ Most importantly , our desire to live like women , to cook for our boyfriends , to adorn ourselves , have our own households . ”
After Bobby went to shampoo his hair under the handpump outside , Kiran made the point more bluntly .
“ I have come here for two specific reasons , ” he said , grinning .
“ One : to dress up as a woman and live like them .
Two : sex , sex , and sex . ”
RAPED FROM CHILDHOOD
For poor , lower - caste families wanting a grand wedding for their children , boys in drag were once a cheap substitute for dancing girls .
Laundas have since become a regional tradition .
After the marriage ceremony they dance through the night , often until dawn .
A relatively honest bandmaster typically pays a dancer 3,000 to 6,000 rupees ( $ 75 to $ 150 ) a month , a little above the average income in India .
Like most laundas dancing in the countryside , Bappa is from the metropolis of Kolkata .
His career path was typical .
From a young age he did n’t fit in with other boys , and bullies forced him out of school .
They liked cricket .
He preferred pictures of cricket players and dolls .
Laughing , he mimes how he would drape his head with a towel to pretend he had long hair .
When he was eight years old , his 25 - year - old neighbor walked into his house , stripped him as he squirmed , and raped him .
It was the first of many such attacks by the neighbor who later got him into brothel work , where he learnt about launda dancers .
He figured it was the best chance for an outcast to make a living .
When at home in Kolkata , his family silently tolerates him so long as he wears men ’s clothing , skips the makeup and keeps out of their way .
He hides his women ’s gear with a vegetable seller at the nearby train station , where he gets changed in the ladies toilet .
His parents are still trying to find him a bride .
“ We once dreamt of having a respectable job , ” said Kiran , “ We wanted to become doctors , craftsmen or company executives .
We dreamt of getting married , having kids of our own , going to the beach for holidays .
But not anymore . ”
SHUNNED
Few people care about launda dancers .
Charities and government projects tend to focus on girls and young women , mostly because they are trafficked and abused in far greater numbers , but also because they are seen as defenseless .
Even the men the laundas call their boyfriends -- mostly married men perceived to be heterosexual -- tend to shun them during daylight hours .
Added to that is the threat of disease .
India has the world ’s largest HIV caseload with an estimated 5.7 million sufferers and the dancers are a high - risk group .
Bobby has a photo album featuring pictures of two launda friends who died from AIDS .
Kolkata - based People Like
Us is one of the few organizations working with laundas to provide better healthcare and reduce the threat of violence .
But it says funding is hard to come by , partly because the line between victim and exploiter can quickly blur .
As they get older , laundas often bring younger kothis into the business .
To some people , this is nothing less than pimping .
But the laundas argue only they can teach these outcast teenagers how to survive a lifetime of abuse as transsexuals living in India .
Europe is having a problem right now .
In truth , it is many problems more than a single problem .
Countries in the former Soviet bloc are in a deep downturn which has been significantly worsened by turmoil in currency markets .
Western European banks are hemorrhaging losses – some will probably be nationalized .
Spain , the U.K. and Ireland have all seen massive property bubbles implode .
Greece , Ireland , Spain , Portugal and Italy have all seen credit warnings and downgrades .
And Ukraine , Hungary and Latvia are but three nations that have been forced into the arms of the International Monetary Fund for a bailout .
Clearly , the credit crisis has moved to Europe in a massive way .
In my view , this was always inevitable given the available evidence after the panic in September .
I have written a number of posts on this very issue :
Anyone who tells you this crisis came out of the blue is lying or ignorant .
Yet , policy makers have largely had their heads buried in the sand .
The Germans , in particular , took a very hard line .
But , now that the German economy is in tatters , they have come ’round .
The question is : will the crisis in Europe lead to a catastrophic outcome ?
My answer is no , despite the challenges .
The Swiss
I will explain why I see a deep downturn but no catastrophic outcome using the case of Switzerland as an example .
Just two days ago , I profiled a somewhat sensationalistic analysis of the situation in Switzerland from the Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger .
This post received a lot of traffic because it highlighted the severity of the problems besetting Europe if the Swiss were being considered a potential Iceland .
Once upon a time , Switzerland , as banking mecca and the fifth wealthiest country in the world ( one notch behind Iceland ) , was considered the paragon of stability and prudence .
The Swiss franc was backed by gold and had importance far beyond the Swiss economy ’s size .
Switzerland is home to some of the world ’s largest companies in a wide range of industries from pharmaceuticals to banking to consumer products .
But , during the great moderation , the Swiss lost their way .
The Swiss National Bank lowered interest rates to extremely low — dare I say it , Japanese — levels .
The SNB starting selling their gold at depressed prices .
And Swiss banks , known the world over for safety , secrecy and security , started to muscle their way into the globalized financial arena of investment banking and trading .
The result has been a dangerous increase in Swiss franc credit abroad and a similarly dangerous increase in the balance sheets and leverage of the two remaining large Swiss banks , Credit Suisse and UBS .
This presents a problem in a world of deleveraging and asset deflation because the Swiss are a small nation of 7 million without the protection of the European Union or the Euro to fall back on .
This makes them vulnerable .
Hence the doomsday pronouncement from Artur Schmidt about Swiss bankruptcy .
I do not believe the Swiss will go bankrupt simply because they are too wealthy , too interconnected and too important to fail .
No one wants a run on the franc .
No one want a collapse of Swiss banks .
As a result , policy makers will address the Swiss problem and work out a solution .
Nevertheless , the lack of specifics in the previous paragraph should give one great pause .
I am merely making a reasonable conjecture .
I am not saying that the problems with writedowns , bad loans , and deleveraging are going to go away .
They may , in fact , become much greater because of Switzerland ’s interconnectedness with the rest of Europe .
Which brings us back to the broader question of Europe ’s many problems .
I would break the Europe down into four distinct spheres :
The Eurozone , the non-Eurozone West ( like the UK , Sweden and Denmark ) , the EU East ( like Poland , Hungary and Latvia ) and the non-EU East ( like Ukraine and Croatia ) .
The problems and potential outcomes in each of these regions is different .
The crux of the matter is the Impossible Trinity of a fixed exchange rate , independent monetary policy and free movement of capital .
You can have two , but you cannot have all three .
Paul Krugman says it best in an article from 1999 :
The point is that you ca n’t have it all : A country must pick two out of three .
It can fix its exchange rate without emasculating its central bank , but only by maintaining controls on capital flows ( like China today ) ; it can leave capital movement free but retain monetary autonomy , but only by letting the exchange rate fluctuate ( like Britain–or Canada ) ; or it can choose to leave capital free and stabilize the currency , but only by abandoning any ability to adjust interest rates to fight inflation or recession ( like Argentina today , or for that matter most of Europe ) .
The Eurozone
The Eurozone members have decided to forgo independent monetary policies .
Individual member nations have free capital movement and a fixed exchange rate but zero control over monetary policy .
That rests with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in Frankfurt .
The problems mount in recession .
Some members are getting devastated .
Spain , for instance , is in depression already with unemployment at 14 % .
Ireland ’s national budget is imploding with estimates for deficit reaching 10 - 12 % of GDP .
If you are Spain or Greece , you would like to print money– a lot of it .
But that ’s not happening in the Eurozone yet .
The result is a potential national bankruptcy for the likes of Ireland , one reason their credit rating is suffering .
Will Ireland go bankrupt ?
Perhaps .
It is unclear how willing other Eurozone members would be to support the country were it to run into that kind of difficulty .
The Germans are furious for having abandoned the Deutsche Mark for the Euro , which they see as a ‘ weak ’ currency .
Bailing out a Eurozone member would come with many strings attached .
Then , there is the case of Austria .
They too are in the Eurozone .
They have a weak banking system because of excessive lending to Eastern Europe — reaching a full 85 % of Austrian GDP .
( Whether the Austrians were mentally re-creating their lost Empire , stripped after World War I , is a case for the Austrian psychologist Freud ) .
If the Eastern Europeans run into problems , Austrian banks will fail en masse , requiring help from other Eurozone members ( read France and Germany ) .
EU East
This brings us to EU East .
And by that I mean members of the European Union nations east of the Eurozone , which stops at Germany , Austria and Italy ( Slovakia is also a Eurozone member as of Jan. 1st ) .
Countries in this region have seen fantastic growth rates over the past decade , but , also a huge increase in debt , asset prices , and current account deficits .
All of this points to excess .
The problem , of course , is the Impossible Trinity .
These countries want stable exchange rates , monetary policy control and free movement of capital .
But , with the excesses already highlighted , the first to go in this trio was always going to be the exchange rate .
Now , EU East loaded up to the nines with debt in Swiss francs , Euros and U.S. Dollars .
Companies , Individuals , even hospitals have huge foreign currency debt exposure ( see my post " Reverse carry trade borrowing is deadly " from October ) .
A reader from Poland said it well :
Situation in Poland : 2008.07 – 1CHF = 2.0PLN – you can go to ANY bank and take a loan for 120 % value of you new flat / apartment .
i live in Warsaw , lot of my friends took that loan .
unemployment rate – 10 % but in Warsaw was close to 0 % especially if you have a master degree and skills to work in office such as advertising agency or as financial advisor or similar type of job .
Now – you cannot take a loan or rent a money from bank .
one square meter is down close to 25 % from 2008.07 .
franc is up – 1CHF = 3.3PLN within my friends unemployment rate is close to 20 % .
banks are full of CHF loans , even if you sell the apartment you have close to half of the money you borrowed .
did i mentioned that the loans we ’ve given in rates even for 50 years ?
Events in Poland are mirrored throughout the region .
Obviously , if Austria , Ireland and Switzerland are having problems , you can imagine it is much worse in Poland , Latvia and Hungary .
Hungary and Latvia have already asked for and received IMF assistance .
I expect we will see a similar turn in Poland , Estonia and elsewhere .
Moreover , these nations are part of the European Union .
The possibility still exists that they could receive increased transfer payments in order to mitigate the worst of things .
However , the Germans would be even less willing here , I suspect — not to mention countries like Britain and Sweden , which have their own worries .
Non-EU East
Then there are those countries east of the Eurozone that do not have a rich uncle .
We are talking about places like Serbia , Croatia , and Ukraine .
Ukraine looks to be imploding .
Other countries will surely see a severe contraction in GDP .
The Impossible Trinity asserts itself here again as it did for the EU East .
The biggest difference for these countries is they are outside the European Union .
This means countries like Ukraine will go bankrupt , no ifs ands or buts .
What this means for stability in the region is unclear given the strategic importance of Ukraine as an energy transit route .
If Ukraine implodes , knock - on effects for the likes of Belarus will be severe .
Russia is a whole different ball of wax that I am not considering .
But , again , for much of non-EU East , the problem is foreign currency loans .
Floaters
And that brings us full circle back to Switzerland .
The Swiss are not a member of the Eurozone .
They are not even a member of the EU .
Like Norway ( and Iceland , for that matter ) , the Swiss are on their own .
This has benefits .
The Impossible Trinity is a non-sequitur .
One can print money and devalue at the heart ’s content .
The Brits have shown us the power of devaluing a currency from 2.11 per U.S. Dollar to 1.43 per U.S. Dollar .
Surely , the Swiss can do the same .
In fact , in the case of the Swiss , devaluation would mean that their debtors will be able to repay their loans more easily .
I fully expect the Swiss National Bank understands this and is prepared to crank up the presses if they have not begun to do so already .
However , in the end , printing money is not much of a solution to what ails Europe .
Banks are undercapitalized and some countries are overly indebted .
This speaks to bankruptcy for individuals , companies , banks , and , yes , nations .
My advice on remedies is fourfold :
Consolidate the financial services sector through merger , bankruptcy and nationalization Recapitalize banks full - stop .
Whether this is done with public or private monies is secondary Increase intra-EU transfer payments .
The European Union and the Eurozone are supposed to be analogous to the United States .
Call it the United States of Europe , if you will .
But , this analogy is false because Europe is much more heterogeneous than the United States .
There is an insufficient movement of private capital and people as an automatic stabilizer .
Translation : European people and money stay put , American money and people do not .
In recession , you want movement because it evens out the rough spots .
In the absence of movement in the private sector , the public sector will have to step in .
Capital controls .
The whole European mess is a result of an asset and credit bubble that failed to understand the importance of incompatibilities between stable exchange rates , free capital movement and independent monetary policy .
If you eliminate free capital movement , as Willem Buiter suggests , Europe would stand a chance of weathering the storm .
None of my ‘ remedies ’ is pain - free and there is considerable ideological resistance to the last remedy of capital controls .
But , Europe is in a bit of a pickle .
If politicians do not take on this challenge with both hands , much worse is to be expected .

In the decade since the Human Rights
Act secured parliamentary approval it has won few friends in the media .
Tarnished by Michael Howard as a " charter for chancers " , the act has been the subject of countless newspaper stories in which the guilty are treated well at the expense of the innocent .
Tales abound about the rights of rapists , paedophiles , asylum seekers and hate preachers , while the day - to - day work of the act in securing decent treatment for old people , the young , the infirm , the mentally ill and other law - abiding citizens is ignored .
This constant drip - feed of negative coverage , even when shown to be false or based on a misunderstanding of the law , has led even the government to consider the future of the Human Rights Act , with the publication yesterday of a green paper on rights and responsibilities that may lead ultimately to the act 's replacement by a new bill of rights .
Why does the Human Rights
Act get such a bad press ?
Is this negative coverage motivated by political , ideological or commercial considerations ?
In last night 's English PEN debate at Kings Place , I asked Bob Satchwell , executive director of the Society of Editors , Alan Rusbridger , editor of the Guardian , Sir Christopher Meyer , chair of the Press Complaints Commission and Anthony Lester QC – Lord Lester of Herne Hill – the act 's architect , " Why do the media hate the Human Rights Act ? "
For Lester , the answer is simple : the media did not get the act they wanted , and they 've rebelled against it ever since .
When the Human Rights
Act was going through parliament , the media lobbied hard for total immunity .
Instead , they got Section 12 , which simply reminds the courts of the importance of freedom of expression and asks judges to pay attention to the press Code of Practice ( the so - called " voluntary code " ) when balancing free speech against privacy claims .
Lester blames this in part for the media 's hostility to the act more generally , while acknowledging that the act's European provenance has always raised the public 's hackles .
" All of this was seen as a top - down liberal conspiracy by people like me , " he said .
Lester went on to say that the Human Rights
Act does now need to be replaced with a central document that the British public can believe in , though he was unimpressed by the government 's first moves in this direction in yesterday 's green paper .
In the view of Christopher Meyer , Section 12 gave judges the impression that they should be interpreting the voluntary code themselves , thereby usurping the role of the Press Complaints Commission and compromising the very nature of self - regulation .
Meyer called for the amendment of Section 12 to reflect the PCC 's own " jurisprudence " in this area , so that the press could be free to set its own balance .
Otherwise , he argued , the judiciary takes on the role of regulator and the crucial independence of the press is lost .
He cited the case of Max Moseley as an example of the judiciary making inroads in this respect .
Rusbridger challenged Meyer to say how the PCC would have adjudicated differently , had Moseley chosen to bring his case to them rather than going to court .
Meyer would not be drawn on this .
Lester also reminded him of the need for the PCC to be tough on press abuses if its regulatory role was to be credible .
Satchwell compared Britain's tight restrictions on free speech unfavourably with the more liberal American regime under the First Amendment .
He suggested that the role of the press was to " comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable " and that any negative coverage of the act was simply motivated by public concern and examples of misuse that brought the act into disrepute .
Rusbridger agreed that free speech was threatened in the UK , but suggested that many journalists were simply resistant to all oversight .
Noting that the judges who came in for so much abuse from newspaper editors were " just doing their job " , he also stated that the Human Rights
Act had not been helpful enough to the press , failing to resolve issues around civil libel law , which continued to impose a chill on critical reporting .
He cited an instance of prior restraint , in which the Guardian had been prevented from posting , or even signposting , documents relating to financial structures at Barclays .
He agreed that there was a need for a new bill of rights , nominating Lester to draft it immediately .
When I put the Moseley case to an audience vote , not a single hand went up in support of the News of the World , and the audience was unanimous that there was no public interest defence for the invasion of Moseley 's privacy .
As one audience member commented , it 's no surprise that there 's no support for the press when they run stories like this .
Press freedom is absolutely essential to democracy .
State control – whether through parliament , the executive , or the courts – subjects the press to oversight that can hamper freedom of expression more generally .
At English PEN we see this , in those many states that still use laws of sedition or criminal libel to silence critical reporting of government .
However , free media clearly need to be responsible media if they are to command the public trust that is also necessary in an engaged democracy .
And this means effective self - regulation – something that last night 's audience clearly believed to be missing from the current framework .
Unable to win , ex-GOP senator calls for election results to be ' set aside ' John Byrne
Published : Tuesday March 3 , 2009

If at first you do n't succeed , change the rules .
That 's the approach of would - be incumbent Minnesota Republican senator Norm Coleman , who has now called for recent Senate election results to be " set aside . "
Coleman has been deadlocked in a recount with Democratic challenger and comedian Al Franken , who until recently was the host of a nationally syndicated talk show .
Franken and Coleman 's lawyers have repeatedly tangled over how the recount should be held and which votes should be counted .
Increasingly byzantine , even veteran political observers have given up trying to follow the case .
Many believe Franken will eventually prevail .
Apparently frustrated that his election has not been won in court , Coleman lawyer Jim Langdon wrote a three - judge panel overseeing the case that the situation was simply so dire that the election results should be forgotten .
" Some courts have held that when the number of illegal votes exceeds the margin between the candidates -- and it cannot be determined for which candidate those illegal votes were cast -- the most appropriate remedy is to set aside the election , " Langdon wrote , according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
Coleman has faced relentless attacks from liberal bloggers .
They have n't , however , had to try hard to find instances undermining the former St. Paul mayor 's case .
" On Day 1 of the Coleman / Franken U.S. Senate election contest in Minnesota , the Coleman team was busted doctoring evidence , " voting rights blogger Brad Friedman wrote Friday .
Friedman has also tracked what he calls myriad " flip - flops " relating to Coleman 's positions on which votes to count .
Also on Friday , TPM's Eric Kleefeld wrote that " all hell broke loose " in a Minnesota courtroom last week after new revelations surfaced that a witness had been kept from the court .
" Al Franken 's lawyers [ caught ]
Team Coleman in the act of yet more concealing of evidence --- and they 've now made a motion to totally strike the Coleman camp 's claims about double - counting of ballots , which the Coleman camp has hoped to use to subtract over 100 votes from Franken 's lead , " Kleefeld wrote .
On Monday , in a boost for Coleman , Minnesota 's elections director conceded that there were flaws in the voter registration system that could " exclude otherwise qualified people from voting . "
But Franken 's lawyers aim to show that the system works -- and that his slight recount lead of 225 votes means he should be named the victor .
Franken lawyer Marc Elias said the team will begin a case today that will include evidence " about the good job that the state of Minnesota did ... that the hardworking auditors and election night officials did .
How the system worked , by and large . "
The trial is now in its sixth week .
Franken 's lawyers expect the presentation of their case will take another three .

About Charlie
Charlie is a wild - born coyote who was unexpectedly delivered to my doorstep in April 2007 after both his parents were shot for killing sheep .
Whatever reservations I had about raising a wild animal simply did n’t matter – could n’t matter – when I realized his survival , at least in the short term , depended on me .
Charlie rides in my truck , walks on a leash , and adores the cats and his hound - dog sister .
Though we ’ve been together for ten years , I do n’t call him my pet .
He ’s more like my co-pilot .
I do n’t wish to own him , just to live together in harmony .
And that we do .

About Me
I live in a tiny town in Wyoming , where it ’s a sixty mile trip to the nearest grocery store and not uncommon to swing by the post office or bar on horseback .
In 2005 , I had plans to move from San Francisco back to New York City – plans that shifted radically when I rode through Wyoming and fell in love with this place .
I went on to New York , but a month later turned around , returned to Wyoming , and moved to the area where I had only spent one day .
The Daily Coyote , my memoir about my first year with Charlie , was published by Simon & Schuster in 2008 .

Early this week , Stephen Colbert urged viewers of “ The Colbert Report ” to purchase his Christmas CD on iTunes so that he could overtake and humble the ever arrogant Kanye West .
At the time , Kanye West ’s album was the top selling album on iTunes while Colbert ’s lagged behind at # 15 .
Colbert told viewers that they should purchase his CD at 5 P.M on Wednesday as part of “ Operation Humble Kanye ” .
So did it work ?
Well , it ’s been 24 hours since the ‘ operation ’ , and the answer is ‘ yes and no ’ .
Colbert did n’t hit the top spot on iTunes , but he did overtake Kanye .
As of early Thursday morning , Colbert ’s album climbed 12 spots to # 3 while Kanye ’s latest release dropped 3 spots down to # 4 .
On Tuesday afternoon , one day before D - day , Kanye responded via Twitter saying , “ who the fuck is Stephen Colbert ? ”
Well , Kanye , he ’s the dude with a CHRISTMAS album who just overtook you on iTunes .
I wonder if we can expect a “ what the fuck is EdibleApple ? ” twit from Kanye sometime in the near future !
Check out the original clip from The Colbert Report below :
VANCOUVER , B.C. —
The federal government has declared war on drug - dealing gangsters but the foot soldiers who prosecute that war predict the fight will bog down in the legal trenches .
Crown attorneys say new mandatory minimum prison sentences for a range of drug and firearms crimes will lead to an inevitable increase in trials as the accused lose any incentive to plead guilty .
That will clog already overburdened courts and put added strain on prosecutors , especially at the federal level where the Justice Department ’s Public Prosecutions Service has trouble recruiting and retaining lawyers .
B.C. Attorney General Wally Oppal , whose government has led the push for Ottawa to get tough , readily agrees .
“ They ’re absolutely right , ” says the outspoken former prosecutor , defence lawyer and judge .
“ There will be more trials because there ’ll be less incentive for defence counsel to plead guilty if there ’s a mandatory minimum sentence .
They will feel with some justification there ’s no percentage in pleading guilty . ”
The Conservative government has jumped on the recent gang shootings in Metro Vancouver to build political support for its crackdown .
Opposition parties have agreed not to delay changes to drug laws that add mandatory minimum sentences for gang - related dealing , selling near schools or operating large marijuana grow - operations .
It ’s also amending the Criminal Code to make gang - related killings first - degree murder automatically and impose four - year minimum terms for drive - by shootings .
While they declined to comment on the strategy ’s deterrent value , spokesmen for federal , B.C. and Ontario Crown prosecutors agree it adds up to more trials , slower courts and more work for them .
They say 70 to 90 per cent of criminal cases are resolved with guilty pleas before they go to trial , diversion to another process or charges being withdrawn .
Plea negotiations are the oil that keep the justice system working , Crowns say .
“ The system relies on that , ” says Steve Fudge , a Victoria prosecutor and president of the B.C. Crown Counsel Association .
“ If we are n’t taking three - quarters or four - fifths of the cases out of the system by way of a negotiated resolution , we would quickly choke up the courts with trials . ”
Mandatory minimums leave less room for a negotiated resolution , he says .
“ There ’s nothing that I can offer as a prosecutor where there ’s a mandatory minimum to induce an accused person to forego their right to a trial , ” says Fudge .
It ’s even more complicated when the Crown must prove an underlying gang connection to trigger the mandatory minimum on , for example , a shooting .
“ Often that evidence is hard to come by for a variety of reasons , ” says Fudge , most often because witnesses who can testify to the gang link are unwilling or afraid to come forward .
All of which increases stress on the prosecutor , who routinely need two days of preparation time for every day in court , he says .
Fudge ’s counterpart in Ontario echoes the concern .
“ Anything that forces people to take a hard stand inevitably drives people into trials , ” says Tom Hewitt , head of the Ontario Crown Attorneys Association .
“ In Ontario , we are already resource - challenged . ”
The problem is more acute at the federal level , where a widening salary gap with their provincial counterparts in larger provinces is causing a steady drain of lawyers .
The disparity ranges from $ 15,000 - $ 20,000 in British Columbia to a $ 72,000 difference for senior Crowns in Ontario , says Montreal prosecutor Patrick Jette , president of the 2,500 - member Association of Judicial Counsel , which includes 500 Crowns at the Public Prosecution Service of Canada .
The association is in binding arbitration for its first contact but Jette says that wo n’t include significant pay raises , which are restricted under a legislated salary cap .
Federal prosecutors handle drug crimes so they ’ll bear the brunt of cases the new drug - dealing measures trigger .
Jette , a drug prosecutor , says he expects the number of trials to rise dramatically as suspects facing a mandatory minimum or stiffer maximum sentences decide they have nothing to lose .
“ Why would they plead guilty and get the same sentence ? ” Jette wonders .
The prosecution service is already short - staffed , says Jette , adding that 23 prosecutors and other Justice Department lawyers have quit in Toronto alone in the last 18 months .
“ We ’re losing senior lawyers so the job gets done by junior lawyers who are overworked and overloaded , ” he says .
Prosecution service spokesman Dan Brien says it ’s aware of the problem and has made recruitment and retention “ a corporate priority . ”
“ From our annual report to our acting director Brian Saunders , no one ’s made a secret that that has been a difficulty , ” he says .
Brien notes the government last year allocated an additional $ 8.6 million to bolster its tough - on - crime policies that will result in hiring 44 new staff , including 31 prosecutors .
Oppal promises the B.C. government will also find the resources necessary to back its anti-gang offensive , despite recent budget cuts proposed for his ministry .
“ I think the prosecutors should rest assured that we ’ll provide the bodies in there to prosecute the cases , ” he says .
Cases would also speed up if Ottawa legislates more streamlined rules covering Crown disclosure obligations to the defence , and if judges were a little aggressive in moving trials along , says Oppal .
“ I think that judges need to take better control of their courtrooms , ” he says .
“ I ’m not blaming the judges when I say that but I think the most important person in a courtroom when it comes to expediting trials is a judge . ”
– Article from The Canadian Press on March 7 , 2009 .
A.I.G. is , of course , back in the news -- and how !
Not that it was ever too far off the radar screen .
Having received yet one more massive infusion of federal tax dollars , as everyone from here to hell now knows , the insurance giant handed out yet another round of lucrative bonuses .
Over the last year , company management has doled out about $ 1 billion in such payments , roughly half to employees in the financial products subsidiary that concocted the type of high - risk , highly - leveraged deals in derivatives which helped send the company , and Wall Street , and most of the rest of us into steep decline last year .
Bonuses went to 418 employees , 73 " retention bonuses " of $ 1 million or more each to members of that subsidiary ( including 11 who have left the firm ) to help " unravel " the deals they created .
How 's that for an A.I.G. mea culpa to the taxpayers and the newly unemployed who officially " own " 80 % of the company ( which might well be 80 % of next to nothing ) ?
Meanwhile , there 's been a drumbeat of headlines about mass layoffs of public employees .
In California , more than 26,000 public school teachers were given notice last Friday that they might not have jobs next year .
An additional 15,000 school bus drivers , janitors , and administrators might be in the same boat .
Unions turned members out across the state for " Pink Slip Friday " protests .
In Michigan , Pontiac 's school board voted to lay off every one of the district 's more than 600 employees .
In both cases , officials claim that not all those who received notices will , in fact , be laid off , yet such notifications speak to the enormity of the problem that local and state governments face .
Nobody , of course , asks schoolteachers and bus drivers to stay on ( with lucrative bonuses ) to unravel the crises they created .
Oh , maybe that 's because , unlike A.I.G.'s traders , they did n't do anything wrong .
The insurance giant is n't the only company feeling its oats in bad times , however .
As journalist Robert Eshelman suggests below , while mass layoffs are grabbing headlines -- and for good reason -- businesses may have opened up a new front in the war on labor , hiding behind horrific economic news the way an advancing army might use a smoke screen .
How big is the problem ?
Well , we just do n't know .
As newspapers continue to disappear or scale back -- the Washington Post recently did in its stand - alone business section -- the reporters that remain on the economic beat may not be paying enough attention to a war against workers that lurks just below the surface of the headlines .
Tom
Juanita Borden , 39 and jobless , patiently waits as her résumé methodically works its way , line by line , through a fax machine at a state - run job center in downtown Philadelphia .
Lying open before her on a round conference table is a neatly organized folder .
" This is my résumé and everywhere I 've been faxing to .
This is how I keep track of what day I 've sent them on , so I can call and check back , " she says , leafing through pages of fax cover sheets .
" I usually give five business days before I inquire whether or not they 've received it and whether or not they 're interested . "
Juanita was fired last October , when her employer found out that her driver 's license -- a job requirement -- had expired .
" It was only a matter of twenty - six dollars .
I was under the impression that it expired in November of ' 08 , but it was actually November of ' 07 , and because I had n't been driving I was n't aware of it . "
The one occasion on which she was required to drive , though , she could n't , and that was all her employer needed to fire her for failing to fulfill her employment responsibilities .
She has since renewed her license and says with an air of futility , " I 'd like to have my job back if they would give it to me . "
She has n't been asked back and , despite her persistent efforts , she has n't received a single call from a prospective employer either .
" The good thing , " she says , remaining remarkably buoyant despite her misfortune , " is that usually when I interview I get the job .
So ... I 'm hoping for an interview soon . "
Until then , her carefully managed folder serves as a small measure of control over an otherwise steady drift into poverty and homelessness .
Juanita is n't the only one at this job center on the precipice of acute need .
And she is n't alone in relating a story about being fired for what would seem to many a frivolous reason .
Chris Topher , 25 and making his first visit here , was axed in March of last year .
The telecommunications company he had been working for sent him packing when , as he tells it , he installed cable equipment a customer had n't ordered .
It did n't matter that the mistake was on the work order Chris was given .
" It was the best job I had since I graduated high school and I 've had a few : Turnpike Commission , working in a Senator 's office .
I 've had some nice jobs , but that one , I enjoyed it the most . "
And there was good reason to enjoy it .
Chris pulled down $ 1,200 - 1,300 every two weeks in addition to receiving a full benefits package .
He thought of contesting his termination , but at the time it looked like a long , uphill battle that he was n't eager to take on .
It 's a fight that , in hindsight , he thinks he could have won and that his employer probably knew he would win as well .
" And that 's why I believe I was approved by my employer for unemployment , " he says .
Under unemployment eligibility requirements , an employer must certify whether an employee committed a " fault " on the job and was therefore terminated .
If an employer indicates that no fault was committed and the employee meets several other requirements , including being physically able to work , states grant an unemployment claim .
In other words , Chris 's former employer granted him a small concession , while otherwise turning his life upside down amid the worst job market since 1983 .
" Unemployment is the pits pretty much , " says Chris , whose unemployment compensation is significantly less than half what he made as a cable installer .
Still , he 's better off than Juanita , who has applied for unemployment twice and been denied both times .
She is now appealing , but her employer is conceding nothing .
In a recent arbitration hearing , Juanita says , her former supervisor claimed that , if she had only told them about her expired license , they would have allowed her renewal time .
If only .
Now , Juanita lives with her brother and his wife , but they , too , have financial problems .
" My brother is working part time and it 's driving him crazy , because it 's causing money problems between him and his wife , " she explains .
" And with me being there , " she hesitates , " ... it's a little constrained . "
Ratcheting Up the Fear
The mainstream media has generally sketched a picture of a labor market in which , under the pressure of an economic meltdown , workers succumb to two types of downsizing .
In one , a fierce recession forces businesses , desperate to cut costs in terrible times , to lay off workers .
They , in turn , face grim prospects for gainful employment elsewhere .
In a kinder , gentler version of the same , employers , desperate to cut costs in terrible times , offer -- or sometimes force workers to take -- " furloughs , " salary cuts , union give - backs , four - day work weeks , or un - paid holidays rather than axing large numbers of them .
In this case , tough as it may be , workers benefit , retaining at least some of their income , while businesses wait out the recession .
In both cases , businesses are largely depicted as unenthusiastic dispensers of pink - slips .
Managers and bosses are just facing up to an unpalatable reality and unavoidable pressures imposed on them by the worst economic moment in recent memory .
A visit to a job center is hardly a scientific survey .
The experiences of Juanita and Chris , along with those of other unemployed people I spent time with while in Philadelphia , may be purely anecdotal evidence .
But they do raise questions about a subject of no small importance , and it's not one you 're likely to read about in your daily paper -- not yet anyway .
If a deepening recession weighs down and threatens businesses , some of those businesses are undoubtedly also making convenient use of the times to do things they might have wanted to do , but were unable to do in better conditions .
In some cases , under the guise of " recession " pressure , they may be waging a secret war against their own workers , using even the most innocuous transgressions of work - place rules as the trigger for firings -- and so , of course , putting the fear of god into those who remain .
In this way , company payrolls are not only being reduced by mass layoffs , but workers are being squeezed for ever greater productivity in return for lower wages , worse hours , and less benefits .
The weapon of choice is the specter of unemployment , a kind of death by a thousand ( or a million ) cuts .
Companies stand to gain a lot these days from such small - scale but decisive actions .
After all , they reap a double benefit .
Not only do they pare down the size of their payroll , often without needing -- as in Juanita 's case -- to consent to unemployment compensation , but they also contribute to a climate of intensifying fear .
Workers who remain on the job are now not only on edge about lay - offs or scaled - back hours , but also know that a late return from a bathroom or lunch break might mean being shown the door , becoming another member of the legions of unemployed -- now at 12.5 million and rising fast .
This dynamic is , of course , hardly new .
Countless critics of working conditions have written about it since the dawn of the industrial age .
But at the moment , even as the latest unemployment figures make screaming headlines , this is a subject that seldom comes up .
Consider , though , that in December , Wal - Mart , the world 's largest retailer , settled 63 outstanding class - action lawsuits that alleged massive wage and hours violations .
Fearing termination , Wal - Mart workers , according to their testimony in the lawsuits , labored through lunch breaks and past their scheduled hours for just above minimum wage pay , with little hope of getting enough hours to qualify for the company 's health benefits .
As a condition of the settlement , Wal - Mart will pay out as much as $ 640 million to those workers .
If corporations were able to exert such coercive power when the unemployment rate was around 5 % , what can they do in a job market in which 14.8 % of the population can't find adequate work ?
In fact , the world 's largest retailer is one of the few American corporations doing well in dark times .
While retail sales slid almost everywhere , the company 's same - store sales went up 5.1 % in February ( when compared with February 2008 sales ) .
Yet , in that same month , it announced a move to " realign its corporate structure and reduce costs . "
It cut 700 to 800 jobs at its Wal - Mart and Sam's Club home offices , in effect acting no differently than any of the companies being battered by the deepening recession .
Free-Firing Zone
Rodney Green , a soft - spoken 52 - year - old , comes to the job center three times a week to search on - line job listings .
He describes his decades - long drift from full - time employee with benefits to marginalized temp - worker with no benefits and , finally , to the category of unemployed for an extended period .
From the late 1970s until the early 1990s , he worked for Bell Telecommunications , where he earned a good salary and full benefits .
Since Bell laid him off , he 's worked periodically as a forklift operator for various companies , getting temporary placements through an employment agency .
Most recently , he earned $ 12 an hour working for a deli meat and artisanal cheese producer .
No benefits were provided .
A year 's work , he explained , would mean a week 's vacation , " but they do n't keep you that long .
They lay you off or rotate you into another job before then . "
Today , as he 's discovered , even such temp jobs are becoming scarce .
" In the eighties , it was n't as bad as it is now , " he comments from the unemployment heartland of what , in 2009 , is a deeply de-industrialized Philadelphia .
" The city had jobs , but then the jobs moved to the suburbs .
Now they 're moving overseas .
Back then , say , you applied for a job , maybe fifty others applied , too .
Today , that same job , you 're going to have hundreds -- I mean , a thousand for that one job .
It 's hard .
It 's depressing . "
For the past year and a half , Rodney has been collecting unemployment periodically , and in that time , he has n't landed a single interview .
Recently , because the Bush administration finally acquiesced to grassroots and Congressional pressure to lengthen unemployment benefits , he received a thirteen - week extension , providing him a little cushion ( unlike equally interview - less Juanita ) .
" That helped me a lot .
Times are hard right now .
I hear there are over four million people collecting unemployment .
That 's kind of high . "
If Juanita and Chris are casualties of the intensified war of attrition businesses are quietly waging on workers , Rodney represents a deeper unraveling of jobs and job security , thanks to a globalized economy in which the hard - pressed workers in this country are pitted against cheaper labor pools in Latin America , South Asia , China , and even the American South .
In such a job environment , what is one to do ?
Someone I interviewed prior to my job center visit described her reaction when she heard that her company had recently closed a plant in the Midwest : " The first thing I thought , and I felt bad for thinking it , " she recalled , somewhat sheepishly , " was that means more work for us -- at least for the time being . "
Her comment speaks volumes , as does her request not to be identified .
Who needs union busters , patrolling shop - stewards , or legions of high - paid lawyers fighting wage and hours claims when a worker is so anxious about job security that she responds positively to the laying off of those she imagines as potential competitors ?
When employees police their own behavior for fear of the axe -- monitoring their time checking email or using the bathroom -- bad times distinctly have an upside for management .
In this job environment , it 's easy to turn not just on others , but on yourself .
Reflecting on what she will do without a job and unemployment benefits , Juanita wonders if the problem is n't the economy , but the choices she made in life .
" I left home when I was sixteen and lived in my own places , had my children , and got married , " she says nervously , continually folding and refolding a local newspaper .
" I should have gone to school and did a lot more things to make myself more marketable earlier in life .
Now I 'm left having to start over again . "
A look at corporate opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) , whose passage in Congress is a central demand of organized labor , offers a glimpse of how persistently companies seek to disadvantage their workers .
EFCA would allow workers to form a union when a majority of them sign union cards in a given workplace .
" Card check , " as it is frequently called , enables them to organize unions without the need for an election .
In a November column surveying the business elite 's response to the Act , Wall Street Journal op - ed columnist Thomas Frank wrote : " Card check is about power .
Management has it , workers do n't , and business does n't want that to change . "
In Frank 's estimation , the current struggle over EFCA is the latest incarnation of a constantly evolving struggle between workers and employers .
For the under - or unemployed crowding into this center in Philadelphia , the current recession is n't a time - out from the normal struggle , it 's more like a new open season for corporate attacks on them .
Right now , for Juanita , Chris , and others at this center , there are actually two wars going on , and only one of them seems to have caught the attention of labor and business reporters .
The headlines about the first read : Desperate Companies Forced to Cut Jobs .
But many here seem to be experiencing a second war in which businesses are using bad times to act in ways they could n't in the best of times .
Should n't reporters be heading out in search of this one - sided , covert struggle ?
Is n't it time for the second business war of our moment to make a few headlines of its own ?

Jewish settlements and outposts in the West Bank expanded more rapidly in 2008 than the previous year , Peace now reported on Wednesday .
The timing of the report is no coincidence , and it was released on the day US Envoy to the Middle East George Mitchell was scheduled to arrive in Israel .
Mitchell has spoken out against the illegal construction of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories in the past .
According to the report , there were 285,800 settlers living in the West Bank as of 2008 , with 1,518 new structures built in the territories last year , including 261 outposts .
Sixty - one percent of the new structures were built west of the route of the separation fence and 39 % were built east of it .
A quarter of the new structures east of the fence were built in outposts .
At least 1,257 new structures were built in existing settlements , including 748 permanent buildings and 509 caravans compared to 800 structures in 2007 - a 60 % rise .
In addition the ground was prepared for the construction of 63 new structures .
Differences in Itamar settlement between May - December 2008
Peace Now also presented a list of settlements with large construction project in the last six months : Alfei Menashe ( 16 new structures ) , Efrat ( 15 new structures ) , Beit Arye ( 27 new structures ) , Beitar Illit ( 18 new structures ) , Keidar ( 13 new structures ) , Giv'at Ze'ev ( 10 new structures ) , Modi'in Illit ( 35 new structures ) , Ma'ale Adumim ( 13 new structures ) , Ma'ale Shomron ( 19 new structures ) .
Settlements in which at least 10 new caravans were built in the last half - year are Har Bracha , Ofra , Kiryat Arba and Shilo .
Outposts
The report continued to say that not a single real outpost was evacuated in 2008 , and at least 261 new structures were built , including 227 caravans and 34 permanent structures , compared to 98 structures in 2007 ( including 82 caravans and 16 permanent structures ) .
In addition the ground was prepared for the construction of nine new permanent structures .
In three of every four outposts construction or development work took place in 2008 .
Besides these outposts there is a large number of additional points controlled by the settlers but without their permanent presence .
At the outpost of Migron for example the settlers added 5 new structures and began building an extension for another permanent structure .
The Peace Now report said , " It seems that the government announcement to the High Court of Justice that it agreed with the settlers to evacuate Migron and relocate it to the settlement of Adam must have encouraged the settlers to begin construction at Migron , because if the relocation does take place it will take years . "
' Settlers took advantage of Gaza war '
During the war in Gaza the settlers took advantage of the fact that all public attention was on the south to expand construction in the outposts and settlements , the report said .
The organization said at this point it is difficult to assess the amount of construction done during the weeks of the war but it can be stated with certainty that a number of new roads were opened , with the goal of extending control in the areas near the settlements .
Roads opened include one connecting the settlement of Eli with the settlement of Shilo , a road extending control surrounding the outpost of Haro'e and an expanded road ascending from Eli cemetery towards Hayovel outpost .
The report continued to say that in 2008 tenders were issued to build 539 new housing units in the settlements , compared to only 65 housing units in 2007 , an eight - fold increase in the number of tenders .
New structure built in Givat Harel from May - December 2008
Construction permits were also granted for the beginning of work on large projects west of the fence : Nine - hundred - and - fifty housing units in Ma'ale Adumim , 800 housing units in Giv'at Ze'ev , 100 housing units in Ariel and more .
In addition a considerable momentum began in planning and construction in east Jerusalem .
Peace Now said Defense Minister Ehud Barak approved dozens of construction plans in settlements in 2008 , some east of the fence .
Among the substantial plans approved was the establishment of the settlement of Sansana - in southern Mount Hebron , establishment of the settlement of Maskiyot , the expansion of the settlement in Hebron , and more .
According to the report all the outposts Barak declared were evacuated were not fully evacuated .
The evacuation of the disputed house in Hebron is the exception .
Peace Now Secretary - General Yariv Oppenheimer said , " The Labor - Kadima government is a big disappointment in anything to do with freezing construction in settlements .
The settlers do n't have to wait for Bibi ( Netanyahu ) , since the present government has allowed construction not just in settlement blocks , but also in isolated settlements and outposts . "
' Most important Zionist enterprise of our time '
Yesha Council said in response , " Once again we thank Peace Now for allocating the money they get from the European Union towards documenting the most important Zionist enterprise of our generation – settling in Judea and Samaria . "
The Council added that " some of the data are not exactly accurate .
The number of settlers today according to official data stands at over 300,000 Israelis .
" Regarding the allegations of ' taking advantage ' of the war to pave roads , all of Israel knows who took advantage of the war to demonstrate against IDF soldiers and who sent their sons to the front line to give their soul in defense of the State . "
Meanwhile , the Yesha Council plans to welcome American Envoy George Mitchell .
On Wednesday , settlers will put on a special presentation titled " A Palestinian state will blow up in our face " , in an attempt to illustrate the " dangers establishing a Palestinian state in Judea and Samara would pose on central Israel , following the lessons learned from the disengagement , the rockets on Beersheba , Gedera and the war in the south " .
The three - dimensional presentation will be accompanied by audio and visual effects and will travel on a large truck from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during Mitchell 's meetings with the heads of the State .
It must have been the first year of desktop Linux when I first played around with it , some time in the late 1990s .
In those days we were so primitive we did n't realise that the year of desktop Linux would become an annual celebration .
I chose Suse Linux then because it came with two thick printed manuals written in clear , slightly Germanic prose , and it took no more than a month of intermittent work to get the whole thing running to the point where I could read and write emails .
All of this was enjoyable , in a rather crossword - puzzling way .
There is a peculiar satisfaction to be had from fitting together all the different bits of a Unix command until it does exactly what you want , but of course it has nothing to do with real productivity , or even the experience of using Windows .
The real problem though was that in those days there was nothing remotely resembling a proper word - processor on Linux .
Instead , there was Star Office , before it became Open Office .
When I realised that it was impossible to set it up to have a non-white , non -glare back­ground to type on without also ensuring it printed every sheet of paper with pale yellow ink , I gave up .
Since then I have occasionally tried out Unixes in the spirit that one would approach a text - only adventure game .
The highlight of these adventures came when I managed to get FreeBSD to play music by compiling my own kernel .
This was not a pleasure that belonged in the age of the iPod .
Last month I decided to see whether ordinary consumer Linux was useful to normal people .
Suse Linux was now up to version 11 , and installed beautifully simply , but nothing I could do would persuade it to talk to my printer or USB soundcard .
So I tried again with Ubuntu , on both desktop and laptop , and after no more than a week of faffing , I think it 's just about OK .
Program installation just works .
OpenOffice and Firefox are the same programs as I use on Windows anyway .
Some things actually work better : it is easier to rotate my screen from landscape to portrait and virtual desktops now work as well as Exposé on a Mac .
I think I will soon have synchronisation between desktop and laptop working more quickly and unobtrusively than under Windows .
The system is still ragged at the edges .
Neither scanning nor printing work as well and simply as they do on Windows .
I 've got 100 GB of music , much of it classical , ripped on to the hard disk , and there seems to be no jukebox program that copes with it elegantly .
I can't find anything as powerful and elegant as Ditto , the open - source clipboard manager for Windows that I have come to rely on .
All that does is store everything you put on the clipboard and let you search it for later use .
This becomes indispensable as soon as you understand it .
The one indisputable improvement has come on an ageing IBM ThinkPad that I take with me everywhere .
Under Windows XP , the window to dial up the 3G modem kept popping up and freezing the wireless connection whether or not the modem was plugged in .
So I tried Xubuntu , a version of Ubuntu that has a lightweight and well - thought - out window manager .
It 's quicker to start up and even to wake from sleep than XP was , and – astonishingly for any Linux desktop – it 's not ugly or obtrusive .
The various network connections all work properly and without fuss .
The only snag is that the screen grows dark after about 10 minutes even when I am typing , and I have to lean on the special brightness keys to reset it .
But these do work after a while .
The only Windows program I will miss is Microsoft 's excellent OneNote , and that may work under some kind of emulator .
I wo n't be reinstalling Windows , anyway .
There 'll never be a year of desktop Linux for the ordinary user , because if an ordinary user notices that they are running a program or even an operating system , it has in some profound sense failed .
But for people who like playing with their computers , desktop Linux is no longer a text adventure game , unless you want it to be .
It is now an undemanding graphical adventure game ; and unless you are a serious user of multimedia , Xubuntu at least makes a worthwhile free upgrade to Windows XP .

I do n't get why people tend to be so down on immortality .
Do n't knock it if you have n't tried it .
:P
Death is just that — non-existence .
You can't see another beautiful sunset after you die .
You can't fall in love again after you die .
You can't have a brilliant idea after you die .
Or read a really good book on a rainy afternoon .
And the universe is ever - changing .
To suggest one would get bored is silly , since every year would bring something new .
And , not fearing death , you'd be able to explore all the possibilities the world offers .
Even if there is such a thing as living for too long , what makes 70 or 80 or 90 years on this planet such a good end point ?
Why not 200 ?
Or 300 ?
Or 1,000 years ?
Then , if you really are bored , maybe you could move on .
But you 'd certainly have time to try and learn and maybe even create a few new things in the meantime .
Why not earn another degree ?
Or try your hand at a whole new profession ?
Or ten new professions over the course of your life ?
Why not change the world ?
If you had a few centuries to think about how to do it and to improve yourself and your abilities , you probably could !
Really , it almost seems like some of all this being down on immortality comes from bitterness . :P
My favourite quote about immortality ?
From Pratchett :
" What 's up , Sarge ?
Do you want to live forever ? "
" Dunno .
Ask me again in five hundred years . "
The Army 's most decorated serving war hero has accused the Government of failing soldiers suffering from mental trauma resulting from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry , who was awarded the Victoria Cross for twice saving the lives of colleagues in Iraq while under heavy rocket fire , told The Independent it was " disgraceful " that some veterans were struggling to receive treatment .
He said the Government was relying on military charities to cover its own deficiencies and called on it to act to better help the growing number of his comrades suffering from severe combat stress , depression and mental breakdowns .
" These are people who have served this country , " said Cpl Beharry , in his most outspoken interview since receiving the VC four years ago .
" Why can't they get treatment ?
I do n't think the Government is doing enough for soldiers .
Those who are still serving get some form of help for combat stress but even those who are serving do n't get enough support . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cpl Beharry became the Army 's most high - profile war hero when he was awarded the VC for " repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour " for the two rescues " despite a harrowing weight of incoming fire " .
Yesterday the 29 - year - old , who is still a serving soldier , displayed the courage which earned him the country 's highest honour by standing up for the thousands of servicemen and women who are still suffering from post - traumatic and combat stress , having served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In a candid interview , Cpl Beharry broke his silence to reveal that almost five years after he suffered severe injuries saving his friends , he is still racked by mental anguish and excruciating pain .
While he is aware he has received first - rate treatment , he has spoken out on behalf of less high - profile service personnel , criticising the fact that charities have been forced to step in where the Government has failed .
He described it as an outrage that former military personnel were forced to wait for NHS treatment : " I think it is disgraceful that an ex-serviceman or woman has to go to the NHS .
The Government should have something in place for ex-servicemen and women . "
In a week when four servicemen died in Afghanistan and as British troops prepare to pull out of Basra after six years , Cpl Beharry described the nightmares , mood swings and irrational rages that plagued many soldiers .
" It brings me back into the killing zone , to the explosion .
When you hear a bang in Iraq you know it is going to be followed by something and back home you feel the same .
You go tense , waiting .
I go into that defence mode .
" I am learning to live with it .
Everyone experiences combat stress differently .
But we are all linked , we all suffer the same problem in different ways . "

Serving with the 1st Battalion , The Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment in Al Amarah in the summer of 2004 , Cpl Beharry 's unit came under fierce attack more than 800 times .
In the last three months of 2007 alone , 868 military personnel presented with a problem at the MoD 's mental health departments and 69 were so severe they had to be admitted as inpatients .
While just 43 were diagnosed as having full - blown post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , hundreds more were deemed to have mood or adjustment disorders or depressive illnesses .
A report on the Ministry of Defence 's Departments of Community Mental Health ( DCMH ) stated that there was a " significantly higher rate of PTSD among those deployed to the Iraq or Afghanistan theatres of operation " .
The report stated : " [ The findings ] do not cover the full picture of all mental disorders in the UK armed forces .
Personnel may have been seen in primary care who did not require , or wish , onward referral to the DCMHs . "
Robert Marsh , a director of Combat Stress , the charity that offers a lifeline to thousands of veterans suffering from PTSD or associated conditions , said they had seen a 53 per cent increase in new veterans in the past three years .
In the past year alone , they have treated 3,700 new veterans .
" Most people do not come forward for an average of 14 years after they have left the services so there is a problem storing up for the future , " he said .
" Combat Stress is working hard to reduce this time lag because by the time we see them they are on their uppers .
" To have someone like Johnson Beharry VC talking so candidly helps normalise this condition for other veterans and , we really hope , encourages them to come forward . "
Defence minister Kevan Jones said : " We recognise mental illnesses as serious and disabling conditions but also ones that can be treated . "
Psychiatric teams provided diagnosis and treatment during and after deployments but the provision of those teams was just one part of the Government 's approach , he said .
The Government had also ensured support systems were in place to help non-medical staff spot those who might have been affected by traumatic events .
" Decompression periods " in Cyprus also allowed personnel to begin to unwind , mentally and physically , after their operational tours .
" We are not complacent , " Mr Jones said .
The Government had commissioned mental health research into King 's College London and expanded the medical assessment programme at St Thomas ' Hospital to include assessment of veterans who had served in operations since 1982 .
In an interview with the military writer Thomas P. M. Barnett last year , Mr. Rumsfeld said , “ I play squash with him , ” gesturing at Mr. Di Rita .
“ When I pass him in a shot and it ’s a well - played hard shot , I saw speed kills .
And it does .
If you can do something very fast you can get your job done and save a lot of lives . ”
Many politicians have relaxed by competing , and Mr. Rumsfeld is not the first to have earned a reputation for zeal .
As governor of New York , Mario M. Cuomo was known for his sharp elbows and tongue on the basketball court ; as president , Bill Clinton exasperated his golf partners by taking mulligans , or do - overs , after bad shots .
In squash , Mr. Rumsfeld ’s main advantage over more capable and fitter players is that he refuses to play anything but “ hardball , ” a variation of the game that was once common in the United States but has largely died out over the last decade .
Most competitors now play the international game , which uses a softer ball and a wider court , requiring more running and allowing more creative shot - making .
The harder ball favored by Mr. Rumsfeld tends to come back to the center of the court , so players do not have to move as much to return it .
The Pentagon gym had eight hardball courts when it was built in the 1940’s .
When a new facility was built in 2002 , one hardball court was kept for Mr. Rumsfeld and the handful of other Pentagon employees who still play that version of the game .
But some who know him say Mr. Rumsfeld refuses to concede that the game may have passed him by .
“ One time I saw Rumsfeld and I referred to hardball as an old man ’s game , and he just stared at me , ” says David Bass , a public relations executive who sometimes plays on the Pentagon courts .
“ It ’s become a running joke with us . ”
Nor does Mr. Rumsfeld lack for bravado .
Mohamed Awad , a former champion player who was once ranked as high as ninth in the world , spent a half hour hitting with him last February at a racquet club in Munich , where Mr. Rumsfeld was attending a military conference .
Mr. Rumsfeld plays well for a man his age , Mr. Awad said .
Afterward , he said , Mr. Rumsfeld suggested that he could outplay another septuagenarian politician still known for his prowess in squash , the 78 - year - old Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak .
In case you missed it , Devin Harris of the New Jersey Nets hit an unbelievable half court shot to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 98 - 96 .
Down one with just under two seconds , Harris dribbles up towards mid-court , where he is possibly fouled by Andre Iguodala .
Harris loses the ball , it bounces off Iguodala ’s chest , ricochets back to Harris , and he proceeds to drill the shot .
My favorite part of the clip is during one of the replays ( at approximately 1:08 into the video ) you can clearly see ref Violet Palmer waive off the shot , to which Vince Carter gives a shocked reaction .
I guess even in such an amazing play , there ’s reason to criticize female refs .
At least they ultimately got the call right and allowed the shot .
Here ’s the video ( provided by The Hoop Doctors ) :

In 1948 , the Charter Members of the United Nations adopted the legally binding United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was not legally binding , it initiated a series of treaties defining an international standard for human rights .
Article 25 addresses medical care specifically .
" Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being of himself and of his family , including food , clothing , housing and medical care and necessary social services , and the right to security in the event of unemployment , sickness , disability , widowhood , old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control . " [ 1 ]
In 1976 , Article 12 of the International Covenant on Social , Economic and Cultural Rights extended the concept of medical care as a human right to include mental health care and , " The creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness . " [ 2 ]
The covenant 's comment on implementation states , " Health is a fundamental human right indispensable for the exercise of other human rights . " [ 3 ]
The United States is a signatory of this covenant , and until just recently , was the world 's undisputed champion of human and civil rights .
Virtually every developed nation successfully and economically provides this human right with not - for - profit " single payer " systems , in which the government pays the People 's medical bills with tax revenues .
Paralleling the " third world " medical care 's nonexistent , inconsistent or unequal access due to lack of personnel and technology , America 's schizophrenic not - for - profit ( Medicare ) and for - profit ( insurance based ) paradigm generates unequal access and substandard quality .
Despite record health care expenditures , American morbidity and mortality statistics are among the poorest in the world .
Medical care is a basic human need and " Do no harm " is a founding medical ethic .
Minimizing access to medical treatments clearly harms patients , especially in the context of profit .
Another key medical ethic is informed consent .
Americans are rarely informed of , or consent to , the profit stemming from the pain and suffering experienced due to treated and or untreated illness or injury .
Furthermore , growing health insurance premiums lead to growing numbers of uninsured workers [ 4 ] and children , [ 5 ] ; medical bills , whether uninsured or insured , are America 's leading cause of bankruptcy . [ 6 ]
Enterprises profiting from health care hold significant conflicts of interest .
Insurers frequently reject applicants likely to need medical care , and deaths of insured clients benefit insurers , who rarely participate personally in the sometimes messy process .
It appears the best way to profit from health care is to deny it .
Since the denial of medical care maximizes profits , for - profit health care systems promote , if not constitute , a market in human suffering .
In addition to significant expenses stemming from profit itself , for - profit medicine generates competition , duplication of services and administrative and marketing costs .
Even brilliant advertising rarely induces illness , injury , or the rejection of insurer reimbursement guidelines .
America 's for - profit medical system fails to provide quality medical care for all and prioritizes corporate profits over basic human needs .
This violates medical ethics , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Social , Economic and Cultural Rights and other international treaties designed to define and ensure basic human rights .
Extending Medicare coverage to all , boosting caregiver reimbursement rates and retraining health insurance workers as health care providers could solve these problems , restore our human rights and end America 's for - profit medical nightmare .

We need to get to the bottom of what happened — and why — so we make sure it never happens again .

We think time and elections will cleanse our fallen world but they will not .
Since November , George W. Bush and his administration have seemed to be rushing away from us at accelerating speed , a dark comet hurtling toward the ends of the universe .
The phrase “ War on Terror ” — the signal slogan of that administration , so cherished by the man who took pride in proclaiming that he was “ a wartime president ” — has acquired in its pronouncement a permanent pair of quotation marks , suggesting something questionable , something mildly embarrassing : something past .
And yet the decisions that that president made , especially the monumental decisions taken after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 — decisions about rendition , surveillance , interrogation — lie strewn about us still , unclaimed and unburied , like corpses freshly dead .
How should we begin to talk about this ?
Perhaps with a story .
Stories come to us newborn , announcing their intent :
Once upon a time …
In the beginning …
From such signs we learn how to listen to what will come .
Consider :
I woke up , naked , strapped to a bed , in a very white room .
The room measured approximately 4 m x 4 m [ 13 feet by 13 feet ] .
The room had three solid walls , with the fourth wall consisting of metal bars separating it from a larger room .
I am not sure how long I remained in the bed … .
A man , unnamed , naked , strapped to a bed , and for the rest , the elemental facts of space and of time , nothing but whiteness .
The storyteller is very much a man of our time .
Early on in the “ War on Terror , ” in the spring of 2002 , he entered the dark realm of “ the disappeared ” — and only four and a half years later , when he and thirteen other “ high - value detainees ” arrived at Guantánamo and told their stories in interviews with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( reported in the confidential document listed above ) did he emerge partly into the light .
Indeed , he is a famous man , though his fame has followed a certain path , peculiar to our modern age : jihadist , outlaw , terrorist , “ disappeared . ”
An international celebrity whose name , one of them anyway , is instantly recognizable .
How many people have their lives described by the president of the United States in a nationally televised speech ?
Within months of September the 11th , 2001 , we captured a man known as Abu Zubaydah .
We believe that …
Drugs cartels are blamed for General Tello's murder last week Mexican troops have detained the police chief and 36 other officers in the resort of Cancun in connection with the murder last week of an ex-army general .
Soldiers swooped on the police HQ and took police chief Francisco Velasco to Mexico City for questioning .
Former general Mauro Enrique Tello , who had just taken command of a squad to tackle crime in Cancun , was tortured and shot by suspected traffickers .
Some 5,400 people were killed in drug- related violence in Mexico in 2008 .
In a surprise operation , dozens of heavily armed soldiers swarmed on the police station in the municipality of Benito Juarez , which includes Cancun .
Soldiers stripped the police chief and his officers of their weapons to check the registration of the guns .
Chief Velasco was flown to the capital for questioning in connection with Gen Tello 's murder .
Gen Tello , who retired from the army earlier this year , had been sent to Cancun to lead a new force intended to break up the influence of drugs cartels .
He and two other men with him were abducted on a local main road , then driven to a remote location where they were tortured and then shot .
No boundaries
The BBC correspondent in Mexico , Stephen Gibbs , says the general 's death , the day after he arrived to take up his new job , is being blamed squarely on corrupt police and drugs cartels .
Drug -related violence in Mexico is soaring , as criminal gangs fight both each other for control of the trafficking routes from Colombia to the US , and fight federal forces deployed against them .
Some 40,000 soldiers and police have been deployed since December 2006 against the cartels .
Much of the violence to date has been concentrated in Mexico 's northern border cities , while Cancun , which attracts millions of tourists every year , has largely been spared .
Our correspondent says the general 's killing is another sign that Mexico 's drug war has no boundaries .

Dear Cecil : I 'm 30 , and so far my life has wasted away .
So , I 've decided to become a eunuch .
Imagine , me a eunuch !!
Do n't you just love it ?
Can I find a good - paying job , or will I end up a house pet ?
And , would it be advisable to keep my " private parts " in a little jar ?
Larry W. , Chicago
Cecil replies :
Frankly I ’m having quite a bit of trouble imagining you at all , Larry , much less as a eunuch .
However , if I were you ( and luckily , I ’m not ) , I ’d think this over carefully .
Employment opportunities for eunuchs seem to be severely limited these days , and you could be left , how shall we say , holding the bag .
The origin of the word “ eunuch ” ( a combination of two Greek words : enue , “ bed , ” and echein , “ to have charge of ” ) refers to the eunuch ’s traditional role as a harem keeper .
But the harem , the official sort at least , has gone by the wayside , cutting eunuchs off from the mass of the gainfully employable .
For quite a while eunuchs found work as singers — a good amount of music was written expressly for the lilting voice of the castrati — but , unfortunately , show business has changed , and the only castrato who ’s found steady work since the turn of the century has been Frankie Valli .
Becoming a eunuch , for that matter , is no easy thing in itself .
You ca n’t just walk into your neighborhood GP ’s office , casually mention that you were thinking of making a change , and have it taken care of then and there .
Reputable hospitals will only perform castrations in connection with complete sex - change operations , and then only after intensive psychiatric screening .
Johns Hopkins , the hospital that for years handled most of the sex changes in the U.S. ( they ’ve since gotten out of the business ) , required a minimum of two years of psychological testing .
But if you ’re impatient , you could travel to Casablanca , where at least up until a few years ago you could find a certain Dr. Georges Borou , the man who , by dint of extensive experience , is reputed to be the world ’s leading transsexual surgeon .
Dr. Borou acquired all that experience by working strictly on a cash - and - carry basis ( it ’s amazing how all these dumb puns just sort of pop up in a story like this ) , no questions asked .
I do n’t have his number , but I assume he ’s listed in the Casablanca directory .
Look under “ Surgeons — Retail . ”
Finally , Larry , I do n’t care what you keep in your “ little jar , ” as long as you keep it to yourself .

Bill Would Allow Texas School to Grant Master 's Degree in Science for Creationism
Wednesday , March 18 , 2009
By Nora Zimmett
ADVERTISEMENT
A Texas legislator is waging a war of biblical proportions against the science and education communities in the Lone Star State as he fights for a bill that would allow a private school that teaches creationism to grant a Master of Science degree in the subject .
State Rep. Leo Berman ( R - Tyler ) proposed House Bill 2800 when he learned that The Institute for Creation Research ( ICR ) , a private institution that specializes in the education and research of biblical creationism , was not able to receive a certificate of authority from Texas ' Higher Education Coordinating Board to grant Master of Science degrees .
Berman 's bill would allow private , non-profit educational institutions to be exempt from the board ’s authority .
“ If you do n’t take any federal funds , if you do n’t take any state funds , you can do a lot more than some business that does take state funding or federal funding , ” Berman says .
“ Why should you be regulated if you do n’t take any state or federal funding ? ”
HB 2800 does not specifically name ICR ; it would allow any institution that meets its criteria to be exempt from the board 's authority .
But Berman says ICR was the inspiration for the bill because he feels creationism is as scientific as evolution and should be granted equal weight in the educational community .
“ I do n’t believe I came from a salamander that crawled out of a swamp millions of years ago , ” Berman told FOXNews.com .
" I do believe in creationism .
I do believe there are gaps in evolution .
" But when you ask someone who believes in evolution , if you ask one of the elitists who believes in evolution about the gaps , they ’ll tell you that the debate is over , that there is no debate , evolution is the thing , it ’s the only way to go . ”
But critics say that Berman ’s bill will be disastrous if it passes .
“ This would open the door to other fly - by - night organizations that come in and want to award degrees in our state , because the bill is highly generalized , ” said Steven Schafersman , president of Texas Citizens for Science .
“ Right now , we do n’t have this problem in Texas .
Texas is not a center for degree mills , because our laws allow only the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to approve the granting of graduate degrees . ”
“ It would certainly open the door to all kinds of chicanery , ” says Eugenie Scott , Executive Director of the National Center for Science Education .
“ I mean , all you have to do , it looks to me from the bill , is start a non -profit organization , do n’t take any federal or state money , and then offer degrees in any fool subject you want . ”
Schafersman fears that amending state law to accommodate institutions such as ICR would devalue Texas graduate degrees .
“ The degrees would substandard , worthless , but they would be certified by Texas , ” he said .
All colleges and universities granting degrees in Texas currently must be issued a certificate of authority by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board ( THECB ) .
The certificate allows that institution to grant a higher education degree that is recognized by the state – a degree a graduate would need to apply for a teaching position in a Texas public school .
ICR was denied a certificate of authority in 2007 .
HB 2800 would pave the way for institutions like ICR to grant science degrees equal to those of other Texas universities .
And that possibility has critics fuming .
“ Their science education degrees are greatly inferior to those at , say , the University of Texas or Baylor University or even a good community college , frankly , ” says Scott .
“ Teaching that the Earth is only 10,000 years old is a little irregular in modern science . ”
The ICR issued a statement affirming that it is a legitimate educational institute that employs credentialed Ph.D. scientists from around the country .
It insisted that the “ THECB has acted discriminatorily against the ICR ’s application both in process and in the substance of fact , ” and it said “ THECB allowed influence of evolution - biased lobbying efforts to influence process and outcome . ”
The coordinating board denies any wrongdoing and says Berman ’s bill is a slippery slope for higher education in Texas .
“ HB 2800 appears to open the doors of Texas to predatory institutions , ” says De Juana Lozada , assistant director of communications for THECB .
“ Were the bill to become law , it could have the effect of leaving students defenseless against exploitation by diploma mills and other substandard institutions .
" The Coordinating Board just last year eased restrictions on legitimate institutions of higher education desiring to operate in Texas .
For legitimate institutions , the legislation is completely unnecessary . ”
Berman sees the board 's decision to deny ICR certification as a double standard .
“ If a school ’s teaching all evolution , would that be a balanced education ? ” he asked .
“ So it ’s the same thing on both ends of the stick . ”
But advocates of more conventional science education say the THECB was right to deny ICR certification and that Berman ’s motives in introducing the bill were simply to reward an institution loyal to him .
“ You just ca n’t play fast and loose with the rules that everyone has to follow just to favor a constituent , ” says Scott .
“ I think the people of Texas should be very concerned about this issue . ”
While HB 2800 makes its way through the legislature , ICR and the THECB will continue their mediation before a Texas state judge .
Insiders say that if the mediation does not go their way , ICR will sue the board .

Despite an expected wave of fraud in the trillion - dollar bailout that aims to stop the ongoing financial meltdown , federal law enforcement officials told Congress on Wednesday that they have nowhere near the level of resources to combat it .
Top FBI and Justice Department officials said they believed mortgage fraud and other types of corporate criminal behavior has contributed to the economic tailspin .
And they said they already have more than 2,300 open investigations into suspected illegal financial activity -- including 38 probes specifically linked to the crisis .
Those investigations are already straining the resources of the FBI and the Justice Department , FBI Deputy Director John Pistole and Acting Assistant Atty .
Gen. Rita Glavin said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
But the problems will worsen exponentially as the economy plunges , and as the Obama administration and Congress spend more than $ 1 trillion in various bailout and stimulus packages in an effort to forestall foreclosures , corporate bankruptcies and a prolonged economic depression , they said .

Pistole said he expected the number of major investigations to rise into the many hundreds , focusing on big - name companies that “ everybody knows about , ” and to be similar in scope and complexity to the massive probe of energy company Enron Corp. after its collapse in 2001 .
In the meantime , the wholesale redeployment of federal agents and prosecutors to counter - terrorism work after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks has depleted the ranks of financial specialists needed to investigate such cases and bring perpetrators to trial , Pistole said .
The FBI has only 240 agents working on mortgage fraud cases , a fraction of the agents working on the savings and loan failures in the 1980s , Pistole said , adding that the current crisis “ obviously dwarfs ” the previous one .
The sheer volume of cases is so overwhelming , he said , that agents can focus only on those “ systematically trying to defraud the system , ” including lawyers , brokers and real estate professionals .

Pistole noted that former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker warned Congress in 2004 about the looming crisis posed by fraudulent mortgage practices .
The FBI is now doing a “ complete scrub ” to find ways of redeploying agents to work on financial fraud cases , and is trying to hire and train more people capable of conducting such complex and long - term investigations , Pistole said .
In the meantime , “ We need the bodies there , ” Pistole said .
“ It is a huge problem that we look forward to addressing as robustly and as aggressively as we can . ”
Neil Barofsky , the inspector general of the government ’s financial rescue package , told the panel that making an example of some high - profile lawbreakers is the best use of the government ’s limited resources .

“ They have the most to lose , they ’re the most likely to flip , and they make the best examples , ” Barofsky said .
Three senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee , which oversees the Justice Department and the FBI , have sponsored legislation to provide federal authorities with additional funds and some stronger laws to go after mortgage cheats and other financial scammers .
One of them , Chairman Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , told the FBI and Justice Department officials that he wanted to see people prosecuted and sent to jail .
In an interview after the hearing , Leahy said he was dismayed to learn how few FBI agents were being deployed to investigate financial fraud cases , but that his committee would “ make sure there are enough people out there to start catching and prosecuting people . ”

“ They will be more aggressive in the future , I can assure you , ” Leahy said .
“ This committee is going to keep the pressure on . ”

Risky loans were being awarded for months after the run on the bank The Treasury has been criticised for allowing Northern Rock to lend £ 800 m in risky mortgages for six months after it was propped up with taxpayers ' cash .
The National Audit Office report on the Treasury 's handling of the crisis found the bank was still giving mortgages of up to 125 % in early 2008 .
It said the Treasury was aware of " potential shortcomings " in how to deal with failing banks as far back as 2004 .
But it concluded nationalising the bank had protected taxpayers ' interests .
Later on Friday Prime Minister Gordon Brown defended the nationalisation of Northern Rock , saying the government took action when necessary .
Slow response " The Treasury successfully met its objective to protect Northern Rock 's depositors and stopped the run on the bank , " said Tim Burr , head of the NAO .
" The Treasury could however have conducted a more systematic assessment of the risks it was taking on and more thoroughly tested the bank 's initial business plan in public ownership , " he added .
The report also concluded that ministers were slow to respond and under - prepared for the crisis .
The Treasury said it would study the report and respond to MPs this month .
Why did n't the Treasury demand an immediate stop to the reckless lending that got the bank into trouble in the first place ?
Edward Leigh MP , chairman of the committee of public accounts
Report adds to ammunition ' Right decision '
However , Business Secretary Lord Mandelson told the BBC that decisions were made to allow Northern Rock to continue operating .
" There is absolutely no question whatsoever that saving Northern Rock , stabilising it , turning round the business as we are doing now is the right decision , " he said .
" Can you imagine the consequences for savers , for mortgage holders , whose finances are intricately tied up with the fortunes of that company if we had just let it go ? "
The NAO found Northern Rock continued to offer its Together mortgage - lending borrowers up to 125 % of the value of their properties - from the time of its emergency support from the Bank of England in September 2007 until it was on the brink of public ownership in February 2008 .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Edward Leigh MP , Conservative chairman of the public accounts committee , which oversees the NAO , said : " While depositors were queuing up outside branches to withdraw their money and the Treasury was pouring public money in to stabilise the Rock , the bank was still ploughing on with awarding mortgages of up to 125 % of a property 's value .
" Why did n't the Treasury demand an immediate stop to the reckless lending that got the bank into trouble in the first place ? "
The bank awarded a total of £ 1.8bn in Together loans , which exposed the bank to swift losses if house prices fell , between September 2007 and February 2008 .
This amounted to 30 % of all its mortgage lending at the time although the bank said £ 1bn of this extra lending had been agreed before September 2007 .
' Potential shortcomings '
The NAO criticises the Treasury for not having checked out the bank 's finances thoroughly before it decided to nationalise it .
" In the lead up to public ownership , the Treasury did not commission its own due diligence on the company 's operations , for example , on the quality of the loan book , " the NAO said .
The NAO said greater scrutiny would have uncovered a much higher level of mortgage arrears than the Rock had previously admitted .

The report also said the Treasury had been aware of " potential shortcomings " in dealing with a failing bank as early as 2004 .
However , it was " not judged by the Treasury to be a priority in a benign economic environment " , the report said .
Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Phillip Hammond said the NAO report was a " hard - hitting indictment " of how the government handled Northern Rock 's nationalisation .
" It now emerges there were major due diligence failures at the Treasury both before and after nationalisation - which have resulted in the bill for taxpayers being even bigger than was previously thought , " he said .
And Liberal Democrats Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : " With billions of pounds of public money at stake , the least taxpayers should expect is that basic due diligence of the company 's loan book should have taken place before nationalisation .
" It seems ministers were keen to hide the scale of the bill that taxpayers were being asked to pick up .
" A Treasury spokesman said the department would study the report and reply to the public accounts committee at the end of the month .
The BBC's Business Editor Robert Peston said that the report was embarrassing for Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling as " a spotlight has been shone again on their misjudgements " .
" But we 've known for many months that they were wrong on these very big issues , " he said .
Negative equity Northern Rock , which had grown to become one of the UK 's biggest mortgage lenders , had to be bailed out by the Bank of England in September 2007 when its funding from other banks evaporated .
ROCK TIMELINE September 2007 : BBC reveals that Northern Rock has been granted emergency financial support from the Bank of England February 2008 : Northern Rock is nationalised March 2009 : The Rock confirms that it made a loss of £ 1.4bn in 2008
It was subsequently nationalised " temporarily " by the government , as the international banking crisis deepened , and no viable private sector bidder came forward .
One result of its high - risk lending was a rapid increase in the bank 's exposure to actual and potential losses .
Falling house prices last year meant that by the end of December 2008 , 33 % of all Rock mortgages had fallen into negative equity - up from just 0.5 % a year earlier .
Along with growing arrears among borrowers , this meant the bank needed a much higher financial cushion , so the Treasury had to give it a further £ 3bn in July 2008 .
Many commentators expect house prices to fall by at least 10 % this year , and probably more .
Northern Rock recently announced a loss of £ 1.4bn for 2008 , mainly stemming from its arrears and losses on selling repossessed homes .

THEY call themselves MBM - the Muslim Brotherhood Movement - a gang of 600 men who boast they are the toughest and best young street fighters of Middle Eastern descent in Sydney .
MBM claims to be the biggest of four new gangs to emerge on Sydney streets in the past year .
Its numbers rival those of the state 's largest bikie gang , the Rebels .
The sudden appearance of MBM , with its growing membership recruited predominantly from the city 's south - western suburbs , has alarmed senior police already battling to combat open warfare among outlaw motorbike gangs .
Even hardened private security guards have expressed concern to police about the indiscriminate " punch and run " tactics of MBM members who , in the past two weeks , have arrived in large numbers at city nightclub venues and who walk the streets in intimidating mobs .
But the objectives of MBM - its emblem features two crossed pistols and a hand grenade - and its leadership remain unclear to officers of both the Organised Crime and Gang Squad and Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad .
Police say that a fortnight ago MBM members embarked upon a campaign of random assaults on men who crossed the path of a mob of about 100 toughs stalking Darlinghurst and Kings Cross during the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras .
Whitehead Institute researchers have developed a novel method of removing potential cancer - causing genes during the reprogramming of skin cells from Parkinson 's disease patients into an embryonic - stem - cell - like state .
Scientists were then able to use the resulting induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells to derive dopamine - producing neurons , the cell type that degenerates in Parkinson 's disease patients .
The work marks the first time researchers have generated human iPS cells that have maintained their embryonic stem - cell - like properties after the removal of reprogramming genes .
The findings are published in the March 6 edition of the journal Cell .
" Until this point , it was not completely clear that when you take out the reprogramming genes from human cells , the reprogrammed cells would actually maintain the iPS state and be self - perpetuating , " says Frank Soldner , a postdoctoral researcher in Whitehead Member Rudolf Jaenisch 's laboratory and co-author of the article .
Since August 2006 , researchers have been reprogramming adult cells into iPS cells by using viruses to transfer four genes ( Oct4 , Sox2 , c - Myc and Klf4 ) into the cells ' DNA .
Although necessary for reprogramming cells , these genes -- the known oncogene c-Myc in particular -- also have the potential to cause cancer .
Â
In addition , the four genes interact with approximately 3,000 other genes in the cell , which may change how the cell functions .
Therefore , leaving the genes behind in successfully reprogrammed cells may cause unintended alterations that limit the cells ' applicability for therapeutic use , for drug screens or to study disease in cell culture .
In the current method , Whitehead researchers used viruses to transfer the four reprogramming genes and a gene coding for the enzyme Cre into skin cells from Parkinson 's disease patients .
The reprogramming genes were bracketed by short DNA sequences , called loxP , which are recognized by the enzyme Cre .
After the skin cells were reprogrammed to iPS cells , the researchers introduced the Cre enzyme into the cells , which removed the DNA between the two loxP sites , thereby deleting the reprogramming genes from the cells .
The result is a collection of iPS cells with genomes virtually identical to those of the Parkinson 's disease patients from whom original skin cells came .
Removing the reprogramming genes is also important because of those genes ' effect on an iPS cell 's gene expression ( a measure of which genes the cell is using and how much it 's using those genes ) .
When the researchers compared the gene expressions of human embryonic stem cells to iPS cells with and without the reprogramming factors , iPS cells without the reprogramming genes had a gene expression closer to human embryonic stem cells than to the same iPS cells that still contained the reprogramming genes .
" The reprogramming factors are known to bind to and affect the expression of 3,000 genes in the entire genome , so having artificial expression of those genes will change the cell 's overall gene expression , " Dirk Hockemeyer , who is also a co-author of the Cell article .
" That 's why the four reprogramming genes can mess up the system so much .
From now on , it will be tough for researchers to leave the reprogramming genes in iPS cells . "
Jaenisch , who is also a professor of biology at MIT and a member of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT , says that the process to remove the reprogramming genes is very successful , when compared with earlier experiments .
" Other labs have reprogrammed mouse cells and removed the reprogramming genes , but it was incredibly inefficient , and they could n't get it to work in human cells , " he says .
" We have done it much more efficiently , in human cells , and made reprogrammed , gene - free cells . "
After removing the reprogramming genes , the Jaenisch researchers differentiated the cells from the Parkinson 's disease patients into dopamine - producing nerve cells .
In Parkinson 's disease patients , these cells in the brain die or become impaired , causing such classic Parkinson 's symptoms as tremors , slowed movement and balance problems .
Because the cells reside in the patients ' brains , researchers cannot easily access them to investigate how the disease progresses at the cellular level , what kills the cells , or what might prevent cellular damage .
Therefore , the ability to create patient - specific iPS cells , derive the dopamine - producing cells , and study those patient - specific cells in the lab could be a great advantage for Parkinson 's disease researchers .
Although the initial results are extremely promising , Jaenisch acknowledges that the process is far from over .
" The next step is to use these iPS - derived cells as disease models , and that 's a high bar , a real challenge .
I think a lot of work has to go into that . "
For MIT 's 2008 Campus Preview Weekend , hackers placed boxes with clear fronts , chainsaws , and the text ' In Case of Zombie Attack , Break Glass ' on the front in the lobbies of MIT 's buildings 16 and 46 .
The selection of Building 46 was a clear reference to the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences housed there ; zombies traditionally seek brains to eat .
These are similar to some of the old fire alarms around campus ( you can find one on the second floor of 26 ) which say " In case of fire , break glass . "

The new Kepler spacecraft , the first telescope specifically designed to find planets like Earth , planets that can have live like our own in our region of the Milky Way .
According to NASA , these are the objectives of Kepler :
• Determine the percentage of terrestrial and larger planets there are in or near the habitable zone of a wide variety of stars ;
• Determine the distribution of sizes and shapes of the orbits of these planets ;
• Estimate how many planets there are in multiple - star systems ;
• Determine the variety of orbit sizes and planet reflectivities , sizes , masses and densities of short - period giant planets ;
• Identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques ; and
• Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems .

In other words , the Kepler is looking for neighbours .
It will be using a 0.95 - meter diameter telescope , which actually is a photometer , with a very large field of view compared to other astronomical telescopes : 105 square degrees .
The photometer tracks a large number of star systems at the same time , without moving , controlling the brightness levels of more than 100,000 systems .
It will controlling those same 100,000 stars for the entire life of the mission , which is set to be 3.5 years .

Öko -Boom Billig - Solarzellen revolutionieren Strombranche

Doch die Sonnenlobby rechnet ihre Erfolge klein - aus Angst vor einem Abbau der Subventionen .
It does n’t matter who you are , what games you run , or how long you ’ve been game mastering — these eight truths are universal to GMing :
GMing is More Work than Playing
Most gaming books gloss over this one , perhaps thinking that no one in their right mind would ever put on the GMing hat if they actually knew how much work was involved .
I dislike that approach — I think every prospective GM should know that yes , it is a lot of work , but :
It ’s not always a lot of work
The work does n’t always feel like work
That work is incredibly rewarding
For Some , GMing is More Rewarding than Playing
If you do n’t find GMing more rewarding than playing , you wo n’t be GMing for long .
Every gamer I know fills one role — GM or player — substantially more often than the other .
Each role is different , and each one holds a different ( though interconnected ) appeal .
The balance is important , though : Every GM should get a chance to play at least occasionally ( it ’s a great break , and an even better way to learn new GMing tricks ) , and every player — yes , every single player — should try GMing at least once .
This is a pretty basic truth , but it ’s an important one :
If you do n’t find GMing more rewarding than playing , do n’t do it .
GMing Makes You a Better Player
When you see the game from behind the screen , you notice all sorts of things you simply can’t spot as a player .
And many of those things actually make you a better player .
For example :
As a player , it ’s not hard to hog the spotlight without really noticing it ; as a GM , it ’s painfully obvious when someone is hogging the spotlight , and equally obvious how detrimental that can be to the game .
Once you ’ve seen it happen as a GM , you ’ll watch out for it as a player .
You also develop a different perspective by running games — the most notable aspect of which is your focus on making the game fun for everyone at the table .
That translates quite well to playing , as does being able to spot when your GM is trying to make something specific ( and fun ) happen — so that you can move in that direction .
When Your Players Have Fun , You Will Have Fun
As the GM , once you sit down at the table the majority of your fun flows from your players .
( Pre-game , your fun is largely internal : prep is all you , as is the fun you derive from it . )
If you sit down with just one goal , and that goal is “ Make my players have fun , ” you will succeed .
This should n’t be your only goal ( as some of the other GMing truths indicate — for example , you need to set out to have fun yourself , as well ) , but this really is the touchstone of good GMing : enabling your players to have fun .
As the GM , You Are Also a Player
Being a player means that you ’re entitled to just show up and have fun , too — your focus should n’t be entirely on the hard work that ’s involved in GMing .
It should also be on taking your own preferences into account .
Because while focusing on your players is a winning strategy — arguably , the winning strategy — it should n’t happen at the expense of sparing a bit of focus for yourself .
GMing Requires
You to Be Proactive
In the most basic , traditional model of a gaming session , players are largely reactive ( with much of their fun coming from deciding how to react to the unexpected , in character ) , while the GM is almost entirely proactive — making things happen , and then seeing what the players do .
Even if you run your games in a less traditional way , fundamentally you , the GM , are required to be more proactive than your players .
This starts with prep ( assuming you do n’t improv exclusively ) and flows all the way through the end of each gaming session .
I really wish I had learned this sooner , because I spent a lot of time early on in my GMing career expecting my players to follow my trains of thought , plot threads , and other obscure trails through the game .
If I had instead assumed the responsibility of making sure that fun stuff happened , we all would have been better off .
You Will Make GMing Mistakes
The tricky thing about being proactive is that it guarantees that you will make mistakes .
There ’s just no way around it — when you do stuff , and that stuff impacts everyone at the table , you ’re going to do the wrong thing from time to time .
The important bit is not letting your inevitable mistakes ( and sweet baby Jesus do I make a lot of GMing mistakes ) get you down .
Feel bad , apologize if needed , make amends or retcon if it ’s appropriate , and then move on .
Later , when you ’ve got a bit of downtime , think about what went wrong , how it might have been avoided , and how to do better next time .
Like nearly every craft , making mistakes is a fabulous — albeit painful — way to learn .
Reading Your Players is Essential to GMing a Fun Game
The absolute worst GMs are the ones who do n’t care to know anything about the gaming tastes , preferences , and tolerances of their players — and do n’t really give a shit that they do n’t know .
This truth covers a couple of different things .
It covers the GMs who are just there to tell their story , and fuck you if you do n’t like it ( though they would never think of their games that way ) ; but it also covers GMs who do n’t pay attention to their players during each gaming session .
When I ’m running a game , I take notes about what worked and what did n’t , based on observing my players at the table .
And I have a running mental file on each of them — what they dig , what they hate , what they ’re getting burned out on , etc .
Number Nine and Beyond …

Text corrected , 1 November 2007 ( see note [ 36 - a ] ) .
What happened in Rwanda in 1994 ?
The standard line is that a calculated genocide occurred because of deep - seated tribal animosity between the majority Hutu tribe in power and the minority Tutsis .
According to this story , at least 500,000 and perhaps 1.2 million Tutsis — and some ‘ moderate ’
Hutus — were ruthlessly eliminated in a few months , and most of them were killed with machetes .
The killers in this story were Hutu hard - liners from the Forces Armees Rwandais , the Hutu army , backed by the more ominous and inhuman civilian militias — the Interahamwe — “ those who kill together . ”
“ In three short , cruel months , between April and July 1994 , ” wrote genocide expert Samantha Power on the 10th anniversary of the genocide , “ Rwanda experienced a genocide more efficient than that carried out by the Nazis in World War II .
The killers were a varied bunch : drunk extremists chanting ‘ Hutu power , Hutu power ’ ; uniformed soldiers and militia men intent on wiping out the Tutsi Inyenzi , or ‘ cockroaches ’ ; ordinary villagers who had never themselves contemplated killing before but who decided to join the frenzy . ” [ 1 ]
The award - winning film Hotel Rwanda offers a Hollywood version and the latest depiction of this cataclysm .
Is the film accurate ?
It is billed as a true story .
Did genocide occur in Rwanda as it is widely portrayed and universally imagined ?
With thousands of Hutus fleeing Rwanda in 2005 , in fear of the Tutsi government and its now operational village genocide courts , is another reading of events needed ? [ 2 ]
Is Samantha Power — a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist — telling it straight ? [ 3 ]
Is it possible , as evidence confirms , that the now canonized United Nations peacekeeper Lt. General Roméo Dallaire was at the time an agent of the Tutsi army ?
Or that the funding for Hotel Rwanda came from a company with powerful mining interests in Congo — where access is insured by the Rwanda government ?
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed , that ’s clear .
There was large - scale butchery of Tutsis .
And Hutus .
Children and old women were killed .
There was mass rape .
There were many acts of genocide .
But was it genocide or civil war ?
“ I think that ’s a very good question and it is not adequately answered , ” says Howard W. French , former East Africa Bureau Chief for the New York Times and author of Africa : A Continent for the Taking . [ 4 ]
Howard W. French operated on the ground in Central Africa ( 1993 - 1999 ) and his reportage of the RPF Tutsi rebel army hunting down and massacring hundreds of thousands of Hutus in Congo is exceptional . [ 5 ]
“ A minority of fifteen percent [ RPF Tutsis ] wages a determined effort to take over a country and rule in an ethnic way , by force of arms , and has been doing this for years .
Two presidents are assassinated . ” Howard W. French is adamant .
“ These are not excuses for butchery .
But these are things that lead one in the direction of civil war , as a descriptor , as opposed to the one - sided tale that we have been given , of these sweet , innocent Tutsis who remind us of Israel , versus the savage Hutus who cold - heartedly butcher people hand - to - hand for three months . ” [ 6 ]
From the very first words and frames , where the image has yet to appear and the screen is completely black , the film Hotel Rwanda sets up viewers to think a certain way about what happened in Rwanda in 1994 .
Here is a story about good versus evil .
An ominous African voice is heard , clearly the announcer on a Rwandan radio program , and he is describing the Tutsis as ‘ cockrrrRRROACHES . ’
The voice is black and the cataclysm unfathomable , as anyone will tell you , and the black screen underscores the evil darkness of Africa .
This voice of terror returns throughout the film to haunt the innocent but terrified Tutsis , on screen , and the viewers gripping their seats .
The good guys are the Tutsis , the victims of genocide .
They are not killers in the movie : they are never killers .
At the end of the film , when a well - attired guerrilla force is shown — the ‘ rebels ’ of the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) — they are rescuers .
They are disciplined , organized .
They keep a tidy United Nations camp safely behind their lines .
They do n’t kill Red Cross nurses , or orphaned children , in the film : they reconnect children to their families .
The Hutus in the standard Rwanda genocide stories are always the bad guys , and they are all bad guys .
Every Hutu is a genocidaire — to use the ominous French term deployed in English contexts to further underscore the horror , the horror ( sic ) .
The Hutus are the devil incarnate .
The Tutsis are saintly .
Indeed , they are beyond reproach , because they are the victims of genocide .
The Hotel manager ’s wife bears an obvious cross around her neck , to remind us that the Tutsis are the chosen people .
When the now celebrated United Nations hero Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire shakes hands with the devil — as his own popular book and the subsequent film Shake Hands With the Devil concur — he is shaking hands with Hutu . [ 7 ]
That is the ideological framework of the Hotel Rwanda film .
There is , today , an industry behind it .
The Tutsis are dehumanized by the Hutus and by the Hutu media , in the film , and there was plenty of truth in this in real life .
But the RPF pro-Tutsi media that operated in Rwanda after 1991 , for example , was equally dehumanizing , and equally vicious , but the film does not tell us this .
Tutsi guerrilla forces — prior to 1970 — were the first to describe themselves as Inyenzi or cockroaches : they were not equated with the insects that everyone loathes , they were well trained , secretive and coordinated military forces who attacked at night and withdrew by day . [ 8 ]
The RPF would hit and run and kill with efficiency .
It was not a pejorative usage , as it has been used in the film Hotel Rwanda , although it was bastardized and turned against the Tutsis by media outlets in Rwanda .
Radio Mille Collines and the other anti-RPF media outlets of the President ’s party , the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development ( MRND ) , [ 9 ] were not the only ones to incite hatred and murder .
Indeed , RPF - controlled Radio Muhabura spread ethnic hatred and incited widespread killings , but this was — according to Hollywood — a war with only one army , the ruthless Hutus . [ 10 ]
The Pillars of Hotel Rwanda
When Human Rights
Watch investigated the genocide , they sent Alison des Forges to tell the story , and the product of her long investigations was the fat treatise on genocide in Rwanda titled Leave None to Tell the Story .
Irony is heaped upon irony when we consider that those who are left to tell the story are silenced by the authorized storytellers like Alison des Forges .
“ Alison des Forges is a liar , ” Cameroonian journalist Charles Onana , author of the book The Secrets of the Rwandan Genocide , Investigations on the Mysteries of a President , published in French in 2001 , is adamant .
“ She is a LIAR . ” [ 11 ]
Paul Kagame , RPF General and President of Rwanda , sued Charles Onana for defamation in a French court : Kagame lost . [ 12 ]
“ Des Forges has written a book which has become the bible regarding Rwanda , ” says Jean - Marie Higiro , former Director of the Rwandan Information Office ( ORINFOR ) who fled the killing , with his family , in early April 1994 .
“ Everyone points to her book even though some of what she has produced is fiction .
I do n’t think she is an intentional liar , but I do n’t know why she investigated Hutu human rights abuses but no RPF human rights abuses . ”
Hotel Rwanda is built on the pillars of selective human rights reporting , but it really takes off from the celebrated text , We Regret To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families , by Philip Gourevitch , the New Yorker magazine ’s premier Africa expert .
“ Gourevitch 's short book should be compulsory reading for Heads of State and Ministers of Defence all over Africa , ” wrote Guardian reporter Victoria Brittain , “ as well as for all U.N. officials involved in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian aid , from the Secretary General on down , and the heads of missionary orders in the US , France and Belgium . ”
Victoria Brittain is a Nation magazine contributor on genocide in Rwanda . [ 68 ]
The International human Rights Law Clinic at American University for several years ( at least ) asked students to read Philip Gourevitch on genocide in Rwanda , in preparation for legal work with the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda .
Professor Melissa Crow , who worked with the Law Clinic , followed her term at Human Rights Watch ( 1994 - 1995 ) by working in Kigali , Rwanda , under the RPF government , working for the Office of the Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda .
Following this she joined Foley , Hoag and Elliot , the influential Washington D.C. law firm closely aligned with the U.S. - Uganda Friendship Council , which is closely tied to ChevronTexaco , Coca - Cola , the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation and the Pangaea Global AIDS Foundation .
The latter foundations are also deeply involved in Rwanda [ 69 ] .
Notably , a U.S. immigration judge in St. Paul Minnesota imposed Gourevitch ’s book as compulsory reading for all attorneys dealing with Rwandan refugees requesting political asylum .
But this is a dangerous and irresponsible precedent . [ 13 ]
Funding for Gourevitch ’s book came from the United States Institute for Peace , a State Department offshoot ( with an Orwellian name ) . [ 14 ]
What we never learn about Philip Gourevitch is that his brother - in - law , Jamie Rubin , was Madeleine Albright ’s leading man and , through him , Gourevitch planted in the public mind a narrow perspective on Rwanda . [ 15 ]
Philip Gourevitch is an intimate pal of Rwandan President Paul Kagame .
I regret to inform you that Philip Gourevitch is not an impartial journalist , regardless of how much you may have liked his book , or have been moved by it , because he has taken sides , and he has told only one side of the story , and he has told it badly , and he has been rewarded for his fine job in telling it badly . [ 16 ]
“ Gourevitch begins the story with the Tutsi as these saintly victims , ” the Times ’ Howard W. French says .
“ And I do n’t think Gourevitch is a stupid guy .
I think that it ’s just sheer intellectual dishonesty …
Gourevitch was coming out in the New Yorker every other month with this very well written and — if you do n’t know the facts — very compelling picture about Rwanda … as the Israel of Central Africa and the Tutsis as the Jews of Central Africa .
That ’s powerful stuff .
But I ’m on the ground in Central Africa seeing that the reality is very , very different . ” [ 17 ]
The theme of genocide in Rwanda — whether true or false — has birthed an industry that revolves around a standard , simplified plot .
The appearance of the film Hotel Rwanda marks the coup de grace in the long process whereby the facts , the ugly realities and dirty details of what really happened in Rwanda have been distilled into a neat and tidy story that proliferates in the media , in film , in literature , at seminars on genocide and workshops on reconciliation , and it is the predominant discourse in academia .
Quebecois journalist Robin Philpot calls it “ the right and proper tale . ” [ 18 ]
The Falsification of Amerikan Consciousness
It has become a mythology : the Rwanda genocide mythology or , better , the Tutsi Holocaust mythology .
But as African scholar Amos Wilson puts it so simply in The Falsification of Afrikan Consciousness , “ you cannot understand the present unless you first understand the past . ”
To understand the growth of the mythology on genocide in Rwanda , consider first the text of Hotel Rwanda — The Official Companion Book , which describes the process of “ bringing the true story of an African hero to film . ” [ 19 ]
The book deletes the most basic facts about the Rwandan Patriotic Front and its backers ’ roles in the ongoing war for the Great Lakes region of Africa , war that has led to at least seven million people dead since the initial RPF invasion from Uganda in October 1990 . [ 20 ]
Instead the book offers an abbreviated timeline of events that accentuate or exaggerate those points that serve the predominant Hotel Rwanda mythology , and it excludes those facts that would undermine this mythology : the entire framework of the brutal , bloody war for control of Rwanda is obscured .
October 1990 : Guerrillas from the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) invade Rwanda from Uganda ; the RPF is mostly made up of Tutsis .
A ceasefire is signed on March 29 , 1991 .
First : the above statement uses the definitive term for the RPF action : invaded .
The Rwandan Patriotic Army invaded Rwanda from Uganda .
However , the context of the RPF ascension to power is obliterated .
RPF infiltration of Rwanda began around 1986 after Yoweri Museveni , with powerful western backers , shot his way to power in Uganda .
Paul Kagame , current president of Rwanda , was head of Museveni ’s Directorate of Military Intelligence , and later commanded the Rwandan Patriotic Front .
But the RPF invasion was a gross violation of international law against a sovereign nation — a point the Hotel Rwanda industry ignores .
Never condemned by the international ‘ community , ’ the RPF ‘ struggle ’ was supported by powerful western agents and institutions , including the World Bank and the IMF , who shackled Rwanda with austerity programs in perfect synchronization with the RPF assault .
This led to the heightened inculcation of structural violence throughout Rwanda .
Combined with the crash of coffee prices on the world market , millions of Rwandans found it impossible to make ends meet as the 1990 ’s began .
Suffering hit new lows not seen in Rwanda for decades .
The majority of people in Rwanda , besieged by the propaganda of competing factions — a spectrum of political interests aligned with or against the RPF or the Rwanda government of Juvenal Habyarimana — found scapegoats according to their positions in society .
Economic interests predominated as a few elites increasingly controlled the life or death of the many .
The rising insurgency and structural violence provoked hostility amongst and between groups , and elites controlling media outlets of all stripes began to use their venues to sow ethnic rivalry as the veneer for the deeper agenda : class warfare .
Hutus were dehumanized as often as Tutsis .
“ Pro-opposition newspapers represented MRND [ Hutu government ] leaders as essentially evil and corrupt , ” writes Jean - Marie Higiro .
They were “ liars , idiots , animals , bloodthirsty murderers and warmongers .
Some of these newspapers published drawings of President Habyarimana covered with blood . ” [ 21 ]
The RPF and Rwandan Tutsi Diaspora had their own publications .
The best known of these is Impuruza , published in the United States ( 1984-1994 ) .
Tutsi refugees joined Roger Winter , the Director of the United States Committee for Refugees , to help fund the publication .
The editor , Alexander Kimenyi , is a Rwandan national and a professor at California State University .
Like most RPF publications Impuruza circulated clandestinely in Rwanda amongst Hutu and Tutsi elite .
“ A nation in exile , a people without leadership , ‘ the Jews of Africa ’ , a stateless nation , ” wrote Festo Habimana , the president of the Association of Banyarwanda in Diaspora USA , in the premier issue of Impuruza .
Habimana called for the unity of Tutsi refugees .
“ But our success will depend entirely upon our own effort and unity , not through world community as some perceive …
As long as we are scattered , with no leadership , business as usual on their part shall always be their policy .
We are a very able and capable people with abundant blessings .
What are we waiting for ?
Genocide ? ” [ 22 ]
The Association of Banyarwanda in Diaspora USA , assisted by Roger Winter , organized the International Conference on the Status of Banyarwanda [ Tutsi ] Refugees in Washington , DC in 1988 , and this is where a military solution to the Tutsi problem was chosen .
The U.S. Committee for Refugees reportedly provided accommodation and transportation . [ 23 ]
Winter is intimate with USAID , and a long - time ally of Susan Rice , former Assistant Secretary of State on African Affairs ( 1997-2001 ) , Special Assistant to President Clinton ( 1995 - 1997 ) , and National Security Council insider ( 1993 -1997 ) .
Roger Winter is also a staunch supporter of U.S. Rep. Donald Payne .
Winter acted as a spokesman for the RPF and their allies , and he appeared as a guest on major US television networks such as PBS and CNN .
Philip Gourevitch and Roger Winter made contacts on behalf of the RPF with American media , particularly the Washington Post , New York Times and Time magazine .
Roger Winter and U.S. Rep. Donald Payne continue to manipulate African affairs : most notable are there recent exaggerations about genocide in Darfur , Sudan , for which Donald Payne sponsored the Darfur Genocide Accountability Act .
Second : the language of the above October 1990 timeline entry underscores the equally discrepant point that the RPF was “ mostly made up of Tutsis . ”
According to the genocide mythology , the cataclysm in Rwanda was a tribal struggle between Hutus and Tutsis , with some involvement of France .
Who were the non-Tutsi elements of the “ mostly ” Tutsi RPF ?
What is the implication ?
They were Hutus ?
How could Hutus be fighting alongside Tutsis if Hutus were exterminating all Tutsis based on an organized , premeditated plan ?
The term “ moderate Hutu ” invites a similar conundrum : what is a “ moderate Hutu ” in the international legal framework of genocide ?
Jean - Marie Higiro says it best : “ Academics and journalists divide Hutus into two categories : moderates and extremists following the myths of Hollywood .
They never suggest that there were Hutu who did not belong to either category .
There were those who were terrified by both sides and who just fled for their lives .
Academics and journalists never do the same [ segregating ] for Tutsis and of course never for the RPF even though the RPF was a conglomerate of Tutsi supremacists , Republicans and monarchists .
These supremacists are highly placed in the current government .
Tito Rutaremara , one of the ideologues of the RPF is one of them , and General Ibingira , the butcher of Kibeho [ is another ] of them . ”
The very definition of genocide would be called into question if it turned out that there were political , economic or class — as opposed to ethnic — motives behind the hundreds of thousands ( or 1.2 million ) of deaths that have been unequivocally attributed to Hutu genocidaires .
A deeper examination of “ genocide ” in Rwanda raises just such inconvenient questions .
The determination of what constitutes genocide is not so cut and dry as Hutus versus Tutsis , or lists of targeted Tutsis versus no lists , no matter the terror now invoked in one ’s soul on hearing the word Interahamwe .
After the October 1990 entry , the timeline in the companion book omits any reference to the RPF until February 1993 , as if the supposed ‘ heroic ’
Tutsi rebels were patiently sitting out the war from the Ugandan sidelines .
But massacres occurred in northern Rwanda after the October 1990 invasion and after the 1991 ceasefire and they were committed by the RPF .
Tens of thousands of refugees fled the border districts in fear of ongoing RPF atrocities .
( This author remembers well the traumatized tourist who disembarked from the bed of a small pick - up truck that crossed the border from Rwanda to Uganda in 1991 .
I was in Kasindi , in southwest Uganda .
The Rwandan man sitting next to this western woman was shot by an RPF sniper as the truck drove down the road ; the truck was then stopped , searched by the RPF , and the dead man taken . )
From 1990 on , RPF terror cells began infiltrating Kigali , the capital , and all other areas of Rwanda , and with them came atrocities that were frequently blamed on the Habyarimana government , including assassinations , massacres and disappearances .
By March 1993 , Rwanda ’s internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) had reached one million people .
The RPF practiced a scorched earth policy : they did not want to have to administer a territory or deal with local populations .
The RPF displaced people , shelled the IDP camps , and marched on .
They killed some captives , buried them in mass graves or burned corpses , and used survivors as porters to transport ammunition , dig trenches or cook their meals .
According to one Rwandan now in the US : prior to 1994 , most Tutsis who had a job in Rwanda collected contributions for the RPF political and military program ; people were afraid to refuse to pay the compulsory tax levied by a ruthless military institution , the RPF .
The Habyarimana government responded to terror with repression in kind , but the international human rights “ community ” had already taken sides in the war : the Hutu government of Habyarimana was accused of “ genocide ” against Tutsis as early as 1993 ; the RPF atrocities were ignored or explained away .
“ There were many RPF killings in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994 , ” says Jean - Marie Higiro , “ but these were not investigated ; they were automatically attributed to Habyarimana ’s [ MRND ] party by the international community .
Even so , we know that the RPF used that kind of strategy to tarnish the image of their opponents . ” [ 24 ]
Jean - Marie Higiro also cites the Tutsi newspaper Impuruza , the publication edited by Professor Alexandre Kimenyi , with accusing the Habyarimana government of committing genocide against the Tutsis , and this was prior to 1993 .
February 1993 : The RPF again invades Rwanda .
Hutu extremists cite the invasion as proof the Tutsis aim to eliminate them , and begin calling for preemptive measures .
To begin with , the RPF never left Rwanda , and they never stopped killing .
Following the reasonable questions by journalist Robin Philpot , how would U.S. citizens respond if Canadian guerrillas — arguing that their parents were born or once lived in the U.S. — invaded from Toronto ?
Would we call Americans who complained “ extremists ” ?
What if a few Islamic militants purportedly invading the U.S. took out the World Trade Center ?
Would the U.S. government call for preemptive measures ?
Would we call the invaders a “ rebel army ” ?
Extremists ?
Would we call them terrorists ?
“ Is it normal in the search for justice to condemn one side in a war for human rights violations , ” writes Robin Philpot , “ and not even question the morality of the aggressors , those who violated the principles of all the charters of rights humanity has ever drafted ?
Is it right to shout about how a government violates rights and turn a blind eye to the launching of an aggressive war ? ” [ 25 ]
Like the film , the Hotel Rwanda Companion Book offers a gross and distorted simplification of events in Rwanda .

Trained by the U.S. Army at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , USA , the RPF soldier and now President of Rwanda , Paul Kagame , is a regular visitor at the Pentagon , and he was not the only officer in Rwanda with ties to the U.S. military .
Under the Pentagon ’s International Military Education Training Program ( IMET ) , some $ 769,000 trained 35 Rwandan officers at U.S. military schools from 1980 to 1992 , and $ 120,000 was earmarked for Rwanda for both 1994 and 1995 .
Further military assistance was provided by the U.S. to 1994 , while the bulk of the arms and logistical support came from U.S. client states ( France , South Africa , Egypt , Uganda and Zaire ) .
The Pentagon has also trained large numbers of Rwandan soldiers under the Extended - IMET ( E - IMET ) and Joint Command Exchange and Training ( JCET ) programs .
One of those trained was Bangladeshi Colonel Moen , the Chief Operations Officer for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ( UNAMIR ) , and another graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College in Leavenworth , Kansas ( USA ) . [ 26 ]
From 1993 onwards the RPF continued to stick its bloody foot in the door of Rwanda , and the “ international community ” continued to tighten the screws on the Habyarimana government .
Ever vigilant and inflammatory in advertising the governments ’ human rights abuses — whether manufactured , exaggerated or real — the human rights community continued to close its eyes to RPF atrocities , terrorist infiltrations and bloodied land grabbing .
Backed by powerful factions from the United States , England and Belgium , the RPF maneuvered and manipulated its way to the very seat of power , in Kigali itself , where — under the Arusha Peace Accords negotiated in Arusha Tanzania in 1993 — a battalion of RPF soldiers was based at a strategic site within the city center .
The RPF immediately fortified its defenses under the watch of Lt. General Roméo Dallaire — now universally regarded as a hero — the Canadian Force Commander of UNAMIR .
The Hotel Rwanda Companion
Book offers only the following tidy summary which , as popular mythology now holds , credits the RPF with the imperative of ‘ stopping the genocide ’ against Tutsis .
Mid-July 1994 : The Tutsi RPF forces capture Kigali and the genocide is over .
Over a period of 100 days , almost 1,000,000 Rwandans were murdered .
While it is alleged that “ almost 1,000,000 Rwandans were murdered ” in those 100 days , a claim that is certainly exaggerated , it is also true that the RPF slaughtered , bombed , massacred , assassinated or tortured hundreds of thousands of people — including Hutu and Tutsi soldiers , politicians and government officials , and innocent civilians .
“ All U.N. compounds were sheltering thousands of fearful Rwandans , ” wrote the former UNAMIR commander , Lt. General Roméo Dallaire , “ How could I possibly keep them safe ? ” Dallaire ’s admission subsequent to the previous statement is very insightful , especially given his pro-RPF position :
“ We protected these citizens from certain death at the hands of the extremists or the RPF … ”
In this [ previous ] quote , Dallaire openly confirms the RPF ’s role in killing , and his book repeatedly describes firefights he witnessed between the RPF and various government factions . [ 27 ]
There were no firefights shown in Hotel Rwanda , there was none of the ongoing warfare that rocked Kigali before and after 06 April 2004 : there were only ruthless , savage , Hutu killers and rapists , and the dead bodies that — by inference and innuendo — the Hutus slaughtered with machetes , pangas , axes and hoes .
The RPF employed state - of - the - art information control and psychological operations tactics practiced by the US military : international reporters were embedded ; access to battle zones was restricted ; evidence of RPF massacres was erased , or massacres were blamed on Hutu extremists , Interahamwe militias or the government Forces Armee Rwandaise .
British journalist Nick Gordon reported crematoriums where the RPF incinerated bodies .
CNN ’s only journalist on the ground in Rwanda at the time , Gary Streiker , has admitted that he worked behind the RPF lines and followed RPF directives on reporting . [ 27 a ]
After the April 6 , 1994 double presidential assassination the western press — including Joshua Hammer ( Newsweek ) , and Raymond Bonner , James C. McKinley Jr. and Donatella Lorch ( New York Times ) — went out of their way to cite ‘ professionalism ’ and ‘ discipline ’ and ‘ remarkable self - control ’ exercised by the invading rebel RPF forces .
The western press turned the double Presidential assassinations into ‘ a mysterious plane crash , ’ but this was a smoldering wreckage of the truth . [ 28 ]
“ In conjunction with the military build - up by the RPF and its allies — including the infiltration into Kigali , the capital city , of up to 10,000 RPF soldiers , ” writes ICTR barrister Chris Black , “ western journalists and western intelligence services masquerading as “ human rights ” organizations began a concerted propaganda campaign against the [ Habyarimana ]
Government and through it the Hutu people , accusing it of various human rights abuses , none of which were substantiated . ” [ 29 ]
U.N. High Commission for Refugees investigator Robert Gersony reported in September 1994 on the RPF ’s killing of more than 30,000 ethnic Hutus — in a period of two months — and gave a detailed account of locations , dates and nature of crimes , as well as the methods used to kill and to make the bodies disappear .
Gersony also identified RPF leaders responsible for the killings .
The classified U.N. report has never been released .
Interested moviegoers might want to hack through the perception management of Hotel Rwanda to get to United Artists parent company Metro Goldwyn Meyer . [ 30 ]
MGM directors , unsurprisingly , given what the film does not tell you about the true U.S. role in Rwanda , include current United Technologies director and U.S. General ( Ret. ) Alexander Haig .
United Technologies is in the business of war and “ I ’m in charge here ! ” Al Haig served as secretary of state under a Hollywood actor named Ronald Reagan .
The other producers of Hotel Rwanda include an unknown company called Kigali Releasing Ltd. , and another called the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa Ltd .
The latter is a major shareholder of , and mining partner with , Iscor Ltd. , one of the companies named by the U.N. Panel of Experts Report ( 2002 ) for the illegal exploitation of resources from the Congo . [ 70 ] .
U.S. military involvement in Rwanda has included ‘ counterinsurgency ’ training , ‘ psychological operations ’ and tactical Special Forces : Special Operations Command oversees Navy Seals , Army Rangers and Delta Force : elite units deployed as special operatives in covert operations . [ 31 ]
The hotel in the film is not the real Hotel des Mille Collines .
The Tutsi RPF rebels did not enter Kigali , Rwanda ’s capital city , and save the day , they were in Kigali all along .
The RPF gained a foothold in Kigali through their constant deceptions and manipulations of the “ peace process , ” and with the support of their international backers , especially the United States .
The RPF ‘ rebels ’ were better trained , better equipped , better organized than any and all other combatants in Rwanda and , notably , numerous sources claim that the RPF had the capacity to stop the killings .
Sources also report that the Forces Armees Rwandais — the Rwandan government army — did n’t have the resources to fight both the RPF and the Interahamwe .
Professors Christian Davenport ( U. Maryland ) and Allan Stam ( Dartmouth ) published research in 2004 that showed that the killings began with a small , dedicated cadre of Hutu militiamen , but quickly cascaded in an ever - widening circle , with Hutu and Tutsi playing the roles of both attackers and victims .
Their team of researchers also found that only 250,000 people were killed , not the 800,000 plus advanced by the RPF , and that for every Tutsi killed two Hutus were killed .
The research unleashed a firestorm : the media jumped on them for denying genocide .
“ Our research suggests that many of the victims , possibly even a majority , were Hutus — there were n’t enough Tutsis in Rwanda at the time to account for all the reported deaths …
When you add it all up it looks a lot more like politically motivated mass killing than genocide .
A wide diversity of individuals , both Hutu and Tutsi , systematically used the mass killing to settle political , economic and personal scores . ” [ 32 ]
“ When you look at the motivations of the Interahamwe leadership and young people in the Interahamwe they were motivated by money , ” notes former ORINFOR director Jean - Marie Higiro .
Some Hutu businessmen were giving out loans , contributing to political parties of both the Rwandan government and the RPF rebels .
“ These guys wanted to do business : people were motivated by different interests . ”
“ Many Hutu and Tutsi businessmen prospered under the Habyarimana regime , ” Jean - Marie Higiro notes .
“ They received government contracts and loans from government banks and suddenly became rich .
During this period of uncertainty they contributed money to the RPF , MRND , and opposition parties — always speculating on the winner .
That is why , after the war , very few Hutu businessmen who had contributed to the RPF reopened their business immediately .
That is why some Tutsi businessmen who contributed to the RPF made an excellent calculation .
After the war they reaped off the benefits . ” [ 33 ]
Some facts in the film are true .
To begin with , in every sense of the terms “ human rights ” and “ humanitarianism , ” the western powers betrayed the people of Rwanda .
The whites were rapidly evacuated , the blacks abandoned , including the many African staffers of international agencies .
The French armed the Hutu side , and they evacuated key Hutu elite at the first opportunity , but the United States , U.K. and Belgium armed the Tutsis .
There was a Rwandan man named Paul Rusesabagina and he would , one day , be working at the Hotel des Mille Collines , but he was the manager of the Hotel des Diplomats .
The Tutsi rebels were blamed with the assassination of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi , but the film convinces us they did n’t do it , when everything suggests they did .
And it is certainly true that hundreds of thousands of Rwandans died .
Hotel Rwanda is a work of fiction .
As a cultural artifact produced by an affluent entertainment industry in the West , and for affluent western consumers , but focused on a distant and exoticized culture about which the affluent western consumers know very little , or nothing at all , it serves to consolidate the ideological pillars of disinformation that came before it , and upon which it was built .
According to many and varied knowledgeable sources , including hotel insiders : Rwanda was not abandoned by the western powers : Belgium , France , Canada , England and the United States were all militarily involved in the 1994 conflict .
Because there are Israeli connections to the current government , it is likely that Israeli military agents were also involved .
These were no bystanders to genocide , as Samantha Power and the Atlantic Monthly and others would like us to think , but active participants in a ruthless international military conflagration .
Note that amongst Atlantic Monthly ’s primary advertisers [ read : sponsors ] is Lockheed Martin [ aerospace and defense ] Corporation .
The hotel was not under a state of siege early on as the movie suggests — an elegant wedding took place there during the fray , and it married the sister of the Tutsi businessman Kamana Claver , who had contracts with the Hutu government .
According to one guest , powerful Hutus and Tutsis regularly came and went .
When the water to the hotel was shut off , forcing the ‘ refugees ’ to drink the water from the swimming pool , it was not shut off by the Hutu genocidaires , as implied in the film , but by the Tutsi RPF army , who cut power to the city .
General Bizimungu appears in the very first scenes of the film , prior to the double presidential assassination : yet when the plane was shot down on April 6 , 1994 , General Bizimungu was still a Colonel , and he was far from Kigali .
According to one hotel guest , who remains unnamed for fear of retribution , Paul Rusesabagina , the film ’s hero , in no way wielded the kind of influence as depicted throughout the film :
“ Paul was a very simple man like me in front of the Interahamwe .
If he succeeded to save some Tutsi from his home he was most probably helped by some influential Interahamwe friend , say Georges Rutaganda .
He was as vulnerable as I was and could not oppose any action against the will of the militia and much less of the army .
He lies when he feints to call General Bizimungu for help , because the Hotel des Mille Collines was under the jurisdiction of Colonel Renzaho .
Bizimungu lived at the northern war front lines , and he only came to Kigali four days after the plane was shot down and I never saw him at the hotel . ” [ 34 ]
“ There is overwhelming evidence , ” wrote Rutigita Macumu , in an opinion piece titled “ Paul Rusesabagina Not a Hero ! ” that appeared in Rwanda ’s The New Times state - owned newspaper on November 5 , 2005 , “ that Paul Rusesabagina did not particularly go out of his way to bring the people , who were being hunted , to the Mille Collines Hotel haven , to protect them once they were in the hotel , to procure them food or even water when they were unable to pay for them , or to devise any uncommon means to fend off the killer gangs outside the hotel .
It is highly apparent that he only fulfilled his duty , as directed by his Sabena bosses , to run the hotel well and cater for all its occupants . ” [ 35 ]
Georges Rutaganda , the Rwandan man misportrayed as the devil beer salesman and erstwhile murderer of Tutsis in Hotel Rwanda , writes that Paul Rusesabagina was no disinterested , apolitical hotel manager , but an important activist member of a national political party .
On 12 April 1994 , Rusesabagina shifted to the Hôtel des Mille Collines where he acted as its new director because the other , the Hôtel des Diplomats where Rusesabagina was working , had been evacuated by foreign troops .
Hotel Rwanda depicts Rusesabagina at the Hôtel des Mille Collines prior to the double presidential assassinations of 6 April 2004 .
Rutaganda claims to have visited the hotel and seen guests from both Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups , including : Rubangura Vedaste ; Mutalikanwa Félicien ; Dr. Gasasira Jean Baptiste ; Kamana Claver ; Kajuga Wicklif ; Rwigema Celestin ; Kamilindi Thomas ; and others .
Rutaganda claims that very few UNAMIR soldiers were around , and they were incidental to security : the Hutu Gendarmes of the FAR army were manning a roadblock at the main entrance .
He also claims that the “ refugees ” in the U.N. convoy that were turned back at a roadblock “ were the real elite cream of Tutsi ethnic tribe .
Had one been really spurred by bad intentions this would have been a great occasion to decapitate the Tutsi ethnic group .
Families of former ministers , of doctors , of lawyers , of big business men , of highly educated men , of professors , etc , were among them . ”
If the ‘ genocide ’ were so organized and calculated , and quick to strike , then Rutaganda has a very interesting point : how did it happen that the elite of the Tutsi tribe were protected and evacuated by UNAMIR troops and Hutu Gendarmes ?
Of course , all Hutus are killers , and no one will believe a genocidaire : Georges Rutaganda was sentenced to life in prison by the ICTR .
Can George Rutaganda ’s claims be corroborated ?
“ Georges Rutaganda cooperated with the U.N. to save all those people . ”
ICTR investigator Phil Taylor offers a compelling portrait of the Hotel Rwanda ’s supposed devil himself : Rutaganda did n’t incite hate crimes , he called for calm and respect for the Red Cross ; Rutaganda was never accused of the rape and sexual slavery depicted in the film ; and Rutaganda never traded in machetes .
Indeed , Human Rights Watch in January 1994 identified an English businessman who had imported tens of thousands of machetes into Rwanda . [ 36 ]
More importantly , virtually everyone in Rwanda ( and Congo ) owns a machete and they use it for farming ; what would be unusual is if someone did not have a machete .
Anyways , it was not machetes that did the most killing .
Rape was off the agenda at the ICTR until Hillary Clinton showed up in Arusha and pledged $ 600,000 to be paid after the first ICTR rape conviction , and that ’s where the Tutsi women collected in the fictitious Rutaganda compound in Hotel Rwanda come from .
Hillary Clinton visited the ICTR and bribed the court , and the issue of rape was immediately elevated and a perpetrator needed to be found to satisfy the court , no matter their innocence or guilt , and meet Hillary Clinton ’s conditions for $ 600,000 bribe .
“ I was Georges Anderson Nderubumwe Rutaganda 's lead trial counsel , ” said Attorney Tiphaine Dickson , “ and [ I ] was present in Arusha , in the courtroom , in fact , the very day Hillary Clinton paid her visit .
There were no ‘ pinning ’ charges of rape against my client .
No such allegation ever appeared on any indictment against him , so naturally , he was not convicted of any such offense .
Jean - Paul Akayesu , however , also on trial at that time ( the trials were heard concurrently , and by the same panel of judges ) did see his indictment amended , after the Prosecution had rested , to include rape , and he was convicted in what the ICTR trumpeted was a ‘ landmark ’ decision on September 2nd , 1998 . ” [ 36 - a ]
The Hollywood Rwanda film offers a fictitious U.N. Colonel Oliver ( Nick Nolte ) as a substitute for the Canadian Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire , who is absent from the film .
( It is believed that Dallaire asked too much money from the filmmakers for the use of his name or character . )
Roméo Dallaire allegedly worked not as an impartial United Nations commander , but as an agent for the invading RPF army .
Dallaire reportedly approached Hutu military commanders to convince them to follow the winds of change and embrace the RPF program .
Dallaire was rarely present at the hotel , according to witnesses , but his substitute ( Nick Nolte ) is always there , and he is painted as a sympathetic and neutral humanitarian .
Dallaire mentions in his book how he passed by the Hôtel des Mille Collines , but in his own meticulously detailed recounting of the daily events and travels around Kigali from 06 April to 10 April , 1994 , for example , Dallaire stops at the Hôtel des Mille Collines only once . [ 37 ]
According to Chris Black , a lead counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda ( ICTR ) since 2000 , U.N. documents brought into testimony at the ICTR in October 2005 clearly establish that UNAMIR ’s Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire :
was an agent of the RPF ;
helped shoot down the plane in the double presidential assassination ;
covered up the preparation of the final RPF offensive assisted by Uganda , the U.S. and U.K. ;
lied to his United Nations boss Jacques - Roger Booh - Booh about it .
Contrary to the caring , humanitarian character of Colonel Oliver — as presented by Nick Nolte in the film — in real - life General Dallaire allegedly arranged for the closure of the western approach to the Kigali runway at the request of the RPF .
This made it easier for the RPF and others to track the presidential plane as it came in from the east .
The Belgian contingent of the U.N. force was in control of the airport area and the area from which the missiles were fired , and a Belgian military unit ( the “ peacekeepers ” killed later ) were the only people caught by the Hutu army coming out of the firing area after the plane was shot down , after the army threw up a cordon to try to catch the culprits .
“ All of Dallaire ’s actions only make sense in this light , ” lawyer Chris Black explains .
“ Dallaire admits in his book that he was close to Paul Kagame and admired him .
He helped Kagame by covering up the RPF build - up for an offensive in violation of the Arusha Accords , while at the same time helping with the anti-government propaganda of the RPF .
The Belgian ’s actively engaged on the side of the RPF and once the plane was shot down they attacked FAR army and gendarme positions alongside the RPF .
We have radio intercepts of the RPF talking about their help from the Belgians and others .
By saying Dallaire was an RPF agent I am of course really saying he worked for the Americans under the orders of Ottawa . ” [ 38 ]
Lt. General Roméo Dallaire was no peacekeeper : he was an active military strategist — a war - maker .
The Political Economy of Genocide
Prior to the cataclysm of 1994 , the RPF set up its political base in Belgium .
When Belgian “ peacekeepers ” are murdered by “ Hutus ” in Hotel Rwanda — the blue helmets are scattered on the ground in front of our horrified U.N. hero , Colonel Oliver ( Nick Nolte ) — the false inference is that the genocidaires ’ calculated killing of the Belgians would provoke a UNAMIR withdrawal from Rwanda .
This is a central pillar of the genocide theory : with the Belgian ‘ peacekeepers ’ out of the way , the Hutu killing machine had free reign to shift into high gear .
In reality , the Belgians were immediately killed because they were the political accomplices of a ruthless bunch of terrorists , the invading RPF army .
Substantial evidence entered into public record in the ICTR ’s so - called ‘ Military I ’ and ‘ Military II ’ trials ( both began in 2005 ) contradicts the fundamental premise above — and the central theory of the ICTR prosecution — by showing that Hutu officers charged by the ICTR with complicity in the Belgians ’ murder actually risked their lives trying to save the Belgian soldiers .
The U.N. Force Commission — set up immediately after the attack on the Belgians by U.N. Force Commander General Dallaire — concluded the same .
Eyewitness testimony by a U.N. Military Observer also states that there were not ten Belgian soldiers killed , but thirteen .
“ This is a point of some interest in Belgium , ” writes Chris Black , “ where the government claims to have lost only ten men . ” [ 39 ]
So who were those three Belgian soldiers and what was their mission ?
Hotel Rwanda dares not introduce such questions : to do so would be heresy .
But the United States knows , and the RPF knows and the legal ‘ experts ’ at the ICTR all know that the genocide theory would crumble under the admission of the truth .
According to ICTR lawyers , U.N. documents show that Lt. General Roméo Dallaire was aware , at least from December 1993 , and probably before , that the RPF , with the support of the Ugandan Army , was daily violating the Arusha Accords by sending into Rwanda men , materiel , and light and heavy weapons .
That is how the U.S. , Belgians and Canadians assisted the RPF / A in preparing for the final solution in Rwanda — total military victory over the Hutus . [ 40 ]
“ The RPF engaged in assassinations of officials , politicians and civilians , and attempted to cast the blame on the government , ” writes Chris Black .
“ Dallaire assisted in this campaign by suppressing facts concerning these crimes and openly siding with the RPF propaganda statements . ” [ 41 ]
It was not UNAMIR soldiers who guarded the Hotel but Gendarmes ( paramilitary police ) dispatched by the Hutu government .
This fact flies in the face of the “ genocide ” mythology .
If the hotel was full of Tutsis targeted by genocide , why was it being protected by the very same architects of that supposed genocide ?
The Hotel was not filled only with Tutsis ( refugees from genocide ) : it was full of powerful Tutsis and Hutus ( with Tutsis in the majority ) with political and economic connections to powerful factions both inside and outside of Rwanda .
Questions about the composition of the ‘ mostly Tutsi ’ RPF invaders provoke questions about the ethnic composition of the Interahamwe militias and commercial relationships that transcended ethnicity .
Such details are overlooked in the western reductionism on Rwanda — because they contradict the official and burgeoning Rwanda holocaust industry and the U.S. State Department fictions .
The following ethnic inconsistencies are very revealing :
Robert Kajuga , was the Tutsi President of the notorious “ genocidal ” Rwandan Interahamwe
Kamana Claver was a Tutsi businessman and frequent recipient of large government - awarded contracts from the “ genocidal ” Hutu government ;
Celestin Sebulikoko was a Tutsi businessman and strong supporter of the main Hutu political party ( MRND ) ; he is believed disappeared by the RPF ;
A Tutsi named Mpangaza , who worked for the Rwandan government firm TRANSINTRA , reportedly manned a powerful machine gun at an Interahamwe roadblock in downtown Kigali in 1994 ; he was a well - known Interahamwe ; he lives peacefully in Rwanda today ;
The son of Juvenal Gatorano , a Tutsi customs agent with the Habyarimana government ’s Ministry of Finance , was always seen at Interahamwe rallies .
These facts , if true , provide compelling evidence that it was not a coordinated genocide that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 , but a civil war , and a western proxy war , with deep political , economic and military motivations behind the atrocities .
Acts of genocide certainly occurred , as did crimes against humanity , but “ acts ” of genocide do not constitute genocide as defined by the international legal frameworks on genocide .
An entire ethnic group could be wiped out , say the last 100 Penan nomads in Sarawak , for example , but if they are incidentally eliminated in the calculated and racist process of logging their forests — which is exactly what has happened to the Penan — it is not necessarily “ genocide ” according to the narrow international legal frameworks of the Genocide Convention .
Equally troublesome , the U.S. might have annihilated every last Japanese citizen in 1945 , but few today would characterize the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki as genocidal in nature or intent .
The calculated nature upheld as the basis for genocide in Rwanda has always revolved around the supposed “ lists ” created by Hutu genocidaires : lists of Tutsis who were subsequently eliminated because , first and foremost , they were Tutsis ; such “ lists ” were purportedly created by the Hutu genocide machine .
“ Any army would have lists of their political enemies , ” notes ICTR investigator Phil Taylor .
“ This is not unusual . ”
The Rwandan government likely had its lists , the RPF had their own lists , and both went about assassinating their enemies .
Phil Taylor notes that the prosecution at the ICTR has not produced any lists — of any kind — as evidence subsequently used for Rwanda genocide convictions .
In the aftermath of the World Trade towers attack the intelligence armies of the United States generated an extensive list of “ enemies of the state ” — a list they maintain today — most of whom were / are of Islamic ethnicity .
Do the existence of these lists constitute genocidal intent ?
“ There is a stunning lack of documentary evidence of a government plan to commit genocide , ” write lawyer Chris Black .
“ There are no orders , minutes of meetings , notes , cables , faxes , radio intercepts or any other type of documentation that such a plan ever existed .
In fact , the documentary evidence establishes just the opposite . ” [ 42 ]
U.S. Pentagon lawyers imported to the ICTR from the Judge Advocacy General ( JAG ) Corps have heavily skewed the ICTR in favor of the U.S. - supported RPF .
Also , the ICTR has not returned a single verdict against RPF Tutsi soldiers or Tutsi leadership ; former ICTR prosecutor Carla Del Ponte was removed for her attempts to prosecute Tutsis . [ 43 ]
“ The ICTR risks being a part of the problem rather than the solution , ” wrote Filip Reyntjens , Belgian historian and expert witness on genocide in Rwanda , in 2004 .
“ I cannot any longer be involved in this process . ” [ 44 ]
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ( ICTR ) , the sister of the Hague Tribunal , consolidates the popular mythology on genocide in Rwanda by playing its role as an international judicial body which , by default , must be beyond reproach or bias .
While demonizing the Hutu leadership and justifying the RPF dictatorship now in control of Rwanda , writes Chris Black , it also serves as a means of presenting a completely false history of the events in Rwanda , and covering up the murder of the two Hutu heads of state and the massacres of hundreds of thousands of innocent people by the RPF and its allies . [ 45 ]
In Hotel Rwanda , the genocidal Hutus blame the Tutsi RPF rebels for shooting down the plane that killed the two presidents , and because the film demonizes every Hutu , the viewer is convinced that the Hutu ’s are lying , deflecting attention from their own nasty deeds .
However , evidence suggests that an RPF terror cell in Kigali shot down the Presidential airplane .
Also on the plane was a Forces Armee Rwandais general , a pivotal target for the RPF .
Former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros - Ghali offered journalist Robin Philpot the claim that the Central Intelligence Agency was almost certainly involved .
“ As early as 1997 , ” writes a Spanish legal team that in 2005 filed suit against Paul Kagame and his RPF cadre , “ a team of investigators appointed by the ICTR — Michael Hourigan , Alphonse Breau and James Lyons — released reports , then held as classified , which revealed that the attack was masterminded by high - ranking RPF military and not by Hutu extremists as had been believed until then .
These disclosures were corroborated in 2004 by the remarkable testimony of Abdul Ruzibiza , a member of the RPF commando unit which perpetrated the attack on the presidential plane . ” [ 46 ]
" I am an eye witness to what took place when the SA - 16 was fired because I was present " , writes Ruzibiza in his recently released book , Rwanda : L'histoire Secrete ( The Secret History of Rwanda ) .
Ruzibiza alleges that after the missile attack on the plane , soldiers of the RPF who had been readied in advance were assembled to immediately launch attacks that culminated in the fall of Kigali on July 4 , 1994 . [ 47 ]
There is also the definitive statement by Paul Mugabe , a Former Intelligence Officer of the RPA , titled : Declaration on the Shooting Down of the Aircraft Carrying Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6 , 1994 .
Paul Mugabe alleges that two weeks before the crash of the Presidential aircraft , [ then ] Major General Kagame sent [ then ]
Lt. Colonel James Kabarebe to bring the SA - 7 surface - to - air missiles to the RPA detachment in Kigali , and to give final instructions for attacking Rwandese Army forces ( FAR ) and shooting down the plane .
Two RPF leaders , Colonels Kanyarengwe Alexis and Lizinde Theoneste , who had earlier served in the Habyarimana Government , gave information and instructions as to where the missiles should be placed .
( Col. Lizinde Theoneste , who later defected , was subsequently assassinated in 1998 by RPF operatives in Nairobi , Kenya , in order to ensure the secrecy of the missile operation . )
Two weeks before the double presidential assassination , 12 artillery systems were brought from Uganda , and arrived at RPA headquarters .
Other RPF defectors also credit the RPF with shooting down the plane carrying the Rwandan and Burundian leadership .
Long - time RPF officer Lt. Aloys Ruyenzi claims that the assassination plan was hatched at an RPF meeting on 31 March 1994 :
“ The Chairman of the meeting was Major General Paul Kagame , and the following officers were present : Colonel Kayumba Nyamwasa ; Colonel Théoneste Lizinde ; Lt. Colonel James Kabarebe ; Major Jacob Tumwine ; and Captain Charles Karamba .
I heard Paul Kagame asking Colonel Lizinde to report about his investigations and I have seen Colonel Lizinde giving to Paul Kagame a map of the selected place for the plane shooting etc . ” [ 48 ]
Lt. Aloys Ruyenzi also accuses General Paul Kagame and ( now ) General James Kabarebe of overseeing the massacres of Hutu and Tutsi civilians , both in the field and at crematoriums set up to dispose of the evidence .
Ruyenzi is just one defector with a compelling story .
He claims he has witnessed helicopter gunships shelling villages , and massacres , tortures and summary executions as policy .
Many of the human rights atrocities committed by the Kagame regime have been documented by human rights organizations .
“ Gen . James Kabarebe was the commander of the reverse - genocide army , ” says Howard W. French , referring to the military campaign where hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees were hunted down and slaughtered by the Tutsi RPA and their western allies in Congo . [ 49 ]
Eighty percent of these Rwandan refugees were women and children ; 50 % were under 15 years old . [ 50 ]
This genocidal reign of terror to hunt down and massacre non-combatant Hutu men , women and children was spearheaded by the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) and Ugandan People ’s Defense Forces ( UPDF ) , who were running the show for Laurent Kabila ’s Allied Front for the Democratic Liberation of Congo ( AFDL ) — and it was backed by government and private factions from the United States , the U.K. , Canada and Belgium .
One eyewitness to the skeletons piling up pinpoints mass graves that were later sanitized in advance of the United Nations mission to investigate the RPF / UPDF / AFDL massacres of hundreds of thousands of unarmed Hutu civilians . [ 51 ]
The contra -genocide against Hutus continues today : at this writing the forces are aligned to exterminate the remaining 40,000 Hutus in Congo : they are all written off as genocidaires who fled Rwanda in 1994 , even though most surviving FDLR were too young to have participated in genocide . [ 52 ]
Sabena officials were not surprised and horrified to be getting a call from some hotel manager in Rwanda , as depicted in the film : one week prior to the October 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the RPF , Sabena Airlines rerouted its airline crews ( pilots , hostesses ) away from the Hotel des Mille Collines and off to Burundi for their overnights .
This was no random decision : it was a calculated policy action meant to insure the safety of company employees in the face of a coming war .
Sabena was well informed .
A Belgian firm born out of the post - Leopold aviation era in Congo , Sabena was later used to ship diamonds , and probably coltan ( columbium - tantalite ) , out of Kigali by the RPF elites , whose base , again , was in Brussels .
It is believed that Sabena ’s eventual “ bankruptcy ” was intended to cover their tracks and shield principals from any possible future legal actions stemming from their pillage in the Congo .
What about the elusive American diamond magnate Maurice Tempelsman and his connection to Bill and Hillary Clinton and the diamonds coming out of Kigali ?
“ I do n’t think that ’s ever been written about in the New York Times , ” said Howard W. French . [ 53 ]
Howard W. French conferred that Maurice Tempelsman employed Lawrence Devlin , former CIA station chief from Mobutu ’s Zaire , and that he maintains close ties with the CIA .
Tempelsman is also on the board of directors of the Harvard AIDS Institute and the Africa - America Institute ( Donald Payne is also deeply involved , as is Gayle Smith , formerly Bill Clinton ’s National Security Council advisor on African Affairs ) .
Maurice Tempelsman was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ’s lover , he was reported to be Madeleine Albright ’s lover , and he was one of the 99 people who accompanied Bill Clinton on his 1998 Africa victory tour .
Tempelsman is one of the many untouchables behind the quagmire in Central Africa . [ 54 ]
Why has the United States blocked all attempts to investigate the shooting down of the plane and the double presidential assassination that sparked the cataclysm on April 6 , 1994 ?
Why has n’t the United Nations pursued an inquiry ?
" It is a very mysterious scandal , ” wrote author Robin Philpot .
“ Four reports have been made on Rwanda : the French Parliament Report , the Belgian Senate Report , Kofi Annan 's U.N. report , and the Organization of African Unity report .
All four say absolutely nothing about the shooting down of the Rwandan President 's plane .
That just goes to show the power of the intelligence services that can force people to be quiet . ”
Philpot continues :
“ The only partial exception is the seven year investigation conducted by the French anti-terrorist judge Jean - Louis Bruguière .
That investigation has implicated current Rwandan President Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front for having planned , ordered and carried out the April 6 assassination . ” [ 55 ]
Says ICTR lawyer Chris Black : “ President Mobutu ’s chief of intelligence , Honore Ngambo , in his book published in France a few months ago [ Western Crimes in Central Africa , 2005 ] relates the meeting between Habyarimana and Mobutu two days before Habyaramana was murdered .
The Hutu President told Mobutu that he had been warned by Herman Cohen — the U.S. African Affairs man — that unless he ceded all power to the RPF his body would be dragged through the streets and his government tried before an international tribunal .
Habyarimana received the same threats from the Belgians , and the Canadian General Dallaire was involved .
Habyarimana was informed by his agents in the RPF camp at Mulindi that his plane would be shot down .
He did n’t know the exact date . ” [ 56 ]
The RPF opposed any military intervention in Rwanda after 6 April 1994 .
The RPF knew the military situation of the Rwandan army ( morale and ammunition ) and it did not want any military intervention to snatch its victory from it .
The RPF ’s official sponsors in Washington , London and Brussels told whoever would listen that any international force would be met with RPF military resistance .
The RPF was the only force that had the capacity to stop the killing , but they did n’t .
ICTR lawyer Chris Black verifies that U.N. documents entered in the ICTR record establish that the Gendarmerie did all it could with the resources it had to restore calm , but could not , and that the FAR army could not both fight the RPF and restore calm among the civilians .
This following statement comes from an unnamed survivor who was in Kigali in April , 1994 , where he lost his entire family to the killings : some of his family were Hutus , some Tutsis , and he began by stating he does not support the ideologies that align themselves along ethnic fault lines .
The interview took place in Bukavu , DRC , in August 2005 :
“ Many Hutus lost family members on the border with Uganda after the RPA invaded in 1990 .
This is where Hutu hatred of Tutsis started .
The Tutsi continued to perpetrate crimes to weaken the government of Habyarimana even while the government was being forced to negotiate with the RPF .
Each Tutsi family had sent one or two boys to the RPF army in Uganda .
We knew these boys – they used to say , ‘ O.K. goodbye .
We are going to Uganda . ’ “
“ Hutus saw this .
The Tutsis [ RPF ] were pushing the hatred higher and higher every day .
Even Hutus knew that all Tutsis had to attend meetings at the end of the month to raise money for the RPF .
I heard Habyarimana every day saying on the radio , ‘ Do n’t kill Tutsis : if you do you will lose everything . ’
Even as the Arusha Peace Accords were going on [ 1993 ] the RPF were starting to kill the intellectuals , the Hutu leaders , in Rwanda . ”
“ They [ RPF ] were putting bombs in public places , in markets and gare routieres [ roundabouts ] , and in night clubs — I almost died in one night club attack .
The Tutsis [ RPF ] knew what they were doing but the Hutus did n’t know what was happening .
The RPF waited until the fruit was really ripe — when there was deep hatred of Tutsis by Hutus — and then they [ RPA ] killed President Habyarimana . ”
“ They killed Habyarimana because they knew he was the only one who could stop the Hutus from killing Tutsis .
That is why , every day , I say that : the genocide was not planned by Hutus , it was planned by Tutsis : it was planned by the RPF .
Even after the Interahamwe killed my wife , even after all the horrible things that have happened to me , I believe the Tutsis created the genocide .
And for me it was a war between brothers : the Hutus had an army and the Tutsis had an army and there was fighting at every level . ” [ 57 ]
Heartless Darkness
Notably , the source for the Hotel Rwanda Companion Book timeline chapter is the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook 2004 ( the previous chapter is filled with the standard deceptions , and it appears without attribution ) . [ 58 ]
It is not surprising then that the roles of the U.S. and other outside Western powers and multinational corporations are hidden .
The most egregious omissions revolve around the Democratic Republic of Congo : the ongoing destruction and depopulation of Congo receives remarkably little press coverage in contrast to the Darfur region of neighboring Sudan , despite the obvious evidence that the scale and nature of atrocities against innocent civilians in Congo has been far worse , over a longer period of time , and with profound but unnecessary human suffering .
After consolidating power in Rwanda in 1994 , and following on massive crimes against humanity there , the RPF shelled and dismantled refugee camps in eastern Congo ( then Zaire ) in the summer of 1996 , in further massive and egregious violations of international law and the Geneva Convention .
The new RPF government has never wavered in its efficacious crusade of calling attention to an ongoing genocide against the Tutsis — the Jews of Africa — who were “ abandoned by the United States and Europe ” to ostensibly suffer the fate of genocide , but this is an affront to the Jewish people and , in particular , to the Holocaust victims and survivors of World War II .
The pretext of ongoing ‘ genocide ’ against the Tutsis has been used by the RPF over and over to justify the most egregious and hostile violations of international law and human rights .
Continuing to implement what is now clearly a well - coordinated and premeditated plan , and with complete logistical and tactical military support from the Pentagon and its outsourced private military companies — including Halliburton , Ronco , and Military Professional Resources Incorporated — the RPF followed its Rwanda victory by invading the sovereign territory of Congo ( Zaire ) , its huge western neighbor . [ 59 ]
Drawing on its previous military alliance , training and rear bases in Uganda , the RPF allied with Yoweri Museveni and the Ugandan Peoples Defense Forces ( UPDF ) to march across the Congo , unseat Habyarimana ’s close friend , Congo ’s ( Zaire ’s ) President Mobutu Sese Seko , and conquer the vast , mineral rich Congo .
“ The international community has refused to bring effective pressure to bear on Rwanda to create conditions of security , ” wrote Rwanda scholar David Newbury , in 1996 . [ 60 ]
Marginalized groups like the Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda have repeatedly echoed this obvious truth .
“ The continuous prevalence of impunity has encouraged the leaders of the RPF / RPA to perpetrate crimes against humanity , war crimes and acts of genocide in Rwanda and DRC without fear of prosecution .
It has consolidated the power and the wealth of criminal elements within the RPF - led dictatorial regime . ” [ 61 ]
And so it continues today .
Paul Kagame and James Kabarebe and the Tutsi RPF - dominated government of Rwanda continue to destabilize the Great Lakes Region of Africa , with infiltration of terror cells throughout the neighboring Congo , just as they did in Rwanda ( 1985 - 1994 ) .
They are appeased or courted , the saintly victims of genocide , and they enjoy total impunity and all the benefits of an elite club .
Similarly , the Human Rights Watch press alert of July 1 , 2005 , for example , targeting the Congolese government , is a veiled defense of Rwandan - US interests in DRC : it is written by Alison Des Forges , from Kigali . [ 62 ]
Both the Hotel Rwanda film and companion book neatly encapsulate the entire mythology of genocide in Rwanda and the invented heroism of now president Paul Kagame and the Rwanda Patriotic Front ( RPF ) .
The true and deeper facts that receive little attention , if any at all , are : { 1 } the RPF ’s illegal invasion of Rwanda from Uganda in 1990 ; { 2} its record of war crimes committed from 1990 - 1994 ; { 3 } the RPF double assassination of the Hutu presidents of Burundi and Rwanda on April 6 , 1994 ; { 4 } the RPF ’s massive contre - genocide of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees in Congo ( Zaire ) , of refugees returning to Rwanda from Congo , and of Hutus in Rwanda itself ; { 5 } the RPF ’s repeated invasions and continuing looting and devastation of the Congo , with the involvement and sanction of RPF officials at the highest level , that continues today ; and { 6 } the collaborating roles of Western institutions , individuals and corporations , and the economic and political benefits that accrue to them , at the expense of Africa and her people .
What has motivated Paul Rusesabagina ?
It is interesting to note that Rusesabagina has been widely lauded and financially rewarded for his story , the rights to his story , and for his alignment with U.S. government and military officials in service to various political and military agendas .
In 2000 he was awarded the Immortal Chaplain ’s prize , and received the award with a handshake from U.S. Republican Senator Bob Dole . [ 63 ]
“ As for Paul Rusesabagina , ” wrote Rutigita Macumu , in Rwanda ’s The New Times newspaper , “ he will go down in the annals of history as a man who sold the soul of the Rwandan Genocide to amass medals , including , among others , the Amnesty International 's Enduring Spirit , the Immortal Chaplain Foundation 's Prize for Humanity , the Tigar Center 's Human Rights Award , the National Civil Rights Museum 's Freedom Award , and now the prestigious Presidential Model of Freedom Award from the sitting American president , George W. Bush . ” [ 64 ]
In 2004 , Paul Rusesabagina traveled with a Pentagon escort and his namesake actor Don Cheadle to Darfur , Sudan , to draw attention to the popularized , officially accredited ‘ genocide ’ occurring there . [ 65 ]
This author had a chance to interview Paul Rusesabagina in 2007 .
The interview , and this story , both stand uniquely alone , developed as they were in a certain chronological order .
( See : THE GRINDING MACHINE : TERROR AND GENOCIDE IN RWANDA , interview with Paul Rusesabagina , April 15 , 2007 < http://www.allthingspass.com/journalism.php?catid=47>).
Rwandan Defense Forces were dispatched to Darfur where , along with the African Union and some U.S. military , they serve as U.S. proxy warriors : these are troops responsible for some of the most egregious acts of genocide and crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda and Congo . [ 66 ]
Hotel Rwanda is merely the latest production in a protracted campaign of psychological warfare .
It is a dangerous work of agitation propaganda because it wets the wide and naive eyes and touches the open and caring hearts of Western viewers .
It is deceptive and when viewers depart the cinema with popcorn and chocolate stuck between their teeth they leave thinking they know something about what happened in Rwanda .
We as viewers enjoy the idea that we are being educated , when instead we are being indoctrinated , and the insidious effects of the indoctrination are unappreciated .
Hotel Rwanda exemplifies the careless , simplistic reductionism that is universally manifest in the West ’s representations of Africa .
Phil Taylor , former investigator for the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda ( ICTR ) says it aptly .
“ For anyone who followed closely the 1994 crisis in Rwanda the highly touted film Hotel Rwanda is merely propaganda statements interrupted by bouts of acting . ” [ 67 ]
The racism and segregation that played out in the Rwanda cataclysm of 1994 , where there were very different conditions and outcomes between whites and blacks , continues to be played out today .
The telling and re-telling of the Rwanda ‘ genocide ’ story by its very nature revolves around a system of institutionalized segregation .
Powerful whites in powerful ‘ gatekeeper ’ positions in the West hold a virtual monopoly over the information .
Alongside of them are the select voices of non-whites who validate the predominant discourse .
These ‘ experts ’ include Alison des Forges ; Roméo Dallaire ; Philip Gourevitch ; Victoria Brittain ; Samantha Power ; Mahmood Mamdani ; and many , many others .
“ They believe Alison des Forges because she is white and they do n’t believe me because I am black and I do n’t speak English so well , ” says Jean - Marie Higiro .
“ She is the expert , even though she was an observer and I was a participant . ”
We ca n’t intimately know the hardships of Paul Rusesabagina , or the trauma of Roméo Dallaire , or the sorrows of Jean - Marie Higiro , or the suffering of the other survivors of the cataclysm in Rwanda , and we must search our own souls on their behalf : the struggle of good versus evil reigns within us all .
Indeed , there is a certain arrogance behind this writing , because neither was I a participant in Rwanda .
But any hesitation I have in challenging the ‘ right and proper tale ’ is overwhelmed by the obscenity of the obvious injustice and the machinations of empire behind it .
If truth is the first casualty in war , then those of us who are lucky observers must endlessly work to resurrect it .
In Central Africa , today , truth mingles with the souls of the dead , forsaken amidst the unheard cries of some seven million — mostly innocent people — whose life on this earth ground to a gruesome , meaningless conclusion .

NOTES :
ST . LOUIS , Jan. 17 ( UPI ) -- New York Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo was hired Saturday as head coach of the St. Louis Rams , the team announced .
The 49 - year - old Spagnuolo , who agreed to a four - year contract , succeeds Jim Haslett , the interim coach who replaced the fired Scott Linehan early in the 2008 season .

Spagnuolo became the Giants ' defensive coordinator in 2007 .
He previously was with the Philadelphia Eagles for eight seasons .
" We considered some very qualified and outstanding candidates for this position but we kept coming back to Steve Spagnuolo , " Rams General Manager Billy Devaney said .
" Steve has been on some outstanding defensive staffs during his 10 seasons in the NFL . "
The Rams finished 2 - 14 in 2008 .
The Government 's Classification Board appears to have fallen victim to a prank from opponents of a proposed mandatory internet filter .
Satirical messages comparing the board 's actions to that of the Chinese Government appeared on the front page of the website for a few hours last night .
" This site contains information about the boards that have the right to CONTROL YOUR FREEDOMZ , " the message said .
The Board is responsible for classifying websites and video games , and its decisions are the basis for the Australian Communication and Media Authority 's ( ACMA ) blacklist of banned websites , the subject of recent controversy when it was purportedly leaked on the internet .
" The Classification Board has the right to not just classify content ( the name is an ELABORATE TRICK ) , but also the right to DECIDE WHAT IS AND ISNT [ sic ] APPROPRIATE and BAN CONTENT FROM THE PUBLIC , " the fake message went on .
" We are part of an ELABORATE DECEPTION from CHINA to CONTROL AND SHEEPIFY the NATION , to PROTECT THE CHILDREN .
All opposers must HATE CHILDREN . "
A spokeswoman for the board this morning said the body was aware of the incident , and was investigating .
She said the investigation would look into who was responsible , and how much of the board 's website was affected .
The board 's website has been inaccessible for some hours .
The attack appears to be linked to recent criticism of the Government 's proposed mandatory internet filter .
The board is responsible for rating websites which then make up the ACMA blacklist , containing websites that would be blocked if a filter was put in place .
Internet advocacy groups say a secret blacklist is an attack on democratic values , and the existence of a blacklist actually makes it easier for people to access the very content supposed to be blocked .
They say this was demonstrated recently with the leaking of what purported to be the blacklist , including links to thousands of websites .
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy last night defended the Government 's plans , saying the list has been in place for nine years , and it is based on the same criteria on which television , radio and book content is rated .
He says the internet filter - which is only in a trial phase - will not limit political content as many critics have said .
" If something is refused classification - if it promotes rape , promotes incest , or similar - it makes it onto the blacklist , " he said on ABC1's Q and A .
" The Government makes no apologies for that .
No political content will be blocked , that is not the intention and in fact the law would have to be changed in order for that to happen .
" It 's not going to happen , I can not be clearer on that . "
He also responded to questions about seemingly innocuous websites , like PG photographs by Bill Henson , a Queensland dentist and a boarding kennel , being placed on the blacklist .
He said the Henson website was a " technical error " by an ACMA official , and the other two were the result of Russian mafia infiltrating the websites ' servers and planting child pornography there .
Western Australian Greens Senator Scott Ludlum says the recent furore over internet filtering shows how difficult it is for the Government to control the internet with a crude filter .
" At the moment there 's still a temptation to treat the internet like any other medium , when it is not , " he said .
" It 's fundamentally different and I think that 's in a way why we 've always been in favour of an approach that says for child pornography and that sort of material , the solutions lie around law enforcement , education , allowing parents to set these boundaries in their own homes .
" For this type of material , law enforcement is the key . "
He says it is a concern that the presence of seemingly harmless sites on the list was only revealed when the list was published a week ago .
In search world we ’ve long noted the power Google holds for shaping the web .
We ’ve long lamented the way Google has failed to put that power to good use , compared to the way it has put that power to work .
Google is responsible for much of the character of today ’s web ( something Google ’s own CEO now refers to as a “ cesspool ” ) .
MFA sites obviously polluted the web ( “ MFA ” is “ made for AdSense ” , Google ’s advertising system .
An MFA site is useless except as a vehicle to serve ads ) .
Comment spam and forum spam are aimed directly at Google ’s reward system .
As Google became the only search engine , it shaped the character of the web , and is responsible for that impact .
By my view , Google is also capable of fixing many of the problems , by virtue of that same power .
But it does n’t bother .
And that ’s the problem .
Today we see evidence that 100 % positive , 5 star product reviews are worth $ 0.65 each .
As the story is currently being reported , some BizDev guy ’s name is associated with an offer to pay $ 0.65 for perfect major brand product reviews on Newegg and Amazon .
According to his instructions , you sign up and read the product description for the target product , and then write a review as if you owned the product and loved it .
You have to give it a full 5/5 rating , and sound real .
For this , you get $ 0.65 .
That ’s sixty five cents .
Of course the Google lovers will say this is not Google ’s doing , and Google ca n’t stop unethical people from gaming human reviews .
The rest of us will note that Google relies heavily on user reviews for things like Google Local .
Google assumes human reviews are worth more than nothing , and includes them into the merit calculations it uses to rank web sites .
If you ’ve ever seen a “ 10 box ” of Google local results for a plumber or other service provider , you will see that those with more / better reviews show up more frequently than those without reviews .
If everyone has one review , then those with zero reviews do n’t show at all .
Google has decided that reviews have value , and this incorporated them into the ranking and indexing rules that drive traffic on the web .
Obviously Google did n’t value them at sixty five cents , since a boost in Google local is worth far more than that .
I wonder , what value did Google assign ?
And is that value managed across markets ?
Is this yet another market Google is making , encouraging and requiring human reviews , valuing them secretly , and then trading in that market ?
If so , Google continues to encourage the web to become a cesspool .
During 2006
I watched known - to - be - less - reputable characters in one of my markets balatantly spam the local reviews in order to gain stars in Google local .
He was ahead of his time and stuck out “ like a sore thumb ” .
No one in his market had any reviews , while he had 5 glowing reviews all dated within a week or so of each other .
The fact that he was not a native English speaker helped them stand out , but Google still missed it .
His competitors cringed with disgust when they saw the results of a Google local search … they felt that guy was really really ugly sitting up there with 5 obviously ( to them ) fake reviews .
They felt it was bad for their industry in general , and bad for the marketplace .
They were so put off they refused to ask their customers for reviews .
They did n’t want to be like that guy .
As you can guess , that guy has been quite successful .
He was never after the top - tier clients on the Dignity Scale .
He was after money , which Google delivered via traffic .
And now that he has the money …
What ’s a fake review worth in your industry ?
Whether you like it or not , as long as Google is controlling the traffic flow , you will be required to either have a number of glowing , perfect reviews , or you wo n’t compete with those who do .
Especially since starting today , many more companies are aware that perfect reviews work and can be had for as low as $ 0.65 .
Be forewarned , though : with most scams , there are third parties riding the coat tails of the instigators of the initial scam , pitching a “ solution ” which also just happens to be really really good for them .
I consider OpenID one of these … watch as the OpenID promotors pepper the web with comments that OpenID is the solution to fake reviews .
It ’s not … and it represents a GREAT way for companies like Google to control even more of your access and perspective on the cesspool of the web .

There ’s plenty to laugh about over at QualityNonsense.com but you might especially like the bit on EBay ’s keyword stuffing .

( Charles Platt is a guest blogger )
As I begin my second week here as a guest blogger , I 'm going to risk venturing into a couple of contentious political areas .
My aim is not to provoke dissent ; I simply feel that some stories are not being told .
The picture above is of me , finishing my shift at the world 's largest retailer .
How did I move from being a senior writer at Wired magazine to an entry - level position in a company that is reviled by almost all living journalists ?
It started when I read Nickel and Dimed , in which Atlantic contributor Barbara Ehrenreich denounces the exploitation of minimum - wage workers in America .
Somehow her book did n't ring true to me , and I wondered to what extent a preconceived agenda might have biased her reporting .
Hence my application for a job at the nearest Wal - Mart .
Getting in was not easy , as more than 100 applicants were competing for fewer than 10 job openings .
Still , I made it through a very clever screening quiz , then through a series of three interviews , followed by two days of training .
I felt ambivalent about taking advantage of the company 's resources in this way , but I was certainly willing to do my part by working hard at the store , at least for a limited period .
The job was as dull as I expected , but I was stunned to discover how benign the workplace turned out to be .
My supervisor was friendly , decent , and treated me as an equal .
Wal - Mart allowed a liberal dress code .
The company explained precisely what it expected from its employees , and adhered to this policy in every detail .
I was unfailingly reminded to take paid rest breaks , and was also encouraged to take fully paid time , whenever I felt like it , to study topics such as job safety and customer relations via a series of well - produced interactive courses on computers in a room at the back of the store .
Each successfully completed course added an increment to my hourly wage , a policy which Barbara Ehrenreich somehow forgot to mention in her book .
My standard equipment included a handheld bar - code scanner which revealed the in - store stock and nearest warehouse stock of every item on the shelves , and its profit margin .
At the branch where I worked , all the lowest - level employees were allowed this information and were encouraged to make individual decisions about inventory .
One of the secrets to Wal - Mart 's success is that it delegates many judgment calls to the sales - floor level , where employees know first - hand what sells , what does n't , and ( most important ) what customers are asking for .
Several of my co-workers had relocated from other areas , where they had worked at other Wal - Marts .
They wanted more of the same .
Everyone agreed that Wal - Mart was preferable to the local Target , where the hourly pay was lower and workers were said to be treated with less respect ( an opinion which I was unable to verify ) .
Most of all , my coworkers wanted to avoid those “ mom- and - pop ” stores beloved by social commentators where , I was told , employees had to deal with quixotic management policies , while lacking the opportunities for promotion that exist in a large corporation .
Of course , I was not well paid , but Wal - Mart is hardly unique in paying a low hourly rate to entry - level retail staff .
The answer to this problem seems elusive to Barbara Ehrenreich , yet is obvious to any teenager who enrolls in a vocational institute .
In a labor market , employees are valued partly according to their abilities .
To earn a higher hourly rate , you need to acquire some relevant skills .
As for all those Wal - Mart horror stories — when I went home and checked the web sites that attack the company , I found that many of them are subsidized with union money .
walmartwatch.com , for instance , is partnered with the Service Employees International Union ; wakeupwalmart.com is copyright by United Food and Commercial Workers International Union .
Why are unions so obsessed with Wal - Mart ?
I 'm guessing that if the more - than - a- million Wal - Mart employees could be unionized , they would be compelled to contribute at least half a billion dollars per year in union dues .
Subsequently I considered writing about my brief experience , but a book defending a company that has been demonized does not have a large potential audience , and the writer tends to be dismissed as either hopelessly naive or bribed by corporate America .
Similar factors result in someone such as Adam Shepard remaining relatively obscure .
If you have n't heard of Adam Shepard , this illustrates my point .
His remarkable book Scratch Beginnings , now being promoted through www.scratchbeginnings.com, describes how he went through an experience far more gruelling than my brief flirtation with low - paying work .
He placed himself in a homeless shelter with $ 25 in his pocket , found a job as a day laborer , then worked for a moving company , and after 10 months had a pickup truck , an apartment , and $ 2,500 in savings .
His conclusion : People can still make it in the United States if they are willing to live carefully on a budget and work hard .
Somehow that kind of news is never as popular as denunciations of the free market written by professional handwringers such as Barbara Ehrenreich .
Mr Chavez has accused rice producers of sidestepping quotas
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has ordered the expropriation of a rice mill , amid a battle with food companies over price regulation .
Mr Chavez said the mill , owned by a subsidiary of US food giant Cargill , was not distributing rice at government - set prices .
He also threatened to nationalise the country 's largest food processor and private company , Polar .
Venezuela has already set quotas and prices for 12 basic foods .
Under the measure , 80 % of all rice produced must be basic white rice .
The measure also includes 95 % of all cooking oil , coffee and sugar .
Producers of items such as powdered milk , cheese and tomato sauce are also affected .
' Intolerable '
Last week President Chavez ordered troops to rice processing plants after accusing producers of sidestepping the law on controlled prices by producing a higher grade of rice .
Cargill , which operates one rice - processing plant in Venezuela , said the mill does not produce the plain rice that is under regulation .
" Prepare the decree , we are going to expropriate Cargill .
We are not going to tolerate this , " Mr Chavez said .
Mr Chavez is attempting to reduce the cost of the basic shopping basket of ordinary Venezuelans at a time of soaring inflation , says the BBC's Will Grant in Caracas .
But business leaders and food producers are furious at what they see as a further attack on their ability to turn a profit , our correspondent says .
The move against Cargill is unlikely to be viewed favourably in Washington either , which angered Venezuela last month by criticising its human rights record , our correspondent adds .

A policeman has been murdered in Northern Ireland just 48 hours after two soldiers were shot by the Real IRA in Antrim .
The shooting happened on Monday night at Lismore Manor , Craigavon , County Armagh , at about 2145 GMT , police said .
Police were responding to a call for help from a distressed woman .
Two police vehicles went to the scene .
As officers got out , shots were fired , one man was hit in the head and died later .
He was married with children .
Chief Constable Sir Hugh
Orde called it a " sad day " for Northern Ireland 's force and said the gunmen were " criminal psychopaths " .
" It reminds us that a small group of people determined to wreck what is a huge political progress are becoming more dangerous , " he said .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned the murderers and insisted there would be " no return to the old days " in Northern Ireland .

" These are murderers who are trying to distort , disrupt and destroy a political process that is working for the people of Northern Ireland , " he said .
Mr Brown , who travelled to Northern Ireland on Monday to visit the scene of the two soldiers ' murders in Antrim , said gunmen would " never be allowed to undermine the political process " .
This is the first murder of a police officer in NI since 1998 .
Constable Frank O'Reilly was killed by a loyalist blast bomb during disturbances linked to the Drumcree dispute in 1998 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
These events show that the peace process is still under threat E Breen , Chelmsford
The last police officers murdered by republicans , RUC constables Roland John Graham and David Andrew Johnston , were shot dead by the IRA in Lurgan , County Armagh in June 1997 .
The man who died last night was the first PSNI officer to have been murdered by paramilitaries since the force was formed in 2001 .
Dissident republicans tried to kill two PSNI officers in shootings in Derry and Dungannon in November 2007 .
They have also been linked to a booby trap bomb which exploded under a police officer 's car in Spamount , County Tyrone in May 2008 .

Politicians from all parties condemned Monday 's killing , which Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward insisted would not damage the peace process .
The chief constable said it was too early to identify the killers .
" We are used to being attacked , but we will not step back , " Sir Hugh said .
" This will not put off me or my officers delivering the service we do to the communities we are paid to protect . "
Asked if the killing was linked to the soldiers ' shooting at the weekend , Sir Hugh said : " I think you are giving ( the attackers ) credit they ill deserve .

This week we feature one of those magical themes that nobody should have ever thought of , but thank god they did .
It 's time , ladies and gentleman , to look at pictures of BIRDS WITH HUMAN ARMS AND HANDS .
The Something Awful Forum Goons created tons of them , and each one is a triumph of both the human and avian spirit .
Paradox86 done it now .

Eggs back on the menu :
They 're not heart attackers , in fact they can help you diet , say experts
Eating eggs does not lead to high blood cholesterol , scientists said today
It 's perfectly safe to go to work on an egg , experts declared last night after a study exploded the enduring myth that they can cause heart attacks .
In fact , two eggs a day as part of a balanced diet can even help you lose weight , they found .
The British Heart Foundation used to recommend that people should limit their egg consumption to no more than three a week because they contain cholesterol , known to raise the risk of heart attack .
It dropped this guidance in 2005 after studies showed very little of the cholesterol in eggs makes its way to the blood .
But a poll carried out by the British Egg Information Service found that 45 per cent of people did not know the three - a- week guidance had been junked and still believed they should stick to these limits .
Now , in a paper written for the British Nutrition Foundation , experts set out the definitive evidence showing there is no link between egg consumption and an increased risk of heart disease .
Dr Juliet Gray , a public health nutritionist funded by the egg industry , and Bruce Griffin , professor of nutritional metabolism from the University of Surrey , found that factors such as smoking , being overweight and a lack of physical activity can influence blood fat and cholesterol levels and heart disease risk .
The only people advised against eating too many eggs are those with a condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia .
Victoria Taylor , senior dietician - at the British Heart Foundation , said : ' We recommend that eggs can be eaten as part of a balanced diet .
' There is cholesterol present in eggs but this does not usually make a great contribution to your level of blood cholesterol .
' If you need to reduce your cholesterol level it is more important that you cut down on the amount of saturated fat from foods like fatty meat , full fat dairy products and cakes , biscuits and pastries . '
WARDENSVILLE , West Virginia ( CNN ) --
After more than 40 years and $ 1.5 billion , West Virginia 's massive " Corridor H " project is getting another boost from the Obama administration 's economic stimulus package , despite questions over whether the project will ever be completed .
Critics of the uncompleted , lightly traveled " Corridor H " say its cost is too high .
The plan is to build a 100 - mile , four - lane highway through the Appalachian Mountains , connecting West Virginia to the eastern seaboard .
It has been receiving federal money for decades , largely due to Sen.
Robert Byrd , the Democrat who has represented West Virginia in the Senate since 1958 .
Byrd has steered hundreds of millions of dollars to the project , including a $ 9.5 million earmark in the $ 410 billion spending bill signed by the president Wednesday .
Another $ 21 million will come from the nearly $ 800 billion economic stimulus bill Obama signed into law in February .
Corridor H has been billed as a way to promote economic development in the impoverished state .
But most of it remains on the drawing board .
It 's not projected to be complete until 2035 -- and neighboring Virginia says it has no plans to add on to the eastern end of the highway , meaning the road will end in West Virginia , 10 miles from the state line .
So why keep building it ?
Paul Turman , West Virginia 's assistant transportation secretary , said the $ 21 million in stimulus money will connect two unfinished stretches of the superhighway at the midpoint of the route .
The State Division of Highways said the money will create 60 jobs lasting between 18 and 24 months , which works out to $ 175,000 in taxpayer dollars a year for each job created .
West Virginia also says Corridor H would be an ideal evacuation route for Washington , about 100 miles away , in case of an emergency .
" If something happens in the D.C. area , they can get out , " Turman said .
But Virginia 's refusal to connect to Corridor H means anyone fleeing would have to negotiate a 20 - mile stretch of narrow , winding county road on the way west .
Critics say the cost is too high for a lightly traveled road , and the state keeps shifting its reasons for continuing to fund it .
" They went through a lot of contortions to try to explain what the need was , " said Hugh Rogers , a conservationist who lives at the end of the first stretch of Corridor H. " Traffic is not the need . "
At the ice - cream shop in Wardensville , where Corridor H now abruptly ends , residents say the big road does make it easier to drive to the high school , but it has n't been a boon to business .
" It does n't seem like it , no , " waitress Jeanette Strawderman said .
Nevertheless , the project is expected to continue for another 26 years -- and another projected $ 1.5 billion .
" I think any time we get some money from the federal government , Corridor H manages to get a little piece of it , " Rogers said .
" They have to show that the project is alive .
We ca n't let the people who have faith in it down . "

McLaren 's Martin Whitmarsh has openly admitted the MP4 - 24 is not as competitive as the team was hoping it would be at this point of the pre-season .
The team has failed to be close to the top of the timesheets in testing , with both Lewis Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen failing to make an impression , leading to suggestions that the team had problems with the car .
On Friday , Whitmarsh confirmed that was the case , admitting the team has found a performance shortfall that it is working hard to rectify .
" Initial testing of MP4 - 24 , which first ran with an interim aero package , went in accordance with our early developmental expectations , " said Whitmarsh .
" This week the car has run in Barcelona with an updated aero package , as we had always planned it would , and a performance shortfall has been identified that we are now working hard to resolve . "
When asked if the car was fast enough at the moment , he added : " Not at the moment - and certainly not by our team 's extremely high standards .
" But Lewis is the reigning world champion , and he became world champion in one of our cars .
" So anything less than success at that level is naturally regarded as unsatisfactory by us , by our partners , by the media and by the fans .
Having said that , McLaren has started 648 grands prix .
We have won 162 of them and have recorded 431 podium finishes .
" We are proud of our record and have faith in our engineers ' ability to work hard to get MP4 - 24 into a position to add to that record .
They are already engaged in doing exactly that . "
Mercedes - Benz motorsport boss Norbert Haug said the problems will need time before they are solved .
" We are definitely not where we want to be .
We will continue our test programme next week at Jerez for another four days .
But it will take time to improve , " Haug said .
Whitmarsh , however , said the team will be working flat out to rectify the situation and he is convinced the problems are fixable .
" It is a combination of factors , " said Whitmarsh of the car 's problems .
" Our Mercedes - Benz engine is strong - we saw that last year - so MP4 - 24's performance shortfall is clearly chassis - centric .
" Inevitably , in 21st - century Formula 1 , it is a car 's aero aspect that confers the greatest pluses and minuses to its overall performance package , and that would appear to be the case with MP4 - 24 .
But Formula 1 engineers can do great things when the pressure is on .
" Speaking to them today , I was struck by their resolute determination to address MP4 - 24 's issues in record time .
In fact , it is that kind of resolute determination , coupled with expertise and experience of ultra-high technology and the ability to work accurately and quickly under pressure , that makes Formula 1 the great sport and the tremendous engineering challenge it is . "
He added : " Many times in Formula 1 history have successful teams started off with a car that was not working as well as they had hoped it would , and many times have those successful teams engineered their way back to the front of the grid in impressively short order .
That is what we aim to do .
In fact , that is what we are already doing . "
RECENTLY , John Bolton , United Nations ambassador under George W. Bush , wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal in which he argued that any outreach to Iran would be useless , and that regime change was the only answer - a neo-conservative voice from the grave of failed policies and bad ideas .
As they used to say in fifth grade : " You and whose army ? "
The US military is stretched a bit thin to contemplate invading Iran , and all the covert actions in America 's black - ops bag could n't unseat the regime .
This is n't 1953 when Kermit Roosevelt and the CIA could oust Iran 's leader and bring back the shah .
A protégé of former vice president Dick Cheney , Bolton was undersecretary of state for arms control and proliferation when the tentative Iranian offer to make a deal on all that divided us was rejected in the we - don't - talk - to - evil days - one of the many missed opportunities to strike a deal with Iran .
In the other corner are some thoughtful diplomats who tried to keep open some back channels to Iran through the long night of the Bush - Cheney administration .
Among them are Frank Wisner , a former ambassador to Egypt and India ; Tom Pickering , former ambassador to Israel , Jordan and Russia ; and William Luers , former ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Venezuela .
They argue that , although we can make it hot for the Iranians , we can not impose our will .
To attack them would be a folly that could have untold negative consequences throughout the region and beyond .
Instead we should engage Iran on many levels at once .
Iran has no interest in seeing the return of the Taliban to Afghanistan .
Nor does Iran have a long - term interest in an unstable Iraq , especially now that President Obama is winding down the war .
Pickering and Luers , in a recent article in the New York Review of Books , advocate building an international nuclear power facility on Iranian soil , which might be acceptable to Iran .
But their main point , which Wisner echoed in recent testimony before Congress , is that only by finding mutual points of shared interest , by showing respect for Iran as a civilization with centuries of tradition , and by recognizing that it has legitimate security interests as a regional power , can we get anywhere .
Although some maintain that Iran is riding high and that we have little leverage , Wisner points out that , from Iran 's point of view , it has great vulnerabilities .
There are American armies on its eastern and western frontiers .
It faces both covert action and sanctions on its economy , which is in decline because of mismanagement and a drop in oil prices .
From Iran 's point of view it is America 's fist that is clenched .
Wisner and the Pickering team differ on the timing of an American overture .
Both Pickering and Luers believe that there is no point making a major initiative until Iran 's presidential elections are over - probably not until midsummer .
Wisner thinks we should begin now , making it clear that it is up to Iran whom it chooses .
But in the meantime we can tone down our rhetoric against Iran , open up an interest section in Tehran , which former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice wanted to do , facilitate exchanges , and reaffirm the Algiers Accord of 1981 in which we agreed not to meddle in Iran 's internal affairs .
We could also respond to the slow - down of Iran 's nuclear activity since last fall and treat it as a gesture of good will to build on even if we are not sure what it means .
Nobody doubts that it is going to take a great deal of patience and time to overcome 30 years of hostility .
Previous attempts to open up a dialogue have not fared well .
At first , Iran 's fragmented leadership leaders will have trouble reacting to advances from the " Great Satan . "
And as Hillary Rodham Clinton found out on her visit to the region , Israelis and Arabs are scared to death of Iran 's intentions .
But inviting Iran to talk about mutual concerns in Afghanistan , not just in Iraq , as the Obama administration did last week , could signal a fresh start .
We never could prevent Iran from having the knowledge of how to build a bomb , but we might , still , if we address Iran 's security concerns , be able to convince Tehran that completing one is not in Iran 's interest .

The administration is also preparing to require that derivatives like credit default swaps , a type of insurance against loan defaults that were at the center of the financial meltdown last year , be traded through a central clearinghouse and possibly on one or more exchanges .
That would make it significantly easier for regulators to supervise their use .
Officials said that the proposals were aimed at the core regulatory problems and gaps that have been highlighted by the market crisis .
They include lax government oversight of financial institutions and lenders , poor risk management efforts by banks and other financial companies , the creation of exotic financial instruments that were not adequately supported by their issuing companies , and risky and ill - considered borrowing habits of many homeowners whose homes are now worth significantly less than their mortgages .
“ I believe that our regulatory system failed to adapt to the emergence of new risks , ” Mr. Geithner said in a written response to questions that was made public on Friday by Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan .
“ The current financial crisis has exposed a number of serious deficiencies in our federal regulatory system . ”

The regulatory changes are a major piece of a broader package being prepared by the new administration to address the market crisis .
Another piece to be issued soon will provide the strategy for how the government will go about repairing the declining banking industry .
Congress recently approved the second $ 350 billion in spending from the Troubled Assets Relief Program .
The White House has come under increasing political and market pressure to disclose how it intends to manage the program , and there is nervous expectation on Capitol Hill that the administration will need to spend more than $ 350 billion .
That plan is expected to focus on reducing foreclosures , revising the bank bailout program , and buying or issuing guarantees for the rapidly deteriorating assets that have been discouraging more private investment in the banks .
Senior aides have vowed to move quickly on the administration ’s financial regulatory agenda .
The Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act , approved last fall , requires the White House to make regulatory recommendations to Congress by April 30 , although the administration is preparing to make legislative and regulatory proposals sooner .

The Second Great Depression seems to have now spread from Ukraine , and arrived in Hungary .
Hungarian industrial production fell the most in December since at least 1991 as a recession in western Europe cut export demand and dragged the economy into its worst decline in 15 years .
Production dropped 23.3 percent from a year earlier , the seventh consecutive monthly decline , after falling 9.9 percent in November , the Budapest - based statistics office said , based on preliminary data .
Output fell 14.6 percent month on month .
And it only looks set to get worse , since Hungary ’s manufacturing purchasing manager index ( PMI ) fell to a all - time low of 38.6 in January , down from 40.8 in December .
Any PMI index figure above 50 indicates expansion while a figure below 50 shows contraction in economic activity .
The index had n’t been below the critical 50 mark for more than three years before it dropped below ( to 42.6 ) in October last year .
GÃ¡bor Ambrus , economist at 4 Cast , in London , estimates that ( in part as a result of the gas crisis ) output could drop by another 14.6 % between December and January , which will give another huge drop in the year on year number .

USA TODAY reached out to tax attorneys and legal experts to get their reaction to the New York Times report on Trump 's taxes .
Here 's what they said .
From Afghanistan and Iraq to military procurement reform , McCain tells POLITICO he is already working with Obama / | John Shinkle / POLITICO McCain : ' I do n't want him to fail '
After a losing presidential campaign in 2000 , John McCain came back to the Senate and established himself as a force no White House could ignore .
Eight years later , he ’s home from defeat again , facing a very different landscape dominated by President Barack Obama and the collapsing American economy .
From Afghanistan and Iraq to military procurement reform , McCain tells POLITICO he is already working with Obama .
Last week alone , he had breakfast with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , appeared with the president at a White House press event and took a phone call from Vice President Joe Biden soliciting McCain ’s input on how to crack down on pork barrel spending .

“ These are terrible , perilous times , so I will seek ways to work with the president of the United States , ” McCain says in an interview .
“ I do n’t want him to fail in his mission of restoring our economy . ”
But there ’s the rub :
On the central issue of the economy , the two men are so far apart it is difficult to see them collaborating effectively .
Until they are , it ’s harder for McCain to be the swing vote he once was — operating against a president not of his own party .
McCain is n’t immune to calls from prominent figures whom he admires , like Warren Buffett , who has likened the economic crisis to Pearl Harbor .
“ I think that the Republicans have an obligation to recognize this as an economic war and realize you need one leader , ” Buffett told CNBC Monday .
To a remarkable degree for a man now 72 , McCain has revamped his legislative profile : dropping the Commerce Committee he once chaired and adding three others to gain a foothold on health care and energy policy — two Obama priorities .
But on the economy , the Arizona Republican was his party ’s point man last month in opposing Obama ’s economic recovery plan .
He has been scathing since in debate over a $ 409.6 billion omnibus spending bill before the Senate and is dismissive of the president ’s new budget for next year as “ certainly not something I can support . ”
Even on areas of common ground , there are tensions .
Obama ’s 2010 budget uses a cap - and - trade regime both to address climate change and to raise $ 645 billion in revenues .
“ It ’s been very harmful to the whole issue of cap - and - trade , ” McCain says .
“ I never looked at cap - and - trade as a way to increase revenues .
...
Never did I envision it would be a vehicle for raising $ 650 billion , which would just be a tax increase on the American people . ”
On the central issue of stabilizing the nation ’s faltering banks , McCain again offers little help for Obama .
When running for president , the two men voted together for the Treasury ’s $ 700 billion financial markets rescue last fall .
But when both former President George W. Bush and Obama asked for the release of the second half of the money in January , McCain voted no , even as his more conservative colleague , Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) supported the new president .
“ We ’re pouring billions and billions of dollars into ( banks ) with not only no improvement , but their stocks continue to plummet , ” McCain says .
“ I think we have been pursuing the wrong strategy . ”
“ There is no clear message , ” he says of Obama ’s Treasury .
“ They ’re just sort of lurching from one crisis to another , and that ’s the perception the American people have . ”
Many Republicans — and Wall Street — have been pounding Obama to come forth with a more specific commitment of resources to help the banks .
But Treasury can’t afford to ask Congress for more money without more confidence in having the votes .
McCain could be a tremendous asset then for the president , but he shows little willingness thus far to play this role .
“ Only under circumstances which are vastly different from what they are doing now , ” he says .
“ They would have to present a blueprint that not only convinces me but frankly that convinces the Warren Buffetts and the Jack Welches ... people we would look up to who are experts who would say this plan will work .
We do n’t hear that . ”
“ Clearly , their policies are evolving , ” McCain says of Treasury .
“ I was supportive of their housing proposal .
I did n’t think it went far enough , but I was supportive of that . ”
“ It ’s the housing crisis that started this conflagration , and it will be the stabilization of home values that stops it . ”
The past week ’s floor debate on the omnibus spending bill illustrates these tensions .
Filling 1,132 pages , the giant package is really nine bills in one , covering more than a dozen Cabinet - level departments and agencies for the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 .
The FBI , Securities and Exchange Commission and Internal Revenue Service are among those included — all now living under a stopgap spending bill due to expire Wednesday night .
Senate Democrats hope to send the bill to the White House before then ; given the impact on government operations , the president ’s advisers have said he will sign the measure into law .
But McCain continued Monday to hammer Obama on the floor , calling on him to veto the measure because of costly spending earmarks he had promised to do away with as a candidate last year .
“ We both campaigned on change .
That was the president ’s promise , ” McCain said in his interview with POLITICO .
“ Now they ’re saying this is last year ’s business . ”
The situation is reminiscent of another $ 397.4 billion omnibus bill in January and February of 2003 .
The budget process had collapsed the prior year , and after consolidating their power in the 2002 elections , Republicans crafted the bill quickly and sent it to then - President Bush , who also wanted the issue quickly resolved , since he was about to take the U.S. into war with Iraq .
Data compiled by Citizens Against Government Waste indicate that the level of earmarks in the 2003 omnibus was substantially higher than it is today .
But McCain voted for the earlier package , and Senate Democrats made no attempt to block the bill , even though it cut spending for their priorities .
Asked if there was a parallel to today , McCain rejected any suggestion that he had cut one president slack and not the other .
“ There are no similar circumstances to the circumstances we are facing now since the Great Depression , ” he said .
“ I strongly disagree that you can compare 2003 and 2009 in any way . ”
No one questions McCain ’s career of voting against earmarks , however he voted in 2003 .
But what angers him most is not the cost but the fear of corruption .
“ I see it lurching completely out of control .
I continue to see it breeding corruption , ” he says .
“ Yes , I ’m angry .
If someone does n’t appreciate that anger or think there ’s something wrong with it , I respect their opinion .
But it makes me angry , because I know how hard people work to pay their taxes , and this is corruption . ”
He spoke to Obama about the issue last week when at the White House but is still waiting for Biden to follow up on his call .
“ I said I ’ll be available any time , any place of your choosing , ” McCain said .
“ I have n’t heard from him since . ”
“ Loyal opposition in my mind means loyal , but it also means opposition where you have fundamental philosophical disagreements , ” he says .
“ We are at a crucial time in America ’s history , the question of whether our economy will survive — I think there ’s a lot of common ground driven by this overwhelming issue of America ’s economy , which motivates me to work with the president and seek out ways that I can work with the president .
Not to have them seek me out , but I seek them out and try . ”

Zero buttons .
That 's as minimalist as it gets .
Removing all buttons — or to clarify , moving them to the headset — shrinks down the size of the new iPod Shuffle dramatically , but it also creates control problems when running , snowboarding or doing anything other than sitting .

Design
This new iPod shuffle is about half the volume of the previous iPod shuffle .
HALF .
By moving all the controls from the face onto the headphone cable , Apple was able to reduce the width and thickness to almost 50 % , even if the length grew slightly .
This was n't totally sensible :
Although the headphones do offer a comprehensive control scheme , the button position on the headphone cord becomes really difficult to use unless you 're sitting still .
It also limits your choice of headphones to the ones Apple gives you , or new shuffle - specific ones made by other manufacturers .
Advertisement
But there 's one point where this shuffle beats the hell out of the previous shuffle , and that 's the audio feedback interface .
Apple calls this UI , which speaks to you , VoiceOver .
It 's a set of text - to - speech files transparently associated to each track on your iPod that will speak the title and artist of your current song .
Hold the button down long enough , and the voice will cycle through all your playlists , one by one , reading the names .
Hit it again to jump directly to that playlist .
Advertisement
The player itself is also fine , even if the blank , monolithic face takes a while to get used to ( and stop reaching for when you want to change tracks ) .
Yes , it only comes in black and silver , instead of the whimsical shuffle / nano palette we 're used to .
Its front and back are made of aluminum .
And just like the nano ( and the previous generation shuffle ) , the edges are a little too sharp .
The clip is made out of stainless steel , like the back of the iPod touch and older generation nanos , so it attracts fingerprints and gets scratched up incredibly easily .
The front , luckily , does not have this problem .

The package comes with headphones and a three - inch USB connector .
Apple 's tendency to remove stuff from the iPod package continues with the removal of the free dock ; which is a shame , since you 'll instead be leaving this strewn about your desk , and because it 's so damn tiny , you 'll have probably have a hard time finding it again .

Syncing and Playback
The entire iTunes sync screen is improved .
There 's now support for podcasts and playlist syncing .
Yeah , you do n't have to use autofill or manually drag tracks and playlists over one by one , because you can now jump between playlists using the VoiceOver feedback system .
These voices , which are generated and synced on the fly when you choose playlists , sound pretty great , assuming you have Mac OS X Leopard .
Those who do will get to take advantage of " Alex " , the newer text - to - speech voice shipped in the OS .
If you 're on Windows , or if you ever want to use the 13 languages other than English , you 'll default to the VoiceOverKit downloadable pack that comes with iTunes 8.1 .
Even the supposedly lousier TTS agent works decently enough , because these are your songs and you should be able to at least guesstimate what artist / track it is .
But Alex prounounces stuff like " Yeah Yeah Yeahs " and " Jamiroquai " correctly , whereas the other one ( a lady 's voice ) does n't .
Advertisement
Voice data is fairly small , with 400 MB worth of songs only taking up about 20 MB of voice track data .
That 's going to be about 175MB of voice data if you fill up all 3.5 GB of usable space .
Advertisement
I tested actual Chinese and Japanese track names and artist names and they all came out sounding correct , if a bit robotic .
You can override language selections by song or globally if you want all your music to be read back to you in the English voice — for example , if you have a bunch of classical music labeled in Italian .
But if you have a mix and match song , with a Japanese title and an English artist name , the iPod will pronounce everything using the Japanese voice , including the English portion .
Which is funny if you 're an ass ( like me ) that gets a chuckle from non-native English speaker accents .
The 255 - character limit to song and artist fields still applies , so you can't shove lyrics or eBooks in there and expect your iPod to read them back to you .
And blank data in both fields results in complete silence ; it does n't say " untitled track " unless the track name is actually " untitled track . "

It does say other things , however , including its battery status , if you flick the hold switch off and on again .
This chart displays the possible blinks and audible alerts .

As for the shuffle 's sound quality , since the shuffle only works with the included headphones and not any other regular set of headphones , we ran a couple playback tests as best we could .
The frequency response , using a specially - encoded frequency sweep MP3 , was decent but not phenomenal .
The start of the sweep was at 16Hz , and we could n't hear anything until half a second later when it got above 50 Hz .
It definitely peaked well under 20 KHz ( probably close to 16 KHzish ) , but some of that could be due to my own high frequency hearing loss .
And , because these headphones are quite lousy .
When I compared frequency response to the old shuffle and to the nano with the same earphones , they were all about equal .

Max volume definitely was louder on this shuffle than the 2G version .
It was n't quite as loud as the latest iPod nano , but it was damn close .
Again , since we could only use the default headphones to test , there was n't any real difference in audio quality , even with high - quality 320 kbps MP3s .
We 're also going to check whether or not the 10 - hour battery life claim is accurate , but Apple themselves claim that it 's down from 12 hours in the previous generation .

Usage
Because the shuffle 's now only half as wide as the old one , the clip is only about half as strong .
There 's less surface area , and it's no longer jagged — it 's just two bits of metal on top of each other .
There 's still quite a bit of strength in it , but you 'll be able to yank it off from your jeans using just the headphone cable , so it could mean trouble .

Since one of the major uses of the shuffle is for exercise , we had to take it on a 30 - minute run , testing usability in active conditions .
Although the clip is fine , the controls are pretty crappy .
The stock headphones suck because the controls are up on the right hand cord , up near the ear .
You pause , forward , rewind and seek by hitting the middle button in various ways .
This is fine when you 're sitting , but when you 're running , it 's really hard to hold your arm still up in that awkward position to change tracks .
And when you 're really tired , your arms start flailing and it's very , very difficult to not yank the earbud out of your ear when you 're changing songs .
Advertisement
Here 's the solution .
Apple should move the controls down to where the two earbud cords split .
It 's much more convenient down there , plus lefties would n't have to suck it up and use their right hand .
This major problem might get fixed by one of the major headphone manufacturers releasing their own compatible pairs .
I 'd pay $ 100 for a good pair that does n't have the controls placed in a lousy place , or maybe even has larger controls on the cable .

I do n't have a pair of snowboarding gloves , but I do have a pair of regular gloves , and when using the shuffle with them on , it 's hard to feel where the groove of the play / pause button stops and the volume +/- buttons start .
It would be much worse for even thicker gloves that offer zero tactile feedback .
But on the bright side , the body itself is at least as water - resistant as the old shuffle .
Probably even more so , since there are fewer cracks and openings for water to leak into .

So where 's this all headed ?
If Apple was n't so absolutely married to the fact that physical controls need to be in a trademark click - wheel shape , they could have easily spread out the five play / next / prev/vol .
up / vol .
down buttons along the smooth face of the shuffle .
But they did n't .
Advertisement
There 's also a limit to how much smaller the shuffle can go .
I would n't expect such a dramatic decrease next time around .
In fact , I predict a re-emergence of the wheel , so that the entire player is thinner , but squarish with only the wheel on the front .
After all , the previous generation 's wheel was n't even a real wheel anyway because you could n't actually scroll with it by thumbing around in a circle .
Apple seems to enjoy alternating between different design shapes in their iPod nano ( 2G nano was thin , 3G nano was fat , 4G nano was thin ) line , so it 's not out of the realm of possibility that they 're going to do this with the shuffle as well .
If you need something like this for exercise , or if you just hate the fact that there are no buttons on this one , buy the last - gen shuffle before they 're all gone , or wait till next year when Apple changes its mind .
To tell the truth , this new shuffle is just okay .
We do n't know what kind of a statement they were trying to make with it , but suffice it to say , the message was n't received .

A student research project funded by the EPA is looking in the most unlikely places for triggers to diseases like asthma : furniture cushions .
[ social_buttons ]
Jon McKinney , a junior at Missouri University of Science and Technology , is helping to develop the science of building forensics by identifying the chemical fingerprints of foam components present in common furniture items .
He hopes to help inform epidemiologists in their search for the sources of indoor environmental pollution that contribute to asthma and other disorders .
“ You can choose what water you drink .
You can choose what you eat .
But you ca n’t choose what air you breathe .
This work combines nature , ecology and chemistry – all the things I like . ” – McKinney
Dr. Glenn Morrison , associate professor of environmental engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology , is working with McKinney to sample household items such as furniture , concrete , and drywall to further the knowledge - base of environmental engineering .
“ Our goal is to identify what ’s happened inside a home based on the ‘ unique fingerprints ’ of the chemicals we find . ” – McKinney
If the pair is successful , their techniques will make it simpler to reliably identify the chemical causes for many diseases linked to indoor air pollution .
Because of the recent push for energy efficiency through ‘ sealing the envelope ’ of homes , indoor ventilation has been reduced , which contributes to the buildup of possibly toxic substances inside the living space .
Americans spend an estimated 90 % of their time inside , being exposed to indoor air pollution from sources as diverse as personal care products , home furnishings , paints , and cleaning supplies .
Some experts believe that the air found inside people ’s homes can be more hazardous to their health than smog and other pollutants they are exposed to while outside the home .
Indoor air pollution has been linked to various negative health effects , especially for children , seniors , and those with weak immune systems .
Prior to receiving the $ 45,000 fellowship from the EPA ’s Greater Research Opportunities program , McKinney ’s research was funded through Morrison ’s National Science Foundation CAREER award .

Yes - love transcends all boundaries
No - his crimes were monstrous
Who are we to judge ?
I do n't know who 's dumber , an Australian woman who wants to marry a serial killer , or the online newspaper editor who asked the poll question : " Is itto marry a serial killer ?
" Is it a good idea ?
Hell no , it 's a bad idea .
It 's possibly the .
Dumbest .
Idea .
Ever .
According to AdelaideNow , Bianca Roberts of Adelaide , Australia will marry the Snowtown serial killer James Vlassakis on September 2 , even though he's not eligible for parole until 2025 .
It goes without saying that one should not ever associate with , befriend , get to know on a first name basis , or hang out with a serial killer , let alone marry the guy .
Or , you 'd think it goes without saying .
But apparently , the AdelaideNow newspaper thought it needed saying , so they ran the .
Stupidest .
Quiz .
Ever. ( see , it emphasizes how stupid it is if I break it up into three one - word sentences ) .
The choices ?
Seems obvious enough , right ?
Wrong .
As of 1:30 pm , EST on Wednesday , 1 day after the article was published , 2822 people had voted ( including me ) .
Here are the results : 1078 people ( 38 % ) said " Yes , she should marry the guy who stuffed 12 bodies into barrels of acid . " 1302 people ( 46 % ) said " No , her life will be in danger !!! " 442 people ( 15 % ) said , " Meh .
" Translation : 53 % of Australians do not think marrying a serial killer is a bad idea .
Oh well , I hope Mr. and Mrs. Vlassakis have a good wedding .
I hear the honeymoon is to die for .---
At a seminar for troubled borrowers near her home , one company offered a service that promised just what Ms. Martinez needed : for $ 1,000 , the company said it would negotiate with her mortgage company to lower her interest rate .
“ I was desperate , ” said Ms. Martinez , 57 , a clerk at the San Joaquin County Jail .
She made an initial payment of $ 500 and paid another $ 500 a few weeks later .
Now the house is in foreclosure , and Ms. Martinez is waiting for the sheriff to evict her .
She cannot reach the man she paid to modify her loan .
Swindlers Find Growing Market in Foreclosures
You can always count on the swindlers and scam artists to come out of the woodwork when desperate consumers get in trouble and need help .
In this case it is poor unsuspecting consumers that are looking for ways to keep their homes and avoid foreclosure .
The new scam is being run by so called " foreclosure rescue companies " .
Many of these outfits charge consumers upfront fees and then walk away with the money .
In Florida , you will see ads on television all day long offering to save you from the impending disaster of losing your home .
More often than not , these " scam artists " have words like " federal " or " government " in their company name .
The company names are intentionally misleading and often lead consumers to believe they are somehow connected to the so called federal government " housing bailout " .
In other words , official government agencies .
If you are in dire straights I would suggest two paths to getting help .
First , talk to the company that services your mortgage loan .
Many of these companies have set up relief programs to help stressed out consumers .
Second , here are two websites you can go to find local housing counselors : Guide to Avoiding Foreclosure or Housing Crisis Resource Center

AROUND THE WEB
With the increased geo-location position accuracy of the GeoEye - 1 satellite sensor the number of required GPS derived Ground Control Points ( GCP ’s ) can be drastically reduced , thereby reducing operational cost and security risks in foreign countries , making the GeoEye - 1 satellite sensor a platform of choice to acquire 0.5 meter high - resolution imagery and DEM products .
Since February 5 , 2009 , Satellite Imaging Corporation ( SIC ) received orders from various customers to acquire new GeoEye - 1 mono and stereo satellite imagery with image resolution of 0.5 meter supporting county tax mapping , engineering / construction , mining , land development and natural resources management .
Satellite imagery is used for many GIS and CAD applications requiring detailed up - to - date image data for planning purposes and change detection .
For three - dimensional ( 3D ) applications , Digital Elevation Models ( DEMs ) , and contours can be delivered through high cost aircraft based LiDAR surveys .
But with constricted budgets , elevation data is sometimes obtained from old and unreliable data sources with 10 meter or 30 meter postings .
For international project planning , many exploration and engineering companies are limited to 30 m ASTER DEM data sets or Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ( SRTM ) 90 meter DEM data to have access to digital terrain models .
When local topographic maps are available at a suitable scale , elevation contours are sometimes extracted from the topographic maps .
The GeoEye - 1 and IKONOS satellite sensors provide the best solution for organizations and companies requiring cost - effective high - resolution image data and Digital Terrain Models ( DTMs ) .
“ With the increased geo-location position accuracy of the GeoEye - 1 satellite sensor the number of required GPS derived Ground Control Points ( GCP ’s ) can be drastically reduced , thereby reducing operational cost and security risks in foreign countries , making the GeoEye - 1 satellite sensor a platform of choice to acquire 0.5 meter high - resolution imagery and DEM products . ” said Leopold Romeijn , President of Satellite Imaging Corporation .
Covering large areas a horizontal position accuracy of < 1 meter can be obtained with just one or two GCP ’s , and without any GCP ’s , geo-location accuracies of < 5 meter can be achieved depending on terrain conditions and collection geometry during the time of image data collection .
GIS and CAD professionals are now able to work with satellite imagery at 0.5 meter resolution , 2 meter digital raster DEMs , 1 meter elevation contours and TIN models , thereby facilitating a 3D computer work environments , supporting the planning and construction of roads , facilities , pipelines and many other project applications .
About Satellite Imaging Corporation :
Satellite Imaging Corporation ( SIC ) , a privately held technology company and Value Added Reseller ( VAR ) of GeoEye Imaging products and services , providing global satellite imaging and processing services for a number of industries , including oil and gas , mining , cadastre , tax mapping , construction , environmental , forestry and agriculture .

There are many parts of this life I enjoy , some more than others , and one of those is bondage .
To bind a sub or slave in a way that leaves her helpless to resist anything you desire is a wonderful feeling for both , and it is something that even those in a traditional ’ vanilla ’ lifestyle are finding more and more exciting , although I would hazard a guess and say they do not go to the extremes that those of us in this life tend to at times .
There is the ‘ soft ’ binding , used for adding a certain something to a scene or play and then there is the extreme , and indeed anywhere in between .
I would advise to take care when going to some of the extremes , it is not something everyone can deal with and in my experience , the more elaborate the bonds the harder it is to remove them in a hurry if needs dictate .
Another thing to remember is the position you tie your sub or slave in is basically how they will stay until you untie them and reposition them , too elaborate and the mood for playing can quickly diminish , just something to remember , sometimes simple is the best way to go .
No matter what stage of BDSM and bondage you find yourself practicing , the key is to enjoy and have fun , remember that to start of simple is not something to be ashamed of , I to this day still cannot tie a slip knot or a reef knot but still my slaves and I have many hours of fun .
CCTV footage of teenage girls brandishing guns in Manchester city centre in broad daylight were not collected by police until the day after the shocking incident .
The pair were caught on film outside a shop in Dale Street , drinking booze and pointing and cocking the apparently imitation weapons , which they pulled from carrier bags .
Shopkeeper David Arathoon called 999 as he captured the girls antics on film - but officers did not arrive at his store until 16 hours later .
The actions of the girls have been condemned by police as they tackle the latest spate of gun crimes , which have claimed several lives in recent months .
They say officers were on the scene within seven minutes and further patrols were sent to the location later in the evening .
But officers did not call on Mr Arathoon until about noon the next day , when they collected a copy of the footage .
Mr Arathoon says he rang 999 and told the operator he was taking CCTV of girls brandishing what looked like guns .
He also claims he stayed on the line to tell the operator in which direction they were heading .
The operator , he says , said they would pick them up on the city centre 's CCTV system .
Mr Arathoon said : " I thought the situation was serious and was surprised at the response .
If these had been real guns somebody could have died . "
He said he would have still been at the shop when police say they went to the scene , but did not see any officers arrive .
Greater Manchester Police said : " We received the initial call at 8.16 pm that night and patrol officers arrived at the scene at 8.23 pm .
Further officers were deployed to the scene . "
A spokeswoman added that inquiries had been `ongoing '.
They appealed for help to identify the girls , who are between 16 and 18 .
One had long black hair and was wearing a red dress with a black belt and white trousers .
The other had long brown hair in a pony tail and was wearing a black top .
Superintendent Mark Burtonwood said : " In this situation armed officers could be deployed , in which case it would n't matter whether the gun was real or a replica .
" It is very difficult , even to the trained eye , to decide if a gun is real of not and an armed officer only has a split second to make that decision . "
Deputy leader of Manchester council Jim Battle said : “ This is an outrageous incident .
“ It is unprecedented in Manchester .
This disgraceful image bears no relation to the reality of our vibrant city centre where hundreds of visitors flock week after week and where more people than ever are happy to live and work .
“ This type of behaviour will not be tolerated and I am confident that the police will track down the perpertrators and deal with them appropriately . ”
More and more , as libraries scan and digitize their rare holdings , books you never thought you'd be able to read are becoming available on the Internet .
But sometimes you 'd rather have the real thing :
Something to read in bed or on the bus , to keep on the bookshelf in case you want to review it .
Soon , thanks to a partnership between Cornell University Library and Amazon.com , some 90,000 titles from Cornell 's library shelves will be available as print - on - demand books as well as online .
The books were digitized over the last two years with the support of Microsoft .
They represent a substantial part of the library 's unique offerings printed before 1923 and which therefore are in public domain in the United States .
Some are rare and many are currently out of print .
The new titles will join about 6,000 items from several of Cornell 's special collections in such areas as historical mathematics , agriculture texts and anti-slavery pamphlets already available in print from Amazon and online from Cornell .
" Although demand for online access to digital books has been growing , books as artifacts continue to have a real value , " said Oya Rieger , associate university librarian for information technologies , noting the advantages of physical books .
" They support deep reading , underlining and writing comments in the margins .
The Web is great for easy access and browsing , but because digital content can sometimes be ephemeral , physical books continue to serve as valuable reference sources on your shelf . "
The new titles will be added to Amazon 's database and available in print over the course of 2009 .
" We are in the process of working with the Internet Archive to provide free online access to the digital books that will be available from Amazon for print - on - demand , " Rieger said .
Positive feedback from users helped contribute to the decision to expand the number of titles available .
Customers who order a title in print will receive a reproduction of the original pages in paperback format .
Orders can be placed on the library 's bookstore page at http://bookstore.library.cornell.edu/
or directly through Amazon.com , and titles can be found through Google 's Book Search .
The books being added reflect Cornell 's subject strengths , including American history , English literature , astronomy , food and wine , general engineering , the history of science , home economics , hospitality and travel , human sexuality , labor relations , Native American materials , ornithology , veterinary medicine and women 's studies .
Collections already available for reprint from Amazon include New York state historical literature , core historical literature in agriculture , historical math monographs and materials related to home economics .
Among current and forthcoming titles are " Plant Lore , Legends , and Lyrics , " by Richard Folkard ( 1892 ) ; " Gettysburg : How the Battle Was Fought , " by James T. Long ( 1890 ) ; " True and Firm , " a biography of Ezra Cornell by Alonzo B. Cornell ( 1884 ) ; " Shakespeare as a Lawyer , " by Franklin Fiske Heard ( 1883 ) ; " Financial Crises and Periods of Industrial and Commercial Depression , " by Theodore E. Burton ( 1902 ) ; and " Memorials of a Tour on the Continent , " by William Wordsworth ( 1820 ) .
Meanwhile , the library is engaged in a large - scale digitization initiative with Google that will digitize another 500,000 books over the next six years .
They borrow leftover prescription drugs from friends , attempt to self - diagnose ailments online , stretch their diabetes and asthma medicines for as long as possible and set their own broken bones .
When emergencies strike , they rarely can afford the bills that follow .
“ My first reaction was to start laughing  I just kept saying , ‘ No way , no way , ’ ” Alanna Boyd , a 28 - year - old receptionist , recalled of the $ 17,398  including $ 13 for the use of a television  that she was charged after spending 46 hours in October at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan with diverticulitis , a digestive illness .
“ I could have gone to a major university for a year .
Instead , I went to the hospital for two days . ”
In the parlance of the health care industry , Ms. Boyd , whose case remains unresolved , is among the “ young invincibles ”  people in their 20s who shun insurance either because their age makes them feel invulnerable or because expensive policies are out of reach .
Young adults are the nation ’s largest group of uninsured  there were 13.2 million of them nationally in 2007 , or 29 percent , according to the latest figures from the Commonwealth Fund , a nonprofit research group in New York .
Gov. David A. Paterson of New York has proposed allowing parents to claim these young adults as dependents for insurance purposes up to age 29 , as more than two dozen other states have done in the past decade .
Community Catalyst , a Boston - based health care consumer advocacy group , released a report this month urging states to ease eligibility requirements to allow adult children access to their parents ’ coverage .
At the end of the Preface to “ Tasting Beer , ” right before you head to Page One , there ’s a picture of a glass of beer with a command : “ Do n’t even consider starting this book without a beer in hand . ”
Since you have the book in the other hand you probably are n’t going to ask yourself if , since you are already drinking a beer you like , you really need this book .
So I will .
Do you think more knowledge about beer will make that beer taste better ?
If you answered yes then you should own this book .
( Before going on , a bit of a disclaimer .
Author Randy Mosher and I are friends , and he asked me to to the “ technical edit ” of the book .
Yes , that sounds as laughable to me as it must to you ; like Malcom Gladwell calling me up to ask for story ideas .
I do n’t get any royalties from the book , so there is no incentive for me to give it a review that boost sales .
Because I do n’t know of another beer book to be published in 2009 that should be of as much interest to you I ’m going to write about it . )
I thought about “ Tasting Beer , ” but was n’t ready to write this review , when I posted “ The tyranny of the tasting note ” last month .
Quite honestly , there ’s more here than many of you are going to want .
Perhaps you do n’t feel the need to be able to turn to your dining companion and whisper , “ I believe I ’m getting a touch of autolysed yeast . ”
More than you might want now , that is , since once you head down the road of beer knowledge stopping ai n’t easy .
Because everything in this book is presented in easy to bite off chunks you can grab what you want now and come back later for more .
Mosher makes it deceptively easy .
Consider this : “ Every sensation found in a glass of beer has its origins in the decisions of the brewer and malstster made druing its manufacture .
For instance , the tangy , green perfume of hops ?
That ’s the result of the careful choice and deployment of prized aroma hops in the brewhouse or perhaps the fermenter .
The light nuttiness and hints of raisiny fruit ?
That lightly kilned pale ale malt and a dab of crystal .
And all of this is shaped by the mysterious workings of a particular strain of yeast under certain conditions . ”
Whether that looks terribly simple to you or densely confusing it will all be clearer 27 pages later in a chapter called “ Brewing and the Vocabulary of Beer Flavor . ”
You ’ll be ready for “ The Qualities of Beer ” and looking forward to it .
I hate quoting book covers , but I ’m going to point out that the subtitle for the book is , “ An Insider ’s Guide to the World ’s Greatest Drink . ”
That ’s certainly true , but you exit knowing you do n’t have to be an insider to enjoy the beers Mosher writes about .
Further , the back cover claims “ Tasting Beer ” is “ The Portable Beer Expert . ” Indeed .
Still with me ?
Then you ’ve reached the part of the review where the reviewer offers a profound thought .
I ’ll pass and give the author the final word :
“ Beer is only as good as the people who seek it out , support it , keep it honest , and , most important of all , enjoy the genuine pleasures of it . ”

I 'm old enough to live on Social Security , and , for most of my adult life , I 've heard about Campaign Finance Reform .
It 's a total fraud .
First - time Candidates promise they 'll do it .
Once elected , they forget all about it .
" It 's not practical , " they say .
" It 's too complicated .
We 've got more important things to worry about ! "
Like a Bill to name a bridge after someone .
In my native state of North Carolina , we bear the stigma of having allowed corruption of campaign financing to take a giant leap forward by electing Jesse Helms to the US Senate , for 30 years .
Jesse 's national contribution extractor , The Congressional Club , reached across state lines like never before to help elect CONservatives all across America .
If you can't raise enough money in your home state , go next door .
Or go continental .
During its existence , 1966 to 1973 , the Club raised $ 100 million to elect CONservatives , back during a time when $ 100 million was real money .
Candidates of both Parties have now adopted Jesse 's strategy , nationwide .
This distortion of democracy has grown to such gargantuan proportions , that big campaign money powerhouses outweigh the influence of those of us who can vote .
But if public officials are supposed to represent the constituency who elect them , why are they forced to serve the desires of those who cannot vote for them ?
For any representative democracy to work , deciding the laws we live by must be done by those elected , not by those who paid to have them elected .
Campaign Finance Reform is a fraud , because immediately it conjures up a set of rules which rivals IRS in complexity .
Rules look like they work , but they 're designed to create loopholes for clever lawyers and politicos to figure a way to slip through .
Reform is made to look good to a politically naive American public .
But it plugs one leak , and simultaneously drills two more holes .
The money pot only grows bigger .
This happened every time any attempt has been made .
Works about one election cycle , then it's chopped and mangled , requiring another Campaign Finance Reform .
So why does n't it ever Reform anything ?
Because all those who make money from gathering money do n't want it to .
Campaign Finance Reform is always designed to fail .
What can be done ?
Restore democracy in America .
Jesse discovered how to corrupt our democracy with money .
Time to return to basics :
One person , one vote .
Why should a voter in Texas , Wyoming or New York be allowed to purchase votes in Carolina ?
And with Corporations daily becoming multi-nationals , who is actually electing people to public office in America ?
In a representative democracy , every elected official has a precise geographical boundary which decides who can vote to elect each Candidate .
Boundaries are clearly established , regardless of occasional gerrymandering .
Money = voting .
Therefore , the only people allowed to vote with their money -- to make campaign contributions -- must be registered to vote within any given political boundary .
It 's idiotically simple .
And does not require a five pound Rule Book , dripping with loopholes , to describe it .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Salvadoran immigrant suspected in the 2001 slaying of Washington intern Chandra Levy told at least two people he killed her , according to an affidavit filed in the case .
Ingmar Guandique is serving a 10 - year sentence for two assaults in the park where Chandra Levy 's body was found .
Ingmar Guandique , 27 , also kept a magazine photo of Levy in his prison cell , stated the affidavit detailing evidence supporting a warrant for his arrest for first - degree murder .
Guandique is in prison in California for two assault convictions .
Guandique boasted of his ties to the violent Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha , or MS - 13 , and told witnesses that he was known as " Chuckie " -- the name of a demonic doll in a series of horror movies -- because he had a reputation for " killing and chopping up people , " the affidavit states .
D.C. Metro police and federal prosecutors released the affidavit on Tuesday , announcing they would charge Guandique with first - degree murder in the Levy case .
He has not been charged with any other slayings .
Watch the police announce arrest »
The affidavit revealed that Levy , 25 , fought for her life , scratching her attacker on his face and giving him a " fat lip . "
Guandique said he received the injuries in a fight with his girlfriend .
But the girlfriend later told police that while Guandique struck and bit her at times , she never hit him , the document says .
Guandique is serving concurrent 10 - year sentences in connection with attacks on two other joggers in the park during the summer of 2001 .
He told probation officials the attacks were motivated by robbery , but no valuables were taken from either victim .
Guandique was arrested after the second attack -- exactly two months after Levy 's slaying .
D.C. Metro police began to take a hard second look at him in 2008 , the affidavit shows .
He has repeatedly denied to authorities that he killed Levy , and his public defenders have cautioned against a rush to judgment , citing what they called flaws in the investigation .
The affidavit details a case built largely on circumstantial evidence collected over the eight years since Levy disappeared , apparently while jogging along the Western Ridge trail in Washington 's Rock Creek Park .
It portrays Guandique as an opportunistic attacker who came up behind female joggers , grabbing them as they were tiring and becoming winded .
The affidavit includes highlights from interviews with a dozen witnesses , who are not identified by name and are instead given numbers .
One witness , who frequently exchanged letters with the suspect , told police Guandique had told him as early as 2003 that he killed a young woman in the park .
During a taped 2008 phone conversation with the witness , " Guandique acknowledged that he had told W9 about the ' girl who 's dead , ''' the affidavit says .
Another witness told police that Guandique said he and two male teenagers were sitting on a bench in a park smoking marijuana laced with cocaine when a woman with dark , thick hair jogged by .
The witness said Guandique thought she " looked good " and told the two teens that he was going to " get her . "
Guandique told the witness that the three followed her along a path , then grabbed her and forced her off the trail .
When she started screaming , he grabbed her by the neck and choked her to death , so that other people in the park would not hear her cries for help .
It is not clear from the affidavit whether the two teens Guandique said were with him actually exist .
Police have said no other arrests are imminent , but the investigation is continuing .
Timeline of Levy 's disappearance »
Levy 's skull was found in the park on May 22 , 2002 -- more than a year after she disappeared .
A search turned up other remains , as well as clothing later identified as hers strewn down the side of a ravine .
Her running shoes were unlaced .
He clothes were turned inside out , the pants knotted in tight restraints around her legs .
" It appears that Guandique wanted Ms. Levy naked and incapacitated , " states the affidavit , signed by D.C. Metro Det. Todd Williams .
Also among the witnesses are two women who were attacked in Rock Creek Park during the summer of 2001 , along with a woman who narrowly escaped her attacker at about 2 p.m. on May 1 , 2001 -- about the same time Levy is believed to have been jogging in the park .
All three identified Guandique from photographs as the man who stalked them in Rock Creek Park .
" I do not doubt that he purposely stalked me as a hunter tracks his prey , " one of the victims told police , according to the affidavit .
The other victim described him as " a bold and practiced attacker , " the affidavit said .
" He waited until he thought I was fatigued from jogging up a hill and purposefully selected a secluded spot right next to a deep ravine .
I fear for other women who may appear to be more vulnerable than I did . "
Guandique also allegedly described his methods to one of the witnesses in whom he confided , according to the affidavit .
" Guandique said he would hide on a dirt path and wait for the girl to walk by .
He would then lasso the girl around the neck and tie her hands and feet together behind her back to prevent her from scratching or kicking him , " the affidavit quotes the witness as saying .
It continues : " After the girl was tied up , he would rape her .
Guandique admitted that he did not always know whether his victims were still alive at the end of the attack , but that it did not matter , because they would be eaten by the animals , like coyotes and vultures . "
Police visited Guandique at a federal prison in California in November , according to the affidavit .
They found him to be heavily tattooed , with multiple MS - 13 gang tattoos , as well as " Chuckie " tattoos and a devil tattooed on his head .
One tattoo on his back depicts the " Chuckie " movie character holding a knife , according to the affidavit .
Guandique learned last week from media reports that he would be arrested in the Levy murder case and , according to a witness , responded with an expletive .
" They got me now .
What am I gonna do ? " the witness quoted Guandique as saying , according to the affidavit .
He vowed that he was not " going to go out alone , " telling the witness he planned to set a fire with a battery and tissues , then use a homemade handcuff key to escape .
He said he would kill the detectives with " shanks , " or weapons made in prison .
A search of his cell on February 26 turned up the items he described to the witness , the affidavit says .
They included an AA battery , several tissues , a toenail clipper fashioned into a sharp piece of metal , and a device made of a razor blade .
Authorities said Guandique will be brought to Washington in the next 45 to 60 days and formally charged , ending a chapter in one of Washington 's most notorious cold cases .
Although the case 's notoriety was fed by news reports linking Levy to a married congressman , U.S. Rep .
Gary Condit 's name does not appear at all in the affidavit supporting the case against the man police want to charge with her murder .
All About Chandra Levy • Murder and Homicide
Police in the northern California city of San Jose say a man has died after being jolted with a Taser , apparently the sixth such death since the department began using the stun guns in 2004 .
The man , who police said appeared to be in his 20s , got into a struggle with two officers when they tried to arrest him in the backyard of a home late Wednesday ( local time ) .
" The struggle was very , very violent to get him into custody , " said police spokesman Mike Sullivan .
" Some time during the struggle , the officers did deploy a Taser . "
One officer was cut in the face during the scuffle and the other had a leg injury .
Police said both were treated and released from a hospital .
Police watchdog groups said the death is the sixth in San Jose connected with use of a Taser , though police could not immediately confirm that figure .
The city has been sued in at least three of those cases .

Embattled American insurance giant AIG , which is at the centre of a huge political row over bonuses , has paid out far more than previously thought to its executives , it was revealed yesterday .
In shelling out a reported $ 165 m in bonuses to its top staff , AIG had already caused an almost unprecedented wave of anti-corporate anger in the US .
The row has rocked President Barack Obama 's administration and prompted new laws in a bid to try to claw back the money .
But now documents obtained by Richard Blumenthal , the attorney general of Connecticut , where AIG has offices , show the firm in fact has in fact paid out $ 218 m in bonuses , 32 % more than previously thought .
The shocking news is certain to further inflame popular emotions against AIG , the financial sector as a whole and embattled Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner .
For many Americans AIG has become the unacceptable public face of the economic crisis .
The AIG brand has in fact become so toxic that security guards have been placed outside the firm 's offices and the homes of senior executives .
Yesterday in Connecticut a group of protesters toured the state holding demonstrations outside houses owned by senior AIG management .
They were hand - delivering a letter that asked for the executives to pay their bonuses back .
Many AIG executives have also faced death threats in the wake of bonus revelations as ordinary Americans , struggling in the face of the deepest economic crisis since the Depression , have wondered why financiers who helped cause the disaster should profit so much from it .
An internal security memo issued last week by AIG warned its staff to travel in pairs in public , to avoid going out at night , to keep an eye out for unfamiliar faces near their work or homes and not to wear an AIG logo in public .
But the impact of the AIG scandal has gone far beyond the security fears of the firm 's management .
Though the actual amount of the AIG bonuses is relatively trivial compared to the more than $ 170 bn the firm has received in bailout aid , and the several trillion dollars the government has flung at trying to end the recession , the saga has had a huge political impact .
The symbolism of the AIG bonuses has triggered an epic political battle in Washington , with some Republicans seeking to use the crisis to force Geithner to resign and to slam Obama .
They have demanded to know when Geithner knew about the bonuses and why legislation that could have prevented them was removed at the apparent request of Treasury officials .
The furore has not left Obama unscathed .
The normally slick message machine in the White House was stuttering all last week and left the president looking unusually beleaguered .
" The administration has really had to scramble on this .
It shows how angry and how politically dangerous the mood of the American public is right now , " said Steve Mitchell , a political pollster and founder of Mitchell Research and Communications .
Though Obama remains essentially popular , the last week has seen a steady erosion of support for America 's first ever black president .
One study showed his approval rating dropping from 64 % to 59 % .
Another revealed that the number of Americans who disapprove of Obama 's performance had risen from 17 % to 26 % .
" I do n't think the honeymoon with Obama is over .
But the public is spending a lot more time in the sun on the beach than in the hotel bedroom right now .
He is slipping in the polls , " said Mitchell .

Then we declare two conversion functions , far2cel and cel2far , to handle marshaling a Fahrenheit temperature to a Celsius .
We are using the * , - , and + operators from the Num class and the / operator from Fractional , by declaring our Fahrenheit and Celsius newtypes to derive from Fractional and from Num in conjunction with the - XGeneralized NewtypeDeriving GHC option .

( 発表資料 ) 、いずれも難解になりがちなところを凄く分かりやすく解説されていて、さすがだなと思いました。各々ショートトークも、いずれも良かったです。
Lie # 1 ) Israel is only targeting legitimate military sites and is seeking to protect innocent lives .
Israel never targets civilians .
The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated pieces of property in the world .
The presence of militants within a civilian population does not , under international law , deprive that population of their protected status , and hence any assault upon that population under the guise of targeting militants is , in fact , a war crime .
Moreover , the people Israel claims are legitimate targets are members of Hamas , which Israel says is a terrorist organization .
Hamas has been responsible for firing rockets into Israel .
These rockets are extremely inaccurate and thus , even if Hamas intended to hit military targets within Israel , are indiscriminate by nature .
When rockets from Gaza kill Israeli civilians , it is a war crime .
Hamas has a military wing .
However , it is not entirely a military organization , but a political one .
Members of Hamas are the democratically elected representatives of the Palestinian people .
Dozens of these elected leaders have been kidnapped and held in Israeli prisons without charge .
Others have been targeted for assassination , such as Nizar Rayan , a top Hamas official .
To kill Rayan , Israel targeted a residential apartment building .
The strike not only killed Rayan but two of his wives and four of his children , along with six others .
There is no justification for such an attack under international law .
This was a war crime .
Other of Israel ’s bombardment with protected status under international law have included a mosque , a prison , police stations , and a university , in addition to residential buildings .
Moreover , Israel has long held Gaza under siege , allowing only the most minimal amounts of humanitarian supplies to enter .
Israel is bombing and killing Palestinian civilians .
Countless more have been wounded , and cannot receive medical attention .
Hospitals running on generators have little or no fuel .
Doctors have no proper equipment or medical supplies to treat the injured .
These people , too , are the victims of Israeli policies targeted not at Hamas or legitimate military targets , but directly designed to punish the civilian population .
Lie # 2 ) Hamas violated the cease - fire .
The Israeli bombardment is a response to Palestinian rocket fire and is designed to end such rocket attacks .
Israel never observed the cease - fire to begin with .
From the beginning , it announced a “ special security zone ” within the Gaza Strip and announced that Palestinians who enter this zone will be fired upon .
In other words , Israel announced its intention that Israeli soldiers would shoot at farmers and other individuals attempting to reach their own land in direct violation of not only the cease - fire but international law .
Despite shooting incidents , including ones resulting in Palestinians getting injured , Hamas still held to the cease - fire from the time it went into effect on June 19 until Israel effectively ended the truce on November 4 by launching an airstrike into Gaza that killed five and injured several others .
Israel ’s violation of the cease - fire predictably resulted in retaliation from militants in Gaza who fired rockets into Israel in response .
The increased barrage of rocket fire at the end of December is being used as justification for the continued Israeli bombardment , but is a direct response by militants to the Israeli attacks .
Israel ’s actions , including its violation of the cease - fire , predictably resulted in an escalation of rocket attacks against its own population .
Lie # 3 ) Hamas is using human shields , a war crime .
There has been no evidence that Hamas has used human shields .
The fact is , as previously noted , Gaza is a small piece of property that is densely populated .
Israel engages in indiscriminate warfare such as the assassination of Nizar Rayan , in which members of his family were also murdered .
It is victims like his dead children that Israel defines as “ human shields ” in its propaganda .
There is no legitimacy for this interpretation under international law .
In circumstances such as these , Hamas is not using human shields , Israel is committing war crimes in violation of the Geneva Conventions and other applicable international law .
Lie # 4 ) Arab nations have not condemned Israel ’s actions because they understand Israel ’s justification for its assault .
The populations of those Arab countries are outraged at Israel ’s actions and at their own governments for not condemning Israel ’s assault and acting to end the violence .
Simply stated , the Arab governments do not represent their respective Arab populations .
The populations of the Arab nations have staged mass protests in opposition to not only Israel ’s actions but also the inaction of their own governments and what they view as either complacency or complicity in Israel ’s crimes .
Moreover , the refusal of Arab nations to take action to come to the aid of the Palestinians is not because they agree with Israel ’s actions , but because they are submissive to the will of the US , which fully supports Israel .
Egypt , for instance , which refused to open the border to allow Palestinians wounded in the attacks to get medical treatment in Egyptian hospitals , is heavily dependent upon US aid , and is being widely criticized within the population of the Arab countries for what is viewed as an absolute betrayal of the Gaza Palestinians .
Even Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been regarded as a traitor to his own people for blaming Hamas for the suffering of the people of Gaza .
Palestinians are also well aware of Abbas ’ past perceived betrayals in conniving with Israel and the US to sideline the democratically elected Hamas government , culminating in a counter - coup by Hamas in which it expelled Fatah ( the military wing of Abbas ’ Palestine Authority ) from the Gaza Strip .
While his apparent goal was to weaken Hamas and strengthen his own position , the Palestinians and other Arabs in the Middle East are so outraged at Abbas that it is unlikely he will be able to govern effectively .
Lie # 5 ) Israel is not responsible for civilian deaths because it warned the Palestinians of Gaza to flee areas that might be targeted .
Israel claims it sent radio and telephone text messages to residents of Gaza warning them to flee from the coming bombardment .
But the people of Gaza have nowhere to flee to .
They are trapped within the Gaza Strip .
It is by Israeli design that they cannot escape across the border .
It is by Israeli design that they have no food , water , or fuel by which to survive .
It is by Israeli design that hospitals in Gaza have no electricity and few medical supplies with which to treat the injured and save lives .
And Israel has bombed vast areas of Gaza , targeting civilian infrastructure and other sites with protected status under international law .
No place is safe within the Gaza Strip .
Pelosi sees no ' justification ' for leaving 50,000 troops in Iraq David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This Although President Barack Obama has not yet officially laid out his plans for withdrawing US troops from Iraq , an unauthorized leak earlier this week suggested that he intends to maintain a " residual force " of up to 50,000 US troops in the country , even after withdrawing the majority of American forces -- a figure that has raised the hackles of liberal Democrats .
That figure has already raised eyebrows about the reason for such a large number of " residual " troops and suspicions that the US military might be planning to continue combat operations under the guise of training and support -- a major issue in the Vietnam War .
" What 's important about this is that we are on a path to ending the war , "
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday .
But " I do n't know what the justification is for the presence of 50,000 troops in Iraq . "
" I do think that there 's a need for some , " Pelosi explained , " but I do n't think that all of them have to be in country .
They can be platformed outside .
... I would think a third of that , maybe 20,000 ... 15 or 20,000 . "
Maddow turned to Tom Andrews , a former Congressman from Maine and now the director of the Win Without War coalition , who began by agreeing with Pelosi that " it 's a very good step . "
But Andrews also expressed concerns about whether Obama 's plans will abide by the status of forces agreement which the Bush administration negotiated last fall with the Iraqi government .
That agreement calls for American troops to " pull back to bases outside Iraq 's cities by the end of June 2009 and withdraw entirely from Iraq within three years . "
" One of the questions ... is not only the numbers of residual troops left , but who are these residual troops , " Andrews said .
" What 's the difference between a combat troop and a residual troop ?
Will a residual troop find itself in the middle of combat .
... I think a key to this is the president on Friday announcing very clearly that he supports this status of forces agreement , with its clear goal of having all US forces out by a date certain . "
" It 's very dangerous , " Andrews added of the potential he sees for the US military to attempt to evade deadlines for withdrawal .
" We 've got military planners telling the press that they 're going to get to that number -- of the reduction of combat troops -- just by redefining a combat troop as a residual force . "
Andrews also noted that author Tom Ricks says military personnel with experience in Iraq have told him him that " there 's a growing consensus that we 're not even halfway through combat operations in Iraq and that we 're still going to be in combat operations in Iraq by 2015 . "
" There 's a lot of people inside and outside off the Pentagon that have designs on obscuring this difference between combat and residual force and use it to keep combat operations going , " he added .

In most modern Linux distributions , network configuration is handled by NetworkManager , a desktop - neutral service that seamlessly manages connections .
It leverages D - Bus and HAL to provide a standardized programming interface through which higher - level applications can interact with network configuration and expose networking functionality to the end user .
NetworkManager has largely eliminated the need for managing network configuration through text files or the command line in all but a few corner cases .
KDE and GNOME both have their own custom graphical frontend components for NetworkManager that make it easy for users to connect to wireless networks and perform other network - related configuration tasks .
KDE uses the KNetworkManager component , which was in dire need of a refresh for KDE 4 .
KDE contributor Sebastian K?gler is working on a new Plasma - based front - end that takes advantage of the NetworkManager support in Solid , KDE 's hardware abstraction layer .
The latest prototype , which is available from KDE 's version control system , has a lot of potential .
In a blog entry about the new plasmoid , K?gler discusses the various usability lessons that he learned from testing WiFi configuration tools on other platforms , including Maemo , an iPod Touch , Windows , and the GNOME NetworkManager panel applet .
He attempted to draw on the best elements of those while avoiding their mistakes .
" So one of my personal goals is to not make all those mistakes in the interface for networkmanager in KDE4 .
We 're not there yet , but progressing OK , " he wrote .
" It is in no way near release quality yet , more like an early Alpha .
We 're trying to have a first working version out within the next couple of months , hopefully in time for the distros that ship in spring . "
It wo n't be included in KDE 4.2 , he says , but he hopes that it will be ready for KDE 4.3 .
First , just in case you have n’t seen it , please review the video ( in three parts ) .
It ’s been suggested before that Jon Stewart is perhaps America ’s most trustworthy journalist .
Which is nice for him , but not so good for the rest of us , because he ’s not a journalist .
He ’s a comedian .
He ’s David Letterman .
He ’s Larry the Cable Guy .
He ’s Phyllis Diller .
He makes his living by making people laugh .
But here he is , once again stepping up and telling truth to power in ways that seem spectacular to us .
( And make no mistake – money is power in America , and media conglomerates are among power ’s most critical brokers .
So stomping the balls off of Jim Cramer does , in fact , constitute speaking truth to power . )
The relevant part of that last paragraph occurs toward the end of the first sentence .
What Stewart did has been the talk of the entire fucking world in the last 48 hours .
He , a guy with a TV show , hauled a man out into the town square who has done , by omission or commission – your choice – grave damage to countless Americans .
Whether Cramer contributed to the insanity that has led us to our current economic apocalypse directly or whether his worst sin is that he did not use his platform to call out the guilty in advance , he and his employers played a noteworthy role in facilitating our financial crash .
And we , the citizenry of the information - logged society in the history of the solar system , stand agog : motherfucking WOW !
Did you SEE that ?!
This is the tragedy .
We ’re as staggered at the occurrence of actual journalism as we would be by the sight of Rosie O’Donnell clubbing Donald Trump to death with her boobs .
The fact that the only journalism in recent memory has emanated from Comedy Central is … well , it ’s like shooting novocaine into the leg of a quadriplegic , really .
Cap and Bells
It ’s never been easy – or profitable , or even safe – to speak truth to power .
America circa 2009 is n’t the first place when the ordained channels have failed to convey to the people an accurate accounting of the events shaping their lives .
In fact , what we ’re dealing with now is more reflective of the historical rule than it is the exception .
Throughout most of history you ’ve had to search for the truth about power in indirect commentaries : literature , and especially speculative genre fiction , for instance .
Comedy .
Art .
The forms allow a person with a point of view to express it while maintaining a sheen of plausible deniability .
“ Oh , no , your majesty , I was n’t writing about your munificent presence !
The malevolent criminal monarch in my story is something I imagined might exist in a less just society on a planet in another galaxy . ”
It ’s good to remember that science fiction and fantasy are never about the future or other worlds – they ’re always about here and now .
And there ’s the very old tradition of the fool .
The jester , in his classical incarnation , was the only one in the court who could get away with telling the truth .
The fact that he was a certified nutball removed enough credibility from his words that he could say serious things without being taken seriously .
He was fine so long as he did n’t slip into lucidity .
Put another way , the truth has always been there if you knew where to look and understood the code .
2009 is n’t a lot different from 1009 in that respect , I imagine .
There can be a price to be paid if the wrong person says the wrong thing in the wrong way .
Once upon a time the price might be that your loved ones would get to watch your head being paraded around on a pike .
Now the price might be something as pedestrian as losing a job opportunity or having your reputation perma- slandered by a vicious partisan noise machine .
But there ’s always risk , so the citizen bent on telling the truth needs to understand the context .
Clowning America
Throughout the Bush years any journalist with the temerity to act like an actual reporter paid a price .
The default was loss of “ access , ” and that was pretty terrifying to most on the best because your ability to survive was going to be hindered if you could n’t get anywhere near the newsmakers .
This was n’t the worst that could happen , of course .
Ask Joe Wilson or that mealy - mouthed cocksucker Scott McClellan ( not a journalist by any means , but a good illustration of the point ) what happened when you hit the Bush / Cheney mob a little too close to home .
At best , it took courage and hopefully enough cash - on - hand to sustain you through some hard times .
Clearly that was n’t the only place where the institutions of the Fourth Estate lacked , and continue to lack , courage .
As Stewart makes brutally clear in his 20 minute - plus dismemberment of Jim Cramer – a man not heretofore known for being short on words or self - confidence – finding malpractice in the field of financial journalism ( my new favorite oxymoron , by the way ) is about as tough as finding loose morals in a whorehouse .
Think about it .
You have CNBC , FOX ’s biz news , the Wall Street Journal , the financial sections of hundreds of newspapers , and how many more business “ news ” outlets .
How many of them were warning you of the things that we ’re now told were more or less inevitable ?
( Told by some , I should say – others are still trying to say there was no way we could have predicted this .
Which is bullshit – I know some very sharp people who predicted it , but they do n’t have TV shows , in large part because they ’re the sorts willing to tell the truth about rigged games .
Maybe they should have put together an irreverent ventriloquist act or written a fantasy novel .
Media as far as they eye can see , so much media , so much “ analysis , ” and not a drop of journalism in sight .
It ’s true that Jon Stewart is n’t the first funny guy in history to be the best available source of reliable reporting on the social , political and economic condition .
But most of those places did n’t have democracies .
Most did n’t have a free press .
And none of them had more access to information or channels of distribution than we do .
“ Journalism is no worse off now than it was during the reign of Caligula ” is a true statement , but it ’s not the sort of thing an advanced society should have to settle for , either .
Let ’s get Jon Stewart the Peabody .
Then a Pulitzer for The Onion .
And why not a Nobel for the karma - obsessed lead in My Name is Earl ?
If that ’s the world we ’re willing to accept , it ’s the best we deserve .
How would the CLR Be Different ?
Tuesday , January 13 , 2009
UPDATED : Added improved generics with higher - kinded polymorphism
There was a good discussion on Twitter a couple of nights ago that arose due to some issues that with an expression that might return a value , or might not ( void ) and how you handle them .
From those questions an interesting question was posed by Ted Neward , “ Knowing what we know now , how would you change the CLR ? ”
Note that this is n’t necessarily a language discussion , but how the underlying framework actually works .
It ’s a good question that I ’ll just lightly dive into , but what I really want to know is , where are the pain points ?
If I Had Only Known …
There were a few things to came to mind immediately on how I should answer this .
I ’ve been bitten by a few items that I ’ve seen as limitations imposed on me .
I ’ve thought a bit about these after my time in Haskell , F# and other languages to come up with a nice list .
Some thoughts from Michael Feathers on his ideal language also solidified my thoughts .
Let ’s go through just a few of them .
Void not treated as a generic argument type
Non-null references
Make immutability easier
Sheer complexity of Code Access Security
Pluggable JIT
Improved generics with higher kinded polymorphism
What do I mean by each of these ?
First is the infamous System .
Void not treated properly as a type .
I ’ve covered this in the past in my functional C# posts here .
As noted , the ECMA Standard 335 , Partition II , Section 9.4 " Instantiating generic types " states :
The following kinds of type cannot be used as arguments in instantiations ( of generic types or methods ) : Byref types ( e.g. , System. Generic.Collection .List`1 <string&> is invalid )
Value types that contain fields that can point into the CIL evaluation stack ( e.g. , List < System.RuntimeArgumentHandle >)
void ( e.g. , List < System .
Void > is invalid )
This means that I cannot fully generalize functions and then have to differentiate between the Func < TResult > and Action delegates .
In F# , they get around this issue by exposing another type of void , the Unit otherwise known as the empty tuple , so that you can handle those differences .
Then , ultimately , it ’s up to the compiler to decide what the return should be , whether it gets compiled to void or Unit .
I think it should have been allow for this behavior in the BCL , and then it ’s up to the language implementation to allow or disallow this behavior .
The second item is the non-null references .
One QCon London 2009 presentation caught my eye recently on this very topic , by Tony Hoare , entitled " Null References : The Billion Dollar Mistake " .
The session is described as the following :
I call it my billion - dollar mistake .
It was the invention of the null reference in 1965 .
At that time , I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language ( ALGOL W ) .
My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe , with checking performed automatically by the compiler .
But I could n't resist the temptation to put in a null reference , simply because it was so easy to implement .
This has led to innumerable errors , vulnerabilities , and system crashes , which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years .
In recent years , a number of program analysers like PREfix and PREfast in Microsoft have been used to check references , and give warnings if there is a risk they may be non-null .
More recent programming languages like Spec# have introduced declarations for non-null references .
This is the solution , which I rejected in 1965 .
I think the abstract alone describes the problem quite well .
Indeed , technologies such as Spec# introduced features to allow for non-null references and is a great piece of technology .
There is also a switch that sets this behavior as default and then an opt - out option for all those variables that allow null references .
But there are some issues of course .
Let ’s define a quick example of an ArrayList that takes an existing non-null ICollection interface .
public ArrayList ( ICollection ! c )
modifies c.*;
ensures _size /* Count */ == c.Count ;
{
_items = new object [ c. Count ] ;
base ( ) ;
InsertRangeWorker ( 0 , c ) ;
}
This looks rather straight forward in terms of the bang notation to specify the non-null behavior , but unfortunately , when compiled down to IL , is handled in a rather ugly way through the use of a modopt , such as the following :
public ArrayList ( ICollection modopt ( NonNullType ) c ) { ...
My CodeBetter , Greg
Young colleague has noted his objections to the modopt in the past such as here .
So , there are issues in the CLR which prevent us from having this rich behavior at this time .
Moving onto the third item brings us to making immutability easier .
This way , we can specify that certain classes , fields , parameters and so on , once assigned , cannot change .
This metadata can then be used by the JIT to take advantage of it and further optimize .
The information is there , but not used in the way I would think it should be .
The fourth item is the sheer complexity of Code Access Security ( CAS ) .
Does anyone really understand it , let alone use it ?
Anyone ?
* crickets *
The ideas seem noble , but I cannot honestly say I ’ve seen this used in practice .
The fifth item on the list is dealing with a more pluggable JIT , so that it opens a pipeline for us to do further refining .
For example , on constrained systems , we want to further optimize the IL .
Another item that Lennart touched upon below in his comments and me in turn in my last post on monadic substitution was around higher - kinded polymorphism in the CLR generics .
Type classes in Haskell for example , provide this example , do n’t need to take a type variable of kind * , but take one of any kind .
An example is the Haskell monad class such as this :
class Monad m where
(>>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
return :: a -> m a
instance Monad Maybe where
( Just x ) >>= k = k x
Nothing >>= _ = Nothing
( Just _ ) >>
k = k
Nothing >> _ = Nothing
return = Just
fail _ = Nothing
In the previous post , I wanted to accomplish something like this which would allow me to build a generic monad builder and then extend the option type to be a part of this :
type MonadBuilder <'M > =
abstract member Bind : ' M < 'a > * ( 'a -> 'M <'b> ) -> 'M <'b>
abstract member Return : ' a -> 'M <'a >
abstract member Delay : ( unit -> ' a ) -> 'a
let m =
{ new MonadBuilder < option > with
member x .
Bind ( x : ' a option , k : ' a -> 'b option ) : 'b option =
match x , k with
| Some x , k -> k x
| None , _ ->
None

Unfortunately , something such as this is impossible given the state of our generics implementation .
That ’s not to say that we ca n’t do type classes , because we can in a very limited way and I ’ll cover that in another post in regards to type classes for QuickCheck .
Hopefully that ’s on the table for a future version of F#. Even if F# fixes this issue , it still will be impossible at the CLR level without some sort of hackery .
But Is That All ?
There are other issues such as generic constraints and such , but my thoughts are n’t fully thought out as far as what they should be right now .
So , I ’ll open it up to you , keeping in mind we ’re talking about the CLR and not the BCL nor any language implementation .
Knowing then what you know now , how would the CLR be different ?
CBS OnDemand , which rents commercial - free episodes for a modest fee as low as 99 cents , but which must be viewed within 24 hours of downloading to a PC , is one experiment .
( Those CBS downloads reveal just how much time commercials occupy in the traditional broadcast : with commercials stripped out , a 60 - minute program may run as short as 41 minutes . )
The abundant network program offerings at iTunes , which cost $ 1.99 but do not go poof after a set time , is a work in progress , too .
An industrywide hardware standard that could immobilize remote controls , and the related Philips pay - to - surf proposal , are also in the mix of possible responses to the industry 's quandary .
I have not paid close attention to the online offerings of single television episodes because my DVR works well and the fast - forward function on my remote works very , very well .
( The button I 've programmed to perform a 30 - second skip is holding up beautifully , even though it is pressed as emphatically as a hospital button connected to a morphine pump . )
Why would I ever buy what the DVR effortlessly records at no cost ?
Even if I were to feel a twinge of concern that by skipping ads , I am violating an implicit contract that Mr. Kellner asserted exists between broadcaster and viewer of ad - supported television , I take comfort in the knowledge that no such contract exists .
James Boyle , a law professor at Duke University , said that broadcasters offer a program knowing that only a fraction of the audience watches the commercials .
Advertisers , he added , buy nothing more than " an option on a probability , " and the viewer is no more obligated to watch every commercial than a driver is obligated to read every billboard .
The trickiest legal issue posed by DVR's is not ad - skipping , but something even more basic : the right to freely make a copy of a program for personal use in the first place .
My assertion of an inalienable right to fast - forward through commercials would be rendered moot if the creators of the program that I am racing to rejoin were permitted to fully exercise the protections of copyright and impose control over the copying of their creative work .
Since the dawn of the videocassette recorder designed for home use in the mid-1970's , we have copied copyrighted television programs with impunity , enjoying the " fair use " exemption granted for this , a private , noncommercial purpose .
The legality of home copying based on " fair use " was enshrined in a Supreme Court decision , Sony Corporation v. Universal City Studios Inc. , handed down in 1984 .
That decision addressed copying with a Betamax videocassette recorder , and it remains the key decision that protects copying with DVR 's today .
But the more one looks at how the court arrived at its decision in the Sony case — a 5 - to - 4 squeaker — and at how recording technology has changed and new business opportunities have opened since then , the more difficult it is to see how a majority of the court could possibly uphold the same position today .
The courts uphold " fair use " only when it does n't harm the commercial value of the copyrighted work .
At the time the suit was brought , skipping ads during playback on a clunky tape machine was hardly worth the considerable trouble .
At the trial , survey data showed that only about 25 percent of recorded ads were skipped .
In the face of testimony by Fred Rogers of " Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood " on PBS , who welcomed home copying of his program , the movie studios that brought the lawsuit failed to convince the judge that VCR copying of televised movies was hurting their business .
