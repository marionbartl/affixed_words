Newly declassified CIA documents show the Americans and the German BND knew Eichmann was hiding in Argentina at least two years before Israeli agents snatched him from the streets of Buenos Aires on his way back from work .
They knew how long he had been in the country and had a rough idea of the alias the Nazi fugitive was using there , Klement .
Even though German intelligence had misspelled it as Clemens , it was a crucial clue .
The Mossad effort to track Eichmann had been suspended at the time because it had failed to discover his pseudonym .
They were ultimately tipped off by a German official disgusted at his government 's failure to bring the war criminal to justice .
Embarrassment
Washington and Bonn failed to act on the information or hand it to the Israelis because they believed it did not serve their interests in the cold war struggle .
In fact , the unexpected reappearance of the architect of the " final solution " in a glass box in a Jerusalem court threatened to be an embarrassment , turning global attention to all the former Nazis the Americans and Germans had recruited in the name of anti-communism .
Historians say Britain and other western powers probably did the same , but they have not published the evidence .
The CIA has .
Under heavy congressional pressure , the agency has been persuaded to declassify 27,000 unedited pages about American dealings with former Nazis in postwar Europe .
One of the most startling of those documents is a CIA memo dated March 19 1958 , from the station chief in Munich to headquarters , noting that German intelligence ( codenamed Upswing ) had that month passed on a list of high - ranking former Nazis and their whereabouts .
Eichmann was third on the list .
The memo passed on a rumour that he was in Jerusalem " despite the fact that he was responsible for mass extermination of Jews " , but also states , matter - of - factly : " He is reported to have lived in Argentina under the alias Clemens since 1952 . "
There is no record of a follow - up in the CIA to this tip - off .
The reason was , according to Timothy Naftali , a US historian who has reviewed the freshly - declassified archive , it was no longer the CIA 's job to hunt down Nazis .
" It just was n't US policy to go looking for war criminals .
It was n't British policy either for that matter .
It was left to the West Germans ... and this is further evidence of the low priority the Germans gave to hunting down war criminals . "
It was not just a question of bureaucratic inertia .
There were good reasons not to go hunting for Eichmann .
In Bonn , the immediate fear was what Eichmann would say about Hans Globke , who had also worked in the Nazis ' Jewish affairs department , drafting the Nuremberg laws , designed to isolate Jews from the rest of society in the Third Reich .
While Eichmann had gone on the run , Globke stayed behind and prospered .
By 1960 he was Chancellor Konrad Adenauer 's national security adviser .
" The West Germans were extremely concerned apparently about how the East Germans and Soviet bloc in general might make use of what Eichmann would say about Hans Globke , " Mr Naftali said .
It was not just a West German concern .
Globke was the main point of contact between the Bonn government , the CIA and Nato .
" Globke was a timebomb for Nato , " Mr Naftali said .
At the request of the West Germans , the CIA even managed to persuade Life magazine to delete any reference to Globke from Eichmann 's memoirs , which it had bought from the family .
But it was not just Globke .
When Eichmann was captured the CIA combed files it had captured from the Nazis to find information that might be useful to the Israeli prosecution .
The results caused near panic among the CIA 's leadership because , unknown to the junior staff who had looked through the files , a few of Eichmann 's accomplices being investigated had been CIA " assets " .
An urgent memo was sent to CIA investigators urging caution and pointing out that if Moscow discovered these ex-Nazis had been working for the Americans that would make those agents " very vulnerable " .
Meanwhile , some of the CIA 's German agents were beginning to panic .
One of them , Otto Albrecht von Bolschwing - who also had worked with Eichmann in the Jewish affairs department and was later Heinrich Himmler 's representative in Romania - frantically asked his old CIA case officer for help .
After the war Bolschwing had been recruited by the Gehlen Organisation , the prototype German intelligence agency set up by the Americans under Reinhard Gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the Nazis .
" US army intelligence accepted Reinhard Gehlen 's offer to furnish alleged expertise on the Red army - and was bilked by the many mass murderers he hired , " said Robert Wolfe , a historian at the US national archives .
' Unreconstructed '
Alongside the Gehlen Organisation , US intelligence had set up " stay - behind networks " in West Germany , who were supposed to stay put in the event of a Soviet invasion and transmit intelligence from behind enemy lines .
Those networks were also riddled with ex-Nazis who had horrendous records .
One of the networks , codenamed Kibitz - 15 , was run by a former German army officer , Lieutenant Colonel Walter Kopp , who was described by his own American handlers as an " unreconstructed Nazi " .
Most of the networks were dismantled in the early 1950s when it was realised what an embarrassment they might prove .
" The present furore in western Germany over the resurgence of the Nazi or neo - Nazi groups is a fair example - in miniature - of what we would be faced with , " CIA headquarters wrote in an April 1953 memo .
The new documents make clear the great irony behind the US recruitment of ex-Nazis : for all the moral compromises involved , it was a complete failure in intelligence terms .
The Nazis were terrible spies .
" Subject is immature and has a personality not suited to clandestine activities , " the CIA file on one of the stay - behind agents said sniffily .
" His main faults are his lack of regard for money and his attraction to members of the opposite sex . "
Those were the least of their flaws as would - be anti-communist agents .
They had not risen in the Nazi ranks because of their respect for facts .
They were ideologues with a keen sense of self - preservation .
" The files show time and again that these people were more trouble than they were worth , " Mr Naftali said .
" The unreconstructed Nazis were always out for themselves , and they were using the west 's lack of information about the Soviet Union to exploit it . "
The lesson would be well learned by young CIA case officers today .
" Threats change rapidly , and it 's always exiles and former government elements who are the first to come running to us saying - we understand this threat .
We have seen it with Iraqi exiles .
No doubt we 're seeing it now with Iranian exiles .
We have to be smart and we have to know who we are really dealing with . "
Protected Nazis
Adolf Eichmann
The SS colonel who organised the final solution was so enthusiastic about his work that he carried on even after Heinrich Himmler had called a halt .
He was captured by US troops but escaped to Argentina .
Israeli agents tracked him down in 1960 and he was hanged in 1962 .
Hans Globke A Nazi functionary working with Eichmann in the Jewish Affairs department who helped draft the laws stripping Jews of rights .
After the war he rose to become one of the most powerful figures in the government .
As national security advisor to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , he was the main liaison with the CIA and Nato .
Reinhard Gehlen
A major general in the Wehrmacht who was head of intelligence - gathering on the eastern front .
He sold his supposed inside knowledge of the Soviet Union to the Americans who made him head of West German intelligence , an organisation he led until 1968 .

When Gina posted her favorite 15 Firefox Quick Searches , she used a Firefox feature which associates keywords with frequent web searches .
But you can use bookmark keywords not only for web searches , but to navigate to your favorite sites and inner pages , and even launch bookmarklets without moving to your mouse .
Advertisement
Today I 'll cover the fine art of browser bookmarking in conjunction with keyword shortcuts , and how I significantly cut down wasted browsing time with an intuitive keyword framework .
Advertisement
Note : Even though I 'm writing from the perspective of a Firefox user , Firefox is certainly not the only browser that can add keywords to your bookmarks and favorites .
In Opera , for example , you can create a " Nickname " for a bookmark that does the same thing .
Lay the groundwork
If you 're using Firefox , first things first :
You need to install the OpenBook Firefox extension .
Yes , you need to - you can add keywords to your bookmarks in Firefox without OpenBook , but it 's decidedly more of a pain in the ass , requiring a trip to the properties of each bookmark .
OpenBook makes adding keywords to bookmarks trivial , meaning you 'll be much more likely to set them up .
Advertisement
Once you 've installed OpenBook , go to Tools -> Extensions and open your OpenBook options .
You can tweak this however you want to , but be sure at the very least to check the Keyword textbox , which will allow you to create keyword shortcuts on the fly .
Additionally , since I really do n't ever click on my bookmarks anymore , I do n't really have much need for organizing them ; instead , I have all new bookmarks automatically dumped into a folder called Keywords ( keeps things nice and tidy in my Bookmarks menu ) .
You can see how I have it set up in the screenshot , but if you have your own preferences , feel free to tweak the OpenBook options however you like .
Advertisement
Once you 've got OpenBook all set up , it 's time to get busy .
Set up your favorites
I like to give all of my favorite web sites a one or two letter keyword .
The process is very simple , but just because I like holding hands ( I'm 6th grade that way ) , it might go a little something like this :
Advertisement
You visit http://lifehacker.com and find out it 's got your most favorite content in all the world .
You do n't want to have to type in that whole address thirty times every day , so instead you hit Ctrl - D ( replace Ctrl with Cmd on Macs ) , type in a keyword of 'l ' and hit enter .
Now anytime you 're ready to visit Lifehacker , you 'll hit Ctrl - L ( the keyboard shortcut for the address bar ) , type , 'l ' , and hit Enter .
Easy , right ?
Advertisement
Of course , first letters run out quickly , so in the off chance that there 's another web site that begins with an " L " that you like more than Lifehacker ( say it ai n't so ! ) , you can add letters based on other intuitive methods ( for example , Lifehacker could be easily remembered as ' lh ' or ' li ' ) .
Drilling down
Since web sites are generally set up in a directory structure , I like to add keywords that help me drill down to other commonly - used pages on the same site .
For example , at Lifehacker we keep a lot of internal communication , lists , schedules , and other such fun productivity porno in a wiki .
I 've set up the Lifehacker Wiki homepage to a keyword of ' lw ' ( Lifehacker Wiki ) in my browser .
But that just gets me to the home page of the wiki .
If I want to go to the page where I keep a list of feature ideas , I type in ' lwf ' ( Lifehacker Wiki - Feature ) .
For our content schedule , I type ' lwc ' , and so on .
Advertisement
You get the idea .
This sort of drilling down can go on indefinitely , though you obviously wo n't want to allow things to get to far out of hand before you just create a new , shorter keyword .
I normally set up my keywords to match the first letter of each word I 'm looking for so that it 's easy to remember and type all of my shortcuts in one to four keystrokes .
Keyword search and the %s variable
Gina has already done an excellent feature on Firefox quick searches , but I 'm going to delve a little deeper into keyword quick searches so that you can create your own keyword search when the simple right - click ->
Add keyword search ... method does n't work .
Advertisement
For example , the online version of the Merriam - Webster dictionary does n't play nice with the regular " Add keyword search " dialog .
However , if you take a look at the URL of any word on M - W , you 'll find that they all look like this :
http://m-w.com/dictionary/<word>/
If we just had a way that we could insert any word we wanted in place of < word > , we'd be set .
Luckily , Firefox provides a very handy little %s variable , which holds everything you type after your keyword .
To create a keyword bookmark search for M - W , then , you 'd hit Ctrl - D and paste the following into the URL field :
http://m-w.com/dictionary/%s/
Assign a keyword of ' mw ' , and any time you type mw productivity into your address bar , the word " productivity " will replace the %s variable .
I use this method all the time to view Lifehacker tag pages by bookmarking the following with a keyword of ' lt ' ( Lifehacker Tag ) .
http://lifehacker.com/software/%s/
Type in something like lt hack - attack and you 'll find yourself conveniently routed to all of my features here on Lifehacker ( though if you visited the tag often , I 'd suggest setting up a drill - down shortcut like ' lha ' [ Lifehacker Hack Attack ] ) .

Keyword your bookmarklets
Do n't be shy about adding keyword shortcuts to your favorite bookmarklets .
For example , I 'm absolutely crazy about the GMail This !
bookmarklet ( it was actually the basis of my Bookmarking with Gmail feature ) .
If I 'm on a page I want to email to someone , all it takes is Ctrl - L , ' gmt ' , and Enter .

Send a Webpage with GmailThis GMail
This is one of those fantastic , simple ideas that makes you slap your head and say " Why did n't Read more
Sync your shortcuts across browsers
Finally , if you 've set up a great keyword bookmarking system , you 're going to want to sync your bookmarks on every computer you use .
To accomplish this , I prefer the FoxMarks Firefox extension .

How do you speed up your browsing ?
I want to point out that there 's really no genius in what I 've described here - many of you may already have a similar method , or perhaps another , more groundbreaking method for speeding up your browsing .
If you do , I 'd love to hear about it in the comments or at tips at lifehacker .com .

Blair allegedly made the remarks privately to Rupert Murdoch , chairman and chief executive of News Corporation , which owns the rival Sky News .
The comments threatened a new rift between the government and the BBC following the Andrew Gilligan affair over events leading to the Iraq war and recent criticisms of ministers Today presenter John Humphrys , which were controversially leaked to the press .
Downing Street said last night it had no comment on the report in the Financial Times .
The BBC said that its coverage had been ' committed solely to relaying the events fully , accurately and impartially ' .
Murdoch , a long - standing critic of the BBC , was addressing the Clinton Global Initiative conference in New York .
Chuckling , he said : ' I probably should n't be telling you this ' before recounting a recent conversation with Blair .
He said the Prime Minister was in New Delhi when he criticised BBC coverage of the catastrophe in New Orleans : ' He said it was just full of hatred of America and gloating at our troubles . '
Bill Clinton , the former US President who was hosting the conference , also attacked the tone of the BBC coverage at a seminar on the media .
He said it had been ' stacked up ' to criticise the federal government 's slow response .
Sir Howard Stringer , chief executive of Sony Corporation and a former head of CBS News , said he had been ' nervous about the slight level of gloating ' by the corporation .
The disapproval will come as a blow to BBC executives , who had declared themselves delighted with the hurricane coverage , led by Matt Frei .
They believed they had learnt the lessons from the Boxing Day tsunami in Asia , when the BBC was regarded as being slow off the mark .
Blair 's reported comments were strongly criticised last night by Martin Bell , the former BBC war correspondent and former MP .
Bell said : ' Assuming it 's accurate - it may of course be that Tony Blair was simply telling Rupert Murdoch what he thought he wanted to hear .
If he really does have a gripe with the BBC coverage , there is no shortage of forums in which he can say so publicly .
But the last time he picked a fight with the BBC , as I recall , the government came off rather badly . '
He added : ' I think Matt Frei 's reporting was absolutely immaculate and reflected the fact that one of the things the BBC is there for is to report events as they happened rather than as politicians may want them perceived to have happened .
If Tony Blair does want to confront the BBC over this , I 'd be surprised - because he would find absolutely zero support , except perhaps among his usual henchmen . '
Charles
Wheeler , the veteran former US correspondent for the BBC , said : ' I do n't believe Murdoch actually said that .
It does n't sound like Blair to me .
The coverage I saw was extremely good and got better and better .
Matt Frei was very good .
He got quite angry , which is what might have annoyed people .
' I do n't see why people should be unemotional ; I never was .
You have to tell people what you feel and what you hate - that 's part of legitimate reporting .'
A spokesman for the BBC said last night : ' We have received no complaint from Downing Street , so it would be remiss of us to comment on what is reported as a private conversation . '

From the Times coverage :
Google , which prides itself on the purity of its search results , agreed to give favored placement to content from AOL throughout its site , something it has never done before .
If this is true , AOL will once again be the ramp over which a major company jumps the shark .
Update :
Or , is this just a trial balloon ?
Update 2 – There ’s still time for the deal to fall apart , but it certainly seems set .
Saul updates his story here , and even quotes me .
From that :
“ This is Google ’s first test as a chess player in a major corporate battle , ” said John Battelle … .
” They are saying , ‘ We will take some of our pawns and block the move to our queen by Microsoft , ’ ” he said .
“ Until now , Google has said , ‘ We do n’t think about our competitors .
We spend all our time building better products for our users . ’ “
And more details on how the deal unfolds :
Google has been providing Web search and search ads for AOL since 2002 .
In the new arrangement , Google will offer promotion to AOL in ways it has never done for another company , two executives close to the negotiations said .
If a user searches on Google for a topic for which AOL has content – like information about Madonna – there will be a special section on the bottom right corner of the search results page with links to AOL.com .
Technically , AOL will pay for those links , which will be identified as advertising , but Google will give AOL credits to pay for them as part of the deal .
They will also carry AOL ’s logo , the first time Google has agreed to place graphic ads on its search result pages .
…. Google will also provide technical assistance so AOL can create Web pages that will appear more prominently in the search results list .
But this assistance will not change computer formulas that determine the order in which pages are listed in Google ’s search results .
Google will also make a special effort to incorporate AOL video programming in its expanding video search section and it will feature links to AOL videos on the video search home page .
These links will not be marked as advertising .
An executive involved in the talks said Time Warner asked Microsoft to give AOL similar preferred placement in advertising and in its Web index and that Microsoft refused , calling the request unethical .
Also very very interesting but not that played up :
Under the current arrangement , Google sells all the search ads that appear on AOL ’s sites .
This year , Google ’s revenue from ads on AOL will be roughly $ 500 million , estimates Jordan Rohan , an analyst with RBC Capital Markets .
Of that , Google will pay AOL about $ 430 million .
Under the new deal , AOL ’s sales force will also have the ability to sell search advertising that appears only on AOL ’s sites , even though those ads will compete for placement with those sold by Google .
AOL ’s sales force will also have the right to sell some display advertising that will be placed on the vast network of Web sites for which Google sells ads .
A child 's depiction of the ninki- nanka on the expedition 's blog
Believed to live in swamps , the ninki - nanka appears in the folklore of many parts of West Africa .
It is described as having a horse - like face , a long body with mirror - like scales and a crest of skin on its head .
Team leader Richard Freeman told the BBC , evidence so far was sketchy as most people died soon after seeing it .
Mr Freeman , a cryptozoologist from the UK - based Centre for Fortean Zoology , admitted that the ninki - nanka 's existence was " very far - fetched indeed " .
There seems to be this thing when you see the ninki - nanka you will die usually within a few weeks
Richard Freeman
Second - hand accounts varied wildly from it looking like a crocodile or a snake to having wings and spitting fire , he said .
But he disputed a suggestion that the hunt was a waste of time and money .
" We did n't know any of this before we came .
We have to look into everything to see if there is a possibility that there 's a real creature there , " he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
Cryptozoology is the search for animals whose existence is disputed or unsubstantiated , such as the Loch Ness monster .
Herbal potion
The team have interviewed one eyewitness so far - a park ranger from the Kiang West National Park who lived to tell the tale of his encounter three years ago .
One of the expedition team examines a ' scale '
He described an immense animal 50 metres long by one metre wide that he watched for more than an hour before being taken ill .
He put down his survival down to a herbal potion given to him by an Islamic holy man , Mr Freeman said .
Later , according to the expedition 's blog , after being shown pictures of various reptiles and mythical animals , the ranger said the creature 's face most resembled that of a Chinese dragon .
" We 've heard very similar stories all over The Gambia but mostly not first hand eyewitnesses ... there seems to be this thing when you see the ninki - nanka you will die usually within a few weeks , " Mr Freeman said .
The team are taking back a sample of what is claimed to be a ninki- nanka 's scale to be tested in the UK .
But initially investigations suggestion this is a red herring , perhaps a bit of rotten celluloid film and " not biological " .
" We have n't discounted the possibility that there is a flesh and blood ninki- nanka in the swamps of West Africa , it 's just at the moment the evidence is pointing to something more folkloric , " he said .
Rollo Carpenter has scooped the prize for two years ' running
Icogno scooped the 2006 Loebner Prize Bronze Medal after judges decided that its AI called Joan was the " most human computer program " .
The competition is based on the Turing test , which suggests computers could be seen as " intelligent " if their chat was indistinguishable from humans .
The gold medal , which goes to an AI that fools the judges , is unclaimed .
The prize is awarded after judges hold a conversation with the AI , asking questions to determine its " humanity " and the quality of its responses .
Joan is a " 26 - year - old budding writer " who exists only on a set of computer servers .
Last year 's Loebner prize went to Icogno's AI called George .
' Big difference '
Joan and George 's creator Rollo Carpenter said : " The big difference overall between the two AIs is that Joan has learnt from the general public and has grown a huge amount in the last year and is keeping ahead of the competition . "
Joan is one of the firm 's so - called Jabberwacky bots , which develop their conversational skills by speaking to the general public online .
The technology has moved on a bit during the course of the year but there 's been no revolution
Rollo Carpenter
English writer Ariadne Tampion worked with Mr Carpenter to help develop Joan 's persona by chatting to the AI online .
Those conversations helped develop the majority of the 16,000 lines that distinguish her from a generic AI .
In all , the bot has more than five million lines of conversation available to it .
" She helped create a much more conversational ability for Joan than George last year .
" It does not mean the AI only ever uses her words .
Any amount of teaching is not quite enough for a realistic conversation . "
He added : " So the AI uses other things said by other people to it that fit the conversational model . "
The underlying technology that powers George and Joan is the same , said Mr Carpenter .
" In terms of her ability to retain her character Joan is more sophisticated than George .
" The technology has moved on a bit during the course of the year but there 's been no revolution . "
George learns how to use words and phrases through online chat
George in action
The technology which powers Joan resides on Windows server machines .
The core of the AI is on a Dual Xeon machine with lots of memory , said Mr Carpenter .
He said there was a very direct relationship between the computing power available and the sophistication of the AI .
' Rate of learning '
" Investment in a lot more equipment could accelerate the rate of learning , " he said .
" If I had Google 's hardware behind it and more hits than Google receives , the AI 's range of utterances could grow by a million every single day . " he added .
Mr Carpenter has said he expects a machine to fool people that they are speaking to a human being and therefore pass the Turing test by 2016 .
Icogno is now working to commercialise the technology of the AI .
" We are working with an organisation that wants web avatars for use in marketing and entertainment purposes .
" Long term we see the use of AIs in call centres , support services and even for sales . "
One day in the future when you pick up the phone to seek help with your broadband connection , the person you are speaking with may be George or Joan , AIs residing on a computer somewhere in the world .
The following is an extract of a conversation between one of the Loebner judges and the AI Joan :
Judge :
But ca n't a machine think ?
Joan :
It may be possible .
Judge : And conscious ?
Joan :
Not after I 'm done with you .
Judge :
What are you going to do to me ?
Joan : Nothing .
I just wanted to talk .
Judge :
What about ?
Joan : Being tested like this .
They sound like something Willy Wonka invented , not the latest craze in civic improvement .
But rubber sidewalks are the wave of the future , according to an initiative going before the Boston City Council proposing the city begin installing walks made from recycled tires instead of concrete .

SEOmoz has recently been interviewing applicants for a web developer position .
Prior to conducting the interview , I wrote up a list of technical questions I wanted to ask .
After interviewing , I decided to build upon this list and put together a larger one that everyone could use - both for interviewers and interviewees .
The list is not specific to any particular type of development position , but I tried to balance it between both the design / html / usability side of things and the back - end / database / programming side .
I 'm just focusing on web development related questions - you should obviously ask the usual barrage of questions like " Why do you want to work for [ some company ? ] "
I 'm not covering those types here .
Also , this list is n't in any particular order .
What industry sites and blogs do you read regularly ?
This question can give you an idea of how in - tune they are with the latest industry trends and technologies , as well as how passionate they are about webdev .
It 'll help separate the people who do it as a career AS WELL as a hobby from those who might simply be in it for the big developer paychecks .
_ Do you prefer to work alone or on a team ?
This is an important question to ask depending on the work environment .
If your project is going to require close interaction with other developers it 's very handy to have someone who has had that kind of experience .
On the other hand , many developers thrive while going solo .
Try to find a developer that fits your needs .
_ How comfortable are you with writing HTML entirely by hand ?
( + exercise )
Although their resume may state that they 're an HTML expert , often times many developers can't actually write an HTML document from top to bottom .
They rely on an external publisher or have to constantly flip back to a reference manual .
Any developer worth a damn should at least be able to write a simple HTML document without relying on external resources .
A possible exercise is to draw up a fake website and ask them to write the HTML for it .
Keep it simple and just make sure they have the basics down - watch for mistakes like forgetting the < head > </ head > tags or serious misuse of certain elements .
If they write something like : < image src= " / some/image.gif " > , it might be a good hint to wrap things up and call the next interviewee .
_ What is the w3c ?
Standards compliance in web development is where everything is ( hopefully ? ) going .
Do n't ask them to recite the w3c 's mission statement or anything , but they should at least have a general idea of who they are .
_ Can you write table - less XHTML ?
Do you validate your code ?
Weed out the old - school table - driven design junkies !
Find a developer who uses HTML elements for what they were actually intended .
Also , many developers will say they can go table - less , but when actually building sites they still use tables out of habit and / or convenience .
Possibly draw up a quick navigation menu or article and have them write the markup for it .
To be tricky , you could draw up tabular data - give them bonus points if they point out that a table should be used in that scenario :)
_ What are a few of your favorite development tools and why ?
If they say notepad you 've obviously got the wrong person for the job .
Not only can this help you gauge their level of competence , but it 'll also see if they match the tools everyone else uses in - house .
_ Describe / demonstrate your level of competence in a * nix shell environment
See how well they work without their precious GUI .
Ask some basic questions like how they would recursively copy a directory from one place to another , or how you 'd make a file only readable by the owner .
Find out what OSs they have experience with .
_ What skills and technologies are you the most interested in improving upon or learning ?
Find out if their future interests match the direction of the position ( or the company in general ) .
_ Show me your portfolio !
A portfolio can say a lot about a developer .
Do they have an eye for aesthetics ?
Are they more creatively or logically oriented ?
The most important thing is to look for is solid , extensive , COMPLETED projects .
A half dozen mockups and / or hacked - out scripts is a sign of inexperience or incompetence .
_ What sized websites have you worked on in the past ?
Find a developer that has experience similar in size to the project you 're putting together .
Developers with high traffic , large scale site expertise may offer skills that smaller - sized developers do n't , such as fine tuning apache or optimizing heavily hit SQL queries .
On the other hand , developers who typically build smaller sites may have an eye for things that large scale developers do n't , such as offering a greater level of visual creativity .
_ Show me your code !
Whether it 's plain old HTML or freakishly advanced ruby on rails , ask for code samples .
Source code can say more about a persons work habits than you think .
Clean , elegant code can often be indicative of a methodical , capable developer .
A resume may say 7 + years of perl experience , but that could mean 7 years of bad , unreadable perl .
Also , make sure you ask for a lot of source code , not just a few isolated functions or pieces of HTML .
Anyone can clean up 20 - 30 lines of code for an interview , you want to see the whole shebang .
Do n't ask for a full , functional app , but make sure it 's enough that you can tell it 's really what their code is like .
_ What are a few sites you admire and why ?
( from a webdev perspective )
Find out what inspires them .
While it does n't necessarily " take one to know one , " a great developer should always have a few impressive favorites .
_ Fix this code , please .
Give them some broken code written in the development language they are expected to know for the position .
Have them go through it line by line and point out all the mistakes .
_ I just pulled up the website you built and the browser is displaying a blank page .
Walk me through the steps you 'd take to troubleshoot the problem .
This is a great question to determine how well rounded their abilites are .
It tests everything from basic support skills all the way up to troubleshooting the webserver itself .
_ What 's your favorite development language and why ?
What other features ( if any ) do you wish you could add to this language ?
Asking about feature additions is a particularly valuable question - it can reveal if they 're skilled in programming in general or if their skillset is pigeonholed into their language of choice .
_ Do you find any particular languages or technologies intimidating ?
I 've often felt that the more I learn , the less I feel like I know .
Solving one mystery opens up ten others .
Having the interviewee tell you their faults can reveal a lot about what they know .
_ Acronym time ( oh boy ! )
Some might argue that knowing what acronyms actually stand for is trivial , but there are certain acronyms that a developer should have hard - wired into their head ( HTML or CSS , for example ) .
This is the kind of question that might be better reserved for the phone interview to weed out those who are very unqualified .
_ What web browser do you use ?
There is a right answer to this question : all of them .
A competent developer should be familiar with testing cross - browser compatibility by using all the major web browsers .
Obviously they 'll have a primary browser they use for surfing , but their answer to this question might be a good way for you to segue to asking how extensively they test cross - browser issues .
Also , if it 's some kind of css / html position seeing what toolbars they have installed can be a good metric of their skillset .
_ Rank your interest in these development tasks from 1 to 5 ( 1 being not interested at all , 5 being extremely interested )
Write up a list of tasks the job requires .
Having them rank these items according to their interest level can help you find who is the best suited for the position .
I know debugging uncommented perl code from 1997 sounds seriously awesome to me .
_ What are a few personal web projects you 've got going on ?
Almost all developers have personal web projects they like to plug away at in their spare time .
This is another question that can help differentiate the passionate developers from the clock - punchers .
It 's also a good question to end an interview with , as it's usually easy ( and fun ) for them to answer .
Any more great questions you can think of ?
In 1955 , atmospheric CO2 was at 314 ppm .
That ’s about a 100 ppm CO2 ago — and 36 ppm CO2 below the James Hansen - claimed ideal CO2 level of 350 ppm .

When a respected member of the Java development community says it may be time to look around for a successor to Java , it sort of catches your attention .
In Beyond Java , Bruce Tate describes the epiphany he reached when one of his clients dumped Java right in the middle of development of an application .
Tate and his partner had decided , perhaps in one of those fits of whimsy that can hit you when you 're busiest , to rewrite one component of the application in Rails .
Just , you know , out of curiosity .
Tate says it shook him to his Java - loving core when the Rails rewrite took four nights of coding compared to four months for the Java build , then outperformed the Java version while weighing in at about a fifth the number of lines of code .
Remember that scene in My Cousin Vinny where sort - of lawyer Vinny Gambini ( Joe Pesci ) utterly destroys a witness and the formerly skeptical defendant jumps up , fires the stuttering public defender , points to Vinny , and declares , " I want him " ?
Apparently , Tate 's client fired Java like a lawyer with a speech impediment .
The experience drove Tate to consider alternatives to Java .
Of course , neither Tate nor anyone else expects Java to lose dominance soon .
If you believe IBM , in a given day the world sees more COBOL transactions processed than web pages viewed .
De gustibus non disputandum est , and languages do n't die overnight .
But Tate was forced to conclude that Rails just might have what it takes to supplant Java for certain purposes .
You 've heard of Rails , of course .
It 's that hot Ruby - based Model - View - Controller - patterned full - stack framework for developing web applications that babysit databases .
Sorry ; I should define my terms .
Here 's what I mean by " hot " :
At this year 's Jolt Awards , Rails snagged the top prize for web development tools , while the top technical book pick was Agile Web Development with Rails .
When the First International Rails Conference sold out in less than a week , the organizers added 150 seats and sold all of those in 24 hours .
In the past three months , Rails has been on the radar of publications ranging from BusinessWeek to Wired .
Employers are starting to ask applicants for Ruby and Rails experience ( so far , this only applies to applicants for programming jobs ) .
Rails 1.0 was released in December 2005 , and there are a number of Rails - developed applications running on the Web right nowsee the www.rubyonrails.org site or Wikipedia for lists .
One such application , MeasureMap , was snapped up by Google .
Rails is clearly getting a lot of attention , but it 's more than just the flavor of the month .
For a growing number of web application developers , Rails seems to have hit some sort of sweet spot .

初版 1997/09/30 , 最終更新 2016/07/22
この学生実験 ( 演習 ) は 2016 年度をもって終了しました.
18 年間 ( 演習で使用した期間 ) ありがとうございました .
OpenGL は Silicon Graphics 社 ( 現 SGI 社 , 以下 SGI ) が開発した , OS に依存しない三次元のグラフィックスライブラリ ( 正確には Application Program Interface , API ) です. でも , この 「 OS に依存しない 」 というところが実は曲者で , ウィンドウを開いたりマウスの操作を受け付けたりするところは , それぞれの OS の流儀に則って , OS やウィンドウシステムにお願いしないといけません .
すなわち , OpenGL の機能を使えるようにするためには , Windows なら Windows の , X Window なら X Window のやり方で , あらかじめお膳立てをしてやる必要があるのです .
実はこれが結構面倒な作業なので , 教科書の OpenGL Programming Guide の第 1 版 では , 補助ライブラリ ( AUX ライブラリ , 一種のツールキット ) というのを導入して , その部分をとりあえず隠していました .
つまり , AUX ライブラリに OS に依存する処理を任せることで , 読者は OpenGL そのものの学習に専念できるようになっていたのです .
OpenGL Programming Guide の第 2 版以降では , AUX ライブラリに代えて GLUT を使っています .
ところで , Microsoft 社 ( 以下 MS ) が SGI から OpenGL のライセンスを買って自分のところの OS に載っけたので , OpenGL は一気にグラフィックスライブラリの業界標準の地位に登り詰めました.
その際 , この AUX ライブラリ も
Windows ( NT / 95 ) に移植されました .
この結果 , 図らずも ?
この AUX ライブラリを使って書いたソースプログラムは , UNIX と Windows のどちらでもコンパイルできるという便利な仕組みができ上がりました .
しかし , AUX ライブラリはもともと学習用であり , ちゃんとしたアプリケーションを書こうとすると機能に不足を感じます.
それに MS による AUX ライブラリの移植はやはり MS の流儀で行われていて , 例えばイベントのハンドラには CALLBACK という型を付けないといけないとか , やっぱり気色の悪い部分があったりします .
そこで AUX ライブラリを , 多少なりともまともなアプリケーションが作れるように改良したものが
GLUT ( The OpenGL Utilitiy Toolkit ) だと言えます .
これは SGI の Mark Kilgard 氏によって作成されました ( 今は NVIDIA に居るみたいですけど ) .
またユタ大学の Nate Robins 氏 ( この人も今は NVIDIA に居るらしい ) という人によって , Windows にも移植されました .
このため GLUT には AUX ライブラリのような問題 ?はありません. バージョン 3.6 以降では Windows 版と UNIX 版のソースコードが統合され , まとめて提供されています .
Linux や Macintosh では Mesa の上に AUX ライブラリや GLUT が移植されました . また Apple 自身もついに ?
Mac OS 8.1 から OpenGL を採用し , この上でも GLUT が使用可能になりました .
現在の Mac OS
X ではグラフィックス機能の基盤として OpenGL を採用しており , Developer Tools ( Xcode ) には標準で GLUT が含まれています .
ソースプログラムも公開されています ( GLUT for Mac OS X ) .
いくつかデモプログラムも入っています .
シミュレーション結果の視覚化など , グラフィックスを専門としない人が グラフィックスプログラミングをしなければならないということは結構ありますよね.
私の記憶が正しければ , かつて ( いつの話だ ? ) は Calcomp のプロッタライブラリとか , Tektronix 4014 ターミナルのエスケープシーケンスとか , あるいは N88BASIC のグラフィックス ( GLIO 呼び出しとか ) なんかがそういう目的に使われてたように思います .
現在なら , そういう目的には何を使えばいいのでしょうか?
Windows ならもちろん DirectX に含まれる Direct3D ( D3D ) が使えます .
X Window なら Xlib で書くしかないのでしょうか ?
PEX はもう廃れましたよね ?
こういうものは , 使ったことがある人はわかると思いますが , 実際に絵を描き始めるまでに訳の分からない呪文をいっぱい並べないといけなかったりして , 結構煩わしいもんですよね. 特にグラフィックスとなると
本格的な GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) を持ったアプリケーションプログラムを作りたければ , Windows なら素直に Visual BASIC を使うか , MFC ( Microsoft Foundation Class ) あるいは .
Net なんかを使うべきでしょう .
X Window なら Motif や GTK などのツールキットを使えば見栄えのいいものができると思います. でも , これらはあくま で 「 ユーザーインタフェース構築のための部品集」なので , これら自体はあまり 「グラフィックスプログラミング」の役に立ちそうにありません.
OpenGL は三次元のグラフィックスライブラリですが , もちろん二次元の機能も持っています . なにより , これを使うと N88BASIC の LINE 文で図形を書いていた頃 ( 遠くなったなぁ ) の気楽さで グラフィックスプログラミングができます ( あくまで個人的な印象です ) .
それでいて , ( 当たり前だけど ) N88BASIC とは比較にならないほどいろんなことができます .
ということで , OpenGL と GLUT を組み合わせれば ,
UNIX 系 OS ( Linux , FreeBSD 等を含む ) と Windows と Mac のいずれでも動く , リアルタイムに三次元表示を行うプログラムが , とっても簡単に書けてしまう ,
という三拍子そろったメリットが得られます.
i Phone OS や Android では , OpenGL から派生した OpenGL ES が使われています .
もちろん GLUT は , 本格的な GUI を持ったプログラムの開発には向いていません .
しかし研究などで , 手早くグラフィックスのプログラムを仕上げないといけないという場合には , とても便利な組み合わせだと思います.
なお GUI については , オリジナルの GLUT 自体にも一応 mui ( micro - UI ) というツールキットが含まれています .
このほか , GLUI という GLUT と C++ で書かれたツールキットがリリースされています.
これについては , GLUI リファレンスマニュアル日本語版 に日本語で書かれた詳しい資料があります . また Clutter という OpenGL のほかに OpenGL ES でも使用できるマルチプラットホームの ツールキットも開発されています .
これらと同様にマルチプラットホームで使えるツールキットとして ,
Qt ( " キュート " と読む ) や FLTK ( Fast Light Toolkit ) , GLFW , SDL ( Simple Directmedia Layer ) などがあります .
Qt は最近のグラフィックスアプリケーションの GUI ツールキットとして非常に人気があります .
非常に高機能ですが , 非常に巨大です .
FLTK は GUI に特化していますが , 非常に軽量です .
GLFW はマウスやキーボードのほか , ジョイスティックも入力デバイスとして使えます .
SDL はジョイスティックなどの入力機器に加えて , 音声も扱うことができます .
一方 , Linux などで使われる GTK というツールキットをベースにしたものに , GtkGLArea や GtkGLExt があります .
その他の OpenGL と組み合わせて使えるツールキットについては , OpenGL.org の GLUT - like Windowing Toolkits に紹介があります .
オリジナルの GLUT のソースファイルの場所 は GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit のページからたどることができます ( glut - 3.7.tar.gz / glut37.zip と glut_data-3.7.tar.gz / glut37data.zip ) .
ただし , オリジナルの GLUT は , 1998 年に発表された Version 3.7 以来 , 長い間メンテナンスされていません .
現在では , 代わりに freeglut という互換のツールキットが使用されることが多いようです ( 他に OpenGLUT というものもありますが , これも現在メンテナンスされていないようです ) .
ほとんどの Linux / FreeBSD 系の OS には , GLUT ( おそらく freeglut ) のパッケージが用意されていると思います .
使用する OS のパッケージマネージャを使ってインストールしてください .
( Vine ) $ sudo apt - get install freeglut freeglut - devel ( Debian , Ubuntu ) $ sudo apt - get install freeglut3 freeglut3 - dev ( RedHat , Fedra ) $ sudo yum install freeglut $ sudo yum install freeglut - devel
root の権限がないときは , freeglut のソースを入手して , 自分でコンパイルしてください .
freeglut のバージョン 3 以降では , これに cmake を使います ( 渡辺 敏暢 様 情報ありがとうございました ) .
cmake の使い方は , 陳 先生が 「 CMake の勧め 」で説明されています ( 陳 先生 ありがとうございます ) .
下記の " インストール先 " には , 自分が書き込み可能なディレクトリを指定してください .
" - DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=インストール先 " を省略した場合は , make install により /usr / local 以下にインストールされます .
$ tar xzf freeglut - 3.Y.Z.tar.gz $ cd freeglut - 3.Y.Z $ mkdir build $ cd build $ cmake - DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=インストール先 .. $ make $ make install
ここでもし " XInput.h が無い " というエラーでビルドに失敗するときは , freeglut - 3. Y.Z/src/x11 にある fg_internal_x11.h の中で #include している X11/ extensions / XInput.h を X11 / extensions / XI.h に書き換えてください .
一方 , freeglut のバージョン 2 では , ソースプログラムに含まれている configure スクリプトを使います .
下記の " インストール先 " には , 自分が書き込み可能なディレクトリを指定してください. " -- prefix=インストール先 " を省略した場合は , make install により /usr / local 以下にインストールされます .
$ tar xzf freeglut - 2.Y.Z.tar.gz $ cd freeglut - 2.Y.Z $ ./ configure -- prefix=インストール先 $ make $ make install
オリジナルの GLUT をインストールする場合は , GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit のページからソースファイル ( glut - 3.7.tar.gz , glut_data-3.7.tar.gz ) を取ってきてコンパイルしてください.
ただし , このコンパイルに使用する xmkmf や imake は現在の X Window には含まれていないので , 別に入手してインストールしておく必要があります.
また , その際は glut - 3.7 / lib / glut に cd して make したほうがいいでしょう .
glut -3.7 で make するとサンプルプログラムから何からコンパイルするので , すごく時間がかかります ( 非常に参考になるサンプルプログラムなので , 目を通しておくことを勧めます ) .
$ gunzip -d -c glut -3.7.tar.gz | tar xf - $ cd glut - 3.7 $ xmkmf $ make Makefiles $ make includes $ make depend $ cd lib / glut $ make
上記の手順によ り glut-3.7/lib/glut/libglut.a が作成されます. これと glut-3.7/ include/GL/glut.h を , GLUT を用いて作成するプログラムと同じディレクトリか , 他の適当なディレクトリに置いてください .
Linux などメーカーによって OpenGL が移植されていない UNIX 系 OS では , Mesa と呼ばれる OpenGL 互換のライブラリが X Window に組み込まれています .
このソースプログラムは , SourceForge の Mesa3D プロジェクトから入手できます .
SGI から Mark Kilgard 氏を含む大量のエンジニアが NVIDIA に移籍したと思ったら , 1999 年 2 月には SGI が GLX ( X Window の OpenGL 拡張 ) をオープンソース化して , XFree86 や X. Org でも GLX が使えるようになりました . 現在 NVIDIA や AMD ( ATI ) などのグラフィックスプロセッサメーカーが , OpenGL のハードウェアアクセラレーションが有効なドライバを提供しています.
その他のメーカーも , それぞれにドライバを用意しているようです.
[ New ] NuGet を使えば，以下の手順でプロジェクトごとに freeglut を組み込むことができます ．
OpenGL が使えるのは , OpenGL の DLL をインストールした Windows 95 および Windows 98 以降の OS です .
Windows 95 の場合 , OSR2 以降なら多分標準で入っているのではないかと思いますが , 無い場合は MS からダウンロードしてきてください . これは ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/MSLFILES/opengl95.exe にあります ( いまさら Windows 95 を使うことは無いと思いますが ) .
GLUT を使えるようにするには , 以前は Nate Robins 氏が Windows 用のバイナリファイルを提供されていましたが , 現在はすでに提供を終了されているようです .
ここでは freeglut をコンパイルして使う方法を説明します .
開発環境は Visual Studio 2013 を想定しています .
freeglut はバージョン 3 から CMake を使用して作成するようになっています .
freeglut のインストールに先立ち , CMake の Windows 用バイナリのインストーラを入手してください .
CMake のサイトの " Download the Latest Version of CMake " のボタンをクリックして , " Binary distributions : " の " Windows ( Win32 Installer ) " を選んでください .
CMake のインストーラを起動してインストールしてください. 次に , freeglut のソースファイルを入手します .
これは .tar.gz 形式のアーカイブファイルなので , lhaplus などの適当なアーカイバを使って展開してください .
CMake ( cmake - gui ) を起動し , " Browse Source " をクリックして freeglut のソースファイルを展開したディレクトリを選んでください.てください.
" Browse Build " をクリックして , コンパイルしたバイナリファイルを置くディレクトリを選んでください.
これはソースファイルのディレクトリの下に " build " というフォルダを作成することが一般的のようです .
" Configure " をクリックします .
すると , 使用する開発環境を尋ねられます .
ここでは Visual Studio 2013 を使用し , 32 bit 版のライブラリファイルを作成することにします. 最後に " Generate " をクリックすれば , Visual Studio 2013 のソリューションファイルファイルが作成されます.
Visual Studio 2013 のソリューションファイルファイル freeglut.sln は , " Browse Build " に指定したフォルダに作成されます .
Visual Studio 2013 でこれを開いてください .
演習のプログラムは , とりあえ ず Debug モードで作成すると思いますから , 「 構成マネージャ 」 の「 アクティブ ソリューション 構成 」 は " Debug " のままにしておいてください .
「 アクティブ ショリューション プラットフォーム 」 は " Win32 " を選んでください .
64 ビット版のライブラリを作成する場合は , CMake の Configure 時に 64 ビット版のライブラリファイルの作成を指定する必要があります .
CMake の Configure を最初からやり直すには , cmake - gui の " File " メニューの " Delete Cache " を選んでください .
Visual Studio 2013 の 「 ビルド」メニューの「ソリューションのビルド」を選んでください.
ビルドに成功すれば , CMake の " Browse Build " に指定したフォルダの中の " bin " と " lib " フォルダの下にライブラリファイルが作成されます.
" bin " フォルダの " Debug " フォルダの中にある freeglutd.dll , および " lib " フォルダの " Debug " フォルダの中にあ る freeglutd .lib と freeglut_staticd.lib というファイルを , 使用する開発環境に応じて , それぞれ次の場所にコピーします. freeglutd.lib , freeglut_staticd.lib OS が 32 ビット版なら " C: \Program Files \Windows Kits\8.1\Lib\winv6.3\um\x86 "
OS が 64 ビット版な ら Win32 版は " C : \Program Files ( x86 ) \Windows Kits\8.1\Lib\winv6.3\um\x86 " x64 版は " C : \Program Files ( x86 ) \Windows Kits\8.1\Lib\winv6.3\um\x64 "
freeglutd.dll OS が 32 ビット版なら " C: \Windows \System32 "
OS が 64 ビット版な ら Win32 版の DLL は " C: \Windows \SysWOW64 " x64 版の DLL は " C: \Windows \ System32 " ( 64 ビット版 OS の " C: \Windows \ System32 " には 64 ビット版の DLL を入れます )
自分のプログラム を Release ビルドする可能性がある場合は , Visual Studio 2013 の 「 アクティブ ソリューション 構成 」 を " Release " に切り替えて , freeglut を Release ビルドしてください .
" bin " フォルダと " lib " フォルダのそれぞれの " Release " フォルダの下 に freeglut.dll および freeglut.lib , freeglut_static.lib が作成されますから , これらを上記と同じ場所にコピーしてください.
展開した freeglut のフォルダにある " include " フォルダの中の " GL " フォルダにあるヘッダファイルを下記の場所にコピーします.
glut.h freeglut.h freeglut_std.h freeglut_ext.h OS が 32 ビット版なら " C: \Program Files \Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um\gl "
OS が 64 ビット版なら " C: \Program Files ( x86 ) \Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um\gl "
C++ Builder の場合は " えむっち " さんの へっぽこプログラマー日記が参考になります .
Cygwin の場合は Cygwin で OpenGL / Glut を使う方法で詳しく解説されています . また , フリーの処理系の LCC - Win32 というのも使えるそうです ( Using GLUT with LCC - Win32 , 山本 秀一 先生 ご教示ありがとうございました ) .
この他 , 埼玉大学の櫻井 先生が OpenGL と GLUT を Windows9*/NT
で使う方法について OpenGL の部屋に詳しくおまとめになっています .
Mac OS X では標準で OpenGL と GLUT が使えます .
OS に標準で添付されている Developer Tools をインストールしてください .
GLUT は Developer Tools に含まれています .
ソースプログラムも公開されています ( GLUT for Mac OS X ) .
ただし , この Web ページのソースプログラムをそのままコンパイルできるようにするためには , /usr / local / include に GL というディレクトリを掘って , そこに GLUT のソースファイルに含まれている glut.h をコピーするか , そこから / System / Library / Frameworks / GLUT.framework/Headers/glut.h へのシンボリックリンクを張っておく必要があります.
$ sudo mkdir /usr / local / include $ sudo mkdir /usr / local / include / GL $ cd /usr / local / include / GL $ sudo ln -s / System / Library / Frameworks / GLUT.framework/Headers/glut.h .
この最後のシンボリックリンクを作成しない場合は , 以下のソースプログラムにおいて GL / glut.h ではなく GLUT / glut.h を #include するようにしてください ( Mac OS X ではそうするのがスジでしょう ) .
ところで , Mac OS X 10.9 ( Mavericks ) / Xcode 5 以降で GLUT を使ったプログラムをコンパイルすると , " deplicated " ( 非推奨 ) という警告が出ます .
このメッセージは以下の方法で抑制できます.
Xcode 5 のプロジェクトの Build Settings で , OS X Deployment Target として OS X 10.8 以前を選ぶ .
コマンドラインでは -mmacosx-version - min=10.8 というオプションを追加するか , 環境変数 MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
に 10.8 を設定しておく .
あるいは , コマンドラインに - Wdeprecated - declarations というオプションを追加する .
しかし , Mac OS X では OpenGL の Core Profile ( OpenGL 3.2 より前の古い機能との互換性を維持しないモード ) の使用を推奨しており , Compatibility Mode に依存した GLUT はもう使うべきではないのかも知れません .
なお , GLUT の代替として使用でき る GLFW は Mac OS X でも使用でき , Core Profile も選択できます .
このほか , Mac OS X 上の X Window 環境である XQuartz も GLX ( OpenGL Extension ) をサポートしており , この上でも OpenGL を使うことができます .
GLUT も含まれています .
freeglut を使用する場合は , ２．２と同様にソースからコンパイルしてください.
freeglut の場合は , cc ( あるいは gcc ) コマンドに - lglut - lGLU - lGL というオプションを追加するだけでコンパイルできます .
この演習では , このほかに三角関数などの数学ライブラリも使用するので , さらに - lm というオプションも付ける必要があります .
$ cc program .c - lglut - lGLU -lGL -lm
オリジナルの GLUT の場合は , 以下のようなオプションを付ける必要があるかもしれません
( 使う可能性のあるライブラリを全部並べたので , 環境によっては不必要なものも含まれています ) .
$ cc -I/usr / X11R6 / include program.c -L/usr/X11R6/lib - lglut - lGLU -lGL - lXmu - lXi - lXext - lX11 - lm - lpthread
GLUT のソースをコンパイルした場合は , 上のコマンドにおいて glut.h と libglut .
a を置いた場所をオプションで指定してください.
仮に , これらを作成するプログラムと同じディレクトリに置いたとすれば , " - I. - L. " というオプションを追加します .
コンパイルの度に長いコマンドを打つのは面倒だと感じたら , 楽をする方法を考えましょう. これにはいくつかの方法が考えられます.
シェルの関数を定義する
あらかじめ以下のようなコマンドを実行しておきます.
$ function ccgl ( ) { cc - I/usr / X11R6 / include " $@ " - L/usr/X11R6/lib - lglut - lGLU -lGL - lXmu - lXi - lXext - lX11 - lm - lpthread ; }
そうすると , 以降は以下のコマンドでコンパイル ( ＆リンク ) が行えます .
$ ccgl program.c
これを . bashrc の中に書いておけば , ログインする度に alias コマンドを実行する手間が省けます .
シェルスクリプトを書く
以下のような内容のファイル ccgl を作成してください .
#!/bin/sh exec cc - I/usr / X11R6 / include " $@ " -L/usr/X11R6/lib - lglut - lGLU -lGL - lXmu - lXi - lXext - lX11 - lm - lpthread
そのあと chmod コマンドを実行して , このシェルスクリプトを実行可能にします .
$ chmod +x ccgl
以降はこの ccgl コマンドを使ってコンパイルできます .
$ ./ccgl program.c
Makefile を作る
以下の内容の Makefile というファイルを作ります . " -- Tab--> " のところは , タブ ( Tab ) を使って字下げしてください .
CFLAGS = - I/usr / X11R6 / include LDLIBS = -L/usr/X11R6/lib - lglut - lGLU -lGL - lXmu - lXi - lXext - lX11 - lm - lpthread a.out : program .c -- Tab --> $ ( CC ) $ ( CFLAGS ) program .c $ ( LDLIBS )
Makefile のあるディレクトリで make コマンドを実行すると , program .c がコンパイルされて a.out という実行ファイルが生成されます. なお , $ ( CC ) は cc ( または gcc ) コマンドに置き換わります .
なお , この場合 $ ( CC ) の行は , 実は書かなくても大丈夫です ．
$ make
このコマンドは emacs の中から も M-x compile で起動できます .
Makefile にはファイルの 「 生成規則 」を記述します . make は実行すると , Makefile 中の最初の生成規則を探します .
上のファイルの場合 , a.out の行がそれになります .
この行には a.out というターゲットを生成するのに program .c が必要だという依存関係を記述しており , その次の行に実際に a.out を生成するための手続きを記述しています ( 注 ) . この行の行頭は Tab 文字にしてください .
ターゲットが複数あるときは以下のようにします.
CFLAGS = - I/usr / X11R6 / include LDLIBS = -L/usr/X11R6/lib - lglut - lGLU -lGL - lXmu - lXi - lXext - lX11 - lm - lpthread all : prog1 prog2 prog1 : prog1.c -- Tab --> $ ( CC ) $ ( CFLAGS ) prog1.c -o prog1 $ ( LDLIBS ) prog2 : prog2.c -- Tab --> $ ( CC ) $ ( CFLAGS ) prog2.c -o prog2 $ ( LDLIBS )
この最初の生成規則は all の行で , all を生成するには prog1 と prog2 が必要だという依存関係を記述しています .
しかし all の生成方法は記述していないので , make は prog1 と prog2 の両方の生成だけが完了した時点で終了します .
特定のターゲットだけを生成したいときは , そのターゲット名を make の引数に指定します .
$ make prog1
プロジェクトを新規作成する際 に「 Win32 コンソール アプリケーション」を選び , 「 空のプロジェクト」を作成してください .
Visual Studio の使い方を知らない人は , まずこちら ( Visual Studio 2008 ) かこちら ( Visual Studio .NET 2003 ) あるいはこちら ( Visual C++ 6.0 ) を見てください ．
以降で示すプログラムは , UNIX / Linux 系 OS 上での実行を前提に作成しています .
Windows 上で は 「 Win32 コンソール アプリケーション 」 のプロジェクトにすることで , これらのプログラムをそのまま Visual Studio 2008 でコンパイルできるようになります .
プログラムの実行時にコンソールウィンドウを開きたくない場合は , ソースプログラムの先頭に次の 1 行を入れてください .
# pragma comment ( linker , " / subsystem : \" windows \ " / entry : \" mainCRTStartup\ " " )
freeglut あるいは GLUT 3.7.2 以降と Visual Studio の組合わせなら , ソースファイルで GL / glut.h を #include することで , 自動的に freeglut.lib または glut32.lib , glu32.lib , および opengl32.lib がリンクされます ( 山下 真 様 ご教示ありがとうございました ) .
したがって , このままビルドすれば実行ファイルができあがるはずです.
もしうまくいかないようなら , プロジェクトのプロパティ ( Alt + F7 ) を開き , 「 構成プロパティ 」 の 「 リンカ 」 の 「 入力」を選んで , 「 追加の依存ファイル 」 に freeglut.lib または glut32.lib , glu32.lib , および opengl32.lib の三つを追加してください. このほか , 「 C/C ++ 」 の「 プリプロセッサ」を選んで , 「 プリプロセッサの定義 」 に WIN32 が含まれていることを確かめてください ( 無いことは無いと思いますが ) .
もしなければ追加してください .
プログラムをコマンドラインでコンパイルする場合は , cc ( あるいは gcc ) コマンドに以下のようなオプションを付けてください ( 榎本 剛 様 ご教示ありがとうございました ) .
$ cc program .c - framework GLUT - framework OpenGL
Mac OS X 10.9 ( Maverics ) 以降では , GLUT を使用したプログラムはコンパイル時に警告が出ます .
この警告を抑制するには , -mmacosx-version -min=10.8 というオプションを追加してください.
できた a.out を実行すれば , ウィンドウが開きます .
メニューも付いているはずです ( メニューからスクリーンショットの保存ができると思います ) .
Developer Tools に含まれ る Xcode を使う場合は , 既に用意されている GLUT のサンプルプログラムの ( 結合 ) プロジェクトにターゲットを追加するのが , 一番手っ取り早いように思います .
新たにプロジェクトを起こす場合は , 次のような手順になります .
新規プロジェクトとして空のプロジェクトを作成する.
新規ターゲットとしてアプリケーションを追加する.
GLUT. framework および OpenGL.framework の二つのフレームワークを追加する. ソースファイルを作成あるいは追加する. ビルドする .
詳しくはここ ( Xcode 3 ) かここ ( Xcode ) , あるいはここ ( Project Builder ) を参照してください .
なお , ２．４で示したよう に /usr/local / include / GL 等に glut.h を置いていない場合は , ヘッダファイルとして GL / glut.h ではなく GLUT / glut.h を #include してください .
上記の手順が面倒な場合は , このファイルを展開してできる " GLUT Application " というフォルダを / Developer / Library / Xcode / Project Templates / Application というフォルダに入れれば , Xcode 3 で新規プロジェクトを作成するときに , " Application " のところに " GLUT Application " が現れます .
ただし , これは見よう見まねで作ったので , 正しいのかどうかわかりません .
Mac OS X 上で X Window ( X11 ) 用にプログラムをコンパイルするには , ３．１で述べた UNIX 系 OS の場合に準じます .
cc コマンドに以下のオプションを追加してください .
$ cc -I/usr / X11R6 / include program.c -L/usr/X11R6/lib - lglut - lGLU -lGL
いよいよプログラムの作成に入ります .
ウィンドウを開くだけのプログラムは , GLUT を使うとこんな風になります .
このソースプログラムを prog1.c とというファイル名で作成し , コンパイルして出来上がった実行プログラム ( a.out ) を実行してみてください .
#include < GL / glut.h > void display ( void ) { } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv [ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc(display ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
void glutInit ( int * argcp , char ** argv ) GLUT および OpenGL 環境を初期化します .
引数には main の引数をそのまま渡します .
X Window で使われるオプション - display などはここで処理されます .
この関数によって引数の内容が変更されます.
プログラム自身で処理すべき引数があるときは , この後で処理します. int glutCreateWindow ( char * name ) ウィンドウを開きます .
引数 name はそのウィンドウの名前の文字列で , タイトルバーなどに表示されます .
以降の OpenGL による図形の描画等は , 開いたウィンドウに対して行われます. なお , 戻り値は開いたウィンドウの識別子です. void glutDisplayFunc(void ( * func ) ( void ) ) 引数 func は開いたウィンドウ内に描画する関数へのポインタです .
ウィンドウが開かれたり , 他のウィンドウによって隠されたウィンドウが再び現れたりして , ウィンドウを再描画する必要があるときに , この関数が実行されます . したがって , この関数内で図形表示を行います. void glutMainLoop ( void ) これは無限ループです .
この関数を呼び出すことで , プログラムはイベントの待ち受け状態になります.
見れば分かる通り , プログラムは ,
初期化して , ウィンドウを開いて , そのウィンドウ内に絵を描く関数を決めて , 何かことが起こるのを待つ .
という順になります .
C 言語の教科書なんかに良く出てくる 「 標準入出力を使ったプログラム」なんかと違うところは , 中心となる処理 ( この場合 display ( ) ) を実行するタイミングが , ソースプログラムを見ただけでは何時なのかわからない , というところでしょうか .
最初に display ( ) が実行されるのは , 初めてウィンドウが開いたとき , すなわち , glutMainLoop ( ) が glutCreateWindow ( )
の指示を受けてウィンドウの生成を完了したときになります.
また , その後も , このウィンドウがほかのウィンドウに隠され再び現れたときのように , ウィンドウの再描画が必要になったときに実行されます.
上のプログラムでは display ( ) の中身に何も記述していないため , display ( ) が呼び出されても何も仕事をしません .
試しにこのウィンドウを移動したり , 他のウィンドウで隠したりしてみてください.
ウィンドウの中の表示はおかしなものになっていると思います.
このように複数の ( オーバーラップ可能な ) ウィンドウが使用できるウィンドウシステムに対応したプログラムでは , 処理の流れは時間軸に沿って「プログラムの始めから終りへ」ではなく , 何かこと ( 事象 ) が起るたび に 「 プログラムの各部がランダムに」実行されます.
従って , そのプログラミングスタイルも , 「 事象」に対して , その 「対処方法」を登録していくというものになります.
ここではこの事象をイベントと呼び , 対処方法の手続きをハンドラと呼ぶことにします.
なお , このプログラムに は 「 終了する方法」を組み込んでいないので , プログラムを終了するには実行したウィンドウで
Ctrl - C をタイプするか , ウィンドウを閉じてください .
今までは関数 display ( ) の中に何も記述していなかったので , ウィンドウの中身はでたらめ ( おそらく , そのウィンドウの位置に以前に描かれていた内容の残骸 ) だと思います .
そこで , 今度は開いたウィンドウを塗りつぶしてみます. prog1.c に太字のところを追加し , もう一度コンパイルしてプログラムを実行してみてください .
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } void init ( void ) { glClearColor ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
void glutInitDisplayMode( unsigned int mode ) ディスプレイの表示モードを設定します .
mode に GLUT_RGBA を指定した場合は , 色の指定を RGB ( 赤緑青 , 光の三原色 ) で行えるようにします .
他にインデックスカラーモード ( GLUT_INDEX ) も指定できます .
後者はうまく使えば効率の良い表示が行えますが , それなりに面倒なので , ここではお任せで使える RGBA モードを使います .
void glClearColor ( GLclampf R , GLclampf G , GLclampf B , GLclampf A ) glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT )
でウィンドウを塗りつぶす際の色を指定します .
R，G，B はそれぞれ赤 , 緑 , 青色の成分の強さを示す GLclampf 型 ( float 型と等価 ) の値で , 0〜1 の間の値を持ちます .
1 が最も明るく , この三つに ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) を指定すれば黒色 , ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) を指定すれば白色になります .
上の例ではウィンドウは 青色 で塗りつぶされます .
最後の A はα値と呼ばれ , OpenGL では不透明度として扱われます ( 0 で透明 , 1 で不透明 ) .
ここではとりあえず 1 にしておいてください. void glClear ( GLbitfield mask ) ウィンドウを塗りつぶします .
mask には塗りつぶすバッファを指定します .
OpenGL が管理する画面上のバッファ ( メモリ ) には , 色を格納するカラーバッファの他 , 隠面消去処理に使うデプスバッファ , 凝ったことをするときに使うステンシルバッファ , カラーバッファの上に重ねて表示されるオーバーレイバッファなど , いくつかのものがあり , これらが一つのウィンドウに重なって存在しています.
mask に GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT
を指定したときは , カラーバッファだけが塗りつぶされます. glFlush ( void ) glFlush ( ) はまだ実行されていない OpenGL の命令を全部実行します .
OpenGL は関数呼び出しによって生成される OpenGL の命令をその都度実行するのではなく , いくつか溜め込んでおいてまとめて実行します .
このため , ある程度命令が溜まらないと 関数を呼び出しても実行が開始されない場合があります. glFlush ( ) はそういう状況で まだ実行されていない残りの命令の実行を開始します. ひんぱんに glFlush ( ) を呼び出すと , かえって描画速度が低下します .
glClearColor ( ) は , プログラムの実行中に背景色を変更することがなければ , 最初に一度だけ設定すれば十分です. そこでこのような初期化処理を行う関数は , glMainLoop ( ) の前に実行する関数 init ( ) にまとめて置くことにします .
glFlush ( ) のかわりに glFinish ( ) を使う場合もあります. これは , glFlush ( ) がまだ実行されていない OpenGL の命令の実行開始を促すのに加えて , glFinish ( ) はそれがすべて完了するのを待ちます .
gl * ( ) で始まる ( glu * ( ) や glut * ( ) で始まらない ) 関数が , OpenGL の API です .
ウィンドウ内に線を引いてみます. prog1.c を以下のように変更し , コンパイルしてプログラムを実行してください.
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glBegin( GL_LINE_LOOP ) ; glVertex2d ( - 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( - 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
void glBegin( GLnum mode ) void glEnd ( void ) 図形を描くには , glBegin ( ) 〜glEnd ( ) の間にその図形の各頂点の座標値を設定する関数を置きます. glBegin ( ) の引数 mode には描画する図形のタイプを指定します .
void glVertex2d ( GLdouble x , GLdouble y) glVertex2d ( ) は二次元の座標値を設定するのに使います.
引数の型は GLdouble ( double と等価 ) です. 引数が float 型のときは glVertex2f ( ) , int 型のときは glVertex2i ( ) を使います .
描かれる図形は , ( - 0.9 , - 0.9 ) と ( 0.9 , 0.9 ) の 2 点を対角線とする正方形です .
これがウィンドウに対して 「 一回り小さく」描かれます.
このウィンドウの大きさと図形の大きさの比率は , ウィンドウを各台縮小しても変化しません.
これはウィンドウの x 軸と y 軸の範囲が , ともに [ - 1 , 1 ] に固定されているからです .
glBegin ( ) の引数 mode に指定できる図形のタイプには以下のようなものがあります .
詳しくは man glBegin を参照してください .
GL_POINTS 点を打ちます .
GL_LINES 2 点を対にして , その間を直線で結びます .
GL_LINE_STRIP
折れ線を描きます .
GL_LINE_LOOP
折れ線を描きます .
始点と終点の間も結ばれます .
GL_TRIANGLES / GL_QUADS 3 / 4 点を組にして , 三角形 / 四角形を描きます .
GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
/ GL_QUAD_STRIP
一辺を共有しながら帯状に三角形／四角形を描きます .
GL_TRIANGLE_FAN
一辺を共有しながら扇状に三角形を描きます .
GL_POLYGON 凸多角形を描きます .
OpenGL を処理するハードウェアは , 実際には三角形しか塗り潰すことができません ( モノによっては四角形もできるものもあります ) .
このため GL_POLYGON の場合は , 多角形を三角形に分割してから処理します.
従って , もし描画速度が重要な ら GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
や GL_TRIANGLE_FAN
を使うよう プログラムを工夫してみてください . また GL_QUADS も GL_POLYGON より高速です .
線に色を付けてみます . prog1.c を以下のように変更し , コンパイルしてください .
プログラムを実行したら線は何色で表示されたでしょうか?
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glColor3d ( 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_LINE_LOOP ) ; glVertex2d ( - 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( - 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
void glColor3d ( GLdouble r , GLdouble g , GLdouble b) glColor3d ( ) はこれから描画するものの色を指定します.
引数の型は GLdouble 型 ( double と等価 ) で , r，g，b にはそれぞれ赤 , 緑 , 青の強さを 0〜1 の範囲で指定します . 引数が float 型のときは glColor3f ( ) , int 型のときは glColor3i ( ) を使います .
図形を塗りつぶしてみます .
GL_LINE_LOOP を GL_POLYGON に変更し , ついでに背景も白色に変更しましょう .
変更したプログラムをコンパイルして実行してください.
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glColor3d ( 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_POLYGON ) ; glVertex2d ( - 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glVertex2d ( - 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } void init ( void ) { glClearColor ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
色は頂点毎に指定することもできます. glBegin( ) の前の glColor3d ( ) を消して , かわりに四つの glVertex2d ( ) の前に glColor3d ( ) を置きます .
prog1.c を以下のように変更してください.
コンパイルしてプログラムを実行すると , どういう色の付き方になったでしょうか?
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glBegin( GL_POLYGON ) ; glColor3d ( 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 赤 */ glVertex2d( -0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glColor3d ( 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 緑 */ glVertex2d( 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glColor3d ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 ) ; /* 青 */ glVertex2d( 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glColor3d ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 黄 */ glVertex2d ( - 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
多分 , 多角形の内部は頂点の色から補間した色で塗りつぶされたと思います.
このプログラムは後で使用するので , prog2.c というコピーを作っておいてください.
$ cp prog1.c prog2.c
glVertex *( ) や glColor *( ) のような関数の * の部分は , 引数の型や数などを示しています .
詳しくは man glVertex2d や man glColor3d を参照してください .
ウィンドウ内に表示する図形の座標軸は , そのウィンドウ自体の大きさと図形表示を行う
" 空間 " との関係で決定します .
開いたウィンドウの位置や大きさはマウスを使って変更することができますが , その情報はウィンドウマネージャを通じて , イベントとしてプログラムに伝えられます.
これまでのプログラムでは , ウィンドウのサイズを変更すると表示内容もそれにつれて拡大縮小していました.
これを表示内容の大きさを変えずに表示領域のみを広げるようにします.
prog1.c に以下のように resize ( ) という関数を追加し , glutReshapeFunc ( ) を使って それをウィンドウのリサイズ ( 拡大縮小 ) のイベントに対するハンドラに指定します .
プログラムが変更できたらコンパイルしてプログラムを実行し , 開いたウィンドウを拡大縮小してみてください.
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void resize ( int w , int h ) {
/* ウィンドウ全体をビューポートにする */ glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; /* 変換行列の初期化 */ glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* スクリーン上の表示領域をビューポートの大きさに比例させる */ glOrtho(-w / 200.0 , w / 200.0 , -h / 200.0 , h / 200.0 , - 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
void glViewport ( GLint x , GLint y , GLsizei w , GLsizei h ) ビューポートを設定します .
ビューポートとは , 開いたウィンドウの中で , 実際に描画が行われる領域のことをいいます.
正規化デバイス座標系の 2 点 ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) を結ぶ線分を対角線とする矩形領域がここに表示されます.
最初の二つの引数 x , y にはその領域の左下隅の位置 , w には幅 , h には高さをデバイス座標系での値 , すなわちディスプレイ上の画素数で指定します. 関数 resize ( ) の引数 w , h にはそれぞれウィンドウの幅と高さが入っていますから , glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) はリサイズ後のウィンドウの全面を表示領域に使うことになります. void glLoadIdentity ( void ) これは変換行列に単位行列を設定します .
座標変換の合成は行列の積で表されますから , 変換行列には初期値として単位行列を設定しておきます.
void glOrtho( GLdouble l , GLdouble r , GLdouble b , GLdouble t , GLdouble n , GLdouble f ) glOrtho ( ) はワールド座標系を正規化デバイス座標系に平行投影
( orthographic projection : 正射影 ) する行列を変換行列に乗じます .
引数には左から , l に表示領域の左端 ( left ) の位置 , r に右端 ( right ) の位置 , b に下端 ( bottom ) の位置 , t に上端 ( top ) の位置 , n に前方面 ( near ) の位置 , f に後方面 ( far ) の位置を指定します .
これは , ビューポートに表示される空間の座標軸を設定します. glutReshapeFunc(void ( * func ) ( int w , int h ) ) 引数 func には , ウィンドウがリサイズされたときに実行する関数のポインタを与えます .
この関数の引数にはリサイズ後のウィンドウの幅と高さが渡されます.
resize ( ) の処理によって , プログラムは glViewport ( ) で指定した領域に glOrtho ( ) で指定した領域内の図形を表示するようになります. ここで glOrtho ( ) で指定するの領域の大きさをビューポートの大きさに比例するように設定すれば , 表示内容の大きさをビューポートの大きさにかかわらず一定に保つことができます.
ここでビューポートの大きさは開いたウィンドウの大きさと一致させていますから , ウィンドウのリサイズしても表示内容の大きさを一定に保つことができます.
図形はワールド座標系と呼ばれる空間にあり , その 2 点 ( l , b ) , ( r , t ) を結ぶ線分を対角線とする矩形領域を , 2 点 ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) を対角線とする矩形領域に投影します .
この投影された座標系を正規化デバイス座標系
( あるいはクリッピング座標系 ) と呼びます .
この正規化デバイス座標系の正方形領域内の図形がデバイス座標系
( ディスプレイ上の表示領域の座標系 ) のビューポートに表示されますから , 結果的にワールド座標系から glOrtho( )
で指定した矩形領域を切り取ってビューポートに表示することになります.
ワールド座標系から切り取る領域は , " ＣＧ用語 " 的には 「 ウィンドウ」と呼ばれ , ワールド座標系から正規化デバイス座標系への変換は
「 ウィンドウイング変換」と呼ばれます. しかしウィンドウシステム ( X Window , MS Windows 等) においては , 「 ウィンドウ」はアプリケーションプログラムが
ディスプレイ上に作成する表示領域のことを指すので , ここの説明ではこれを「座標軸」と呼んでいます. なお , 正規化デバイス座標系からデバイス座標系への変換はビューポート変換と呼ばれます.
glOrtho ( ) では引数として l , r , t , b の他に n と f も指定する必要があります .
実は OpenGL は二次元図形の表示においても内部的に三次元の処理を行っており , ワールド座標系は奥行き ( Z ) 方向にも軸を持つ三次元空間になっています .
n と f には , それぞれこの空間の前方面 ( 可視範囲の手前側の限界 ) と後方面 ( 可視範囲の遠方の限界 ) を指定します .
n より手前にある面や f より遠方にある面は表示されません .
二次元図形は奥行き ( Z ) 方向が 0 の三次元図形として取り扱われるので , ここでは n ( 前方面 , 可視範囲の手前の位置 ) を - 1.0 , f ( 後方面 , 遠方の位置 ) を 1 にしています .
glOrtho ( ) を使用しなければ変換行列は単位行列のままなので , ワールド座標系と正規化デバイス座標系は一致し , ワールド座標系の 2 点 ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) を対角線とする矩形領域がビューポートに表示されます.
ビューポート内に表示する空間の座標軸が変化しないため , この状態でウィンドウのサイズを変化させると , それに応じて表示される図形のサイズも変わります.
初期状態はこのようになっています.
表示図形のサイズをビューポートの大きさにかかわらず一定にするには , glOrtho ( ) で指定するの領域の大きさをビューポートの大きさに比例するように設定します.
例えばワールド座標系の座標軸が上記と同様に l , r , t , b , n , f で与えられており , もともとのウィンドウの大きさ が
W×H , リサイズ後のウィンドウの大きさが w×h なら , glOrtho(l * w / W , r * w / W , b * h / H , t * h / H , n , f ) とします .
上のプログラムでは , ワールド座標系の 2 点 ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) を対角線とする矩形領域 を
200×200 の大きさのウィンドウに表示した時の表示内容の大きさが 常に保たれるよう設定しています .
プログラムの起動時に開くウィンドウの位置やサイズを指定したいときは , glutInitWindowPosition ( ) および glutInitWindowSize ( ) を使います .
これらを使用しなければ , プログラムが起動したときに開かれるウィンドウのサイズは
ウィンドウマネージャの設定に従います. prog1.c に試しに太字の部分を追加してみてください.
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInitWindowPosition ( 100 , 100 ) ; glutInitWindowSize ( 320 , 240 ) ; glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
void glutInitWindowSize ( int w , int h ) 新たに開くウィンドウの幅と高さを指定します .
これを指定しないときは , 300×300 のウィンドウを開きます. void glutInitWindowPosition ( int x , int y ) 新たに開くウィンドウの位置を指定します .
これを指定しないときは , ウィンドウマネージャによってウィンドウを開く位置を決定します.
X Window の場合 , - geometry オプションによって コマンドラインからウィンドウを開く位置やサイズを指定できます. これは glutInit ( ) によって処理されるので , - geometry オプションを有効にするには glutInitWindowPosition ( ) と glutInitWindowSize ( ) を glutInit ( ) より前に置き , 無効にするには後に置きます .
マウスのボタンを押したことを知るには , glutMouseFunc ( ) という関数で マウスのボタンを操作したときに呼び出す関数を指定します.
prog1.c を以下のように変更してください .
#include < stdio.h > # include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; /* 途中削除 */ glFlush ( ) ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) {
/* ウィンドウ全体をビューポートにする */ glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; /* 変換行列の初期化 */ glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 以下削除 */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { switch ( button ) { case GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON : printf ( " left " ) ; break ; case GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON : printf ( " middle " ) ; break ; case GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON : printf ( " right " ) ; break ; default : break ; } printf ( " button is " ) ; switch ( state ) { case GLUT_UP : printf ( " up " ) ; break ; case GLUT_DOWN : printf ( " down " ) ; break ; default : break ; } printf ( " at ( %d , %d )
" , x , y ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInitWindowPosition ( 100 , 100 ) ; glutInitWindowSize ( 320 , 240 ) ; glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; glutMouseFunc( mouse ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
glutMouseFunc( void ( * func ) ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) ) 引数 func には , マウスのボタンが押されたときに実行する関数のポインタを与えます.
この関数の引数 button には押されたボタ ン
( GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON , GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON , GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON ) , state には 「 押した ( GLUT_DOWN ) 」のか「 離した ( GLUT_UP ) 」のか , x と y にはその位置が渡されます .
プログラムが変更できたら , コンパイルしてプログラムを実行してみてください.
開いたウィンドウの上でマウスのボタンをクリックしてみてください.
x と y に渡される座標は , ウィンドウの左上隅を原点 ( 0 , 0 ) とした画面上の画素の位置になります .
デバイス座標系とは上下が反転している ので気をつけてください .
マウスの位置をもとに図形を描く場合は , マウスの位置からウィンドウ上の座標値を求めなければなりません.
ここではちょっと手を抜いて , ワールド座標系がこのマウスの座標系に一致するよう glOrtho( ) を設定します ( 上図 ) .
またウィンドウの上下も反転します ( prog1.c の下線部 ) .
prog1.c を以下のように変更してください .
#include < stdio.h > # include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void resize ( int w , int h ) {
/* ウィンドウ全体をビューポートにする */ glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; /* 変換行列の初期化 */ glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* スクリーン上の座標系をマウスの座標系に一致させる */ glOrtho( - 0.5 , ( GLdouble ) w - 0.5 , ( GLdouble ) h - 0.5 , - 0.5 , - 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { static int x0 , y0 ; switch ( button ) { case GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON : if ( state == GLUT_UP ) { /* ボタンを押した位置から離した位置まで線を引く */ glColor3d( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_LINES ) ; glVertex 2i ( x0 , y0 ) ; glVertex 2i( x , y ) ; glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } else { /* ボタンを押した位置を覚える */ x0 = x ; y0 = y ; } break ; case GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON : /* 削除 */ break ; case GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON : /* 削除 */ break ; default : break ; } /* 以下削除 */ } void init( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
前のプログラムでは , ウィンドウのサイズを変えたり ウインドウが他のウィンドウに隠されたあと再び表示される度に , ウィンドウの中身が消えてしまいます . やはり , この場合もちゃんと書き直してやる必要があるわけですが , そのためにはそれまでに表示した内容を記憶しておかなければなりません.
mouse ( ) が実行されたときに , 配列に現在の位置を記憶しておき , display ( ) が実行されたときに , それをまとめて描画するようにします. prog1.c を以下のように変更してください .
#include < stdio.h > # include < GL/glut.h > # define MAXPOINTS
100 /* 記憶する点の数 */ GLint point [ MAXPOINTS ] [ 2 ] ; /* 座標を記憶する配列 */ int pointnum = 0 ; /* 記憶した座標の数 */ void display ( void ) { int i ; glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; /* 記録したデータで線を描く */ if ( pointnum > 1 ) { glColor3d ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_LINES ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < pointnum ; ++i ) { glVertex2iv( point [ i ] ) ; } glEnd ( ) ; } glFlush ( ) ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 削除 */ switch ( button ) { case GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON : /* ボタンを操作した位置を記録する */ point [ pointnum ] [ 0 ] = x ; point [ pointnum ] [ 1 ] = y ; if ( state == GLUT_UP ) { /* ボタンを押した位置から離した位置まで線を引く */ glColor3d( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_LINES ) ; glVertex2iv( point [ pointnum - 1 ] ) ; /* 一つ前は押した位置 */ glVertex2iv( point [ pointnum ] ) ; /* 今の位置は離した位置 */ glEnd( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } else { /* 削除 */ } if ( pointnum < MAXPOINTS - 1 ) ++ pointnum ; break ; case GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON : break ; case GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON : break ; default : break ; } } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
glVertex2iv( const GLint * v ) この関数は glVertex2i ( ) と同様に二次元の座標値を設定しますが , 引数 v には 2 個の要素をも つ GLint 型 ( int と等価 ) の配列を指定します . v [ 0 ] には x 座標値 , v [ 1 ] には y 座標値を格納します .
この例のように , 複数の点の座標を指定する場合に便利です .
マウスのボタンを押しながらマウスを動かす操作を , ドラッグと言います . ドラッグ中はマウスの位置を継続的に取得する必要がありますが , glutMouseFunc ( ) で指定するハンドラはボタンを押したときにしか実行されないので , この目的には使用できません .
マウスを動かしたときに実行する関数を指定するには , glutMotionfunc ( ) または glutPassiveMotionFunc( ) を使用します. glutMotionfunc ( ) で指定した関数は , マウスのボタンを押しながらマウスを動かしたときに実行されます. glutPassiveMotionFunc( ) で指定した関数は , マウスのボタンを押さずにマウスを動かしたときに実行されます.
前のプログラムでは , マウスの左ボタンを押してから離すまでウィンドウには何も表示されませんでした.
これを , マウスのドラッグ中は線分をマウスに追従して描くようにします.
このような効果をラバーバンド ( 輪ゴム ) と言います. こ のために glutMotionFunc ( ) を使って , マウスのドラッグ中にラバーバンドを表示するようにします
( 大川 様 ご指摘ありがとうございました ) .

glEnable ( GLenum cap ) 引数 cap に指定した機能を使用可能にします .
GL_LOGIC_OP もしくは GL_COLOR_LOGIC_OP
は , 図形の描画の際にウィンドウに既に描かれている内容と , これから描こうとする内容の間で論理演算を行うことができるようにします. glDisable ( GLenum cap ) 引数 cap に指定した機能を使用不可にします.
glLogicOp( GLenum opcode ) 引数 opcode にはウィンドウに描かれている内容と , これから描こうとする内容との間で行う論理演算のタイプを指定します .
GL_COPY はこれから描こうとする内容をそのままウィンドウ内に描きます .
GL_INVERT はウィンドウに描かれている内容の , これから描こうとする図形の領域を反転します. 詳しくは man glLogicOp を参照してください .
glutMotionFunc( void ( * func ) ( int x , int y ) ) 引数 func には , マウスのいずれかのボタンを押しながらマウスを動かしたときに 実行する関数のポインタを与えます .
この関数の引数 x と y には , 現在のマウスの位置が渡されます .
この設定を解除するには , 引数に 0 ( ヌルポインタ ) を指定します ( stdio.h 等の中で定義されている記号定数 NULL を使用しても良い ) .
ラバーバンドを実現する場合 , マウスを動かしたときに直前に描いたラバーバンドを消す必要があります.
また , ラバーバンドを描いたことによって ウィンドウに既に描かれていた内容が壊されてしまうので , その部分をもう一度描き直す必要があります . しかし , そのために画面全体を書き換えるのは , ちょっともったいない気がします .
そこでラバーバンドを描く際には , 線を背景とは異なる色で描く代わりに , 描こうとする線上の画素の色を反転するようにします.
こうすればもう一度同じ線上の画素の色を反転することで , そこに描かれていた以前の線が消えてウィンドウに描かれた図形が元に戻ります. このために glLogicOp ( ) を使用します. glLogicOp ( ) で指定した論理演算は , glEnable ( GL_LOGIC_OP ) ＜白黒の場合＞あるいは glEnable ( GL_COLOR_LOGIC_OP
) ＜カラーの場合＞で有効になります ( 陳 先生 ご指摘ありがとうございました ) .
ただし , マウスのボタンを押した直後はまだラバーバンドは描かれていませんから , そのときだけラバーバンドの消去は行わないようにしなければなりません.
このため rubberband なんていう変数を使ったちょっと泥臭いプログラムになっていますが , 我慢してください ( もっとエレガントな方法もありますけど ) .
glutMotionFunc( ) , glutPassiveMotionFunc( ) で指定した関数は , マウスの移動にともなって頻繁に実行されるので , この関数の中で時間のかかる処理を行うと , マウスの応答が悪くなってしまいます .
これを避ける方法は９節以降で解説します.
OpenGL のアプリケーションプログラムが開いたウィンドウには , ターミナルウィンドウのようにキーボード入力を行うことができません.
そのかわりマウスのボタン同様 , キーをタイプするごとに実行する関数を指定できます. それには glutKeyboardFunc ( ) を使います .
これまで作ったプログラムは , プログラムを終了する方法を組み込んでいませんでした. そこで q のキーや ESC キーをタイプしたときに exit ( ) を呼び出して , プログラムが終了するようにします. また exit ( ) を使うために stdlib.h も include します.
prog1.c を以下のように変更してください .
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < GL/glut.h > # define MAXPOINTS
100 /* 記憶する点の数 */ GLint point [ MAXPOINTS ] [ 2 ] ; /* 座標を記憶する配列 */ int pointnum = 0 ; /* 記憶した座標の数 */ int rubberband = 0 ; /* ラバーバンドの消去 */ void display ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void motion ( int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { switch ( key ) { case ' q ' : case ' Q ' : case ' \033 ' : /* ' \ 033 ' は ESC の ASCII コード */ exit ( 0 ) ; default : break ; } } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInitWindowPosition ( 100 , 100 ) ; glutInitWindowSize ( 320 , 240 ) ; glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; glutMouseFunc( mouse ) ; glutMotionFunc( motion ) ; glutKeyboardFunc( keyboard ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
glutKeyboard Func(void ( * func ) ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) ) 引数 func には , キーがタイプされたときに実行する関数のポインタを与えます.
この関数の引数 key にはタイプされたキーの ASCII コードが渡されます .
また x と y にはキーがタイプされたときのマウスの位置が渡されます .
ファンクションキーのような文字キー以外のタイプを検出するときは glutSpecialFunc( ) , Shift や Ctrl のようなモディファイア ( 修飾 ) キーを検出するには glutGetModifiers ( ) を使います .
使い方はいずれも man コマンドで調べてください .
これまでは二次元の図形の表示を行ってきましたが , OpenGL の内部では実際には三次元の処理を行っています .
すなわち画面表示に対して垂直に
Z 軸が伸びており , これまではその三次元空間の xy 平面への平行投影像を表示していました .
試しに５．４節で作成したプログラム ( prog2.c ) において , 図形を y 軸中心に 25 度回転してみましょう .
#include < GL/glut.h > void display ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glRotated ( 25.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_POLYGON ) ; glColor3d ( 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 赤 */ glVertex2d( -0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glColor3d ( 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 緑 */ glVertex2d( 0.9 , - 0.9 ) ; glColor3d ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 ) ; /* 青 */ glVertex2d( 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glColor3d ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 黄 */ glVertex2d( - 0.9 , 0.9 ) ; glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } void init ( void ) { glClearColor ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
コンパイルしたプログラムを実行して , 描かれる図形を見てください .
Y 軸中心に回転しているため , 以前に比べて少し縦長になっていると思います .
このウィンドウを最小化したり他のウィンドウを重ねたりして , 再描画をさせてみましょう. 再描画する度に図形の形が変わると思います. これは変換行列に glRotated ( ) による回転の行列が積算されるからです.
これを防ぐには描画の度に変換マトリクスを glLoadIdentity ( ) で初期化するか , 後で述べる glPushMatrix ( ) / glPopMatrix ( ) を使って変換行列を保存します .
それでは , こんどは以下のような三次元の立方体を線画で描いてみましょう. glut には glutWireCube ( ) など , いくつか基本的な立体を描く関数があるのですが , ここでは自分で形状を定義してみたいと思います .
この図形は 8 個の点を 12 本の線分で結びます .
点の位置 ( 幾何情報 ) と線分 ( 位相情報 ) を別々にデータにします .
GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { { 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , /* A */ { 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , /* B */ { 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , /* C */ { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , /* D */ { 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , /* E */ { 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , /* F */ { 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 } , /* G */ { 0.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 } /* H */ } ; int edge [ ] [ 2 ] = { { 0 , 1 } , /* ア ( A - B ) */ { 1 , 2 } , /* イ ( B - C ) */ { 2 , 3 } , /* ウ ( C - D ) */ { 3 , 0 } , /* エ ( D - A ) */ { 4 , 5 } , /* オ ( E - F ) */ { 5 , 6 } , /* カ ( F - G ) */ { 6 , 7 } , /* キ ( G - H ) */ { 7 , 4 } , /* ク ( H - E ) */ { 0 , 4 } , /* ケ ( A - E ) */ { 1 , 5 } , /* コ ( B - F ) */ { 2 , 6 } , /* サ ( C - G ) */ { 3 , 7 } /* シ ( D - H ) */ } ;
この場合 , 例えば " 点 C " ( 1,1,0 ) と " 点 D " ( 0,1,0 ) を結ぶ線分 " ウ " は , 以下のようにして描画できます. glVertex3dv( ) は , 引数に三つの要素を持つ GLdouble 型 ( double と等価 ) の配列のポインタを与えて , 頂点を指定します .
glBegin( GL_LINES ) ; glVertex3dv( vertex[edge [ 2 ] [ 0 ] ] ) ; /* 線分 " ウ " の一つ目の端点 " C " */ glVertex3dv( vertex[edge [ 2 ] [ 1 ] ] ) ; /* 線分 " ウ " の二つ目の端 点 " D " */ glEnd ( ) ;
従って立方体全部を描くプログラムは以下のようになります. なお , 立方体がウィンドウからはみ出ないように , glOrtho ( ) で表示する座標系を ( - 2 , - 2 ) 〜( 2,2 ) にしています .
prog2.c を以下のように変更してください .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { { 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , { 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , { 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , { 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , { 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 } , { 0.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 } } ; int edge [ ] [ 2 ] = { { 0 , 1 } , { 1 , 2 } , { 2 , 3 } , { 3 , 0 } , { 4 , 5 } , { 5 , 6 } , { 6 , 7 } , { 7 , 4 } , { 0 , 4 } , { 1 , 5 } , { 2 , 6 } , { 3 , 7 } } ; void display ( void ) { int i ; glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glColor3d ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_LINES ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 12 ; ++i ) { glVertex3 dv( vertex[edge [ i ] [ 0 ] ] ) ; glVertex3 dv( vertex[edge [ i ] [ 1 ] ] ) ; } glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; glOrtho( - 2.0 , 2.0 , - 2.0 , 2.0 , - 2.0 , 2.0 ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
glVertex3dv( const GLdouble * v ) glVertex3dv ( ) は三次元の座標値を指定するのに使います.
引数 v は 3 個の要素を持つ GLdouble 型 ( double と等価 ) 配列を指定します . v [ 0 ] には x 座標値 , v [ 1 ] には y 座標値 , v [ 2 ] には z 座標値を格納します .
前のプログラムでは , 立方体が画面に平行投影されるため , 正方形しか描かないと思います .
そこで現実のカメラのように透視投影をしてみます. これには glOrtho( ) の代わりに gluPerspective ( ) を使います .
gluPerspective ( ) は座標軸の代わりに , カメラの画角やスクリーンのアスペクト比 ( 縦横比 ) を用いて表示領域を指定します. また glOrtho( ) 同様 , 前方面や後方面の位置の指定も行います .
視点の位置の初期値は原点なので , このままでは立方体が視点に重なってしまいます. そこで glTranslated ( ) を使って立方体の位置を少し奥にずらしておきます.
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int edge [ ] [ 2 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; void display ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void resize ( int w , int h ) { glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; gluPerspective ( 30.0 , ( double ) w / ( double ) h , 1.0 , 100.0 ) ; glTranslated ( 0.0 , 0.0 , - 5.0 ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
gluPerspective ( GLdouble fovy , GLdouble aspect , GLdouble zNear , GLdouble z Far ) 変換行列に透視変換の行列を乗じます .
最初の引数 fovy はカメラの画角であり , 度で表します .
これが大きいほどワイドレンズ ( 透視が強くなり , 絵が小さくなります ) になり , 小さいほど望遠レンズになります .
二つ目の引数 aspect は画面のアスペクト比 ( 縦横比 ) であり , 1 であればビューポートに表示される図形の x 方向と y 方向のスケールが等しくなります .
三つ目の引数 zNear と四つ目の引 数
zFar は表示を行う奥行き方向の範囲で , zNear は手前 ( 前方面 ) , zFar は後方 ( 後方面 ) の位置を示します .
この間にある図形が描画されます. glTranslated ( GLdouble x , GLdouble y , GLdouble z ) 変換行列に平行移動の行列を乗じます .
引数はいずれも GLdouble 型 ( double と等価 ) で , 三つの引数 x , y , z には現在の位置からの相対的な移動量を指定します. 引数が float 型なら glTranslatef ( ) を使います .
ウィンドウをリサイズしたときに表示図形がゆがまないようにするためには , gluPerspective ( ) で設定するアスペクト比 aspect を , glViewport ( ) で指定したビューポートの縦横比 ( w/h ) と一致させます .
上のプログラムのように , リサイズ後のウィンドウのサイズをそのままビューポートに設定している場合 , 仮に aspect が定数であれば , ウィンドウのリサイズに伴って表示図形が伸縮するようになります.
したがって , ウィンドウをリサイズしても表示図形の縦横比が変わらないようにするために , ここでは aspect をビューポートの縦横比に設定しています .
前のプログラムのように , 視点の位置を移動するには , 図形の方を glTranslated ( ) や glRotated ( ) を用いて逆方向に移動することで実現できます. しかし , 視点を任意の位置に指定したいときには gluLookAt ( ) を使うと便利です .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int edge [ ] [ 2 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; void display ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void resize ( int w , int h ) { glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; gluPerspective ( 30.0 , ( double ) w / ( double ) h , 1.0 , 100.0 ) ; gluLook At ( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
void gluLookAt ( GLdouble ex , GLdouble ey , GLdouble ez , GLdouble cx , GLdouble cy , GLdouble cz , GLdouble ux , GLdouble uy , GLdouble uz ) この最初の三つの引数 ex , ey , ez は視点の位置 , 次の三つの引数 cx , cy , cz は目標の位置 , 最後の三つの引 数 ux , uy , uz は , ウィンドウに表示される画像の 「 上」 の方向を示すベクトルです .
この例では ( 3,4,5 ) の位置から原点 ( 0,0,0 ) を眺めますから , 立方体の A ( 0,0,0 ) の頂点がウィンドウの中心に来ると思います .
なお , gluPerspective ( ) , gluLookAt ( ) 等 , glu * ( ) で始まる関数は GL Utility ライブラリ ( - lGLU ) の関数です .
ここまでできたら , 今度はこの立方体を回してみましょう .
それにはちょっと工夫が必要です .
アニメーションを行うには , 頻繁に画面の書き換えを行う必要があります. しかし glutMailLoop ( ) は無限ループであり , glutDisplayFunc ( ) で指定された関数は , ウィンドウを再描画するイベントが発生したときにしか呼び出されません.
したがってアニメーションを実現するには , このウィンドウの再描画イベントを連続的に発生させる必要があります.
プログラム中でウィンドウの再描画イベントを発生させるには , glutPostRedisplay ( ) 関数を用います .
これをプログラムが「暇なとき」に繰り返し呼び出すことで , アニメーションが実現できます. プログラムが暇になったときに実行する関数は , glutIdleFunc ( ) で指定します .
一つ注意しなければいけないことがあります .
繰り返し描画を行うには , 描画の度に座標変換の行列を設定する必要があります.
ところで座標変換のプロセスは ,
図形の空間中での位置を決める 「 モデリング変換 」 その空間を視点から見た空間に直す「 ビューイング ( 視野 ) 変換 」 その空間をコンピュータ内の空間にあるスクリーンに投影する「 透視変換 」 スクリーン上の図形をディスプレイ上の表示領域に切り出す「 ビューポート変換」
という四つのステップで行われます .
今行おうとしている図形を回すという変換は , 「 モデリング変換」に相当します .
これまではこれらを区別 せずに取り扱ってきました .
すなわち , これらの投影を行う行列式を掛け合わせることで , 単一の行列式として取り扱ってきたのです .
しかし図形だけを動かす場合は , モデリング変換の行列だけを変更すればいいことになります.
また , 後で述べる陰影付けは , 透視変換を行う前の座標系で計算する必要があります.
そこで OpenGL では , 「 モデリング変換−ビューイング変換」の変換行列 ( モデルビュー変換行列 ) と , 「 透視変換」の変換行列を独立して取り扱う手段が提供されています.
モデルビュー変換行列を設定する場合は glMatrixMode ( GL_MODELVIEW ) , 透視変換行列を設定する場合は glMatrixMode ( GL_PROJECTION ) を実行します .
カメラの画角などのパラメータを変更しなければ , 透視変換行列を設定しなければならないのはウィンドウを開いたときだけなので , これは resize ( ) で設定すればよいでしょう .
あとは全てモデリング−ビューイング変換行列に対する操作なので , 直後に glMatrixMode ( GL_MODELVIEW ) を実行します .
カメラ ( 視点 ) の位置を動かすアニメーションを行う場合は , 描画のたびに gluLookAt ( ) によるカメラの位置や方向の設定 ( ビューイング変換行列の設定 ) を行う必要があります .
同様に物体が移動したり回転したりするアニメーションを行う場合も , 描画のたびに物体の位置や回転角の設定 ( モデリング変換行列の設定 ) を 行う必要があります .
したがって , これらは display ( ) の中で設定します .
マウスの左ボタンをクリックしている間 , 立方体が回転するようにします .
ついでに右ボタンをクリックすると立方体が
1 ステップだけ回転し ( 関谷 先生 ご指摘ありがとうございました ) , 'q ' , ' Q ' , または ESC キーでプログラムが終了するようにします .
prog2.c を以下のように変更してください .
#include < stdlib.h > # include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int edge [ ] [ 2 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; void idle ( void ) { glutPostRedisplay ( ) ; } void display ( void ) { int i ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glColor3d ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_LINES ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 12 ; ++i ) { glVertex3 dv( vertex[edge [ i ] [ 0 ] ] ) ; glVertex3dv( vertex[edge [ i ] [ 1 ] ] ) ; } glEnd ( ) ; glFlush ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; /* 透視変換行列の設定 */ glMatrixMode ( GL_PROJECTION ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; gluPerspective ( 30.0 , ( double ) w / ( double ) h , 1.0 , 100.0 ) ; /* モデルビュー変換行列の設定 */ glMatrixMode ( GL_MODELVIEW ) ; } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { switch ( button ) { case GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON : if ( state == GLUT_DOWN ) { /* アニメーション開始 */ glutIdleFunc( idle ) ; } else { /* アニメーション停止 */ glutIdleFunc(0 ) ; } break ; case GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON : if ( state == GLUT_DOWN ) { /* コマ送り ( 1ステップだけ進める ) */ glutPostRedisplay ( ) ; } break ; default : break ; } } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { switch ( key ) { case ' q ' : case ' Q ' : case ' \033 ' : /* ' \ 033 ' は ESC の ASCII コード */ exit ( 0 ) ; default : break ; } } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; glutMouseFunc( mouse ) ; glutKeyboardFunc( keyboard ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
void glutPostRedisplay ( void ) 再描画イベントを発生させます .
このイベントの発生が発生すると , glutDisplayFunc ( ) で指定されている描画関数が実行されます. なお , 再描画が開始されるまでの間にこのイベントが複数回発生しても , この描画関数は一度だけ実行されます. void glutIdleFunc( void ( * func ) ( void ) ) 引数 func には , このプログラムが暇な ( 何もすることがない ) ときに実行する関数のポインタを指定します.
引数の関数はプログラムが「暇になる」たびに繰り返し実行されます.
この関数を指定すると , プログラムが止まっているように見えてもコンピュータの負荷は増大します. したがって glutIdleFunc ( ) による関数の指定は必要になった時点で行い , 不要になれば glutIdleFunc ( ) の引数に 0 または NULL を指定して関数の指定を解除してやる必要があります. void glMatrixMode ( GLenum mode ) 設定する変換行列を指定します .
引数 mode が GL_MODELVIEW
ならモデルビュー変換行列 , GL_PROJECTION
なら透視変換行列を指定します .
前のプログラムでは毎回画面を全部描き換えているため , 表示がちらついてしまいます . これを防ぐためには , ダブルバッファリングという方法を用います.
これは画面を二つに分け , 一方を表示している間に ( 見えないところで ) もう一方に図形を描き , それが完了したらこの二つの画面を入れ換える方法です .
GLUT でダブルバッファリングを使うには , glutInitDisplayMode ( ) に GLUT_DOUBLE の指定を追加します. また , 図形の描画後に実行している glFlush ( ) を glutSwapBuffers ( ) に置き換えて , ここで二つの画面の入れ換えを行います .
それでは , prog2.c でダブルバッファリングを行うようにしてみましょう.
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int edge [ ] [ 2 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glColor3d ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_LINES ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 12 ; ++i ) { glVertex3 dv( vertex[edge [ i ] [ 0 ] ] ) ; glVertex3dv( vertex[edge [ i ] [ 1 ] ] ) ; } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc(display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; glutMouseFunc( mouse ) ; glutKeyboard Func( keyboard ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
int glutSwapBuffers ( void ) ダブルバッファリングの二つのバッファを交換します. glFlush ( ) は自動的に実行されます .
このプログラムでこれを使うとずいぶん遅くなるように見えますが , これはディスプレイのバッファの交換の時のちらつきを防ぐために , ディスプレイの表示タイミング ( 帰線消去期間 ) を待っているためです .
ディスプレイのリフレッシュレートが 60 Hz であれば , バッファの交換は 1/60 秒ごとに行われます .
このプログラムは一周で 360 回再表示を行いますから , この場合一周するのに最短でも 6 秒かかることになります .
それでは , 次に立方体の面を塗りつぶしてみましょう.
面のデータは , 稜線とは別に以下のように用意します .
int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 } , /* A - B - C - D を結ぶ面 */ { 1 , 5 , 6 , 2 } , /* B-F - G - C を結ぶ面 */ { 5 , 4 , 7 , 6 } , /* F-E - H - G を結ぶ面 */ { 4 , 0 , 3 , 7 } , /* E - A - D - H を結ぶ面 */ { 4 , 5 , 1 , 0 } , /* E-F - B - A を結ぶ面 */ { 3 , 2 , 6 , 7 } /* D-C - G- H を結ぶ面 */ } ;
このデータを使って , 線を引く代わりに 6 枚の四角形を描きます .
prog2.c を以下のように変更してください .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 } , { 1 , 5 , 6 , 2 } , { 5 , 4 , 7 , 6 } , { 4 , 0 , 3 , 7 } , { 4 , 5 , 1 , 0 } , { 3 , 2 , 6 , 7 } } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; int j ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glColor3d ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 6 ; ++j ) { for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; ++i ) { glVertex3dv( vertex [ face[j ] [ i ] ] ) ; } } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
でもこれだと真っ黒で何もわからないので , 面ごとに色を変えてみましょう. 色のデータは以下のように作ってみます.
GLdouble color [ ] [ 3 ] = { { 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , /* 赤 */ { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , /* 緑 */ { 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , /* 青 */ { 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , /* 黄 */ { 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , /* マゼンタ */ { 0.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 } /* シアン */ } ;
一つの面を描く度に , この色を設定してやります .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLdouble color [ ] [ 3 ] = { { 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , { 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } , { 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , { 0.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 } } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; int j ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 6 ; ++j ) { glColor3dv( color[j ] ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; ++i ) { glVertex3dv( vertex [ face[j ] [ i ] ] ) ; } } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
void glColor3dv( const GLdouble * v ) glColor3dv( ) は glColor3d ( ) と同様にこれから描画するものの色を指定します.
引数 v は三つの要素を持った GLdouble 型 ( double と等価 ) の配列で , v[ 0 ] には赤 ( R ) , v [ 1 ] には緑 ( G ) , v [ 2 ] には青 ( B ) の強さを , 0〜1 の範囲で指定します .
でもこれだとなんか変な表示になるかもしれません.
前のプログラムではデータの順番で面を描いていますから , 先に描いたものが後に描いたもので塗りつぶされてしまいます.
ちゃんとした立体を描くには隠面消去処理を行う必要があります.
隠面消去処理を行なうには glutInitDisplayMode ( ) で GLUT_DEPTH を指定しておき , glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) を実行します .
こうすると , 描画のときにデプスバッファを使うようになります.
このため , 画面 ( フレームバッファ , カラーバッファ ) を消去するときにデプスバッファも一緒に消去しておきます. それには glClear ( ) の引数に GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT
を追加します .
デプスバッファを使うと , 使わないときより処理速度が低下します. そこで , 必要なときだけデプスバッファを使うようにします.
デプスバッファを使う処理の前で glEnable( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) を実行し , 使い終わった ら glDisable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) を実行します .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLdouble color [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; int j ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 6 ; ++j ) { glColor3dv( color[j ] ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; ++i ) { glVertex3dv( vertex [ face[j ] [ i ] ] ) ; } } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init( void ) { glClearColor ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_DEPTH ) ; glutCreateWindow ( argv[ 0 ] ) ; glutDisplayFunc( display ) ; glutReshapeFunc( resize ) ; glutMouseFunc( mouse ) ; glutKeyboardFunc( keyboard ) ; init ( ) ; glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
上のプログラムでは常にデプスバッファを使うので , init ( ) の中で glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) を一度だけ実行し , glDisable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) の実行を省略しています .
立方体のように閉じた立体の場合 , 裏側にある面 , すなわち視点に対して背を向けている面は見ることはできません.
そういう面をあらかじめ取り除いておくことで , 隠面消去処理の効率を上げることができます.
視点に対して背を向けている面を表示しないようにするには glCullFace ( GL_BACK ) , 表を向いている面を表示しないようにするには glCullFace ( GL_FRONT ) , 両方とも表示しないようにするには glCullFace( GL_FRONT_AND_BACK ) を実行します .
ただし , この状態でも点や線などは描画されます .
また , glCullFace ( ) を有効にするに は glEnable ( GL_CULL_FACE ) , 無効にするには glDisable ( GL_CULL_FACE ) を実行します .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLdouble color [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; int j ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 6 ; ++j ) { glColor3dv( color[j ] ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; ++i ) { glVertex3dv( vertex [ face[j ] [ i ] ] ) ; } } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init( void ) { glClearColor ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) ; glEnable ( GL_CULL_FACE ) ; glCullFace ( GL_BACK ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
このプログラムも , 多分妙な表示になります .
裏側の面を表示しないはずなのに , 実際は表側の面が削除されています. 実は , 面の表裏は頂点をたどる順番で決定しています. 配列 face [ ] ではこれを右回り ( 時計回り ) で結んでいます .
ところが OpenGL では , 標準では視点から見て頂点が左回りになっているとき , その面を表として扱います. 試しに glCullFace ( GL_FRONT ) としてみてください . あるいは , face [ ]
において頂点を右回りにたどるようにしてみてください.
なお , 頂点が右回りになっているときを表として扱いたいときは , glFrontFace ( GL_CW ) を実行します . 左回りに戻すには glFrontFace ( GL_CCW ) を実行します .
一般にカリングはクリッピングや隠面消去処理の効率を上げるために , 視野外にある図形など見えないことが分かっているものを事前に取り除いておいて , 隠面消去処理 ( 可視判定 ) の対象から外しておくことを言います .
これには様々な方法が存在しますが , glCullFace ( ) による方法 ( 背面ポリゴンの除去 ) は , そのもっとも基本的なものです .
次は面ごとに色を付けるかわりに , 光を当ててみましょう .
陰影付け ( 光源の処理 ) の計算を行うためには , 面ごとの色の代わりに法線ベクトルを与えます. glColor3dv( ) の かわりに glNormal3dv ( ) を使います .
GLdouble normal [ ] [ 3 ] = { { 0.0 , 0.0 , - 1.0 } , { 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , {- 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , - 1.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } } ;
光を当てるためには , もちろん光源も設定する必要があります .
OpenGL には , 最初からいくつかの光源が用意されています .
いくつの光源が用意されているかはシステムによって異なります.
０ 番目の光源 ( GL_LIGHT0 - 必ず用意されている ) を有効にする ( 点灯する ) には glEnable ( GL_LIGHT0 ) , 無効にする ( 消灯する ) には glDisable ( GL_LIGHT0 ) を実行します .
陰影付けを行うと , 陰影付けを行わないより処理速度は低下します. 陰影付けを有効にするには glEnable ( GL_LIGHTING ) , 無効にするには glDisable ( GL_LIGHTING ) を実行します .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLdouble normal [ ] [ 3 ] = { { 0.0 , 0.0 , - 1.0 } , { 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } , {- 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , - 1.0 , 0.0 } , { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 } } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; int j ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 6 ; ++j ) { glNormal3dv( normal[j ] ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; ++i ) { glVertex3dv( vertex [ face[j ] [ i ] ] ) ; } } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init( void ) { glClearColor ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) ; glEnable ( GL_CULL_FACE ) ; glCullFace ( GL_FRONT ) ; glEnable ( GL_LIGHTING ) ; glEnable ( GL_LIGHT0 ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
なお , 陰影付けが有効になっているときは , glColor3d ( ) などによる色指定は無視されます. glColor3d ( ) などで色を付けたいときは , 一旦 glDisable ( GL_LIGHTING )
を実行して陰影付けを行わないようにする必要があります.
一方 , 上のプログラムのように常に陰影付けを行う場合や , 光源を点灯したままにしておく場合は , glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) 同様 glEnalbe ( GL_LIGHTING ) や glEnable ( GL_LIGHTn ) を init ( ) の中で一度実行するだけで十分です. また , このとき は glDisable ( GL_LIGHTING ) や glDisable ( GL_LIGHTn ) を実行する必要はありません .
それでは光源を二つにして , それぞれの位置と色を変えてみましょう. 最初の光源 ( GL_LIGHT0 ) の位置を Z 軸方向の斜め上 ( 0 , 3 , 5 ) に , 二つ目の光源 ( GL_LIGHT1 ) を x 軸方向の斜め上 ( 5 , 3 , 0 ) に置き , 二つ目の光源の色を緑 ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) にします .
これらのデータはいずれも四つの要素を持つ
GLfloat 型の配列に格納します .
四つ目の要素は 1 にしておいてください .
GLfloat light0pos [ ] = { 0.0 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat light1 pos [ ] = { 5.0 , 3.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat green [ ] = { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ;
これらを glLightfv( ) を使ってそれぞれの光源に設定します. prog2.c を以下のように変更してください.
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLdouble normal [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLfloat light0pos [ ] = { 0.0 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat light1 pos [ ] = { 5.0 , 3.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat green [ ] = { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; int j ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 光源の位置設定 */ glLightfv( GL_LIGHT0 , GL_POSITION , light0pos ) ; glLightfv( GL_LIGHT1 , GL_POSITION , light1 pos ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 6 ; ++j ) { glNormal3dv( normal[j ] ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; ++i ) { glVertex3dv( vertex [ face[j ] [ i ] ] ) ; } } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsign ed char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init( void ) { glClearColor ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) ; glEnable ( GL_CULL_FACE ) ; glCullFace ( GL_FRONT ) ; glEnable ( GL_LIGHTING ) ; glEnable ( GL_LIGHT0 ) ; glEnable ( GL_LIGHT1 ) ; glLightfv( GL_LIGHT1 , GL_DIFFUSE , green ) ; glLightfv( GL_LIGHT1 , GL_SPECULAR , green ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
void glLightfv( GLenum light , GLenum pname , const GLfloat * params ) 光源のパラメータを設定します .
最初の引数 light には設定する光源の番号 ( GL_LIGHT0 〜GL_LIGHTn , n はシステムによって異なります ) です. 二つ目の引数 pname は設定するパラメータの種類です .
ここに GL_POSITION を指定すると光源の位置を設定します. また GL_DIFFUSE を指定すると光源の拡散反射光強度 ( 色 ) を設定します .
最後の引数 params は , pname に指定したパラメータの種類に設定する値です .
pname が GL_POSITION あるいは GL_DIFFUSE のときは , params は四つの要素を持つ GLfloat 型の配列で , それぞれ光源の位置および拡散反射光強度を指定します.
光源が ( x , y , z ) の位置にあるとき , params の各要素には ( x / w , y/w , z/w , w ) を設定します .
通常 w = 1 として点光源の位置を設定しますが , w = 0 であれば ( x , y , z ) 方向の平行光線の設定になります .
また光源の拡散反射光強度が ( R , G , B ) なら params の各要素には ( R , G , B , 1 ) を設定します .
なお , この初期値は ( 1 1 1 1 ) ですが , RGB には 1 を越えた値を設定できます .
陰影付けの計算はワールド座標系で行われるので , glLightfv( ) による光源の位置 ( GL_POSITION ) の設定は , 視点の位置を設定した後に行う必要があります. また , 上のプログラムの glRotate3d ( ) より後でこれを設定すると , 光源もいっしょに回転してしまいます .
座標変換のプロセスは " モデリング変換→ビューイング変換→透視変換→ " という順に行われると書きましたが , プログラムのコーディング上は , これらの設定が 逆順になる ことに注意してください． glLoadIdentity ( ) でモデルビュー変換行列を初期化 gluLookAt ( ) 等でビューイング変換を設定 glTranslated ( ) や glRotated ( ) 等でモデリング変換を設定 glBegin ( ) 〜glEnd ( ) 等による描 画
ことに注意してください． 1- 2 の間で光源の位置を設定した場合は , 光源は視点と一緒に移動します. このとき , 光源の方向を ( 0 , 0 , - 1 , 0 ) , すなわち Z 軸の負の方向に設定すれば , 自動車のヘッドライトのような効果を得ることができます．
2-3 の間で光源の位置を設定した場合は , 光源の位置は視点や図形の位置によらず固定になります.
通常はここで光源の位置を設定します.
3 - 4 の間で光源の位置を設定した場合は , 光源の位置は図形と一緒に移動します.
glLightfv( ) による光源の色の設定 ( GL_DIFFUSE 等) は , 必ずしも display ( ) 内に置く必要はありません .
プログラムの実行中に光源の色を変更しないなら , glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) や glEnable ( GL_LIGHTING ) 同様 init ( ) の中で一度実行すれば十分です .
glLightf *( ) で設定可能なパラメータは , GL_POSITION や GL_DIFFUSE 以外にもたくさんあります .
光源を方向を持ったスポットライトとし , その方向や広がり , 減衰率なども設定することもできます. 詳しくは man glLightf を参照してください .
前の例では図形に色を付けていませんでしたから , 立方体はデフォルトの色 ( 白 ) で表示されたと思います .
今度はこの色を変えてみましょう .
この場合も光源の時と同様に四つの要素を持つ
GLfloat 型の配列を用意し , 個々の要素に色を R , G , B それに A の順に格納します .
四つ目の要素 ( A ) は , ここではとりあえず 1 にしておいてください .
GLfloat red [ ] = { 0.8 , 0.2 , 0.2 , 1.0 } ;
glColor * ( ) で色を付けるときと同様 , 図形を描く前に glMaterialfv ( ) を使ってこの色を図形の色に指定します. prog2.c を以下のように変更してください.
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLdouble normal [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLfloat light0pos [ ] = { 0.0 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat light1 pos [ ] = { 5.0 , 3.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat green [ ] = { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat red [ ] = { 0.8 , 0.2 , 0.2 , 1.0 } ; void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { int i ; int j ; static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; /* 視点位置と視線方向 */ gluLookAt( 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 光源の位置設定 */ glLightfv( GL_LIGHT0 , GL_POSITION , light0pos ) ; glLightfv( GL_LIGHT1 , GL_POSITION , light1 pos ) ; /* 図形の回転 */ glRotated ( ( double ) r , 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; /* 図形の色 ( 赤 ) */ glMaterialfv( GL_FRONT_AND_BACK , GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE , red ) ; /* 図形の描画 */ glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 6 ; ++j ) { glNormal3dv( normal[j ] ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; ++i ) { glVertex3dv( vertex [ face[j ] [ i ] ] ) ; } } glEnd ( ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; /* 一周回ったら回転角を 0 に戻す */ if ( ++r >= 360 ) r = 0 ; } void resize ( int w , int h ) { /* 変更なし */ } void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { /* 変更なし */ } void init ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* 変更なし */ }
void glMaterialfv( GLenum face , GLenum pname , const GLfloat * params ) glMaterialfv ( ) は図形の材質パラメータを設定します.
引数 face には GL_FRONT , GL_BACK および GL_FRONT_AND_BACK
が指定でき , それぞれ面の表 , 裏 , あるいは両面に材質パラメータを設定します.
設定できる材質 pname には GL_AMBIENT ( 環境光に対する反射係数 ) , GL_DIFFUSE ( 拡散反射係数 ) , GL_SPECULAR ( 鏡面反射係数 ) , GL_EMISSION ( 発光係数 ) , GL_SHININESS ( ハイライトの輝き ) , あるいは GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE
( 拡散反射係数と鏡面反射係数の両方 ) があります .
他にインデックスカラーモード ( GLUT_INDEX ) であれば GL_COLOR_INDEXES
も使用できますが , この資料では使用していません .
引数 params は一つまたは四つの要素を持つ GLfloat 型 ( float と等価 ) の配列で , 四つの要素を持つ場 合 ( GL_SHININESS , GL_COLOR_INDEXES 以外 ) は , 色の成分 RGB および A に対する係数を指定します .
この初期値は ( 0.8 , 0.8 , 0.8 , 1 ) ですが , 1 を越える値も設定できます .
図形に色を付けるということは , 図形の物理的な材質パラメータを設定することに他なりません.
GL_DIFFUSE
で設定する拡散反射係数が図形の色に相当します.
GL_AMBIENT は環境光 ( 光源以外からの光 ) に対する反射係数で , 光の当たらない部分の明るさに影響を与えます .
GL_DIFFUSE と GL_AMBIENT
には同じ値を設定することが多いので , これらを同時に設定する GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE
が用意されています .
GL_SPECULAR
は光源に対する鏡面反射係数で , 図形表面の光源の映り込み ( ハイライト ) の強さです .
GL_SHININESS
はこの鏡面反射の細さを示し , 大きいほどハイライトの部分が小さくなります.
この材質パラメータの要素は一つだけなので , glMaterialf ( ) を使って設定することもできます .
GL_DIFFUSE
以外のパラメータを設定することによって , 図形の質感を制御できます . たとえば GL_SPECULAR ( 鏡面反射係数 ) を白 ( 1 1 1 1 ) に設定して GL_SHININESS を大きく ( 10〜40 とか／最大 128 ) すれば つややかなプラスチックのようになりますし , GL_SPECULAR ( 鏡面反射係数 ) を GL_DIFFUSE と同じにして GL_AMBIENT を 0 に近づければ金属的な質感になります. ただし GL_SPECULAR や GL_AMBIENT を操作するときは , glLightfv ( ) で光源のこれらのパラメータも設定してやる必要があります.
次に図形の階層構造を表現してみます. これまでのプログラムで実際に立方体を描いている部分を , 独立した関数 cube ( ) として抜き出します .
また , このプログラムでは視点の位置や画角などは変更しないので , これをウィンドウを開いたりサイズが変更されたときに設定するようにします.
こうすると変換行列は glRotated ( ) で変更されたあと元に戻されないため , このままでは次に描画するときにはおかしくなってしまいます. そこで , glRoatated ( ) を使う前に , そのときの変換行列の内容を保存しておき , あとでその内容を戻します . 現在の変換行列を保存するには glPushMatrix ( ) , 保存した変換行列を復帰するには glPopMatrix ( ) を使います .
prog2.c を以下のように変更してください.

この図形に , もう一つ立方体を追加します. 二つ目の cube ( ) を実行する前に glTranslated ( ) を実行して , 最初の cube ( ) の位置から少しずらします .
#include < GL/glut.h> GLdouble vertex [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; int face [ ] [ 4 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLdouble normal [ ] [ 3 ] = { /* 変更なし */ } ; GLfloat light0pos [ ] = { 0.0 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat light1 pos [ ] = { 5.0 , 3.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat green [ ] = { 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 } ; GLfloat red [ ] = { 0.8 , 0.2 , 0.2 , 1.0 } ; void cube ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void idle ( void ) { /* 変更なし */ } void display ( void ) { static int r = 0 ; /* 回転角 */ glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT

この例では , 一つ目の glRotated ( ) による回転が 両方の cube ( ) に影響しているのに対し , 二つ目の glRotated ( ) は二つ目の cube ( ) にしか影響していません .
これによって , 図形の動きの階層構造を表現できます.
では最後に , この二つの立方体の色を変えてみましょう.

立体視のメカニズ ム
人間が映像から立体感（奥行き）を知覚する要因には様々なものがありますが , その中のひとつに両眼視差があります. これは１つの対象を見るときでも右目と左目では見る角度が微妙に異なるため , それぞれの目の網膜に映る映像に違いが発生して , そこから奥行きを知覚する現象です.
これをテレビやコンピュータのディスプレイを使って再現するには , 右目と左目に別々の映像を見せる仕組みが必要になります.
これにはヘッドマウンティッドディスプレイ
( HMD ) などのように右目と左目の直前に独立したディスプレイを置く方式や , 液晶シャッタメガネを使う時分割方式 , 偏光メガネ方式 , メガネを必要としない裸眼方式など , いくつかの方式があります．

OpenGL と GLUT を使って，立体視ディスプレイを活用したゲームなど（シューティング，レース，格闘，落ちもの等何でも）何か「動く」プログラムを作成してください．実験１・２のプログラムを拡張したものでも構いません．
Google just told the applicants for this year ’s Summer of Code whether they were accepted !
I ’ve put up GNOME ’s list of accepted projects .
Many congratulations to everyone we accepted as part of GNOME , and commiserations to students we had to turn down — we ’d love to keep working with you outside of the formal SoC .
GNOME had 181 submissions in total , and it was a pleasure to read all of them .
We got that down to a shortlist of 40 , and then had to try to go from there to our accepted list of 20 via votes , meetings , and long e-mail threads .
Since the list ’s going to be new to everyone outside SoC , I thought I ’d enthuse about a couple of the projects that I ’m going to be tracking excitedly over the summer .
( With apologies if I end up misrepresenting anyone ’s project ! )
Generic user - to - user connection interface for collaborative applications using telepathy
Telepathy is a freedesktop.org project working on a unified interface to different types of communication ( IM , VoIP , etc ) , and this proposal from Mads Chr.
Olesen aims to make direct connections with your Telepathy contacts possible over an IM layer .
For example , if I want to work on a document with a friend using the collaborative editor Gobby , we need a server to host the session .
What if we ’re both behind different NAT networks , as most people are ?
Well , then , we can ’t .
Same for VNC .
The proposal uses the Jabber stream extensions to tunnel application data , meaning that contacts can be treated as “ first - class objects ” for establishing connections .
( If you ’re using a different IM protocol and it also supports arbitrary streams , that ’s fine too ; the whole point of the project would be that application developers and users do n’t need to know exactly how the data is getting tunnelled unless they care . )
The reason I like this proposal so much is that it reminds me of the way this interview with Nat talks about how good programmers add a dose of empathy to their code .
Why should the user have to care how they connect with one of their contacts , or what NAT is , or what IP address each of them has ?
This is totally user - centric programming .
Improving Emblems in GNOME
This is a proposal by James Barrett .
The title does n’t tell the whole story — as well as emblems , think tags .
Everywhere .
James is going to integrate nautilus and leaftag , and gives some excellent use cases : using a “ backup ” tag to have those files / folders backed up automatically , viewing “ virtual folders ” of each tag in nautilus , being able to quickly bring up all your photos with a particular friend in after tagging them .
Emblems are going to be the visual representation of a tag , and will be integrated with nautilus / the panel / the file chooser .
People are getting comfortable with the idea of tags from experiences with Flickr and YouTube , and I think a well - designed use of tags for their files as well is going to be a killer feature .
This is exactly where we can innovate far past Windows and OS X , and I ’m pleased to say I got the same feeling from many of the proposals .
Bluetooth Manager
Matthew Garrett works on the kernel , GTK2 apps and everything inbetween , and he ’s going to spend the summer tidying up Bluetooth ; making sure that you can pair with keyboards , headsets and phones inside GNOME and have things Just Work , and ideally by having HAL do the heavy lifting so that you do n’t need root to do so .
Our bluetooth tools are in need of an overhaul , and this is valuable work .
Improving nautilus login performance & ease of profiling
Phillip Ezolt is a published expert in profiling and optimisation , and wants to help us out both with profiling nautilus and providing hooks to aid profiling in the future .
Phillip ’s in grad school working on visualisation at the moment , and knowing how to usefully represent profile data graphically is a problem we ’ve only recently started trying to solve .
He ’s interested in getting involved with Linux / GNOME in the long - term , and I ’m looking forward to everything we have to teach and learn from him ; it seems like hardcore profiling skills are something only a few of us have .
I liked this proposal so much that I offered to mentor it .
Thanks to Google for their sponsorship and the insane amount of work it must take to coordinate all this , to Behdad and Vincent for heading up GNOME ’s involvement , and welcome to all our new SoCers !
JOE MATHLETE EXPLAINS TODAY'S MARMADUKE
in 500 words or less
Brain cells that are usually destroyed in Parkinson ’s disease have been rescued in a rat model of the disease .
Easing the movement of proteins within key neurons reversed the effects of Parkinson ’s on the cells .
The approach might one day work in humans as a way of treating the debilitating neurological disorder .
Parkinson ’s disease is characterised by rigid , slow movement or other problems with body coordination .
One of the hallmarks of Parkinson ’s is the demise of brain cells that produce the chemical dopamine , which transmits signals between brain cells .
Current treatments for Parkinson ’s aim to boost levels of dopamine in patients ’ brains .
But giving people dopamine precursor chemicals to this end can create further problems by causing their natural production of dopamine to decline even further .
Better treatments could be possible if we knew what makes dopamine - producing cells die in the first place .
Previous work has suggested that an overabundance of a protein called alpha - synuclein may be to blame .
Now a new study provides clues as to how alpha - synuclein might wreak havoc inside dopamine - producing cells .
Advertisement
Ferrying proteins
Susan Lindquist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and colleagues began by confirming that if yeast cells were engineered to vastly overproduce alpha - synuclein , they died .
They then randomly screened 3000 genes – about half the total number of genes in yeast – to see which ones influenced the toxicity of the protein .
This test pointed to genes involved in an important biological pathway for proteins within cells .
Proteins are folded in a part of the cell known as the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to another part called the Golgi apparatus , which packages and ships them off to their final destination .
Alpha -synuclein seemed to somehow prevent a molecule called Ypt1 p from doing its job of ferrying proteins between these two sites .
So the team tried boosting Ypt1p in the engineered yeast cells and found that this protected them .
The cells survived even with high levels of alpha -synuclein present .
Dopamine - producing neurons are more prone to being killed by excess alpha - synuclein than other cells because dopamine accumulates in the cell when the transport system is derailed , the researchers speculate .
And because dopamine is a highly chemically reactive molecule it kills its cell .
Fly and rat cells
Lindquist and colleagues tested their approach of fixing the damaged transport system by applying it to dopamine - producing fly and rat cells that had been engineered to produce too much alpha -synuclein .
In flies they managed to fully rescue the loss of cells .
In rat neurons , inserting a gene for a molecule called Rab1 – the equivalent of Ypt1 p –saved more than 50 % of the cells from death .
“ Given the wide spectrum of defects in cells accumulating defective proteins , it is surprising to see that fixing only one of the defects shows such a significant improvement , ” says Seung - Jae Lee of Konkuk University in Seoul , South Korea .
Researchers suggest a drug that boosts levels of the human equivalent of Rab1 may reverse the loss of dopamine - producing cells in Parkinson ’s patients .
But they caution that prospect is still a distant one , and other biological pathways may prove more worthwhile targets .
“ Putting all our eggs in one basket at this stage would be a huge mistake , ” says Lindquist .
Lee says : “ It remains to be addressed whether this approach would be able to reverse the course of ongoing neurodegeneration . ”
Even when people are diagnosed with Parkinson ’s at the earliest stage of the disease , it is assumed that they have suffered brain damage .

Who Owns Your Computer ?
When technology serves its owners , it is liberating .
When it is designed to serve others , over the owner ’s objection , it is oppressive .
There ’s a battle raging on your computer right now — one that pits you against worms and viruses , Trojans , spyware , automatic update features and digital rights management technologies .
It ’s the battle to determine who owns your computer .
You own your computer , of course .
You bought it .
You paid for it .
But how much control do you really have over what happens on your machine ?
Technically you might have bought the hardware and software , but you have less control over what it ’s doing behind the scenes .
Using the hacker sense of the term , your computer is “ owned ” by other people .
It used to be that only malicious hackers were trying to own your computers .
Whether through worms , viruses , Trojans or other means , they would try to install some kind of remote - control program onto your system .
Then they ’d use your computers to sniff passwords , make fraudulent bank transactions , send spam , initiate phishing attacks and so on .
Estimates are that somewhere between hundreds of thousands and millions of computers are members of remotely controlled “ bot ” networks .
Owned .
Now , things are not so simple .
There are all sorts of interests vying for control of your computer .
There are media companies that want to control what you can do with the music and videos they sell you .
There are companies that use software as a conduit to collect marketing information , deliver advertising or do whatever it is their real owners require .
And there are software companies that are trying to make money by pleasing not only their customers , but other companies they ally themselves with .
All these companies want to own your computer .
Some examples :
Entertainment software :
In October 2005 , it emerged that Sony had distributed a rootkit with several music CDs — the same kind of software that crackers use to own people ’s computers .
This rootkit secretly installed itself when the music CD was played on a computer .
Its purpose was to prevent people from doing things with the music that Sony did n’t approve of :
It was a DRM system .
If the exact same piece of software had been installed secretly by a hacker , this would have been an illegal act .
But Sony believed that it had legitimate reasons for wanting to own its customers ’ machines .

Antivirus :
You might have expected your antivirus software to detect Sony ’s rootkit .
After all , that ’s why you bought it .
But initially , the security programs sold by Symantec and others did not detect it , because Sony had asked them not to .
You might have thought that the software you bought was working for you , but you would have been wrong .

Internet services : Hotmail allows you to blacklist certain e-mail addresses , so that mail from them automatically goes into your spam trap .
Have you ever tried blocking all that incessant marketing e-mail from Microsoft ?
You can’t .

Application software : Internet Explorer users might have expected the program to incorporate easy - to - use cookie handling and pop-up blockers .
After all , other browsers do , and users have found them useful in defending against Internet annoyances .
But Microsoft is n’t just selling software to you ; it sells Internet advertising as well .
It is n’t in the company ’s best interest to offer users features that would adversely affect its business partners .

Internet security :
It recently came out that the firewall in Microsoft Vista will ship with half its protections turned off .
Microsoft claims that large enterprise users demanded this default configuration , but that makes no sense .
It ’s far more likely that Microsoft just does n’t want adware — and DRM spyware — blocked by default .

Update : Automatic update features are another way software companies try to own your computer .
While they can be useful for improving security , they also require you to trust your software vendor not to disable your computer for nonpayment , breach of contract or other presumed infractions .
Adware , software - as - a - service and Google Desktop search are all examples of some other company trying to own your computer .
And Trusted Computing will only make the problem worse .
There is an inherent insecurity to technologies that try to own people ’s computers :
They allow individuals other than the computers ’ legitimate owners to enforce policy on those machines .
These systems invite attackers to assume the role of the third party and turn a user ’s device against him .
Remember the Sony story :
The most insecure feature in that DRM system was a cloaking mechanism that gave the rootkit control over whether you could see it executing or spot its files on your hard disk .
By taking ownership away from you , it reduced your security .
If left to grow , these external control systems will fundamentally change your relationship with your computer .
They will make your computer much less useful by letting corporations limit what you can do with it .
They will make your computer much less reliable because you will no longer have control of what is running on your machine , what it does , and how the various software components interact .
At the extreme , they will transform your computer into a glorified boob tube .
You can fight back against this trend by only using software that respects your boundaries .
Boycott companies that do n’t honestly serve their customers , that do n’t disclose their alliances , that treat users like marketing assets .
Use open - source software — software created and owned by users , with no hidden agendas , no secret alliances and no back - room marketing deals .
Just because computers were a liberating force in the past does n’t mean they will be in the future .
There is enormous political and economic power behind the idea that you should n’t truly own your computer or your software , despite having paid for it .

So far , there have been at least 965 confirmed deaths , making the incident the single biggest loss of Iraqi life since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The incident happened on a river bridge as about a million Shias marched to a shrine for a religious festival .
Witnesses said panic spread over rumours of suicide bombers .
Radical Sunni groups have often targeted Shias in the past , but Iraqi officials said the tragedy had nothing to do with sectarian tension .
Many victims , mostly women , children or elderly , were crushed or drowned .
Littered with shoes
The BBC's Jon Brain in Baghdad says that on Wednesday evening the corridors of the city 's hospitals were lined with bodies , as were the pavements outside .
MUSLIM FESTIVAL TRAGEDIES
July 1987 - Saudi security forces clash with Iranian pilgrims in the holy city of Mecca , 402 killed July 90 - 1,426 pilgrims killed in a stampede in Mecca May 94 - 270 pilgrims killed in Mecca stampede April 97 - More than 340 pilgrims killed and 1,500 injured in fires at tent city in Mina , Saudi Arabia Feb 2004 - 251 pilgrims killed in stampede at Mina
Witnesses describe horror World reaction
Grief - stricken relatives have been walking along the lines , lifting the covers looking for loved ones killed in the tragedy .
The bridge , which spans the River Tigris , is littered with the shoes of victims .
According to tradition , they were supposed to walk across barefoot .
Earlier , mortar rounds had been fired into the crowd , killing at least seven people .
About 36 others were injured when four mortar rounds landed close to the Kadhimiya mosque .
A Sunni group , Jaysh al - Taifa al - Mansoura ( Army of the Victorious Sect ) , said it carried out the mortar attacks , according to a statement posted on a website frequently used by groups linked to al - Qaeda .
There were also reports that some worshippers had been poisoned .
Our correspondent says there are now fears that the tragedy will increase the sectarian divisions in this already troubled country .
Iraqis are preparing to vote on a proposed constitution , with Shia and Sunnis sharply divided on its contents .
Wednesday is the last day the majority of Iraqis can register to vote in October 's referendum .
Panic
Iraqi Defence Minister Saadun al - Dulaim said that the only people to die at the hands of insurgents were the seven killed in the mortar attack .

" What happened has nothing at all to do with any sectarian tension , " he said live on Iraqi TV .
" People swarmed the bridge .
There had to be a search operation at the end of the bridge , so crowds gathered and a certain scream caused chaos ... and this sorrowful incident took place . "
Officials had earlier suggested that someone in the crowd deliberately triggered the stampede by saying they had seen a suicide bomber .
BBC Middle East analyst Roger Hardy says that , because of radical Sunni attacks on big Shia gatherings in the past , it was not unreasonable for the worshippers to be nervous .

Television pictures showed large crowds of Shia pilgrims heading towards the Kadhimiya mosque to mark the martyrdom of the 8th Century religious figure Imam Musa al - Kadhim .
During the crush , iron railings on the bridge leading to the shrine gave way and hundreds of people fell into the water .
The bridge links the staunchly Sunni area of Adhamiya on the east bank of the Tigris and the Shia area of Kadhimiya on the west bank .
The government has declared three days of mourning .
In the opening match of soccer 's World Cup Friday , German midfielder Torsten Frings scored an amazing goal from 40 yards out .
The ball started off straight and then tailed sharply to the right in the last 10 yards or so .
It was an unstoppable shot , but with a different ball it might have been a simple save .
A scientist has explained why a new ball being used in this year 's World Cup is frustrating goalies .
The new Adidas Teamgeist football , as it is called , has 14 panels instead of the 26 or 32 that traditionally create the hexagonal pattern .
Fewer panels means fewer seams , which will make the ball behave more like a baseball , says Ken Bray , a sports scientist at the University of Bath in the UK .
Complex whirls of air cause a spinning ball to drift toward the side that 's spinning away from the ball 's direction of movement [ learn why ] .
A ball that 's not spinning can bounce around unpredictably .
Pitchers rely on this physics when throwing knuckleballs .
A good knuckleball is crazy because the ball rotates lazily in the air and the seams disrupt the air flow around the ball at certain points on the surface , Bray said .
" With a very low spin rate , which occasionally happens in football , the panel pattern can have a big influence on the trajectory of the ball and make it more unpredictable for a goalkeeper , " Bray said last week .
Bray suggests one way to watch for the effect on TV .
" Watch the slow motion replays to spot the rare occasions where the ball produces little or no rotation and where goalkeepers will frantically attempt to keep up with the ball ’s chaotic flight path , " he said .

Minimum wage , estate tax bill dead for now / Unclear provision on tips a sticking point in Senate
2006-08-04 04:00:00 PDT
Washington --
The Senate , by a narrow margin , blocked legislation Thursday night that Democratic critics said could have slashed the pay of about 650,000 Californians who rely on tips for a big part of their income .
The provision was included in a fiercely lobbied election - year " trifecta bill " that seemingly offered something for everyone : Democrats ' long - sought minimum wage increase , Republicans ' cherished cut in estate taxes for the wealthiest families and business tax cuts that appealed to both parties .
For many Democrats , however , their desire for the first increase in nine years in the $ 5.15 federal minimum wage was outweighed by their abhorrence of a tax break for the rich they said could have cost the federal treasury $ 753 billion over 10 years .
The Democrats also contended the bill would have cut the pay for a few million workers in California and six other states who rely on tips for a big part of their income .
Those objections led to a 56 - 42 vote to cut off debate -- falling short of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist 's effort to gain the necessary 60 votes .
" This bill will cut the wages of millions of people , most of them in the West .
This bill will add almost $ 1 trillion to the debt , " Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said before the vote .
" Eighty - one hundred of the wealthiest families hit the jackpot while working Americans pay the debt . "
The Senate 's debate came as it moved to finish business and leave today for its August recess .
Frist switched his vote on the motion to end debate from " yes " to " no " to preserve his right as leader to bring the bill back to the Senate at a later date .
The House , last Saturday just after midnight , passed the bill and left on its five - week break .
Republican
House leaders had long opposed a higher minimum wage -- which is earned by about 7 million people -- because they said it would have destroyed low - wage jobs .
But political pressure to allow a vote increased as Democrats focused on the lack of a minimum wage increase and Republicans looked to the midterm congressional elections fearful about their party 's prospects for keeping control of the House and Senate .
Instead of providing a clear vote on the minimum wage , Republicans teamed it with legislation that would have cut the estate tax .
Republican leaders hoped the bill would allow them to defang the Democrats ' criticism that the GOP was hostile to the working poor while also achieving one of their top goals -- reducing taxes for wealthy families .
To sweeten the pot , Republican leaders threw in a host of tax provisions they hoped would appeal to individual senators , particularly Democrats whose votes were needed .
So the bill contained , for example , tax breaks for coal - mining companies , aimed at Sen. Robert Byrd , D - W.Va. , and timber tax breaks aimed at Sen. Maria Cantwell , D - Wash .
" One thing I 've learned in my time in government is you can always find a reason to vote no .
It takes a bigger step ... to compromise and get something done that is important for people , " said Sen .
Rick Santorum , R - Pa. , during the debate .
" This bill does that . "
But one of the items that unraveled the deal was the minimum wage issue in states like California that do n't allow employers to use " tip credits " in figuring the pay for workers such as waiters , manicurists and bartenders who get regular tips .
" This legislation is cynical , " said Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif .
" It 's all done to let the public think they are doing something about the minimum wage .
But what they 're doing to tipped employees is a disgrace . "
There was a bitter disagreement about what the tip credit provision meant .
Democrats contended it would have cut the pay of about 650,000 Californians from the current $ 6.75 state minimum wage plus tips to $ 2.13 an hour plus tips .
In San Francisco , which has its own , higher minimum wage , they maintained pay would have been hacked from $ 8.82 an hour plus tips to $ 2.13 with tips .
But Republicans and the restaurant industry had a sharply different reading .
They said the change would have applied only to future increases in the federal , state or local minimum wage in the seven states .
In other words , if California raised the minimum -- as is being considered -- workers who get regular tips would n't have received that new higher wage .
" The tip credit provision in the minimum - wage bill protects employee wages at their current level .
No provision results in the lowering of wages for any worker , " California Restaurant Association President Jot Condie said before the vote .
The bill , HR5970 , called for the federal minimum wage to increase to $ 7.25 over three years , but Democrats said their reading made it clear that tipped workers would have faced a big wage cut .
To bolster their view , they offered supporting opinions from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office .
But the restaurateurs , who sought the tip credit provision , disagreed .
" We just do n't agree with that interpretation , " Condie said .
" And the legal experts that we have asked to review this do not interpret it that way either . "
The bill 's backers also cited a letter from the U.S. Labor Department saying the department interpreted the legislation to " protect current minimum wages . "
The California Labor Federation worked against the bill , which was opposed by Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif .
" Our state should have the ability to set fair wages for workers in California -- not have the federal government tell us we need to sink to their level , " said Angie Wei , of the labor federation , before the vote .
The other heavily lobbied feature of the bill was the estate tax cuts .
The bill would have increased the amount of an estate exempt from taxes to $ 5 million for an individual and $ 10 million for a couple by 2015 .
Estates of up to $ 25 million would have been taxed at the capital gains rate , which is 15 percent and scheduled to increase to 20 percent .
The top rate on larger estates would have fallen to 30 percent .
" We hope that in the Senate a lot of Democrats who are for a permanent solution to the death tax will vote for the package , " Mike Donohue , spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business , said before the vote .
But Donohue acknowledged that by putting diverse elements together in one package , drafters could have overplayed their hand .
" It 's the danger of packages like this .
The tip credit is an issue that 's important to senators from some states and it gives them a reason to oppose it , " he said .
In addition to California , the six other states were Washington , Oregon , Nevada , Alaska , Montana and Minnesota .
Applicants to the University of Abertay 's new Ethical Hacking course will be subject to stringent background checks before being offered a place , to make sure they are not likely to abuse the knowledge they will gain .
The four - year degree " Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures " will be on offer from this September , and is designed to produce White Hat hackers , capable of working with businesses to defend their networks .
A university spokesman said the institution would be working with the Home Office , using " Home Office type procedures and Disclosure Scotland " to rule out applicants with a criminal past .
" This is n't something we do as standard , " he told us .
" It 's just that the particular circumstances of this course make it advisable . "
The degree is the first of its kind in the UK , and is expected to attract a lot of interest from students .
Course leader professor Lachlan McKinnon tried to address concerns that the course would simply produce skilled hackers , saying the only sure - fire way to secure a computer is to unplug it .
He added : " We will monitor students closely because we want them to become ethical hackers .
But there is no guarantee .
Harold Shipman qualified as a doctor , after all , before deciding to become a murderer . "
Other courses that can require background checks include medicine , dentistry and even speech science . ®

I srael has opened “ windows ” for the foreign powers to evacuate their terrified nationals from Lebanon .
Obligingly , the foreign media have turned these “ windows ” into an opportunity to avert their gaze further from the death and destruction in Lebanon , Gaza and the West Bank .
On BBC World , for example , we have been following the progress of one 12 - year - old British boy fleeing Beirut .
When he observed that he was worried for the Lebanese family members he was leaving behind , reporter Clive Myrie noted his was a “ very mature attitude ” .
If only the BBC was demonstrating such maturity .
I have to keep reminding myself that this is BBC World , not its domestic news service .
You would hardly know it watching the coverage of the past couple of days .
On Tuesday , when at least 35 Lebanese were killed -- possibly many more as no one seems to know who is lying under the rubble or has been incinerated in their fleeing cars -- we had the BBC ’s Ben Brown in Beirut giving a blow - by - blow account of every facet of the evacuation of foreign nationals in general and British nationals in particular .
If anyone doubted the racism of our Western media , here it was proudly on display .
The BBC apparently considers their Beirut reporter ’s first duty to find out what meals HMS Gloucester ’s chef will be preparing for the evacuees .
Lebanese and Palestinian civilians die unnoticed by the Western media ( though not by the Arab channels ) while we learn of onboard sleeping arrangements on the ship bound for Cyprus .
Did we really need to hear a lengthy live speech from the commander of HMS Gloucester telling us how “ delighted ” he was to be in Beirut ?
With the long minutes of rolling news to fill this might have been justified had the other minutes been stuffed with reports from the areas where civilians are dying by the dozen each day .
But such reports are the mean filling in the thick sandwich of the main story of the evacuees .
In the 4 pm GMT broadcast , I watched 45 minutes of coverage , most of it dedicated to “ live ” footage of the British warship ’s arrival and the relieved faces of the Brits about to leave .
Even so the BBC still managed to squeeze in other bits of reporting in the lulls in the drama of evacuation .
At different points there was a interview from Tel Aviv with former Israeli cabinet minister Yossi Beilin and a live link - up between Ben Brown and Lyse Doucet in Haifa .
She informed us of the “ barrage ” of 50 Katyushas that had landed on northern Israel that day , killing one man .
Supportively , Ben Brown , added that there was “ shock ” at the death and destruction spread by Hizbullah ’s rockets and opined that what the Israeli army was “ really after ” was Hizbullah ’s long - range missiles .
So we had the BBC in Haifa and Beirut speaking with one voice -- that of Israel .
Back in Beirut , Brown repeated with bafflement statements by the British ambassador that some British nationals preferred to stay put for the time being and would not be taking advantage of Israel ’s “ window ” .
It occurred to neither of them that many of these British nationals have loved ones in Beirut and may not want to leave them in the coming desperate hours .
Ben Brown also told us that it was “ understandable ” that the British evacuees were “ pretty scared ” because they were not accustomed to this kind of bombing .
Not like , he added , war correspondents such as himself or the people of Beirut , who had grown used to such assaults .
The outrageous racism implicit in this comment was clear the moment one paused to consider its possible meanings .
Did Brown mean that the Lebanese do not mind being bombed ?
Did he mean that Lebanese children understand from birth that it is their fate to be attacked by Israel , that they get used to the explosions around them ?
Did he mean that their parents are less terrified than a British mother and father by the thought that their family might be obliterated at any moment ?
Or did he mean that Lebanon ’s civilians will not be as traumatized by their experiences as other human beings would be ?
This is the racist subtext of the foreign media ’s evacuations story .
That once the foreigners have been moved to safety , we in the West can leave those who understand only the language violence -- the Israeli army and , apparently , the whole population of Lebanon -- to carry on with their unfinished business .
And we can be sure that this is exactly what will happen as soon as Israel ’s “ window ” is shut .
When the foreign powers no longer have even a small vested interest in the safety of Beirut , can we expect the coverage to improve ?
Do n’t hold your breath .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Anne Kellow , a factory supervisor , had six of her fingers sliced off as she cleaned a packing machine .
Paramedics packed the severed digits on ice and put them in the ambulance with her on the 60 - mile journey to Derriford Hospital , Plymouth .
Once there , a team of surgeons worked in relays to reattach all six fingers during 17 hours of microsurgery .
It is said to be the first time so many fingers have been " replanted " in one operation .
What are the key factors in successfully reattaching a severed digit ?
The window of opportunity is usually six to 12 hours , and success depends on how much damage has been done to the muscles , as these are the first to die .
ANNE KELLOW'S INJURIES
All four fingers on left hand cut off in straight line
Also lost tips of index and little fingers on right hand Cuts not clean , but she was willing for surgeons to go ahead
And be sure to gather up all parts of a severed digit , no matter how small .
The body cannot grow a new nail bed , the tissue directly under the nail , so being able to use the original tissue makes a big difference to whether a full reconstruction can take place .
The operation to " replant " Mrs Kellow 's lost digits was only possible because the industrial equipment left smooth cuts , meaning her finger tissue was in relatively good condition .
Her surgeon has said that while the cuts were not as clean as he'd have liked , she was willing for the team to " give it a go " .
Surgeons fixed the severed fingers in place at the bone with wires and steel plate , and then sewed the muscle tissue , small blood vessels and nerves back together .
Such attention to detail improves the chances of the 62 - year - old grandmother being able to regain full use of her hands , and she is now undergoing intensive physiotherapy .
David Ross , a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon , describes a typical " replanting " operation , in which one team starts out working on the severed body part and the other on the stump .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine , answering questions behind the headlines
" The real challenge is getting the veins to work so they drain the finger .
If you have poor blood drainage you can try a vein graft - if you are short of vein , for example .
Or , if you have joined the veins but they are n't working together you can use leeches to salvage the finger . "
Leeches - one of the oldest medical tricks in the book - act as a temporary blood pump until the finger has healed sufficiently to do this naturally .
This may take up to a week .
" After working on the veins , then you do the tendons , then the nerves .
Then there is the problem of repairing the skin , " says Mr Ross .
" The real challenge is getting a stable , functional hand .
That 's a lot of work for the physiotherapists . "
Finger in custard
This is by no means the first case of a severed finger to make the headlines .
Last May , a US man found a severed finger in a tub of ice cream , then refused to give it back to an injured employee so it could be reattached .
Instead Clarence Stowers , of North Carolina , took it home and put it in his freezer as evidence in legal action against the store .
A week later he offered to return it , too late for surgeons to be able to act .
And in a case that became a popular sensation , John Wayne Bobbitt underwent reattachment surgery after his wife cut off a portion of his penis .
She drove off with it and tossed it into a roadway , only for the missing portion to be recovered by police .
The operation to reattach a penis is the same kind of surgery to repair a severed finger , but far less common .
Another literate Haskell post :
I 've tried a few times to read various documents on the web about
Monad Transformers in Haskell .
I think that in almost every case the
authors are trying to show how clever they are rather than explaining
their use .
If I had just seen the simplest possible examples of Monad
Transformers at work I would have been able to figure out what was going
on and that would have given me enough information to bootstrap myself
into Monad Transforming enlightenment .
So to save other people the trouble I went through I 'm providing you
with examples of Monad Transformers at work .
I 'm not even going to
explain in detail how they work , they 're close to self - evident once the
main features are pointed out .
> import Control .
Monad .
State
> import Control .
Monad .
Identity
Firstly here are two examples of the use of the State Monad .
This
code is n't intended as a tutorial on the State Monad so I won't
explain how they work .
> test1 = do
> a > modify ( +1 )
> b > return ( a , b )
> test2 = do
> a > modify ( ++ " 1 " )
> b > return ( a , b )
> go1 = evalState test1 0
> go2 = evalState test2 " 0 "
Note how evalState ' unwraps ' the State Monad and gives you back the
answer at the end .
So the question is : how do I combine both of these states into one
so that I can update or read either the integer or the string state
at will ?
I could cheat and make a new state of type ( Int , String )
but that is n't a general solution .
The idea is that you use a Monad Transformer .
A Monad Transformer
if like a layer of onion peel .
You start with the Identity monad
and then use Monad Transformers to add layers of functionality .
So to get a two - state monad you take the Identity and add two
layers of stateness to it .
To get the answer at the end you need
to unwrap the State layers and then unwrap the Identity layer too .
When you 're inside your ' do ' expression you need a way to choose
which Monad you 're talking to .
Ordinary Monad commands will
talk to the outermost layer and you can use ' lift ' to send your
commands inwards by one layer .
The following should now be self - evident :
> test3 = do
> modify (+ 1 )
> lift $ modify (++ " 1 " )
> a > b > return ( a , b )
> go3 = runIdentity $ evalStateT ( evalStateT test3 0 ) " 0 "
Note that we use evalStateT to unwrap the State layer instead
of evalState .
evalStateT is what you use to unwrap one layer
of the Monad .
evalState is what you use when your entire Monad
is just the State monad .
When State is a layer , rather than
the whole thing , it 's called StateT .
( Try : type go3 in ghci . )
What if you want to combine IO and State ?
For various reasons
the IO monad must form the innermost core of your onion so
there 's no need to wrap an IO layer around the Identity ,
you can just start with IO .
And when you unwrap you do n't
need to unwrap the IO layer because the Haskell compiler does
that for you .
( Now you can see why you can't layer IO , you 're
not supposed to unwrap IO as it's the job of the code that
calls main at the top level to do that . )
So here we go :
> test5 = do
> modify (+ 1 )
> a > lift ( print a )
> modify (+ 1 )
> b > lift ( print b )
> go5 = evalStateT test5 0
At this point you might be suspicious that IO is being handled
slightly differently from State .
So here 's a StateT layer
wrapped around State :
> test7 = do
> modify (+ 1 )
> lift $ modify (++ " 1 " )
> a > b > return ( a , b )
> go7 = evalState ( evalStateT test7 0 ) " 0 "
You can probably safely ignore my comments and crib the code above
directly for your own use .
And credit where credit 's due : I found the following link to be
more helpful than any other in trying to figure this stuff out
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/MGS2006/LectureNotes/lecture03-9up.pdf
( But I still felt that this link was obfuscating . )
You may now be wondering where test4 and test6 are .
So am I .
Update : I just figured out that you do n't always need to use the
' lift ' operation .
Some of the Monad Transformers have been defined
so that the commands will automatically be passed into the inner
Monad ( and further ) if needed .
I think it 's slightly confusing to
write code this way , however .

Der Internet - Krieg der Editoren Rudolf Stumberger
Auf den Seiten der elektronischen Enzyklopädie Wikipedia wogt ein " Edit - War " um die von Arbeitgebern ins Leben gerufene " Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft "
Die umstrittene Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) war bislang schon für diverse Schlagzeilen gut ( Think Tanks sollen Stimmung schaffen und lassen die Grenze zwischen PR und Journalismus verschwimmen ) , nun sorgt sie auch im Internet für Turbulenzen : Auf den Seiten der basisdemokratischen Enzyklopädie Wikipedia tobt ein Streit um das Wesen dieser von einem Arbeitgeberverband ins Leben gerufenen Propaganda - Abteilung .
1
Immer wieder werden kritische Beiträge zur INSM von bestimmten Nutzern gelöscht - manche vermuten dahinter zahlende Auftraggeber ( vgl .
Wie versucht wird , Wikipedia zurecht zu trimmen ... ) .
Anhand der sich fast täglich verändernden Einträge unter dem Stichwort " Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft " in dem Netz - Lexikon lässt sich ein Kampf um Bedeutungen und Begriffe begutachten , der eine Schlacht um die Deutung von Welt ist .
Wikipedia2 wird damit zwangsläufig zum Terrain eines gesellschaftlichen Kampffeldes und jener Kämpfe die „ auf eine Änderung der Wahrnehmungs - und Bewertungskategorien der sozialen Welt und darin auf eine Veränderung der sozialen Welt selbst abzielen “ , wie es der französische Soziologe Pierre Bourdieu ausgedrückt hat .
Beginnen wir mit dem Anfang : Am 6 .
Dezember 2004 war in Wikipedia unter dem Stichwort „ Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft “ zu lesen :
Die SPD kritisierte im Dezember 2004 die ‚ Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ’ ( INSM ) als ‚ Tarnorganisation ’ .
Die grüne Finanzpolitikerin Christine Scheel verließ im Dezember 2004 die Initiative .
Zuvor hatte attac der Initiative anläßlich der Vergabe der Auszeichnungen ‚ Blockierer des Jahres ’ und ‚ Reformer des Jahres ’ vorgeworfen , sie betreibe ‚ Industriepropaganda ' .
Der Hintergrund für diesen Eintrag war , dass durch diverse kritische Medienberichte öffentlich wurde , dass die INSM unter dem Deckmäntelchen der Unabhängigkeit und Neutralität Lobbyarbeit für die gesellschaftspolitischen Interessen des Arbeitgeberverbandes Gesamtmetall leistete .3
Denn dieser gründete 2000 diese Initiative und gönnt sich seither für zehn Millionen Euro pro Jahr die Dienste einer Werbeagentur , die neoliberale Botschaften wie den Abbau des Kündigungsschutzes unter die noch immer „ sozialstaatsgläubige “
Bevölkerung bringen soll .
Und auch die dazu eingekauften Journalisten taten ganze Arbeit : Sie plazierten die politischen Ansichten des Arbeitgeberverbandes geschickt in den Redaktionsstuben der Zeitungen , finanzierten genehme Beiträge im Fernsehen , vermittelten „ Botschafter “ als Interviewpartner .
Dies alles , ohne dass in den jeweiligen Medienbeiträgen klar wurde , dass finanziell und geistig federführend die Organisation der Metallarbeitgeber dahinter stand .
4
Dies ging soweit , dass ganze Szenen in der Soap - Opera „ Marienhof “ gekauft wurden .
Diese Manipulation der Öffentlichen Meinung war der Grund , warum die INSM selbst zum Gegenstand der Berichterstattung und von Wikipedia wurde .
Dort allerdings mutierte die kritische
Beschreibung mehr und mehr hin zu einer „ Neutralität “ der Darstellung .
So hieß es am 15 .
Februar 2005 nun :
Die Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) ist eine im Jahr 2000 gestartete Kampagne , ‚ Reformbewegung ’ und Denkfabrik , die strikt marktwirtschaftliche Positionen vertritt .
Am 17 .
Juni 2005 erfolgte eine weitere Weichspülung .
Statt „ strikt marktwirtschaftliche Positionen “ ist jetzt nur noch von „ marktwirtschaftlichen Positionen “ die Rede .
Im September schließlich ist der Weichspülvorgang dann nahezu abgeschlossen :
Die im Jahr 2000 gegründete Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) bezeichnet sich selbst als Reforminitiative .
Sie sieht sich als parteiübergreifende Plattform , die sich der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft verbunden sieht .
In dieser Definition ist jeglicher kritische Impuls getilgt und das Eigenbild der Propaganda - Truppe übernommen , was ungefähr ähnlich naiv ist wie an eine halbe Schwangerschaft zu glauben .
Das sehen auch die Mitglieder der Wikipedia - Gemeinde auf der Diskussionsseite so :
Dieser Artikel macht ja eine erstaunliche Metamorphose durch !
Alte Versionen stellten mal eine kritische Betrachtung der Lobby - Organisation und ihrer Ziele dar , aber Stück für Stück hat er sich wie von Zauberhand in das gesäuselte Loblied einer tüchtigen Gruppe von Reformern verwandelt , die nur unser Bestes wollen .
62.180.160.80 01:17 , 3 . Sep 2005 ( CEST )
Anfang März 2006 schließlich eskaliert der Streit um die inhaltliche Ausrichtung des INSM - Artikels in einem sogenannten „ Edit - War “ , wobei die „ gegnerische “ Version jeweils gelöscht und durch die eigene ersetzt wird .
So konnte sich folgende immerhin wieder leicht kritische Version nicht durchsetzen :
Die im Jahr 2000 gegründete Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) bezeichnet sich als ‚ branchen - und parteiübergreifende Plattform ’ , die für ‚ marktwirtschaftliche Reformen ’ eintritt und mittels professioneller PR - Kampagnen und Medienkooperationen versucht , Mehrheiten für ihre Ziele zu gewinnen .
In den Augen ihrer Kritiker ist sie hingegen eine getarnte PR - Agentur eines Arbeitgeberverbandes .
Diese Version wurde insgesamt zehn Mal gelöscht und durch die Weichspülversion ersetzt , der Wächter über die „ neutrale “ Version hatte schlicht den längeren Atem im „ Edit - War “ .
Edit - War oder : Mythen des Internet
Um diesen „ Edit - War “ zu verstehen , muss man die Regeln und die Konstruktion von Wikipedia kennen .
Als „ basisdemokratische “ Enzyklopädie ( „ umfassendes Wörterbuch “ , „ Grundwissenschaft “ ) kann jeder einen Artikel ins Leben rufen oder bestehende Artikel verändern .
Damit letzteres nicht im Chaos endet , gibt es gewisse Grundregeln : „ Vandalismus “ etwa ist verboten ( das Löschen von Teilen oder ganzen Artikeln ) , der „ Werdegang “ eines Artikels ist aufgezeichnet und in seinen verschiedenen Versionen nachvollziehbar , für Streit unter den Autoren gibt es eine Diskussionsseite , auf der dieser Streit ausgetragen werden soll .
Wikipedia setzt damit auf den Sieg der Rationalität und des Arguments , die „ Wahrheit “ solle sich im rationalen Austausch der Argumente herstellen - Aufklärung pur also .
Mit diesem zweifelsohne sympathischen Ansatz nährt Wikipedia freilich - in Anlehnung an Roland Barthes „ Mythen des Alltags “ - die „ Mythen des Internet “ .
Diese Mythen erzählen vom demokratischen und aufklärerischen Potenzial des Netzes , von der Gleichheit der Benutzer , von der Redefreiheit der Massen und der subversiven Kraft gegenüber den politisch und ökonomisch Mächtigen .
Der Streit um den INSM - Artikel freilich zeigt die Grenzen dieser Eigenschaften auf .
Jener eifrige Nutzer , der über die „ neutrale “ - sprich weichgespülte Version - des Artikels Tag und Nacht wacht , beruft sich gerne auf die „ fehlende Neutralität “ der kritischen Beiträge .
Damit ist argumentativ natürlich nichts gelöst , sondern der semantische Streit um das „ Wesen “ der INSM lediglich auf eine andere Ebene verschoben , in der es dann um den semantischen Streit von „ Neutralität “ geht .
Interessanter Weise lässt sich an diesem Wikipedia - Artikel sozusagen in Zeitrafferform ein gesellschaftliches Phänomen studieren , das „ in der freien Natur “ als vielfältigster und langandauernder Prozess stattfindet : Der Kampf der Klassifikationssysteme als Teil eines Kampfes um gesellschaftliche Ressourcen .
Bourdieu hat dies so formuliert5 :
Darum geht es in den Auseinandersetzungen um die Definition des Sinns der Sozialwelt : um Macht über die Klassifikations - und Ordnungssysteme , die den Vorstellungen und damit der Mobilisierung und Demobilisierung der Gruppen zugrundeliegen .
Und darum geht es grundsätzlich in der Auseinandersetzung zum INSM - Artikel , nämlich darum , ob von „ Reformen “ oder von „ Sozialabbau “ , von „ Flexibilisierung “ oder von „ Abbau des Kündigungsschutzes “ , ob von einer „ branchen - und parteiübergreifende Plattform “ oder von einer „ getarnte PR - Agentur eines Arbeitgeberverbandes “ gesprochen wird .
Diese Wörter sind Politik und es geht eben entweder um die „ Mobilisierung von Gruppen “ für den neoliberalen Umbau des Staates oder für die Verteidigung sozialer Rechte .
Und dies nicht im luftleeren Raum , sondern höchst verbunden mit den Interessen der Akteure :
„ Die Klassifikations - und Ordnungssysteme bildeten keine derart hart umkämpften Streitobjekte , trügen sie nicht bei zum Bestand der Klassen , indem sie mittels der entsprechend dem Ordnungssystem strukturierten Vorstellung die Wirksamkeit der objektiven Mechanismen noch verstärkt .
Dem Arbeitgeberverband
Gesamtmetall ist eben sehr daran gelegen , mithilfe eingekaufter Journalisten und Werbeagenturen die Wirksamkeit seiner politischen Ansichten zu verstärken , also unter die Leute zu bringen , und einen Meinungswechsel hin zur Befürwortung neoliberaler „ Reformen “ zu bewirken .
Die Sache mit der Neutralität
„ Neutralität “ ist in diesem Kampf der Klassifikationssysteme natürlich selbst ein Kampfbegriff , der „ gut “ ist , weil „ interesselos “ - freilich eine im realen sozialen Universum nicht existierende Position .
Denn natürlich sind , so Pierre Bourdieu , „ zahllose von den etablierten Wissenschaften geschaffene ethische , ästhetische , psychiatrische und juristische Klassifikationen...gesellschaftlichen
Funktionen unterworfen , wobei ihre spezifische Effizienz freilich gerade auf dem Schein ihrer Neutralität beruht “ .
Die „ Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft “ beherrscht diese Klaviatur perfekt , indem sie sich auf wissenschaftliche Expertisen beruft , „ unabhängige “ Rankings in die Welt setzt und eben grundsätzlich und generell mit dem Deckmäntelchen der „ branchen - und parteiübergreifende Plattform “ den Schein der Neutralität erzeugen will .
Dem „ Mythos der Neutralität “ in der Konstruktion von Wikipedia ist der Mythos einer
Welt beigestellt , in der soziale Kämpfe durch den Austausch rationaler Argumente entschieden werden .
Dieser Ansatz hat ebenso wie sein Scheitern eine lange Geschichte .
1907 zum Beispiel kamen reformorientierte Sozialarbeiter und Wissenschaftler in die US - amerikanische Stahlstadt Pittsburgh , um das Leben der Stahlarbeiter und die Arbeitsbedingungen in den Fabriken und Eisenhütten - geprägt durch große Hitze , Rechtlosigkeit , tödliche Arbeitsunfälle etc. - zu untersuchen und zu dokumentieren .
Das Ergebnis wurde in sechs Bänden6 festgehalten .
Die dahinter stehend Idee war , dass sich angesichts unwiderlegbarer Fakten ein Konsens über die Notwendigkeit von Reformen ( Reformen im ursprünglichen Sinne als Verbesserung von Arbeits - und Lebensbedingungen und nicht im heutigen oft propagierten Sinne von Sozialabbau ) einstelle .
Die Stahlbarone sollten also kraft rationaler Argumente dazu gebracht werden , die Arbeitsbedingungen in ihren Fabriken zu verbessern .
Das Ergebnis war freilich ernüchternd : Einige kleinere Reformen kamen auf kommunaler Ebene in Gang , die grundsätzlichen Lebens - und Arbeitsbedingungen der Arbeiter änderten sich aber nicht .
Erst durch eine gewerkschaftliche Organisation verbesserten sich in den 1930er Jahren die Arbeitsbedingungen in den Stahlwerken .
Ein jüngeres Beispiel für diesen Glauben an „ Neutralität “ ist die umstrittene Werbeaktion der Modefirma Bennetton aus dem Jahre 2000 .
Auf Plakatwänden und in Anzeigen wurden die Fotografien von Todeskandidaten in US - Gefängnissen gezeigt .
In einer Presseerklärung zu dieser Kampagne hieß es , der Firma Bennetton gehe es NICHT um eine Kampagne GEGEN die Todesstrafe , sondern um eine Kampagne ÜBER die Todesstrafe .
Auch hier wieder der Mythos , man stelle „ neutrale “ Fakten zur Verfügung und der Betrachter solle sich sein eigenes Urteil bilden .
Doch es ist wie bei der Fotografie : Auch sie bildet „ objektiv “ die Welt so ab , wie sie ist .
Aber was abgebildet wird und was nicht und aus welchem Blickwinkel etc. , das ist längst jenseits einer „ Objektivität “ und interessensbestimmt .
Redlichkeit ( auch in der Wissenschaft ) besteht darin , diesen Standpunkt offen zulegen .
Bei Wikipedia freilich besteht das Veröffentlichungsprinzip im Gegenteil : Die Nutzer bzw .
Autoren sind in der Regel anonym und schreiben unter Fantasienamen .
Eine Zuordnung oder Einschätzung einer Information ist so nicht möglich , es fehlt der Kontext .
Was bleibt ist das pure Wogen der Argumente , freilich wird in diesem Wellengang gerne von Betroffenen eingegriffen , wie die Manipulation von Wikipedia - Artikeln durch US - Parlamentarier zeigte ( Wikipedia - Gate ) .
Statt dem Mythos einer „ neutralen “ Wissensquelle zu folgen , sollte man sich also bewusst sein , dass Wikipedia natürlich auch ein gesellschaftliches Kampffeld um Klassifikationssysteme ist und diese Kämpfe nicht nur mit den Mitteln des „ rationalen Diskurses “ , sondern auch durch bezahlte Agenten , durch Manipulation und Betrug , durch Verschweigen oder Verschleierung und interessensgeleitet geführt werden können - eben wie im richtigen Leben .
Ein Nutzer hat dies auch klar erkannt und sich vom Mythos der Neutralität verabschiedet :
Um einen Artikel in eine bestimmte Richtung zu drängen , braucht man nur ‚ Sitzfleisch ’ , lies Hartnäckigkeit .
Gute Argumente braucht man gar nicht .
In wikipedia zählt Stärke , nicht Argument . ( [ Benutzer : Anorak ] ]

We chunk method call data into many different small calls through ExternalInterface ,
which makes performance linear rather than O( n ^ 2 ) , which is what the standard External Interface 's performance is .
which makes performance linear rather than O( n ^ 2 ) , which is what the standard External Interface 's performance is .
I used a debugger to find hidden JS serialization methods used by the Flash plugin , which internally uses XML serialization and made all sorts of mistakes in terms of serializing characters - for example , it does n't escape characters and also uses eval ( ) so its slow as dirt .
I found a way to bypass this internal serialization , do it all manually , and make the method call myself using an undocumented JS function .
I now double encode and decode all XML characters on both sides :
& --> &&
This is very important for persisting XML , and I did lots of testing around this to catch every single problem character ( including nulls , for example )

I 'm proud to announce the immediate availability of dojo. storage and a new web - based editor named Moxie .
Imagine if web applications could store megabytes of data on the client - side , in the browser , both persistently and securely .
No server needed .
Imagine if web applications could work offline with the click of a button .
Want to access your web based word processor when you are not on the network , with your private files stored privately , right on your own machine and not on some server ?
Now you can .
Even better , imagine if all of this worked across the existing web ; 95 % of the existing browsers on the web could start using these features right now , with no software installs or funky new browsers .
What could you build if you had these tools ?
How about a truly collaborative , web - based word processor with client - side storage for your private documents , as well as offline access ?
Maybe an Ajax RSS aggregator with client - side caching of the feeds you read and offline access ?
An offline , web - based book reader using data from the Internet Archive 's Open Library would be cool .
This is the vision , and now the reality , of dojo. storage .
For years I 've been tinkering and prototyping to see if it was possible to achieve both persistent client - side storage as well as offline access across the existing installed browser base , cross- platform and cross - browser ; there were many times I thought it was impossible , but I kept at it because it was an obsession I wanted to see exist .
For the last eight months I have worked on it for at least two or three days a week , on my off days when I am not working for my consulting clients .
Also , a few months ago , Julien Couvreur had a breakthrough when he figured out the HTTP header to send from a server to achieve offline access .
I 've finally finished ; dojo.storage is now done , in beta , and fully open source under a business - friendly BSD license .
I 've put together an example application to show dojo. storage called Moxie , a web - based word processor with persistent , client - side storage , no server , and full offline access .
It is open source and is in the Dojo repository .
It works across the big three browsers : Internet Explorer 6 + , Firefox , and Safari ..
Use the rich editing control to enter a document , type in a file name , and select the Save button .
If the document is above 100 K , you will be prompted on whether to accept this storage request ; user 's can deny storage requests above 100K .
Choose the file from the Load File pull down to reload the file , even if you have closed the browser .
Follow the directions on the page on how to do offline access .
I 've done a bunch of QA around all of this , but the dojo. storage framework I created that powers this is still in beta ; if you run into a bug or problem email me at bkn3@columbia.edu with the details .
Moxie was put together inusing the power of the Dojo framework ; it uses Dojo Widgets ( the rich editing control ) ; Dojo Events ; and the newest member of the Dojo team , Dojo Storage .
What is dojo.storage ?
Dojo.storage is a unified API to provide JavaScript applications with storage .
It is a generic front - end to be able to provideJavaScript applications a consistent API for their storage needs , whether this JavaScript is in a browser , a Firefox plugin , an ActiveX control , using Windows Scripting Host , etc .
Further , the storage backends can use whatever mechanism is appropriate ; dojo.storage automagically detects its environment and available storage options and selects the most appropriate one .
You might have heard about AMASS , the Ajax MAssive Storage System , and are wondering about the relationship of AMASS and dojo. storage .
AMASS was a proof - of - concept prototype of Flash based storage I released in October 2005 .
It was not widely QAed and only worked in Firefox and IE .
Dojo.storage now supersedes and replaces AMASS .
The dojo.storage architecture is simple ; a JavaScript application interacts with the Dojo Storage Manager , which selects the best available Storage Provider and makes it available .
Storage Providers implement a generic interface , which makes the underlying storage system look like a simple hash table that can be saved and loaded from .
Storage provider can optionally be persistent , and can provide metadata about their capabilities ( isPersistent , has SettingsUI , getMaximumSize , etc. )
Some possible storage providers : Right now the dojo. storage system includes one provider , the Flash Storage Provider ; others are not implemented yet but should be straightforward if folks want to contribute .
The Flash Storage Provider uses features available since Flash 6 , including Flash's SharedObject ' s. Why Flash ?
Flash now has a greater installed base than Internet Explorer ; Flash 6 + has a 97.1 % penetration across the installed base of PCs , while IE 5 , 6 , and 7 have 64.7 % .
Flash is probably one of the most installed pieces of software on the planet .
The Flash Storage Provider uses Flash as a hidden runtime to extend the browser , because of its ubiquity and cross- platform / cross - browser qualities .
When browsers get native persistence support , your dojo. storage applications will continue to run since you write them against the generic dojo. storage APIs .
I 'm going to quickly take you through Moxie , to show you how to use dojo. storage to build applications .
Moxie has two files : editor.html and editor.js .
It has a singleton JS object named Moxie , which you can see if you look at the editor .js file .
It 's HTML is straightforward , except for one thing : we use the Dojo Editor Widget , which we specify in HTML as follows :
The items attribute tells the Editor widget what toolbars we want visible , and the between them says to put a seperator between them .
The next big step , inside edit.js , is to import our packages , including dojo. storage ; this is at the top of the file : Next , at the bottom of the file , we subscribe to find out when the storage system is ready for us to work with it ; we can not load or save values until the underlying storage provider is ready .
In this case we want to call Moxie.initialize when storage is ready ; if by the off chance it is already ready when we get to this code block , then we want to wait until the page is fully loaded before working with it :
When we are all loaded up , we can start to play with the storage system .
For example , to load a value that was previously saved with some key , we just do the following : To save some value : Value can be a string or even a complicated JS object ; we internally JSON everything before storing it as a flat string , and turn it back into an object on later retrieval .
Dojo.storage actually does some nifty autodetection if it is working with strings , to avoid the JSON performance hit of evaling ( ) and bypass this , which gives much better performance for storing large strings into storage , like XML files or digital books as you will see in a later demo in this post .
Notice the saveHandler above ; a storage system can optionally ask the user if they want to accept or deny your storage request , so you must be ready for a save request to fail .
saveHandler is a callback function that receives two arguments .
The first is the status , which can be one of three values :
The second argument is the keyName that is being saved ; since saving is asynchronous , it is sometimes useful to know which key is being worked with on the callback .
The Flash Storage Provider pops up an underlying Flash storage dialog to the user after 100K , and every order of magnitude increase after that :
Here 's an example saveHandler :
There is more to the code , but those are the important bits in terms of understanding dojo. storage .
It 's pretty straightforward to use .
I 'll briefly describe dojo .
flash here , which is the layer that seperates out JS and Flash communication .
Cross - browser , fast , reliable JS +
Flash communication is really hard and ugly , so I encapsulated this portion out into it 's own layer .
The great thing is you do n't have to know any of this externally ; dojo .
flash and dojo.storage work together to figure out your Flash capabilities , and use the appropriate mechanism internally .
Zero hassle .
Dojo. flash provides several major services : dojo.flash .Communicator was the real doozy to create ; it was a pain in the butt , to put it lightly .
This area of the system provides a method abstraction between Flash + JS .
For example , JavaScript can call sayHello( ) , which is some Flash method , while Flash can execute DojoExternalInterface.call ( " dojo.storage.save " , resultsHandler ) to run some JS method .
The heart is something called DojoExternalInterface , which is a backport of Flash 8 's ExternalInterface to Flash 6 .
I did n't want to create this backport , but the complexity of handling all the internal tricks I was doing to make this stuff work required that I wrap this magic in some kind of maintainable API .
DojoExternalInterface makes it possible to register Flash methods that can be called from JavaScript :
There are three ways to do Flash + JS communication :
Only methods 1 and 2 are acceptable for the Flash Storage Providers needs .
It turns out that we use method 1 for IE and Firefox , and method 2 , ExternalInterface , for Safari .
I found workarounds to fix ExternalInterface 's serious bugs , so that it works on Safari and is fast and serializes correctly , but these workarounds only work on Safari .
The Flash 8 communication support for Safari took 3 months to figure out ; pain in the behind .
I wo n't go into detail on the method and workarounds , but here is a bit of info on the workarounds :
With these workarounds , performance and reliability on Safari are great .
Unfortunately , these workarounds only work on Safari , so we can't use External Interface cross browser .
Check out this testing page , which provides a lower level interface to dojo. storage ; there are quick links on the left to fully save an entire book into the storage system , in this case Faust by Goethe at 250 k courtesy of Project Gutenberg ; there is also a quick link to save an example RSS XML feed into the storage , in this case an atom feed from my weblog .
Try this on Safari ; in the past it tookand froze the machine to save the book , now it takes seconds .
I wo n't go into the Flash 6 communication necessary for IE and Firefox support ; there were lots of fun different things that had to be figured out , like how to center the Flash dialog even if you are across many different kinds of HTML doctypes , browsers , and platforms , or isolating timing issues like the fact that the fscommand infrustructure on some versions of IE comes upyour Flash applet is already running .
dojo .
flash was really hard to make , but I tried to isolate the pain into that module so that it is encapsulated and ready for folks to use .
Externally its easy , internally it was hell .
Dojo.storage has had lots of what I call poor - mans QA testing , which means I went to coffee shops and Kinkos , paid them money , and used their machines to test all of this code ; I also begged random people to go to the pages and saw how it works .
I 've spent a bunch of money and done alot of QA testing , but this is still beta ; if you find a bug or have something wierd email me your browser and platform details at bkn3@columbia.edu
For offline , Julien Couvreur discovered the necessary HTTP headers .
The core part of it is to use HTTP caching ; your site must have the following kinds of HTTP headers on : Etags and Last - Modified are on by default on Apache 2.0 ; the rest have to be turned on in httpd.conf with mod_expires :
The page is now in the browser cache after the first access .
In IE and Firefox , the user has to go to File > Work Offline to work offline , and then can simply just navigate to the app's URL .
In Safari , this is not necessary , and you can just go to the URL .
I like to provide a link that can be dragged to the toolbar .
The offline and dojo. storage work together , because whether you are offline or online you can access the same persistent storage , saving data while offline then syncing when online .
Expect a dojo. offline and dojo.sync in the future that will provide abstractions for common operations like this .
I 'm looking for financial sponsors on this if you are interested .
Dojo.storage is in beta and is inside the Dojo Subversion now .
It will be bundled with the next release of Dojo , including with Moxie , but you can download it now .
Links :
If you try out dojo. storage and run into problems , remember that I did this all for free and make my money and food from consulting , so I 'm not available to provide free support ; please consider a consulting contract .
I do want bug reports though .

[ My apologies for the somewhat shaky camera work .
This conversation took place shortly after the terrorist scare at London 's Heathrow airport ( I had to leave some of my camera equipment in New Delhi ) ]
Recently , we visited MSR Cambridge ( UK ) to meet some of the great minds working there .
In this case , we were fortunate enough to get an hour 's time with Simon Peyton - Jones and Tim Harris , who are researchers working on a very hard problem : making it easier ( more predictable , more reliable , more composable ) to write concurrent applications in this the age of Concurrency ( multi - core is a reality , not a dream ) .
Specifically , Simon and Tim ( and team ) are working on a programming technology called Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) which provides an elegant , easy to use language - level abstraction for writing concurrent applications that is based on widely - understood conceptual constructs like Atomic operations ( and , well , Transactions ... ) .
Simon , Tim and team do all the nasty locking work for you .
With STM - enabled languages , you can just concentrate on the algorithms at hand and leave the low - level heavy lifting to the sub-system .
Sound familiar ?
So , imagine this : Read scientific papers here Play with STM here and here
Aurora – For 31 years , a hideaway in the rafters of Smoky Hill High School has served as a refuge for select drama students – a secret getaway whose whereabouts were passed down every year from class to class .
Unbeknownst to teachers and administrators , students had hauled up chairs , a radio and candles to furnish the lair above the lights .
The room was actually a space created by the vents and walls of the ventilation system , accessible only by perilous traverses across catwalks .
Knowledge about the room had become a sacred Smoky Hill rite until the school newspaper last month revealed the secret .
The April 14 article in the Smoky Hill Express prompted administrators to shut down access .
In its wake , newspaper students learned the power of the printed word .
Drama students learned that their unsupervised exploits above the rafters could have been deadly .
“ It ’s probably a pretty good idea to keep the kids safe , ” said Brian Pelepchan , 45 , one of two teens who created the room during the school ’s first year in 1975 .
Pelepchan and his best friend , Gary Walker , were sophomores , avid rock climbers and drama - department “ techies ” who were allowed on the catwalks above the stage .
“ We went up into the catwalks and saw this little opening , climbed up the structure and , lo and behold , we found this little cavelike place that we could hang out in , ” said Pelepchan , now an engineer with three children who attend Smoky Hill .
Pelepchan and Walker started the log book , which later filled with the names of everyone who had visited the room .
Rumors about activities in the room ranged from sex to drugs to rock ‘ n ’ roll .
Students changed the room ’s location in the rafters at various times over the years .
The log was found this year by newspaper students who stumbled upon the space while researching a story about things students do that they should n’t .
Freshman photographer Evan Hicks was on the catwalks , trying to find lovers smooching , when a drama student asked if he was looking for the secret room .
“ You do n’t tell a newspaper student that , ” said teacher Carrie Faust , the newspaper adviser .
“ It ’s kind of a challenge , do n’t you think ? ”
Her students worked to nail the story , asking drama students about the room ’s location and combing the catwalks to find it .
Senior Allie Lemieux along with Hicks wrote a story complete with photos of the room .
Lemieux said she immediately felt the weight of the room ’s tradition when she crawled into it .
“ All over the walls , people had signed their names , ” she said .
“ You could totally tell teens had been coming up there .
There was ash all over the ceiling .
They had used smoke from the candle to write on the ceiling . ”
The newspaper staff was conflicted about running the story .
If the room was outed , it would be shut down .
But Faust told them she would have to tell administrators anyway .
“ We decided that we report about the school ’s history , and this is news about the school , ” said Lemieux .
A few days before publication , Lemieux and Faust told activities director Kathy Daly about the room .
Within four hours , access was sealed .
After publication , drama students wore black T - shirts with the saying “ I know where the secret room is , but I ’m not telling ! ”
“ All the drama kids are really upset about it , ” junior Bill Setterlind said .
“ It was sort of a neat thing … It was one of the little things that made the school special . ”
Daly and Faust met with the drama department .
Students who had used the room were given amnesty .
The department was given the log book .
“ If the article had come out and was , ‘ What a bad thing , ’ … we would n’t have run it , ” Lemieux said . ” … I told the drama students , ‘ It was n’t about ratting you out .
It was about showing the cool tradition . ” ‘

I like to live life dangerously .
Wild stuff like living by myself , being single and staying in watching Ealing comedies on DVD .
If I keep up this kind of behaviour into my 50s , it will double my risk of heart disease , the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health reported last week .
I already knew not getting married was more dangerous than smoking , while Richard Layard has been reminding me in his book Happiness that not marrying is likely to make me more miserable than those who wed ( but do n't divorce ) .
If all that was n't bad enough , I 'm also a social problem .
Having a whole flat to myself means I take up too much room in our overcrowded island and my atomised existence is indirectly responsible for social breakdown and crime , as I 'm contributing to the weakening of community cohesion .
Pleasing yourself ( not like that ) has never been so socially and morally unacceptable .
The only trouble is that none of this evidence shows that being single is bad for you .
People who live alone simply tend to expose themselves to more health risks than those who do not .
Single people are more likely to eat badly and smoke , and that is what kills them .
That is why comparing solo living with smoking as a risk factor just does not make sense .
Smoking damages your body directly ; living alone is in itself harmless .
In general , it is true that people are happier if they have strong family and social networks .
But this does not depend on how many people you share your home with .
Miserable couples who just stay in and watch TV are less socially connected than live - alones who go out every night .
Furthermore , there are many who actually prefer relative solitude , so it is not inevitable that being a loner will make you less happy and healthy .
As for our environmental impact , a two - car couple in a large house use up more resources than I do , especially if they have kids they refuse to keep in tree houses and rear as semi-feral hunter - gatherers .
As long as I eat well , exercise , am not wasteful and get as much social contact as I need , being single is not only perfectly safe , it is better for me than growing fat and old with a wife , social circle and family who all drive me up the wall .
And if anyone has studied the effects of being a bitter cynic on life expectancy , they can sod off too .
" It 's important for us , if we 're going to proceed legislatively , to keep in mind there 's a price to be paid for that , and it might well in fact do irreparable damage to our capacity to collect information , " Mr. Cheney said .
The administration , backed by Republican leaders in both houses , has also resisted calls for inquiries by either Congress or an independent investigator .
As for the politics , some Republicans say they are concerned that prolonged public scrutiny of the surveillance program could prove a distraction in this year 's midterm Congressional elections , and the administration has worked to contain any damage by aggressively defending the legality of the operation .
It has also limited its Congressional briefings on the program 's operational details to the so - called Gang of Eight -- each party 's leaders in the Senate and the House and on the two intelligence committees -- and has agreed to full committee briefings only on the legal justifications for the operation , without discussing in detail how the N.S.A. conducts it .
Ms. Wilson said in the interview Tuesday that she considered the limited Congressional briefings to be " increasingly untenable " because they left most lawmakers knowing little about the program .
She said the House Intelligence Committee needed to conduct a " painstaking " review , including not only classified briefings but also access to internal documents and staff interviews with N.S.A. aides and intelligence officials .
Ms. Wilson , a former Air Force officer who is the only female veteran currently in Congress , has butted up against the administration previously over controversial policy issues , including Medicare and troop strength in Iraq .
She said she realized that publicizing her concerns over the surveillance program could harm her relations with the administration .
" The president has his duty to do , but I have mine too , and I feel strongly about that , " she said .
Asked whether the White House was concerned about support for the program among Republicans , Dana Perino , a presidential spokeswoman , said : " The terrorist surveillance program is critical to the safety and protection of all Americans , and we will continue to work with Congress .
The attorney general testified at length yesterday , and he will return to Capitol Hill twice more before the week ends . "
Aides to Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , who as chairman of the full House Intelligence Committee is one of the eight lawmakers briefed on the operations of the program , said he could not be reached for comment on whether he would be open to a full inquiry .

A city - sized iceberg has broken off an island near Antarctica .
The iceberg is about 8 miles wide and 15 miles long .
It broke free of the Fimbul Ice Shelf , a large glacial ice sheet along the northwestern section of Queen Maud Land , in the eastern Weddell Sea near Antarctica .
The discovery was announced Friday .
The National Ice Center , using visible satellite imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program , spotted the iceberg now named named D - 16 .
Iceberg names are derived from the Antarctic quadrant where they are first sighted .
Last year , a larger wandering iceberg named B - 15A rammed into the continent and single - handedly ripped two other new city - sized icebergs free .

My personal favourite example of dismissing advancement is the television .
When it came out , old time radio people dismissed it as a toy .
Nice call .
But wait , we are n't done .
When colour television came out , the black and white television people dismissed it as unneeded .
Somebody , as they say , was n't dancing with the innovation they brought to the ball .

Hot news !
How many of you have 2,000 systems ?

have written
Recently , Lucas Carlson announced Starfish , an ultra- lightweight distributed processing framework , and map_reduce , his own implementation of distributed mapping and reducing based loosely on Google 's famous MapReduce Almost immediately , people pointed out that what he had created looked to them like a toy .
Some people pointed out that although its map is fully distributed , its reduce is centralized in the supervisor process .
Others pointed out that fault tolerance was not built - in .
Some even pointed out that it looked like a thin wrapper around other services ( as if free software is ) .
I agree that map_reduce is not MapReduce .
That 's a .
After all , the world alreadyMapReduce .
If you want to use MapReduce just the way it is , go work for Google .
Do n't wait .
You know , all the comparison to MapReduce has a strangely familiar ring .
What do the following systems have in common ?
Must I go on ?
History is replete with inventions that are simplified , scaled - down versions of things that have come before ( I know , Java - haters will find it hard to remember a time when Java was the new kid on the block that represented a simplified , scaled - down language compared to C++ ) .
It seems that every time some such thing comes out , somebody points out that it is a toy , not suitable for serious use .
And what happens ?
Come on , youwhere this is going , it 's practically a cliché : first the new , simpler , less powerful thing lives in a weird niche where people have a special need that overrides the bountiful impracticalities of the new thing .
Then whole new markets are discovered where the new thing offers the perfect balance of features and before long , the new thing takes over the old markets .
It 's pretty obvious to me that when a lot of people dismiss something as being too simple , too underpowered , and lacking the wide variety of features and options of its predecessors , the right thing to do is to take a closer look and suspend final judgment .
Right now there 's a world market for maybe five full - text web search engines .
If you are one of those five people trying to index the entire web , you can dismiss map_reduce immediately .
Everyone else might want to look at map_reduce ( and everything else considered too wimpy for serious work ) and instead of listing all the ways it falls short of the status quo , ask yourself in what ways does the status quo falls short of mass - market appeal .
At first glance , map_reduce looks like it makes it really easy to distribute analysis , especially of things living in your database .
Hmmm .
Thousands of Rails users put things in one database .
Will it scale to 2,000 systems ?
How many of you have 2,000 systems ?
Next question .
Now how many Rails programmers just ordered a shiny new Mac Pro with four cores ?
Nice to see a sea of hands .
Guess what ?
You are all people who could benefit from map_reduce .
Do you have a few spare Macs or PCs in your office ?
All the better , put them to work while you 're at it .
I 'm not in a position to recommend using map_reduce until I 've tried it myself .
But I can say without hesitation that there is a need for ridiculously easy distributed processing on Ruby , and it does n't need to scale to 2,000 machines to be useful . "
The answer is :.
Amazon 's Elastic Compute Cloud lets you run applications on thousands of machines and pay only for compute time and bandwidth outside of the cloud .
Note to my sharp - witted readers ( again , all of you ) : this is not a license to write and say " because Irun an application on 2,000 servers , I 'm dismissing Starfish without another thought . "
The correct thing to write is " Ian application that runs on 2,000 servers , and ... "

Fields , he recalls , were lined with hummocks of strawberries .
Grapes and peaches grew in glasshouses .
Plums dangled over the walls of orchards .
There was a pump for spring water .
A mile - and - a - half down the road was a small cluster of cottages called Heathrow .
The only grey objects in the sky above the market gardens of Middlesex were Clark 's pigeons .
Jack Clark is 94 and still keeps pigeons at the bottom of his cottage garden in Sipson .
Around him , however , is a landscape utterly transformed .
At night , he stands in his dressing gown and watches a line of eight aircraft , lights ablaze , hanging in the sky like Christmas lights as they make their descent into the world 's busiest international airport .
A field away , a satellite dish whirs round and round .
The red lights of a control tower blink over the rooftops .
Sipson , a village of 700 homes , is marooned between the M4 , the M25 and Heathrow .
Where he would bird - nest as a boy , a boxy Holiday Inn now squats .
Where he once played cricket on the street , people carriers stack up .
And yet , against all logic , a small community survives in Sipson .
You will see it if you look to your right seconds before touching down from your sunshine break in Barbados .
Americans exclaim at it .
There is a paddock of horses , the low beams of the King William IV pub , a primary school , a ( converted ) Baptist church , the post office and the butcher 's , mock - Tudor houses , crescents of pale - bricked semis from the 70s .
A village , a recognisable village .
This year , 855 years after the first surviving records of a settlement called Sibwineston , the people of Sipson expect to be wiped off the map .
From Gordon Brown downwards , the government , supported by airlines and the aviation industry , says that Heathrow must have a third runway .
At Stansted , plans for a second runway will swallow two small hamlets , but not since wartime has such a large village been threatened .
Sipson 's 700 homes , shops , pubs , small businesses and school will by buried under taxiways , terminals , concourses and car parks by 2020 if this year 's government review of its 2003 aviation white paper approves R3 , as the aviation industry calls it .
And , as BAA , Heathrow 's owners , acknowledge , it is not an either / or choice .
A third runway at Heathrow will not halt the need to expand other airports .
Our insatiable appetite for cheap foreign travel means that the struggle to save Sipson will mirror other battles across the country in years to come .
A sickly image recurs on the streets of Sipson .
" I 've lived here for more than 30 years and just rubbed along with the airport , " says Christine Shilling , whose house is 200 yards from the proposed taxiway just outside Sipson .
" Now I see it like a cancer , spreading across the landscape . "
Bryan Sobey stands in his front room next to three wistful oil paintings of trains .
" Heathrow used to be what I called a ' friendly - advantage ' place .
It supplied work .
It was a bit of a family , in a way .
It is now a cancer just about to become malignant . "
He and his wife Ann bought their house in 1959 .
Coming from Devon , they had seen entire villages sacrificed for military camps during the second world war .
" But this is so that someone can go to Malaga , " says Sobey .
Heathrow was born in the war .
A small aerodrome with a grass runway was built by Fairey Aviation to test aircraft in 1929 .
According to local historian Philip Sherwood - like every resident , drawn into the campaign to save Sipson - the air ministry knew that an airport so near west London would never be approved under normal planning laws .
The second world war intervened , Fairey was evicted and Heathrow became a military airfield .
" It was a ruse , " says Sherwood .
" They did n't start work on building the airport until May ' 44 .
Within a year , the war was over . "
The people of Sipson have a motto for Heathrow : " Deception since its inception . "
This year , Sipson celebrates an inauspicious anniversary : 60 years of having been earmarked for destruction .
Plans from 1946 show five runways and no Sipson , but money ran out .
Heathrow remained a bucolic collection of marquees .
" They had only just pulled down the tents when I arrived .
The terminals were Nissen huts , " says Sobey .
In his early days as a customs officer intercepting smuggled diamonds , all the " bucket and spade " flights departed from other ( now defunct ) small airports nearby .
He never imagined Heathrow 's remorseless expansion .
When Terminal 4 arrived in 1978 , residents were assured there would never be a 5 , 6 or 7 .
But by the early 1990s , with T5 on the statute book , a third runway was mooted to serve Terminals 6 and 7 .
Rejected in 1995 , the plans for R3 were quietly resuscitated at the century 's end .
Three developments make 2006 a potentially fatal year for Sipson .
Buried in the chancellor 's pre-budget report in November last year was an announcement of " extensive " research on pollution problems at Heathrow " aimed at identifying solutions that would allow construction of a third runway to take place within relevant air quality limits " .
Then there is the government 's own review of Britain 's transport infrastructure by Rod Eddington , the former British Airways chief executive .
It is widely expected to streamline the planning process for major infrastructure , making it harder for Sipson to block the runway .
Finally , at the end of the year , the government will review its 2003 white paper .
It had said Heathrow 's expansion would be delayed because of noise and pollution problems .
Lobby groups are now pushing for a positive decision on R3 ; the chancellor 's activity suggests they will get it .
Sobey , the diligent president of Sipson 's residents ' association , knows every publicly available fact of the plans - and every detail he claims has been left out ( such as how the roads will cope with the extra traffic from Heathrow 's expansion ) .
A calm , rational man , he struggles to comprehend the destruction of his village .
" This is the total eviction of an entire community - their recreation grounds , country walks , schools , houses , small businesses .
It 's ethnic cleansing without the guns . "
" Maybe it 's primeval , " says Shilling , who , with two other local women , helped set up Sipson 's campaigning arm , the No Third Runway Action Group ( NoTRAG ) .
" Maybe it 's biology .
You fight for the nest .
[ But ] it is n't just home .
It 's the school where generations of children have been educated .
It 's the wiping out of memories .
It hit me as immoral , evil and unjust . "
Anti-airport protests remain rooted in parochial concerns .
But the people of Sipson know it is not enough to be Nimbys .
" In the past , one group would say , ' Why not build the runway at Stansted where there 's all those empty fields ? ' and the other would say , ' Why not build another runway at Heathrow , it 's ruined already ' , " says John Stewart of the west London campaign group Hacan ClearSkies .
" Now , it 's more united . "
Sipson 's radicals tilt at the whole edifice of air travel , where predictions ( UK passenger journies to increase from 200 million to 500 million a year by 2030 ) become targets .
" I'm a caravaner , " says NoTRAG 's chair , Geraldine Nicholson .
" I last flew five years ago .
I 'm not asking people to fly less .
I 'm asking them to pay the proper cost . "
It is ironic , says Sherwood .
" Food is being imported from all over the world .
Parsnips come from Australia to Heathrow .
Before the airport , parsnips grew at Heathrow . "
NoTRAG includes residents from Harmondsworth and Harlington , the villages to the west and east that expect to be similarly blighted beyond habitation by R3 .
Nearly 1,000 local people attended its AGM last year .
Now Sipson hopes to mobilise the good folk of Richmond , Kensington and others across south - west London , who , they say , do not realise the increase in noise and pollution they could experience .
They have written letters to ministers and , aided by green groups and road protest veterans , pledge non-violent direct action if and when building work begins .
" It 's a housewives ' army , " says Nicholson , 36 .
" Our strategy is to make the MPs listen but [ transport secretary ] Alistair Darling wo n't even visit or meet us . "
Heathrow dwarfs Sipson .
Each year , 67 million people rely on its 166 aircraft stands , four terminals ( five from 2008 ) and two runways for work and pleasure , escape and return .
There are 70,000 people who depend on the airport for their jobs and at least 100,000 more across the UK who are indirectly linked to Heathrow .
Airlines also depend on it : in 2003 , 83 % of BA 's passengers flew there .
But without expansion it is the airport , not Sipson , that faces extinction , argues Lord Soley , a resident of west London and former Labour MP who fronts the pro-expansion pressure group Future Heathrow .
He hopes that the government will approve R3 by December .
The airport is currently squeezed on to 1,227 hectares , compared with 3,100 at Charles de Gaulle outside Paris .
Its flights are capped at 480,000 each year .
If Heathrow cannot grow , he argues , it will die .
The inexorable upward curve of passenger numbers gives people a false sense of security , says Soley .
It is like London 's docks : in the 60s , record import figures disguised their relative decline ; by 1980 , it was all over and east London was ruined .
Without a third runway , he says , west London faces the same prospect .
Heathrow already serves fewer regional destinations than it used to ; Frankfurt , Paris and Amsterdam serve more .
Amsterdam is positioning itself as London 's third airport : it flies to 21 British cities compared with Heathrow 's nine , and fewer regional connections mean the loss of international flights .
Book a flight from Edinburgh to Asia , for instance : chances are , you will be routed through Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport .
" Heathrow is living on borrowed time , " says Soley .
" If it does n't expand , it cannot survive . "
The third - short - runway would provide regional connections and preserve Heathrow 's status as a European hub .
" We need to address this argument in the context of north - west Europe , " he says .
The consequences of not expanding for the west London region are " too awful to contemplate " .
The government estimates R3 would generate more than £ 6bn in direct net economic benefits .
These economic arguments are played out in Sipson .
Some feel forced to choose between their home and their job .
One resident attends every anti-expansion demo but , with retirement two years away , is petrified that his opposition will get him the sack .
Another local , a father of two who works for BA , is happy to talk but later calls to ask to remain anonymous because he fears speaking out will get him the sack .
" I like my job .
Mine is not an argument with BA .
It is entitled to support the runway and I 'm entitled to support my home .
It 's a fight between me and my employer 's landlord .
It 's BAA 's attitude to normal hard - working families that gets me . "
" There are some things we can compensate for - house prices - and some we cannot - the sense of community , " admits a BAA spokeswoman .
Lord Soley argues that compensation must be fair and generous .
BAA says it is .
The BA worker desperately wants to move to give his family more space but says that he cannot because Sipson 's depressed prices will not fetch him a comparable home near work .
BAA has offered him and other residents affected by R3 a transferable bond which guarantees them or any future owner of their house the market value of their home as it stood in 2002 , before news of the latest plans came out and caused a house - price slump .
But residents argue that the third runway was first publicised in the early 90s , so their homes were blighted since before 2002 .
With normal life suspended as they await a verdict on the runway , villagers say it is virtually impossible to sell , even with the promise of a transferable bond .
" It 's a question of morality , " says one .
" How can you treat families like that ?
How can the government in the so - called fairest country in the world do this to working - class people ? "
Publicly , BAA remains cautious over R3 , which it says must be decided by the government .
" Our position reflects the conclusion of the government 's white paper , which is that an additional runway is desirable , but not at any cost , " says a spokeswoman .
" We know there are very challenging targets in relation to air quality and that this issue must be addressed before any possible runway can be considered . "
Even if extra runways are built at Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted by 2030 , she says , they will not meet predicted demand .
Sipson is stuck in a physical and emotional no - man 's - land .
If they lose , on the earliest reckoning residents would be forced from their homes before construction work began in earnest around 2015 .
The dispiriting dance of consultation - protest , consultation - protest might prolong the life of Sipson , but the community would die long before then .
Rumours of R3 already swirl in a vicious circle : disillusioned residents move out and let their homes rather than sell them cheap .
Renting newcomers - who are described as " the dregs " by one long - term local - are n't so bothered about Sipson 's fate .
Residents feel pushed out by BAA .
" The more dead they make this village , the less arguments they will have , " says Gerald Storr , the butcher .
" We 're like mushrooms , " says Lynn Davis , who has lived in Sipson for 50 of her 57 years .
" Kept in the dark and fed on you - know - what . "
Quality of life is flagging .
Noise pollution is surprisingly light because planes land parallel to Sipson , not over it .
The air , however , is not fresh .
Vapour trails scribble across the sky , converging into man-made clouds that blur the sun .
" It 's the creation of a post - industrial hell , " says Shilling .
Clark tends his potatoes and beetroot .
" If it 's damp , you get an oily dew on everything .
If you grow cabbages or cauliflowers , you can't eat them because of the pollution . "
Sobey has a diffusion tube on his drainpipe .
It reads 38 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre ; the EU safety maximum is 40 .
The Sipson sceptics believe Gordon Brown 's talk of " identifying solutions " to Heathrow 's air pollution problem is code for massaging the figures downwards .
How does Sipson feel ?
" These are traumatised communities , " says Shilling .
" There are people who feel helpless and despairing .
Others feel anger - all the classic bereavement reactions . "
Sobey is 76 .
He has been campaigning against Heathrow 's expansion since he retired in 1989 .
How will he feel if he loses ?
" Ulcerous .
I would feel leaden .
Well , I do now .
I have n't done anything I wanted to do when I retired . "
In years to come , Nicholson 's three sons will probably be the last generation to have any recollection of Sipson .
Where Jack Clark once walked through lanes at dusk , Nicholson takes her boys to the ponds around BA 's headquarters .
Zach , 6 , points excitedly at passing aircraft .
" I tried to explain to him what would happen when the runway came .
' So we can't feed the ducks mummy ? ' he said .
I said , ' But you like aeroplanes , ' and he said , ' No mummy , I like the swans and the ducks . ' "
Heathrow 's R3 may simply represent the unfeeling sweep of market forces .
Land use is constantly changing .
When Jack Clark was young , Thomas Wild decided three crops each year would make more money than one .
The strawberry fields were ripped up and lettuce and spring onions planted instead .
" Old man Wild lived opposite the King William pub , " remembers Clark .
" He 'd stand at his gateway on a Sunday .
The boys would walk down Harmondsworth Lane and slide in the pub's back door so he did n't see them .
The Wilds used to run the village .
BAA is running it now . "
He sits in his living room with the radiator turned up high .
" If my old guv 'nor came to life , he'd have 40 fits when he saw what they 're doing to the village .
I thought the third runway would not be in my time , but my doctor said I 'll live to 100 , so maybe I 'll see it .
Then I 'll be buried under the concrete " .

Ziegler : " Flagrant violation of international law "
Human rights investigator Jean Ziegler said they had driven people out of insurgent strongholds that were about to be attacked by cutting supplies .
Mr Ziegler , a Swiss - born sociologist , said such tactics were in breach of international law .
A US military spokesman in Baghdad denied the allegations .
" A drama is taking place in total silence in Iraq , where the coalition 's occupying forces are using hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population , " Mr Ziegler told a press conference in Geneva .
He said coalition forces were using " starvation of civilians as a method of warfare . "
" This is a flagrant violation of international law , " he added .
' False allegations '
Mr Ziegler said he understood the " military rationale " when confronting insurgents who do not respect " any law of war " .
But he insisted that civilians who could not leave besieged cities and towns for whatever reason should not suffer as a result of this strategy .
Lieutenant Colonel Steve Boylan , a US military spokesman , later rejected the accusations .
" Any allegations of us withholding basic needs from the Iraqi people are false , " he said .
Even though some supplies had been delayed during fighting , he argued that " all precautions " were being taken to take care of civilians .
" It does not do relief supplies any good if you have them going into a firefight , " he said .
The Geneva Conventions forbid depriving civilians of food and water .
Cutting off food supply lines and destroying food stocks is also forbidden .
Mr Ziegler , who opposed the US - led invasion of Iraq , said he would urge the UN General Assembly to condemn this practice when he presented his yearly report on 27 October .
Correction Appended
SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 25 — Google is calling on the computer industry to create a simpler and more efficient power supply standard that it says will save billions of kilowatt - hours of energy annually .
In a white paper to be presented Tuesday on the opening day of the Intel Developer Forum here , two leading data center designers at Google will argue that the industry is mired in inefficiency for historical reasons , dating to the introduction of the first I.B.M. PC in 1981 .
At that time , standard power supplies , which convert high - voltage alternating current to low - voltage direct current , were required to provide multiple output voltage , which is no longer necessary in today ’s PC’s .
The Google plan calls for a shift from multivoltage power supplies to a single 12 - volt standard .
Although voltage conversion would still take place on the PC motherboard , the simpler design of the new power supply would make it easier to achieve higher overall efficiencies .
Graffiti is a type of deliberately inscribed marking made by humans on surfaces , both private and public and is often prevalent in low - income neighborhoods .
It can take the form of art , drawings or words .
When done without a property owner 's consent it often constitutes vandalism .
Graffiti has existed at least since the days of ancient civilizations such as classical Greece and the Roman Empire .
The word " graffiti " expresses the plural of " graffito " , although the singular form has become relatively obscure and is largely used in art history to refer to works of art made by scratching the design on a surface .
Another related term is sgraffito , a way of creating a design by scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another one beneath .
All of these English words come from the Italian language , most likely descending from " graffiato " , the past participle of " graffiare " ( to scratch ) ; ancient graffitists scratched their work into walls before the advent of spray - paint , as in murals or frescoes .
These words derive in their turn from the Greek γ ραφ ειν ( graphein ) , meaning " to write " .
Historians continue to speculate over the vexing question as to where the term " graffiti " first referred to this form of marking .
Now let 's see some art .

Now , with 36,000 jobs cut in a week and foreign vehicles filling the highways , Paul Harris in New York surveys the collapse of an industry
For John McVeigh , making cars was not just a job ; it was his shot at the American Dream .
He had left Glasgow a young , wide - eyed man at 21 and ended up in Detroit , lured by the huge factories churning out the cars that defined 20th century US life .
He started on the factory floor and rose through the ranks .
When he retired in 1989 he was part of the management ; he had brought up four good children and lived in a nice house in the suburbs .
His neighbours ' life stories mirrored his .
But after a week in which Ford laid off 30,000 workers and shut 14 factories , McVeigh knows his story is now part of history , like the homesteaders or the goldrushers , a way of life his grandchildren will never know .
He winced at the news .
' You can't do what I did now .
It just could not happen again , ' he said in an accent still coloured by his Scots childhood .
The statistics tell a bleak story of economic disaster that has seen a whole corner of north - east America dubbed the Rust Belt .
The Big Three - Ford , General Motors and Chrysler - have declining market share , crippling pension costs and a product line reliant on deep discounts to sell .
Chrysler has been taken over by the Germans and GM posted a $ 8.6 bn loss last week , its biggest since 1992 .
Ford has been losing market share for 10 straight years .
Last week 's news was so bad that few people noticed DaimlerChrysler quietly announcing it too was axeing 6,000 staff .
At the same time , foreign firms have been invading .
In 1979 the Big Three sold nearly nine out of every 10 new vehicles on US roads .
By 2004 , as European and Asian firms ate away at their market , only about 50 per cent of the nation 's new cars were sold by US producers .
By October 2005 , cars made by the Big Three accounted for about 40 per cent of the US market , according to Forbes .
Toyota , Honda and Korean Hyundai had all made inroads .
Even that US archetype the truck saw 30 per cent of its market go to foreigners .
The US car industry is lurching into terminal decline .
It means a fundamental part of America has died as well .
Nothing has come to symbolise the American century more than the American car .
It began with Henry Ford and the Model T and went right through the tail - finned monsters of the Fifties and the hot rods of the Seventies .
American cars were about freedom , sexual liberation and sheer confident patriotism .
For young Americans a driving licence and their first Chevy or Ford was the most important rite of passage into adulthood .
The car gave birth to other American icons : the motel , the advertising billboard and the diner .
They were all children of the road .
Of course , the car still defines a lifestyle .
Americans still buy cars by the millions , whether they are in gridlocked LA or in the middle of Kansas miles from the nearest town .
But what does it mean when a country 's cultural heart is now made in Japan ?
Or Korea ?
Or Germany ?
On a stretch of Texas highway west of Amarillo lies Cadillac Ranch .
Planted in a field of wheat are 10 rusting Cadillacs , ranging from a 1949 Club Coupe to a 1963 Sedan .
All stand face down in the earth , enormous tail fins pointing defiantly at the sky .
They hail from an era when the Cadillac motto was ' The Standard of the World ' .
Motorists in their thousands pull off the Interstate in their Hondas and Toyotas to gawp at the sculpture that has stood there for 32 years : a row of automobile tombstones .
' When we made it , Cadillac Ranch was intended to be as much a monument to the glory of the tail fin as a burial of the gas guzzler , said Chip Lord , one of the artists behind what has become one of the most famous US public works of art .
' But that 's not how people see it these days . '
When Lord and his fellow artists collected the Cadillacs for their work , they toured the Texas panhandle looking for cheap deals .
Driving the huge beasts to Amarillo was a ' white trash dream come true , ' he says .
Back in 1974 the cars ' paint gleamed under the blue Western skies .
Now they are rusted and covered in graffiti .
' Perhaps it can be seen now as a sign of the decline of the American empire , ' Lord mused .
' It could become a symbol for it . '
Lord now drives a Honda : ' I know the thrill of being on the road in one of those old American cars , but the fact is that if you drive one you quickly realise how archaic they are . '
The thrill used to be all anyone cared about .
American cars had names such as Mustang , Charger and Javelin .
They were about moving forward , at speed and damn the consequences .
The size of the engine and the roar it made cruising down the road were all that mattered .
The American car was the ultimate expression of the self .
It was a story that begun at the start of the 20th century in Detroit , when Henry Ford , born on a Michigan farm , mass - produced the Model T .
He changed not only his own life from rural poverty to urban riches , but the country 's too .
In thrall to the car , America went from a farming - based society centred on small - town morality to an industrialised behemoth where the new cultural hero - personified by Ford himself - was the big city capitalist .
The new frontier was not out on the open range or staking a homestead , it was on urban streets and the new horse was a car .
Detroit became Motown - Motor City .
From the beginning , America 's cars were just as much lifestyle as they were practical .
In the Twenties , Ford Motion Pictures was the biggest film producer in the world , spewing out more than 3,000 movies celebrating the adventures to be had behind the wheel of a Ford .
Product placement is no newcomer to the film industry ; it was there at the birth .
In the Fifties and Sixties , brimming with post - war confidence , America entered the age of drive - in cinemas and suburbs geared around cars .
James Dean drove a 1949 Mercury in Rebel Without A Cause and Steve McQueen tore through the streets of San Francisco in a 1968 Mustang in Bullitt .
JFK was shot in a Lincoln Continental .
Car advertisements featured open roads , blue skies and square - jawed fathers piloting wives and children along new Interstate highways ( the biggest public works project in the history of the world ) .
American cars were the best in the world because America was the best in the world .
It ended in the 1970s with the Oil Shock .
Suddenly America - and its cars - were vulnerable .
Rob Latham , a popular culture expert at the University of Iowa , was given his first car at the same time .
' It was a 1963 Chevy Malibu convertible .
I was 16 years old , driving this huge gas guzzler right through the middle of the oil crisis when you were only allowed to buy petrol every other day .
It was nuts , ' he said .
' I later wrapped it around a telephone pole , but I loved that car . '
He now drives a Suburu .
The same thing happened to Detroit .
The 1970s triggered the decline of the American car industry and a landscape of huge factories and skyscrapers turned into an urban wasteland .
Only last week , the downtown home of Motown records , whose music was born from black workers flocking to the city for the car factory jobs , was bulldozed .
America 's tempestuous affair with the car has become a passionless marriage .
Americans still need their cars , but the world has changed and they no longer really love them .
Chrysler was taken over by Germany 's Daimler .
Japanese firms , such as Toyota and Honda , are opening plants as Ford shuts down .
Cars are not big business .
Ford as a company is worth about $ 15 bn - Google is worth $ 129bn .
US car design and production values have also been criticised .
For years American cars have been outperformed by their European and Asian competitors .
' Asian and European design used to be considered a joke in the 1980s .
Now it is the standard for cars , ' said Lord .
Many of the US cars now on the market copy modest European and Japanese designs and shun the brasher concepts .
Ford has brought in two Britons to be in charge of the look of its European and US products .
Future cars will also be more fuel - efficient and aware of green issues .
That is probably good for the environment , but represents a huge shift in what a car actually means to Americans - and what America means to itself .
The Hollywood car of choice now is not the 1946 Fat Fender Ford Coupé of John Travolta 's ' Greased Lightning ' or Jayne Mansfield 's Buick Electra .
It is the Toyota Prius , an energy - efficient hybrid driven by Cameron Diaz and Leonardo di Caprio .
And the king of the recent SUV craze is the far from sexy Hummer , a boxy military - style vehicle , inspired by the 1991 Gulf war , that encloses its owner in a protective shell .
A car born of looking for enemies , not rolling down the windows and hitting the road .
Latham says his students no longer see their cars as an essential expression ; their Toyotas and Hondas are just vehicles .
They boast of iPods or computer games , not their ' wheels ' .
' They are like walking cyborgs with all these things attached to them .
Cars have become functional .
They are not statements anymore .
Electronics are , ' he said .
Lord agrees : ' Young people do not have that same set of cultural signs .
Their cultural landscape is about technology and the internet , not about convertibles and driving across America . '
The Age of the American car is passing into nostalgia .
Latham once studied a slew of road movies from the early 1990s in which old American cars were nostalgically treated .
The most famous was Thelma and Louise , in which two put - upon women find freedom in an open - top T - Bird .
At the end of the film , the heroines hold hands and drive off the edge of a cliff .
It is a fitting image for the death of a slice of the American Dream .
After decades of the car being so much more than just a mode of transport - of symbolising industry , art , freedom , sex , a triumphant America - it has now become simply a way of getting from A to B .
The Voter 's Paradox By Leon Felkins Written 10/14/95 Revised 8/19/00
Introduction " No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible . "
-- STANISLAW LEC
It is said that society is in a moral crisis .
And , what is worse , it seems to be deteriorating at an ever increasing rate .
We all agree that something needs to be done .
Our politicians and preachers say we need to help each other more , we need to have " family values " , we need to contribute to society and we need to have high moral standards .
But there is a fundamental reason why none of this is going to happen .
That reason may be a paradox for which there is no answer .
This essay will serve as an introduction to this fascinating social problem which I will call the " Voter 's Paradox " . [ 1 ]
A few nights ago , my wife and I were driving along one of the lesser traveled highways .
We came upon a person with a broken down vehicle in obvious distress .
My wife said , " Maybe we should help " .
But I said , " I think not - it is not worth the risk " .
She responded , " But what if someday you were stranded and needed some help .
Would n't you want someone to stop ? "
Her reasoning is noble and her attitude is just exactly what our society needs .
But her logic is faulty .
It is faulty on at least two counts .
First off , my wife and I personally had much to lose and little to gain by helping this person .
There would likely be time and expense involved to us in getting the stranger 's car going again .
And , there was some risk in that we could have been harmed by the person .
The only practical reward for all this was a possible future gain of being helped in a similar situation .
And that brings us to the second fault ; how is the recipient of our compassion going to spread the word to the population that the two of us are compassionate people ( so that we might be rewarded someday when we need help ) ?
Of course , it would not happen .
Helping this person would have no effect on our chances of ever receiving similar help in this large anonymous society we now live in .
That example illustrates a phenomenon that is ubiquitous to our society .
When an individual has reason to contribute to what is basically a group activity in which the benefits of the group activity are shared by the group , certain puzzling phenomena are evident that can only be described as " diabolical " .
While there is no generally accepted terminology for these phenomena , various manifestations are often referred to as the " Voter 's Paradox " , the " Volunteer 's Paradox " , " Collective Action problems " , the " Tragedy of the Commons " , " Many - Person Prisoner 's Dilemma " , etc. , or , in general , the " Social Dilemmas " .
The well known , two - person , " Prisoner 's Dilemma " is just a special case of the " Social Dilemmas " .
In this essay , these social phenomena , which Garrett Hardin described ( see References at end of this essay ) as " problems that have no technical solution " ( a nice way of saying it is a paradox ) and other such problems belonging to the " social dilemmas " ( SD ) , will be represented by one term -- " The Voter 's Paradox " ( VP ) .
The " Voting Paradox " , seems to be an excellent representation of a wide variety of Social Dilemmas .
The definition for " paradox " used in this essay is " a person , situation , act , etc. that seems to have contradictory or inconsistent qualities " from Webster 's dictionary .
Basically , what we have are two apparently contradictory truths in the same phenomenon .
One reason that the Voting Paradox is a good candidate to represent Social Delimmas in general is that it seems to be a double paradox !
The first can be expressed as , " while it is true that a particular personal endeavor would return a benefit to all members of the group such that all individuals would receive rewards that , in totality , more than compensate for that individual 's contribution , it is also true that that particular individual would receive an even greater net return by not contributing anything ! " .
I will call this the " free - rider " aspect .
This aspect of the phenomena is consistent with a related dilemma , the " Prisoner 's Dilemma " which has received much study and is well reported in the scientific press ( see the associated article , " Prisoner 's Dilemma " ) .
The second paradox is that , " while it is true that the outcome of a group effort is made up of the sum of the individual efforts , in many cases a particular individual 's contribution makes no significant and / or measurable impact on the outcome " .
I will call this the " my vote does n't count " aspect .
I will go into more detail on the Voting Paradox , in particular , in the Examples section .
Is Rationality the Problem ?
" What is rational is real ;
And what is real is rational " .
-- Hegel
The basis for the social dilemmas is rationality .
So , what do we mean by " rationality " ?
First , it is considered to be rational for individuals to look after their own best interests .
It is hard to imagine that a free individual can do anything else .
Now , we know that a computer or robot performs actions without any such " self - interest " motivation .
A robot simply does what it is told to do .
I suppose a human could also be in a robotic state also , in which case there would be no need for self - interest motivation .
Hopefully , most of us cannot be described as robots although it sometimes seems that way when you see people mindlessly spending their money for useless products just because a TV salesperson suggests it .
Further , a case can be made that people who mindlessly accept directions from others , that is meme - driven people , of which the trend seems to be more of every day , are not much more than robots .
But for those of us who have not totally succumbed to the euphoric state of the meme - controlled mind , and who still have to make decisions continuously throughout the day , rational self interest has to be the criteria ( but maybe we humans are not always rational .
See my essay , " Humans are Rational , are n't they ? " ) .
Even a person who claims to be an altruist will admit that the reason she wants to help other people is that it makes the her feel good , and therefore , is performing a selfish act .
A person who gives her money to a robber has the choice of parting with the money or possibly her life .
Choosing life over money is a rational self - interested decision .
With regard to the social dilemmas , the choice is between looking after one 's own interest or looking after a large , often anonymous , group 's interests .
The problem is complicated by the disproportionate impact that the contribution might make between giving it to yourself or the group .
For example , maybe I could send in a $ 1,000 to President Clinton to help with the national debt .
That $ 1,000 means a lot to me but it will have an insignificant impact on our country 's welfare and it will not be noticeable by anyone .
So , the problem is not just that I am selfish , but that the individuals of the group get little from my contribution compared to what I would get giving it to myself .
[ 2 ]
The act of voting that I have chosen to be representative of the social dilemmas , seems to be an irrational act for the individual .
It has some cost and it would appear that one vote cannot impact the election results .
Some say that there is a rational justification for voting and that is the possibility of breaking a tie .
But the probability of breaking a tie in any election of any reasonable size is incredibly small .
An excellent analysis of this probability is in the book , Democracy and decision listed in the references at the end of this essay .
In any case , tie breaking is not the reason most people vote .
An Action can be both Good for the Individual but Bad for the Group Specifically , the claim here is that a situation can exist such that : ( 1 ) while everyone would be better off if everyone contributes ( cooperates ) , a particular individual is always better off not contributing ( defecting ) and ( 2 ) the individual 's contribution will not affect the outcome anyway .
That both of these conditions are satisfied for a voter in a national election is obvious on reflection .
We are all better off if most people vote , but my vote will make no impact and it does cost me to vote .
Hence the term , " Voter 's Paradox " for this type of social dilemma .
The reader should not be too quick to cynically dismiss this assertion as some academic pathological construct .
On the contrary , the situation described is extremely common -- as I will attempt to show in this essay by providing examples occurring in all walks of life .
Philosophers and social scientists claim that the VP is a special case of the well studied " Prisoner 's Dilemma " phenomenon .
" The Voter 's Paradox " , is similar to the " The Prisoner 's Dilemma " in the payoff matrix ( where the " other player " is everyone else ) but is much more complex and much more common in the real world .
The VP phenomenon includes both contributions by an individual to a group shared benefit as well as the withdrawal of some portion of a group shared asset .
The " contribution " example is best illustrated by the voting process itself .
The " withdrawal " example is well illustrated by the so - call " Tragedy of the Commons " in which excessive withdrawals of a shared asset are done by certain individuals .
This aspect is often called " freeloading " or " freeriding " .
Some Examples to help Clarify the Concept Here are a few examples of Social Dilemmas .
More are listed here .
Water Shortage in Los Angeles
Let 's say you live in Los Angeles and one day the city announces that , due to a water shortage , everyone should cut back on consumption .
In particular , the city says that you should only shower once a week .
Now you have been working in the garden and you really would like a shower !
What are your options ?
If you do n't take a shower , the water situation gets -- for all practical purposes -- no better but you are uncomfortable and stink like a clogged sewer .
If you do take a shower there is great benefit to you but the small amount of water that you consume is insignificant compared to the total in the reservoir and , in fact , no one will notice .
Put another way , your consumption when spread over the millions of residents in Los Angeles is of no consequence .
( But " what if everyone did the same ? " .
we are not talking about everyone , we are talking about one person -- namely you . )
Elections
There is some cost to you in voting . [ 3 ]
While it may be small for some , it is significant for others .
Some people go to a great deal of effort just to vote .
What return do they get for this effort ?
Zilch !
A single vote can only impact an election when there is a tie , which has essentially zero chance of happening in a state or national election .
( To be more precise , " The chance that your vote will count in a democratic election is much less than one over the number of elementary particles in the universe " according to Pierre Lemieux ' excellent and comprehensive article , " The Voting Gamble " . )
The typical response to this is " Well , what if everyone did that ? "
Of course , that would be a disaster .
But we are not talking about everyone , we are talking about the impact of ONE individual 's action .
Any activity , if " everyone does it " , is likely to have a major impact on society .
The next time you buy or sell a few shares of stock , consider " What if everyone does it ? " .
What if everyone flushed the commode at the same time you do ?
Etc. But like the Prisoner 's Dilemma , if you do " cooperate " by voting and everyone else does , society as a whole is greatly benefited .
On the other hand if everyone declines to vote -- which rationally they should -- we have a disaster .
Yet each individual has a greater reward by not voting !
That is the paradox .
The Voting Paradox has more sinister effects than just discouraging voting .
Realizing that their vote will have essentially no effect on the election outcome , many people do n't bother to get involved with politics at all !
A quote from the book , Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory , says it well ; " The hypothesis of ' rational ignorance ' holds that the citizens know little beyond what they can learn costlessly , because they have no incentive to expend resources to become knowledgeable about political affairs . [ 3 ]
In light of the small probability that any voter 's ballot will prove decisive in an election , the rational citizen reasons that the benefits of casting a well - informed vote will not offset the expenditure of time and money spent gathering information . "
This view of the true cost of voting was expanded further in the November 4 , 1996 , issue of the newspaper , Investor 's Business Daily , in an article called " Is Ignorance Rational ? " .
The publication of this essay is very noteworthy as it represents one of the few times that the popular press has taken note of this phenomenon .
It is particularly noteworthy that this is a conservative , no - nonsense , newspaper !
A summary quote from this essay is : " Each person knows his vote wo n't decide the election , so he does n't follow the issues " .
While many people will agree with me that their one vote will have no impact on the election results , they say , " But still , Leon , we should vote -- it is our duty . "
Good point .
But that philosophy has an interesting implication ; you should vote strictly for who you would like to be elected .
That is , you can meet your call to duty for voting for the lesser candidates , like Ron Paul , that while highly desirable by you , have little chance to be elected .
That is , now that you accept that your vote will not help or hurt anyone , you can meet your call to duty by voting for the person you like .
This issue is well examined and explained in an article by Art Carden , " Your Vote Wo n't Matter .
Do n't Waste It " .
Environmental Degradation
The environment is a " commons " shared by all of us .
Obviously there is incentive to freeride and to destroy .
The question is " how to minimize individual abuse of an environment shared by all " .
While most people think that the heavy hand of government must be brought in , some argue that that " ai n't necessarily so " .
A good essay presenting this argument appeared in the September , 1993 issue of Atlantic Monthly , " Can Selfishness Save the Environment ? " by Matt Ridley and Bobbi S. Low .
It may be that the government solution is a solution that creates problems worse than the orginal .
Miscellaneous Examples
We are confronted with this paradox daily in our lives in many ways .
To list a few :
The disastrous national debt , the Balkins situation ( " it was not in our personal interest to help them " ) , the rampant crime situation , the exploding welfare situation , the exploding medical costs , the insurance and legal mess , the deteriorating educational programs , the environmental crisis , etc. , etc .
All these -- and many other -- situations are characterized by the conflict between the " individual " interest and the " group " interest .
In some cases the " individual " may actually be a community , a state , an ethnic group or a nation .
For example , my congressman , to help assure he will be elected again , continues to sponsor spending programs for our area of the country .
Sure , the nation suffers ( like Los Angeles , above ) but we local folks are greatly benefited ( like the individual taking a bath in Los Angeles ) .
What if every congressman did that ?
They do .
That 's the problem !
Group Size and Anonymity
The VP results from the fact that for the individual there is greater reward for defecting than there is for cooperating .
So why do many ( most ? ) people cooperate ?
One reason is that cooperating can have many hidden rewards .
No doubt , most people get a " feel good " reward when they help others or carry out their civic duties .
Certainly , they are greatly rewarded if everyone knows about it .
If these inner rewards are large enough , then it can become rational to cooperate .
But therein is a major problem .
When mankind consisted of small family of hunter / gatherer groups every person 's actions were known by everyone else .
Even in modern times , people in small communities cooperate because their actions are displayed to everyone in the community .
On the other hand , most of us live in large cities in which no one knows or cares what we as individuals do , for the most part .
If I send in an extra thousand bucks with my income tax because I really want to help the poor and the military , no one will know .
My reward just does n't come close to my cost , the thousand bucks .
That is the situation most of us are in today and that is why defection continues to grow over cooperation .
The conclusion is obvious and many studies have shown ( see the Hubermann reference ) that people cooperate more if they are kept in small groups .
Large organizations do better if they organize into many small components .
People live fuller lives if they live in small towns .
A political conclusion can be drawn here : have we done the right thing in centralizing our government in Washington ?
Classifying Social Dilemmas
The following is a short introduction on the various aspects of social dilemmas with brief indications of significance .
[ Note , this section is in its initial development ! ]
Continuous vs. Step Inputs
The PD is characterized by a " step " input : cooperate or defect .
The VP , in elections where each person has only one vote , also has a step input : vote or not vote .
Other social dilemmas may have a continuous input however .
Consider voluntary contributions to a " Community Center " in which everyone can share as desired .
Your contribution can be any amount .
Most group efforts are such that a person can make variable contributions , including taxes .
( It is a bit peculiar that most of the literature on the social dilemmas tries to identify the phenomena with the PD when the PD is characterized by step input and social dilemmas are characterized typically with a continuous input .
So , we see such terms as " Many - person Prisoner 's Dilemmas " used to represent the general social dilemmas .
If the " Tragedy of the Commons " is reduced to only two players ( two farmers sharing a pasture ) it still does not become a Prisoner 's Dilemma game .
The important conclusion here is that all the research and simulations of the various forms of the PD are not likely to be applicable to the general social dilemmas ! )
Continuous vs. Step Outputs
An election is a step output .
We do n't get 45 % Bush and 55 % Clinton but we get either all Clinton or all Bush .
But some social dilemmas have variable outputs .
Consider the " Commons " .
If I add another cow to the pasture , all those who share the Commons will each get slightly less return .
Jointness of Supply
If an output from a group effort is in joint supply , one person 's consumption of it does not reduce the amount available to anyone else .
Public TV is a good example of a public good that -- once on the air -- can be consumed by a person without diminishing the service to anyone else .
On the other hand , public highways , sewers , utilities , are not in joint supply .
The more I use , the less is available to the rest of the group .
Impossibility of Exclusion
The environment , freedom , public television , public highways , etc. are generally impossible to exclude from a person who wants to use them whether that person contributed or not .
That is , people can easily freeride if they want to .
Size of Group
When the group of players is small , the analysis of the game is fairly straight forward .
If one person freerides , then the cost is divided over the other players .
A good example is the example given by Glance and Huberman in the Scientific American , March , 1994 ( See references ) article in which a group of people are having dinner and intend to split the bill evenly .
Some of the participants take advantage of this and load up with the most expensive dinners on the menu !
But what if the group is very large -- say all the citizens in your state or country -- is it still useful to consider the group as being individuals ?
I think not .
It seems to make more sense in this situation to regard the individual as interacting with the group .
For example , in the Voter 's Paradox , if I decline to vote , I am not defecting against any individuals but society as a whole .
If I were to represent the situation with a matrix , it would only show the payoffs for me and " the rest of the group " .
A further assumption would be that I am anonymous .
This fact creates additional problems above and beyond the small group freeriding situation .
And emphasizes the inappropriate use of the PD as a model !
A Basis for Morality ?
Like the players of the Prisoner 's Dilemma , we are confronted with a situation in which , rationally , an individual should defect ( freeride ) but we will all suffer if both players ( the individual and the " rest of society " ) take that action .
While there are other actions that will help to alleviate the problem , the most promising and most general solution is well known and has a long history : morality .
If somehow we can establish that cooperating is the moral thing to do and we can convince everyone ( or , at least , most everyone ) to be moral , then we have solved the problem .
People will vote , politicians will not steal , teenagers will avoid irresponsible sex , people will conserve resources or not pollute the environment , and so on .
Could it be that human society is so constructed that to survive , morality is necessary ?
An intriguing thought -- a nonreligious basis for morality !
And a powerful one : either we cooperate or we face a total destruction of civilization as we know it .
For more on this issue , see my essay , " A RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR ETHICAL BEHAVIOR " .
Solutions : Some Successes , Many Failures Metering or Directly tying the return to the cost
The paradox goes away when a person is directly rewarded or punished by her actions .
The strategy would be to delete or minimize the " group " component in the cost / benefit equation .
That this is not always possible is recognized .
Many " Public Goods " could really be converted to " Personal Goods " .
For example , in the water usage problem or the garbage removal problem , a simple solution would be to monitor each person 's usage and charge them accordingly .
Toll roads are another example .
Small Groups
As discussed above , we have few problems with the free - rider aspect of the VP when everyone in the group is personally acquainted with each other .
Coercion and other Outside Inducements Garrett Hardin stated in his 1968 paper that the solution to the class of problems discussed here -- those having " no technical solution " -- is " mutual coercion , mutually agreed to " .
Practically , this means government control , a democratic government , most would say .
But that has its downside too -- a big downside !
Using the Government to do your dirty work Most activist groups use the government to enforce cooperation when it is obvious that voluntary cooperation will not do the job .
The Environmental movement would be dead if left up to the voluntary cooperation of the citizens .
In fact , it is difficult to find a purely voluntary program that is successful -- even if the citizens agree to its necessity !
Another example is " culture " .
Those that would provide " culture " to the masses know that the masses would not support this by any voluntary sacrifice .
So they use the force of law to give the masses what they " need " .
There is a dear price to pay in using the government to solve the Social Dilemmas .
The government primarily controls by means of laws .
The laws passed to force personal " cooperation " of the free - riders , hurt us all .
For example , the criminal justice system is a failure due to the lack of " cooperation " of the various responsible individuals ; the judges , the police , the prison administrators , etc .
As discussed elsewhere in this series of essays , each of these people find that looking after their own interests [ 4 ] is at odds with solving the crime problem .
Guess which wins !
To combat this " defection " the government ( from citizen pressure , by the way ) has passed Mandatory Sentencing laws and other such disastrous laws .
This not only results in cruel and excessive punishment for some who have done little or no harm to society but also has generally complicated the Criminal Justice system even more !
Jonathan Baron 's essay entitled " Political action vs. voluntarism in social dilemmas and aid for the needy " , published in Rationality and Society , 9 , 307-326 , provides an analysis of the comparative benefits of doing nothing , voluntary contribution , and attempting to induce the government to force people to do what is " good for them " .
Using Religion to induce cooperation Religions have been quite effective in inducing people into cooperating and acting in the group 's best interests .
However , religion 's technique of increasing the reward and / or punishment by promising an afterlife is not easy for many to accept .
The force of religion as a means of invoking cooperation seems to be declining as the population has become more educated and " world - wise " .
Using propaganda to encourage cooperation
The news media and the educational establishment have been quite effective in seducing members of society into " doing the right thing " .
The enormous guilt that many people feel if they do n't throw their aluminum can in the recyclable bin is a testimony of the power of propaganda .
The disadvantage is that propaganda can be misdirected .
Examples are too numerous to mention in this limited space !

Das Cluster - Dateisystem OCFS2 , überarbeitete Locking - Mechanismen für kritische Codebereiche , komplette Unterstützung für den Cell - Prozessor und Verbesserungen an diversen Treibern zählen zu den wichtigsten Neuerungen der neuen Kernel - Version .
Nach über zwei Monaten Entwicklungszeit hat Linus Torvalds den Linux - Kernel 2.6.16 freigegeben .
Hinzu kamen mit der neuen Version unter anderem das Cluster - Dateisystem OCFS2 , verbesserte Locking - Mechanismen für kritische Codebereiche , komplette Unterstützung für den Cell - Prozessor und Verbesserungen der Stromsparmechanismen bei diversen Treibern .
Beim maßgeblich von Oracle vorangetriebenen Cluster - Dateisystem OCFS2 hatten seine Entwickler ursprünglich schon bei Linux 2.6.14 auf die Integration gehofft .
Es ähnelt vom Aufbau her ext3 und ist das erste im Kernel enthaltene Dateisystem speziell für Netzwerk - Cluster .
Es soll schneller als der separat vertriebene Vorgänger OCFS sein und das System - Management von Oracle Real Application Cluster ( RAC ) vereinfachen ; es eignet sich jedoch auch für Einsatzgebiete jenseits von ( Oracle - ) Datenbanken .
Die Programmierer des ursprünglich von Sistina entwickelten und von Red Hat erneut unter Open - Source - Lizenz gestellten Cluster - Dateisystems GFS ( Global File System ) hingegen arbeitet weiter an der Aufnahme in den Kernel .
Zusammen mit OCFS2 nahmen die Entwickler das Pseudo - Dateisystem configfs zur Konfiguration von Kernel - Parametern zur Laufzeit auf – im begrenzten Maß lassen sich dafür zwar auch procfs und sysfs benutzten , dafür sind sie aber eigentlich nicht konzipiert .
Für die Prozesskommunikation im Cluster kam unabhängig von OCFS2 TIPC ( Transparent Inter Process Communication ) hinzu .
Sicher und schnell
Ebenfalls neu ist der Mutex - Locking - Mechanismus .
Mutex stammt von dem Begriff mutual exclusion ( " wechselseitiger Ausschluss " ) .
Wie Semaphoren schützt ein Mutex kritische Codebereiche , sodass sich mehrere , unter Umständen auf unterschiedlichen Prozessoren laufende Prozesse dort nicht ins Gehege kommen .
Anfangs war über die Mutex - Implementation und deren Sinn heftig debattiert worden , doch nach einigen Überarbeitungen durch Ingo Molnar , den Entwickler der Realtime - Patches , wurde der Code unter anderem aufgrund von deutlichen Geschwindigkeitsverbesserungen im Vergleich zu den bisher genutzten Semaphoren kurzfristig in den offiziellen Kernel übernommen .
Darüber hinaus wurden einige neue System Calls aufgenommen .
Darunter einige vom glibc - Verwalter Ulrich Drepper vorgeschlagene , die zusammen mit Neuerungen in der glibc schneller und besser sicherstellen , dass sich mehrere Threads bei Dateisystemoperationen nicht ins Gehege kommen .
Die Speicher - und Swap - Verwaltung in NUMA - Systemen wurde verbessert , und ein neues Subsystem namens EDAC ( Error Detection And Correction ) kam hinzu .
Es soll korrigierbare und unkorrigierbare Speicher - oder PCI - Fehler erkennen , gegebenenfalls beheben und den Administrator darüber informieren , damit er die verantwortliche Hardwarekomponente rechtzeitig austauschen kann .
Die erst vor kurzem zum Kernel hinzugestoßene Unterstützung zum Verschlüsseln des Speicherabbilds beim mit dem Ruhezustand von Windows vergleichbaren Software - Suspend wurde wieder entfernt ; langfristig soll ein Userspace - Programm dies und vieles andere erledigen , für das bisher noch der Kernel zuständig ist .
Der häufig kritisierte Kernel - Code für Software - Suspend entwickelt sich mit diesen und einigen anderen Neuerungen wieder deutlich weiter .
Es entstanden aber auch lange Debatten , ob oder wie das von vielen Anwendern als bessere angesehene , jedoch extern entwickelte Suspend2 komplett oder in Teilen in den Kernel aufgenommen werden kann .
Das Kompilieren des Kernels erfordert in Zukunft mindestens eine GCC in Version 3.2 .
Neu in 2.6.16 sind die High - Resolution Kernel Timers ( hrtimers ) , die eine exaktere Zeitmessung im Nanosekundenbereich inner- und außerhalb des Kernels ermöglichen .
Das ist etwa für Real - Time - oder Multimedia - Anwendungen interessant .
Stark überarbeitet wurde das TTY - Subsystem für serielle Geräte .
Zudem erfuhr der Code für den Paketfilter IP - Tables mit der Aufnahme der bisher unter dem Namen x_tables entwickelten Überarbeitung ein Lift - up , das langfristig die Wartung vereinfachen soll .
Das CIFS - Client - Dateisystem zum Zugriff auf Windows - und Samba - Netzwerkfreigaben kennt jetzt Access Control Lists ( ACLs ) und Authentifizierung über Kerberos .
Mit der Aufnahme des spufs zum Zugriff auf die acht Synergistic Processor Units ( SPUs ) des Cell - Prozessors ist der Support für diesen nun weitgehend komplett .
Ebenfalls unterstützt werden AMDs Prozessoren Geode GX und LX .
Auch bei den im Kernel enthaltenen Treibern hat sich wie mit jeder Version einiges getan .
Unter anderem kam zum skge - Treiber für Marvell - Netzwerkchips ein neuer Treiber namens sky2 für einige der Gigabit - Produkte aus gleichem Haus hinzu .
Sie dürften den von Marvell entwickelten und im Kernel vorhandenen , dort aber kaum noch gewarteten Treiber sk98 lin langfristig ablösen .
Die Sound - Treiber wurden auf die Alsa - Version 1.0.11rc2 aktualisiert , die nun mit einer ganzen Reihe an vorher nicht unterstützten HD - Audio - Codecs umgehen können .
Die Treiber beherrschen jetzt genauso wie überarbeitete USB- , PC - Card- , AGP - und SATA - Treiber die Standby - und Suspend - Vorgänge deutlich besser .
Die SATA - und Sound - Treiber von 2.6.16 unterstützen bereits Intels für Mitte des Jahres angekündigten ICH8 , für den SATA - Chipsatz JMicron JMB360 kam ein neuer Treiber hinzu .
Der Direct Rendering Manager arbeitet nun auch mit dem Notebook - Chipsatz 945GM als auch mit dem Radeon x600 zusammen , zudem spricht der Kernel gleich eine Reihe bisher nicht unterstützter TV - und DVB - Karten an .
Debatten
Aufregung gab es während des Entwicklungszeitraums um eine Änderung der Treiber - Schnittstelle im USB - Subsystem , bei denen einige alte API - Aufrufe entfernt wurden und durch neue , ausschließlich für GPL - Treiber nutzbare ersetzt wurden .
Das bemängelte ein AVM - Mitarbeiter auf der Kernel - Mailingliste – wenn es nicht mehr möglich sei , Nicht - GPL - USB - Treiber zu schreiben , würde das Unternehmen den Linux - Support für alle AVM - USB - Geräte einstellen müssen .
Greg Kroah - Hartman , der den USB - Code verwaltet und einer der treibenden Kräfte hinter der Beschränkung von Kernel - APIs auf GPL - Treiber ist , wandte ein , dass es schon lange möglich sei , Closed - Source - USB - Treiber im Userspace zu schreiben – die würden dann auch unter BSD und gar Windows arbeiten können .
Nichtsdestotrotz gab er die Schnittstellen für Nicht - GPL - Software frei , sodass die AVM - Treiber prinzipiell auch wieder mit Kernel 2.6.16 zusammenarbeiten können .
Damit sich Hersteller auf solche Änderungen rechtzeitig einstellen können , plant Kroah - Hartman in Zukunft ein verändertes Procedere .
Diskussionen gab es auch um eine Änderung am Hardware Abstraction Layer ( HAL ) .
Sie hätten eigentlich ein Update der HAL - Userspace - Programme erfordert , der entsprechende Quellcode wurde jedoch wieder modifiziert , um das zu umgehen .
Um hier in Zukunft für Kernel - Entwickler , Distributoren und Anwender mehr Klarheit zu schaffen , schlug Greg Kroah - Hartman vor , die Verlässlichkeit der Schnittstellen zum Userspace zu dokumentieren .
Ausblick
Auch außerhalb des Kernels hat die Entwicklung nicht stillgestanden und dürfte in den kommenden Kernel - Versionen Auswirkungen zeigen .
So sind einige Entwickler von extern gewarteten WLAN - Treibern mit dem erst vor wenigen Monaten in Version 2.6.14 aufgenommenen IEEE80211 - Stack nicht zufrieden .
John Linville von Red Hat will hier in Zukunft als erster offizieller Verwalter des Wireless - Subsystems für Ordnung sorgen und die Situation verbessern , sodass die Streitereien um die IEEE80211 - Stacks ein Ende finden und mehr Treiber in den Kernel aufgenommen werden können .
Der aktuelle mm -Entwicklerkernel von Andrew Morton enthält eine Vielzahl von Erweiterungen , die vielleicht früher oder später in den Kernel einziehen – etwa ein generisches RTC Subsystem oder eine Überarbeitung von procfs .
Um das vor rund 18 Monaten vorgestellte Dateisystem Reiser4 ist es nach diversen Rangeleien um die Qualität des Quellcodes und die Integration in Linux wieder relativ still geworden .
Bevor der Code aufgenommen werden kann , muss sich laut Andrew Morton zuallererst ein mit dem Linux Virtual File System ( VFS ) Vertrauter hinsetzen , der Reiser4 zusammen mit dessen Entwicklern in einen für den Kernel akzeptablen Zustand bringt .
Er habe dies selbst tun wollen , aber schlicht keine Zeit gefunden , meinte Morton .
Linux 2.6.16 steht ab sofort über kernel.org oder in Kürze auch über dessen deutschen Mirror zum Download bereit .
Sämtliche Änderungen listet das ausführliche Changelog , einige der wichtigen fasst zudem das Kernelnewbies - Wiki zusammen .
Whatever else can be said for or against Israel 's escalation of military action against Lebanon , there is little prospect that it will achieve its stated objectives .
If Israel could n't defeat Hizbullah after 18 years in which its army occupied large swaths of Lebanese territory , it is not going to succeed with air strikes and blockades , or even another occupation .
The same point applies even more forcefully in the case of Gaza .
Every time Israel applies the iron fist in an effort to beat the Palestinians into submission , their resistance simply re-emerges in a more extreme and rejectionist form .
Far from fearing Israel 's wrath , Hizbullah and Hamas must be rather pleased at their success in provoking it into the sort of over - reaction from which they have always benefited .
Nor does it seem plausible that military action will enable Israel to secure the release of its captured soldiers .
The civilian victims of Israel 's indiscriminate retaliation have no real influence over the militias that hold them , while the militias themselves are untroubled by the spectacle of public suffering .
On the contrary , they thrive on it .
In the case of Lebanon , it is possible that acts of collective punishment , such as the destruction of Beirut airport and yesterday 's killing of yet more civilians , might divide Hizbullah and its supporters from the rest of the country , but only at the risk of triggering another civil war and creating a vacuum that Israel 's enemies in Syria and Iran will find easier to exploit .
In view of all this , it is valid to ask what Israel thinks it is doing .
Indeed , this question is implicit in the statements of world leaders at the G8 and elsewhere who have called on Israel to use force proportionately , avoid civilian casualties and refrain from acts that might strengthen Hamas or destabilise Lebanon 's fragile political settlement .
No one quibbles with Israel 's right to defend itself , but does n't it understand how irresponsible and immoral it is to deliberately escalate the conflict in this way ?
The problem is that the premise of the question is false .
It assumes that Israel shares our view that a de-escalation followed by negotiation is the best route to a settlement .
It assumes , therefore , that when Israeli ministers complain of having " no partner for peace " , they actually want one .
A much more sensible approach would be to credit them with having the intelligence to know exactly what they are doing and to work backwards from there .
If so , it might become apparent that far from wanting a partner with which to negotiate , the Israeli government is acting with the specific intention of forestalling that possibility .
There is nothing particularly new in this .
The extremists on both sides have always formed a kind of tacit alliance , with the supporters of " greater Israel " and " no Israel " understanding their joint interest in preventing any moves towards a compromise peace .
That is the main reason why Israel encouraged the growth of Hamas as it emerged in the 1980s .
Unwilling to negotiate with the secular nationalists of Fatah , even as they were moving towards support for a two - state solution , the Israeli authorities thought it would be a clever idea to promote their Islamist rivals .
In the case of the current crisis , it is no accident that it occurred at precisely the moment when the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , was gaining the upper hand in the latest round of that struggle .
By using the threat of a referendum to force Hamas to accept the existence of Israel as the basis for a final settlement , Abbas had created the most promising opening for peace in six years .
Faced with internal division and the loss of political initiative , Hamas militants understood that the only way to prevent it would be to trigger another cycle of violence .
In turn , the Israel government , whose interests were also threatened by the Abbas initiative , recognised that it had an equally good reason to oblige .
The effect of Hizbullah 's intervention and Israel 's over - reaction has been to put peace even further down the agenda .
The plain truth is that Israel thinks that it can get more by imposing a solution through force than by negotiation and is not interested in any kind of peace process .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , pays lip service to the road map , but he has already received American endorsement for his fallback position , artfully dubbed " unilateral convergence " .
George Bush has described it as a " bold idea " .
Armed with the knowledge that he will continue to enjoy American patronage if the road map fails , Olmert has set out to ensure that it does just that .
Bush 's diplomacy has been truly inept .
It 's high time western governments grasped the fundamental truth that Israel is pursuing an agenda that conflicts directly with their own .
In the context of the fight against terrorism and the need to promote international cooperation , the west 's interest must be to remove the Palestinian question as a source of grievance among mainstream Muslims in a way that guarantees justice for the Palestinians and security for Israel .
A settlement of this kind is perfectly feasible and has been outlined in countless documents and initiatives over the years , most recently in the Geneva accords .
But the main reason it has proved illusive is that Israel is not , and never has been , prepared to make the territorial compromises required .
It still believes that it is entitled to the victor 's spoils by annexing large tracts of Palestinian land .
This situation will persist as long as the west remains in denial about the reasons for the ongoing conflict and until the Israeli political establishment is forced to pay a price for its obstinacy .
Yet the US remains entirely complicit in its role as Israel 's main strategic ally .
In the midst of last Friday 's onslaught , in which Israeli bombers killed dozens of Lebanese civilians , the Pentagon announced the export of $ 210 m of aviation fuel to help Israel " keep peace and security in the region " .
Even Britain and other European countries indulge in a form of diplomatic misdirection by focusing one - sidedly on the roles played by Syria and Iran .
The key to resolving the situation in Lebanon lies , as it did throughout the 1970s and 1980s , in finding a solution to the Palestinian question .
A viable and successful Palestinian state would rob Hizbullah and its sponsors of the conceit that they are defending helpless Muslims and make it easier for those in the region who oppose them to gain the upper hand .
Mahmoud Abbas is the only leader currently working for the kind of negotiated two - state solution the Middle East and the wider world desperately need .
But he is being let down by the west at the moment when he had earned the right to expect better .
The Palestinian president needs a partner for peace .
If Israel will not play that role , the international community must .

[ This article is excerpted from chapter 13 of Mr. Callahan 's book , Economics for Real People . ]
In the economies of most modern industrial nations , a central bank manages the nation 's money supply and attempts to control the level of interest rates , at least to some extent .
( In the United States , that central bank is called the Federal Reserve .
Since it is the most powerful and famous central bank in the world , we will focus our discussion on " the Fed . " )
Various rationales have been put forward for central bank interference in the market : to supply sufficient currency and credit to " meet the needs of commerce , " to ensure a " stable value " for the currency , to " fight inflation , " to smooth out fluctuations in the economy , and so on .
In light of our discussion of money and credit so far , those reasons are suspicious .
We have seen that prices can adjust to whatever amount of currency is in the economy .
Certainly , the adjustment process takes time and has associated costs .
Therefore , we 'd prefer gradual to rapid change , giving us more time to adjust .
The need to dig up gold from the ground in order to create money acted as a regulator on the growth of the money supply during the period of the gold standard .
That regulator led to a century - long period of remarkably low volatility in prices .
Being able to create new money almost at will , as central banks can , obviously makes it easier to create rapid changes in the money supply .
The various hyperinflations that have occurred in the last century , under fiat money regimes , attest to that fact .
Similarly , we have every reason to believe that the best mechanism for matching the businesses ' perceived credit needs with the available savings is the interest rate market .
What really matters to a business is that it can acquire the goods , the knowledge , and the services it needs to complete its plans during their progress toward producing consumer goods .
The cash a business borrows is important only as a means to help acquire those factors of production .
If the real factors are not available , because people have not saved a sufficient amount out of current and past production to bring them into existence , then neither increasing the amount of dollars in circulation nor artificially lowering the interest rate will magically bring them forth from the void .
And we have already covered the reason that the search for a stable currency is hopeless : valuation is an aspect of human action , and there are no constant numerical values in human action .
Every freely chosen value implies the possibility of a change in valuation .
And , far from fighting inflation , the Fed is the main cause of it .
In this chapter , we will examine the final reason listed above , " smoothing out fluctuations in the economy , " in some depth .
Over the course of the chapter we will see that the central bank tends to be the creator , and not the dissipater , of economic fluctuations .
When it is putting on the brakes and deflating a bubble , it was usually the one that inflated the bubble in the first place .
Out of Gas
Image that you are a bus driver , at the edge of a desert , about to take a busload of passengers across it .
You have left all gas stations behind .
Your destination is a town on the other side of the wasteland before you .
You are faced with a trade - off : the faster you try to reach the town , the less the passengers can use the air - conditioning to alleviate the desert heat .
Both higher speeds and higher air - conditioning settings will use up the gas more quickly .
And since , in our luxurious bus , each passenger has his own temperature control for his seat , you , the driver , cannot control the total amount of air conditioning used on the trip .
In order to make your decision , you look at your fuel gauge and determine how much gas you have .
You tell the passengers that they must now make a trade - off between comfort on the way and speed traveled , as the more air - conditioning they choose to use , the faster the bus will consume fuel .
Then you collect statements from the passengers on what temperature they will keep their seat .
You perform some calculations on mileage , speed , and fuel consumption , and pick the fastest speed at which you can travel , given the amount of gas you have and the passengers ' statements about their use of the air - conditioning .
The passengers had to decide whether to cross the desert in greater comfort but arrive later at their final destination , or in less comfort but with an earlier arrival .
The science of economics has little to say about the combination that they picked , other than that it seemed preferable to them at that moment of choice .
However , also imagine that , before you began your calculations , someone had sneaked up to the bus and replaced the passengers ' real choices with a fake set that chose a higher temperature , in other words , one that makes it seem they will use less fuel than they really will .
You will make your choice on travel speed as if the passengers will tolerate an average temperature of , say , 80 degrees , whereas in reality they will demand to have the bus cooled to an average of 70 degrees .
Obviously , your calculations will prove to be incorrect , and the trip will not come out as you had planned .
The trip will begin with you driving as if you have more resources available than you really do .
It will end with you phoning for help , when the sputtering of your engine reveals the deception .
" Far from fighting inflation , the Fed is the main cause of it . "
I offer the above as a metaphor for the Austrian business cycle theory ( ABCT ) , which explains why most modern economies tend to swing through boom times and recessions .
You , the driver , represent the entrepreneurs .
The gas is the sum of the resources available in the economy .
The trip across the desert is some period of production .
The passengers represent the consumers .
Their choice on how much to use the air conditioning is analogous to how much consumers want to consume now at the expense of saving for the future ( i.e. , their time preference ) .
The speed of the bus is the amount of investment spending the entrepreneurs will undertake .
The ultimate destination is the satisfaction of as many of the consumers ' wishes as possible .
And it is the central bank — for instance , the Federal Reserve — that has sneaked up and tampered with the consumers ' choices .
What the central bank tampers with is the market 's reading of the consumers ' average time preference , which is the rate of originary interest .
Consumers ' time preferences tell us how much capital will become available through consumer saving , or , in our metaphor , through cutting back on the air - conditioning .
When the central bank artificially lowers the rate of interest — we hear on the news that the Fed has cut rates to " stimulate the economy " — entrepreneurs make their plans as if consumers were willing to delay consumption and save more than they really are .
As the bus driver , you act as if the passengers are willing to endure the heat enough for you to drive 70 miles per hour .
In reality , they will force the bus to consume gas so rapidly that you should have planned to drive only 55 .
Your attempt to cross the desert will fail , leaving you out of gas .
Of course , the real economy does not simply come to a halt .
At some point in the trip , it becomes apparent that the bus is using fuel too rapidly .
The Fed , expressing a concern about " overheating , " will raise rates .
The entrepreneurs will slow way down so that the bus does not simply die — they lay off employees , cancel investment projects , and reduce spending in other ways .
The economy , after the boom at the start of the trip , has fallen into a recession .
Our metaphor also allows us to differentiate between a " soft landing , " a " hard landing , " and a full crash .
The further the bus has gone before the discrepancy between the market interest rate and consumers ' real time preference is accounted for , the " harder " a landing the economy will undergo .
If the entrepreneurs discover the error early ( or the central bank cuts short the expansion quickly ) , the bus may only have to slow to 50 miles per hour to complete the trip .
If the credit expansion is continued for a long time the bus may wind up having to coast down hills with the engine off — and we have a fullscale depression , or crash .
As we saw in earlier chapters , interest rates reflect consumers ' time preference because it is what borrowers must pay lenders , in order to persuade the lenders to delay their own consumption .
If I have $ 100 , I could spend it today on a nice dinner with my wife .
Or , I could lend it out for a year , at the end of which I could spend it on a somewhat nicer dinner .
Exactly how much nicer a dinner I must expect to receive before I will lend the money is an expression of my preference for current consumption over future consumption .
If I demand a rate of interest of at least 5 % , that means that a $ 105 dinner next year is marginally more valuable to me than a $ 100 dinner this year .
On the other hand , if my friend Rob demands 10 - percent interest , he is demanding a $ 110 dinner .
He values current consumption compared to future consumption more highly than I do .
The net result of all lenders and borrowers expressing their time preference by offering and bidding on loans is the market rate of interest .
In any real interest - rate market , that rate will include , besides originary interest , added interest to account for inflation ( or subtracted interest to account for deflation ) , as well as a risk premium to account for the chance that the venture or person that the money has been lent to will go belly - up .
The rate of interest tells entrepreneurs whether a particular investment is worth making or not .
In an unhampered market , without inflation or deflation , that rate would be approximately equivalent to what is termed , in finance , the risk - free rate of interest .
Since entrepreneurs can earn that return on their money simply by buying high - grade bonds , they will not undertake capital projects if they estimate that their return will be lower than the risk - free rate of interest .
In terms of our analogy , it makes no sense to plan to travel 70 miles per hour on our trip if the consumers are only willing to turn off the AC ( put off current consumption ) enough for us to travel 55 miles per hour .
For any project that returns less than the riskfree rate of interest , the consumers are indicating that they would , in fact , prefer that the resources necessary be used for current consumption rather than being invested in that project .
The Fed Starts A Party
Let 's look briefly at the recent Internet boom - and - bust as an example of using the Austrian theory to explain an episode in economic history .
It 's been said that the Fed 's job is to take away the punch bowl once the party gets going .
The aphorism does n't mention that it was usually the Fed that had filled it in the first place .
ABCT has sometimes derisively been referred to as a " hangover theory . "
In fact , the metaphor is fairly apt .
The Fed gets the party ginned up on cheap credit , then has to cut everyone off before disaster strikes .
MZM ( money of zero maturity , one of a number of money supply measures ) increased at a rate of less than 2.5 % between 1993 and 1995 .
But over the next three years it shot up at an annualized rate of over 10 % , rising during the last half of 1998 at a binge rate of almost 15 % .
Sean Corrigan , a principal in Capital Insight , a British - based financial consultancy , details in " Norman , Strong , and Greenspan , " the consequences of the expansion that came in
autumn 1998 , when the world economy , still racked by the problems of the Asian credit bust over the preceding year , then had to cope with the Russian default and the implosion of the mighty Long - Term Capital Management .
Corrigan continues :
Over the next eighteen months , the Fed added $ 55 billion to its portfolio of Treasuries and swelled repos held from $ 6.5 billion to $ 22 billion … .
[ T ] his translated into a combined money market mutual fund and commercial bank asset increase of $ 870 billion to the market peak , of $ 1.2 trillion to the industrial production peak , and of $ 1.8 trillion to date [ August 2001 ] — twice the level of real GDP added in the same interval .
The party was in full swing .
The Fed had kept the good times rolling by cutting the federal funds rate a whole percentage point between June 1998 and January 1999 .
The rate on 30 - year Treasuries dropped from a high of over 7 % to a low of 5 % .
Stock markets soared .
The NASDAQ composite went from just over 1,000 to over 5,000 between 1996 and 2000 , rising over 80 % in 1999 alone .
With abundant credit being freely served to Internet start - ups , hordes of corporate managers , who had seemed married to their stodgy blue - chip companies , suddenly were romancing some sexy dot -coms that had just joined the party .
Meanwhile consumer spending stayed strong — with very low ( sometimes negative ) savings rates .
Growth was not being fueled by real investment , which would require the putting aside of current consumption to save for the future , but by the monetary printing press .
Buoyed by the stellar stock market returns , consumers built massive additions to their houses and took trips they otherwise would not have taken .
Real estate , especially in the " dotcom areas " such as Silicon Valley , soared in price .
As so often happens at bacchanalia , when the party entered the wee hours , it became apparent that too many guys had planned on taking the same girl home .
There were too few resources available for all of their plans to succeed .
" The rate of interest tells entrepreneurs whether a particular investment is worth making or not . "
The most crucial — and most general — unavailable factor was a continuing flow of investment funds .
( Of course , a continual supply of such funds by the Fed would only extend the boom and worsen the ensuing crash . )
There also turned out to be shortages of programmers , network engineers , technical managers , and other factors of production .
Internet startups , which had planned to operate at a loss for years by raising capital , found that not only was there less investment money available than they had hoped , but the cost of staying in business had gone up as well !
The business plans for many of the start - ups involved negative cash flows for the first ten or fifteen years , while they " built market share . "
To keep the atmosphere festive , they needed the host to keep filling the punch bowl .
However , the Fed knows that such a boom cannot be sustained indefinitely without eventual price inflation .
Ultimately , if credit expansion continues , it will lead to the crack - up boom , where the economy enters into a period of runaway inflation .
Fears of inflation led to Federal Reserve tightening in late 1999 , which helped bring MZM growth back into the single digits ( 8.5 % for the 1999 – 2000 period ) .
As the punch bowl emptied , the hangover — and the dot - com bloodbath — began .
According to research from Webmergers.com , at least 582 Internet companies closed their doors between May 2000 and July of 2001 .
The plunge in share price of many of those that remained alive was gut wrenching .
For example , shares of Beyond.com , split adjusted , went from $ 619 to 79 ¢ .
The NASDAQ retraced two years of gains in a little over a year .
Unemployment shot upward , and the economy slipped into a recession .
In the fall of 2001 , Enron exploded in the largest corporate bankruptcy in US history .
It appears , at the time of writing , that some at Enron were at least morally and perhaps criminally culpable in the meltdown .
But Enron 's rise took place during a period of free - flowing credit , and it crashed once the last call was made .
Ponzi schemes , too , thrive when credit is easy .
Another prominent explanation for booms and busts , one that has been applied to the Internet craze , might be called " mania theory . "
Investors become entranced by some particular investment — tulip bulbs , French colonial trading ventures , Florida real estate , the " nifty fifty " stocks , or Internet companies — and begin a self - perpetuating process of bidding more for the asset , seeing its price rise , bidding even more , and so on .
Like a manic - depressive who can only maintain his manic phase so long before crashing , eventually people begin to have doubts about the mania , and it all blows up .
Commenting on the psychology of the theory is beyond the scope of this book .
Nevertheless , we can say that there is nothing in the mania theory that contradicts the Austrian account .
They look at the same phenomenon from the vantage point of two different sciences : social psychology and economics .
" ABCT has sometimes derisively been referred to as a " hangover theory . "
In fact , the metaphor is fairly apt . "
They may , in fact , prove to be complementary .
The Austrian theory offers a coherent explanation of the onset of the mania — a credit expansion — and the onset of the depression — the cessation of the expansion .
After all , the mere fact that people are excited about the Internet cannot create a speculative bubble by itself .
The funds to speculate with must come from somewhere , and the Austrian theory identifies just where .
On the other hand , the mania theory might help explain the reason that booms often do seem to be channeled into certain faddish investments .
Boom , Bust , and the Structure of Capital
The Austrian Theory is concerned primarily with malinvestment , not with overinvestment .
Entrepreneurs have spent time and resources on projects that they cannot actually complete and that they would not have undertaken if there had been an accurate reading available of consumers ' time preference .
As Mises put it in Human Action ,
a further expansion of production is possible only if the amount of capital goods is increased by additional saving , i.e. , by surpluses produced and not consumed .
The characteristic mark of the credit expansion boom is that such additional capital goods have not been made available .
Differentiating overinvestment from malinvestment is only possible because of the key Austrian insight that capital has structure , which we examined in Chapter 8 .
Many entrepreneurial plans count on complementary capital goods being available sometime in the future .
For example , as I launch my e-commerce business , my plan may have a step such as : " Six months after start - up : hire 100 web programmers at $ 100,000 each annually . "
But in the intervening months the boom is proceeding .
Other companies are flush with cash from the credit expansion as well .
As we all begin to hire our programming staffs , it turns out that web programmers are not available in the quantity and at the price we thought they would be .
Any company that can't afford to put its plan on hold must bid more for those services .
The new credit tends to flow first into the higher - order capital goods — things like business plans , new buildings , new plants , and so on .
It is later , when those goods require complementary goods to continue production on their road toward consumer goods , that the transitory nature of the boom becomes apparent .
If real saving had occurred , there would have been a much better chance of the complementary goods being available .
Take our example of my e-commerce business :
If enough people had been setting aside enough time to learn web programming ( a form of saving ) , then perhaps there would have been enough web programmers available for both my plans and those of my competitors to succeed .
Yet another metaphor for the process by which the Fed " manages " the economy would be that of a hyperactive pediatrician , who never feels that the children under his care are growing at the " right " rate .
The body grows by a process we do not consciously control , based , in ways we only partly comprehend , on genetic makeup , nutrition , rest , exercise , and so on .
Each cell responds to its own local conditions , and the net result of all of these responses is the body 's overall rate of growth .
Similarly , each individual in the economy makes local decisions based on his unique circumstances , the net of which is the overall state of the economy .
By using this analogy I do not mean to contend that the economy is " really " some sort of organism , only that the process of economic growth is in some ways similar to that of organic growth .
" The Austrian Theory is concerned primarily with malinvestment , not with overinvestment . "
The Fed , the pediatrician of our analogy , feels it can improve on its patient 's natural state .
It does n't alter any of the real inputs to the process , such as the number or nature of capital goods available , or the willingness to save .
Instead , it fidgets with the economy 's " hormonal levels " by adjusting the interest rate .
When it makes credit easy , the economy 's apparent growth speeds up .
In fact , what has occurred is that certain visible manifestations of growth have accelerated , while other , equally necessary but less visible growth processes have suffered as a result .
Without the necessary " nutrients " being present , the " growth " is not built on a solid foundation .
The " bones " weaken and cannot support the body .
The central bank , fearing a collapse , then tries to reduce the rate of growth through tightening credit .
That in no way undoes the damage done during the period of credit expansion , but , rather , adds a new set of distortions to those already present .
Of course , once the central bank has engaged in credit expansion , it is foolish to blame it for reining in the boom .
The only alternative is eventual economic collapse in the crack - up boom : hyperinflation and the breakdown of the indirect exchange economy .
The proponents of Austrian business cycle theory do not hold that credit expansion unsupported by savings is the only way an economy can come upon hard times , or that , even when ABCT does apply , that it accounts for all of the hardships experienced in a downturn .
For instance , although many Austrian theorists contend that the path to the Great Depression was paved by expansionist central bank policy in the 1920s , they generally acknowledge that ABCT does not fully account for the depths of the crash .
For instance , in the United States , both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations disastrously attempted to hold post - crash prices , especially wages , at pre-crash levels .
That halted the adjustment process of the bust in its tracks and created the mass unemployment that made the Great Depression so notorious .
( W.H. Hutt did extensive work on this aspect of busts . )
Milton Friedman feels that Fed blunders led to a collapse of the money supply .
Austrians acknowledge that further Fed errors would exacerbate the downturn .
And at the same time the stock market crashed , the system of international division of labor , made possible by the free trade policies of the late nineteenth century , was collapsing in an international trade war among the increasingly interventionist states of the 1930s .
( The infamous Smoot - Hawley tariff was the main American salvo in that war . )
Nor is the Austrian business cycle theory deterministic , in that it does not claim to reveal beforehand precisely where the distortions resulting from an artificially low interest rate will appear .
The story we have given here is a typical one , but not the only one possible .
When the government sets the price of eggs too low , we cannot say exactly where distortions will appear , but we can say it is likely they will .
Piero Sraffa objected to ABCT as stated by Hayek : Why , he asked , could n't relative wealth changes from the rate cut drive marginal time preferences down to exactly where the central bank had set the rate ?
Well , we suppose , they could .
So could the wealth changes from price - fixing in the egg market just happen to set supply and demand equal .
But it would be pure chance and would happen very rarely .
But What About Expectations ?
As Economist Richard E. Wagner of George Mason University says , in a paper published in the Review of Austrian Economics , " Austrian Cycle Theory : Saving the Wheat while Discarding the Chaff " : " the primary criticism that has been advanced against Austrian cycle theory … is that the Austrian theory assumes that entrepreneurs are foolish in that they do not act rationally in forming expectations . "
Wagner goes on to point out that " a variety of occupations and businesses have arisen that specialize in forecasting the timing and extent of all kinds of governmental actions , including those of the central bank . "
Presumably , entrepreneurs now have better information with which to form their expectations .
The idea of rational expectations entered into economic theory chiefly through the work of Robert Lucas .
Justin Fox , in a Fortune magazine article entitled " What in the World Happened to Economics ? " explains Lucas 's theory as follows :
He argued that if people are rational … they can form rational expectations of predictable future events .
So if the government gets in the habit of boosting spending or increasing the money supply every time the economy appears headed for a downturn , everybody will eventually learn that and adjust their behavior accordingly … .
But the deductive logic of Lucas and other " new classical " economists led them to the stark conclusion that government monetary and fiscal policy should have no effect on the real economy .
As Austrian theory posits central banking as the primary cause of the cycle of booms and busts that have characterized modern market economies , it is easy to see why a wholesale acceptance of rational expectations theory entails a rejection of Austrian business cycle theory .
For instance , Gordon Tullock , in his article " Why the Austrians Are Wrong about Depressions , " says :
The second nit has to do with [ Austrian 's ] apparent belief that business people never learn .
One would think that business people might be misled in the first couple of runs of the [ Austrian ] cycle and not anticipate that the low interest rate will later be raised .
That they would continue unable to figure this out , however , seems unlikely .
What can Austrian theory say to this objection ?
If business people , aided by legions of " Fed watchers " and econometricians , could tell just what the Fed ( or any other central bank ) is up to , would we see a disappearance of the cycle ?
To begin an examination of that question , I would like to recall the metaphor of the hyperactive pediatrician .
Unsatisfied with how his patients were growing , the doctor kept administering doses of hormones that alternately sped up and slowed down that process .
Let us imagine that we visit one of these patients after ten years of " treatment . "
What do we know about this child 's height compared to what it would have been without the treatment ?
Very little , I contend .
The child might be taller than he would have been at his natural rate of growth , shorter , or even , by chance , exactly the same height .
We might know that , at present , the doctor is applying growth - promoting hormones .
But are they merely boosting growth up to where it would have been without the previous round of growth - retarding hormones , or are they boosting it above that ?
Entrepreneurs are in a similar situation vis -à - vis the central bank and the rate of interest as it might have been on an unhampered market .
When , exactly , could we point to a time when we saw that rate on the market ?
The Fed is always intervening , attempting to establish some rate .
We might assume that , at least some of the time , the Fed - influenced rate has been close to the market rate , but how do we know at which times ?
Even if we somehow did know that on , for instance , July 12 , 1995 , the interest rate was at its natural level , how could we relate that fact to what the rate should be now ?
Fed watchers might be able to tell entrepreneurs that the Fed is easing .
But is it easing toward the market rate of interest from some level above it , or further past the market rate from some level already below it ?
The idea that entrepreneurs are committing significant errors by not somehow divining where the rate ought to be is to criticize them for lacking superhuman capacities .
" The Austrian explanation fits well with the experience of real booms and busts . "
Entrepreneurs do know , however , whether the Fed is currently easing or tightening .
But here the knowledge that is most important to them is how long that policy will be pursued .
The Fed has a motivation to act contrary to whatever expectations the business community forms .
If businessmen feel the Fed will raise rates , and therefore they refrain from hiring , undertaking new projects , making new capital good orders , and so on , then the Fed , watching the statistics collected on new hires , capital good spending , etc. , will be less likely to raise rates .
The Fed will explain that the economic growth seems " under control . "
Of course , the reverse is true as well :
If the Fed thinks businesses , busily hiring , undertaking new projects , and so on , are not anticipating a rate increase , it will be more likely to raise rates — the economy is " overheating . "
Wagner 's point , mentioned above , that businesses have become better at watching the Fed must be complemented by the observation that the Fed has become better at watching businesses .
Entrepreneurs and the Fed have entered into a sort of poker game , and it is hard to see how entrepreneurs can be faulted for not always guessing correctly which card the Fed is about to play .
We must also look at the issue of which entrepreneurs will have the strongest motive to first take advantage of easier credit , and in what position that will place the remaining entrepreneurs .
Let us , for simplicity , divide entrepreneurs into classes A and B . ( Such a sharp division is not crucial to our analysis , as you 'll see ; it is merely a device to simplify our picture . )
Class
A entrepreneurs are those who are currently profitable , i.e. , those most able to interpret the current market conditions and predict their future .
Class
Bs are struggling , money - losing , or , indeed , unfunded " want - to - be " entrepreneurs , less capable at anticipating the future conditions of the market .
Now , let us go to the start of the boom .
It is 1996 , and the Fed begins to expand credit .
To where does this new supply flow ?
The As are not necessarily in need of much credit .
If they wish to expand , they have available their cash flow .
In the state of the market prior to the expansion , they were the ones most able to secure loans .
They quite possibly have been through several booms , and , adept at interpreting the state of the market , suspect that they are witnessing the start of another one .
They are cautious about expansion under such conditions .
The situation for the Bs is quite different , however .
Their businesses are marginal , or perhaps nonexistent .
They have previously been turned down for funding .
Even if they could tell that they are witnessing an artificial boom , it might make sense for them to " take a flier " anyway .
As it is , they are either not capitalized , or on the verge of failing .
If they ride the boom , they will have a couple of years of the high life .
And who knows , their business just might make it through !
Or , perhaps , they will build a sufficient customer base to be purchased , maybe even enough to retire on .
In that case , it might not matter to them if their company ultimately fails .
They use the easy credit to expand or start their business .
We should notice that the As are much less susceptible to such a motivation — they expect to be " living the high life " anyway , since their businesses are already doing well .
As the Bs create and expand businesses , the boom begins to take shape .
However , we can see that the actual situation of the As has changed :
Of course , in order to continue production on the enlarged scale brought about by the expansion of credit , all entrepreneurs , those who did expand their activities no less than those who produce only within the limits in which they produced previously , need additional funds as the costs of production are now higher .
( Mises , Human Action )
Although the most skilled entrepreneurs suspect that the expansion is artificial , most can't afford to shut down their business for the duration of the boom .
But if they can't , they must increasingly compete with Bs for access to the factors of production .
Take , for instance , the A company Sensible Software , Inc. , and the B company , Dotty Dotcom .
Dotty Dotcom , flush with venture capital and an " insanely great business plan , " is luring top Java engineers with salaries matching Sensible 's while throwing in stock options that could be worth millions after the IPO .
( That is an investment in higher - order capital goods , as top engineers are needed chiefly for more complex projects , which typically can take several years to complete . )
Sensible simply cannot afford to lose all of its best programmers to Dotty .
It must bid competitively for them .
However , in order to do so , Sensible must take advantage of the same easy credit that Dotty is using to back its bids .
At the market rate of interest existing at the start of the boom , Sensible was already bidding as much as it deemed marginally profitable for producer goods .
So the A entrepreneurs , willy - nilly , are forced to participate in the boom as well .
Their hope is that , in the downturn , the basic soundness of their business and the fact that they have expanded less enthusiastically than the Bs will see them through , perhaps with only a few layoffs .
Or , take the case of a class A mutual fund manager who suspects that stock prices are artificially high .
If he simply puts his funds in cash and attempts to sit on the sidelines , he 's sunk .
All of his customers will leave , and he 'll never survive to see the bust that proves he was right .
In order to stay in business , he will continue to invest in stocks , perhaps keep a bit more money in cash than usual , and watch carefully for signs of the turn .
Our analysis of the banks proceeds in the same fashion .
It is precisely the marginal lenders , those with the least ability to evaluate credit risks , that have the least to lose and the most to gain from an enthusiastic participation in the boom .
They will tend to have the strongest motivation to expand credit .
The more prudent lenders are eventually sucked in , in order to compete .
The problem is compounded by the tendency of the International Monetary Fund , central banks , and other government bodies to jump in and bail out large investors when they get in trouble .
The Mexican bailout of 1994 and 1995 , and the bailout put together , at the Fed 's urging , after the collapse of Long Term Capital Management a few years later , are two prominent , recent examples of the creation of moral hazard .
If you are promised all of the upside of making a risky loan , should the borrower being funded succeed , but are protected on the downside by the likelihood of a bailout , you are much more likely to make the loan !
Our A/B division of entrepreneurs adds to the explanation of the radical difference between an artificial boom and a savings - led expansion .
In the latter , the A entrepreneurs are able to sense that the consumers really do desire a lengthening of the production process and an increased investment in capital goods , as demonstrated by increased saving .
Therefore , they are eager to take advantage of new credit .
There is no reason to turn to the B entrepreneurs to find takers for the new funds .
Of course , there is no sharp A/B division in entrepreneurial ability .
That was introduced only to simplify the discussion above , but the fundamentals remain unchanged under a more realistic assumption .
Another source of investment maladjustment from the boom , in addition to the intertemporal one , is the interpersonal one — the Bs are those entrepreneurs whom the consumers least want to have capitalized !
One of the corrective forces operating to bring on the downturn is the fact that capital must be wrested back from the Bs and into the hands of the As , who can better satisfy the desires of the consumers .
The Austrian explanation fits well with the experience of real booms and busts .
For example , an architect I worked with several years ago was quite aware that we were in a boom phase .
He told me stories of witnessing a previous wipeout in Connecticut real estate in the late eighties .
He expected another downturn , yet he had expanded his business anyway .
There were simply jobs that he could n't afford to turn down coming his way .
Meanwhile , with the established builders so busy , new builders popped up everywhere .
When the downturn came in 2001 , one local contractor told me , " Some guys are going broke — but they 're the ones who should not have been in the business in the first place . "
As Auburn University economist Roger Garrison said , in commenting on this chapter :
In lectures more so than in print , I have often referred to the " marginal loan applicant " in explaining it all ( your Class B entrepreneur ) .
At the operational level , the relevant margin is the creditworthiness of the borrower and not an eighth of a percent difference one way or another in the rate of interest .
The Rate Game
As Wagner points out , the idea that the Austrian cycle depends on systematic , foreseeable errors on the part of entrepreneurs arises from confusion between individual outcomes and aggregate outcomes .
Certainly , an omniscient socialist planner in perfect control of the economy , who had by some miracle solved the problem of economic calculation in the absence of a market for capital , would not choose to misalign the time structure of production .
But in a market economy , as Wagner says , the " standard variables of macroeconomics , rates of growth , levels of employment , and rates of inflation , are not objects of choice for anyone , but rather are emergent outcomes of complex economic processes . "
I 'd like to introduce one last metaphor to clarify Wagner 's point .
Picture a small town centered on a village green .
It is an ordinary town , except that the town council has acquired an odd ability and has chosen to use it in a most curious way .
Somehow , the council has devised a way to abscond with 50 % of each resident 's store of goods , including money , every evening at midnight .
No effort to hide wealth from the council is of any avail .
In a redistributionist fantasy , the council has decided that it will deposit this pile of stuff in the middle of the green every morning at six o'clock , available to anyone who wants to grab some .
" The idea that the Austrian cycle depends on systematic , foreseeable errors on the part of entrepreneurs arises from confusion between individual outcomes and aggregate outcomes . "
It is obvious that this activity cannot make the town as a whole better off .
In fact , as everyone will now be spending time trying to grab back as much wealth as they can , the town will be worse off .
( They obviously had better things to do before this program started , as they were n't all hanging out on the green at six . )
Some less - well - off residents may occasionally do OK , but as time goes on , the net effect of the lost productivity will tend to punish them as well .
Our process also will alter the distribution of wealth , with wealth moving from those who are best at meeting the needs of the consumers to those who are best at grabbing things from the green .
Still , it is not an economic error on the part of residents to plop down on the green at 5:55 every morning .
They are subject to a phenomenon that they cannot control .
Each of their micro - level decisions leads them to participate despite the fact that , at the macro - level , the activity is wasteful .
There is only one error necessary to generate this wasteful activity , and that is the error of the town council 's foolish policy .
During a credit expansion , the entrepreneurs are in a similar position .
On the one hand , they may suspect the frantic activity around the green is in the long run unproductive .
On the other hand , they cannot produce without resources , without being able to secure access to the factors of production .
To the extent that those factors are being placed out on the green every day , the entrepreneurs must go and participate in the competition to employ them .
There are many long - term plans already under way that count on access to those factors .
In many cases it is not financially feasible to halt those plans until the central bank 's expansion has ended .
Anthony M. Carilli and Gregory M. Dempster , in a paper in the Review of Austrian Economics , look at ABCT from a game theory perspective .
As I mentioned earlier , Austrians tend to view game theory as having limited applicability to market exchange .
But the relationship between investors and the Fed is like a game in many ways .
Carilli and Dempster employ a simple game theory model to help explain expectations and ABCT .
The Fed acts as " the house . "
The players are the investors .
The best net result for all of them is when no one takes advantage of artificially low rates .
But for any individual player , the worst result is when he fails to take advantage of the low rate while all of his competitors do take advantage of it .
And the best result for each individual player is when he does take advantage of the credit expansion while his competitors do n't .
Since no entrepreneur can count on all of his competitors to abstain from the easy credit , his best move is to get " his bus " heading across the desert first .
Earlier , we had a single bus driver , representing the entrepreneurs , driving a single bus , representing the economy .
The passengers ( the consumers ) had voted on a level of air - conditioning for the trip , but the Fed had replaced their vote with its own .
To incorporate the game theory perspective , we need to have many buses crossing the desert , each with its own driver .
Meanwhile , scattered across the desert are several gas stations , with limited supplies of gas , where the drivers can refuel .
The drivers are competing for passengers , who will , to a great extent , board a particular bus based on the combination of comfort and speed that the driver offers them .
The drivers , while knowing that they do not have the passengers ' real preferences on air - conditioning , do not know what those preferences are , or how the temperature they have been handed actually relates to those preferences .
In particular , the drivers ( entrepreneurs ) who first take advantage of a low apparent time preference from the passengers have the best shot at making the crossing .
They will arrive at the intermediate gas stations first , and have the first shot at the scarce gas available to complete the crossing .
Meanwhile , the drivers who hesitate to use the low apparent time preference may not attract any passengers .
In addition , as the supposed air - conditioning preference ( the interest rate ) is lowered , it lures more drivers into the business , many of whom are not really qualified , but may have no better shot at " making it " than to attempt the desert crossing .
Perhaps , after all , they will get across !
It is clear that the situation is far from optimal .
Whenever the Fed sets a supposed demand for air - conditioning ( current consumption ) that is too far below the real one , many buses will fail to make the crossing .
Recovering from the problem ( liquidating the failed investments , or , we might say , sending out the tow trucks ) adds unnecessary costs to production , creating the losses of the downturn .
But it is hard to see why the bus drivers are to blame .

There was a time when comic books were just that – comic – with the likes of Mutt and Jeff and Mickey Mouse .
But by the mid-1930 ’s new comics with characters like Dick Tracy and Flash Gordon which were filled with adventure and a little violence started to appear .
With the arrival of Superman in 1939 the funny papers just were n’t funny anymore .
And to some they were getting steamy and way too rough .
A charge was leveled against comic books that would be repeated decades later against television , movies , music and video games .
An editorial by renowned Chicago Daily News literary editor Sterling North said the following about comics on May 8 , 1940 :
“ Badly drawn , badly written and badly printed – a strain on the young eyes and young nervous systems – the effect of these pulp - paper nightmares is that of a violent stimulant .
Their crude blacks and reds spoil a child ’s natural sense of color ; their hypodermic injection of sex and murder make the child impatient with better , though quieter , stories .
Unless we want a coming generation even more ferocious than the present one , parents and teachers throughout America must band together to break the comic magazine . ”
Still comics continued to explode in popularity through out and beyond World War 2 .
With the likes of Batman , Superman and Captain America , comics were selling 60 million copies a month .
But one man was about to bring the old criticisms of comic books back to life .
His name was Dr. Frederic Wertham , a German immigrant psychiatrist .
Wertham had been helpful in the 1920 ’s of proving the then novel idea that a patient ’s environment should be taken in consideration before diagnosing treatment .
He also did a series of lectures and testimonies before state legislates about the evils of school segregation .
His article , “ Psychological Effects of School Segregation ” was submitted as evidence in the historic “ Brown vs. The Board of Education ” Supreme Court case that helped to end segregation .
Wertham worked with troubled teenagers and noticed that many of them were avid readers of comic books .
Upon looking into the books he was deeply troubled by their content of gory violence and lurid sex .
In 1948 he addressed a psychiatric convention and claimed that comics were creating a new and large group of juvenile delinquents .
In the late 40 ’s magazines like Time and Look were criticizing comics for their “ degeneration ” .
There were towns that staged mass comic book burnings and others enacted laws to control and censor comic books .
Canadian lawmakers banned the publication of “ crime comics ” .
The U.S. Senate became involved in 1950 when a special committee was formed to investigate the link between comic books and organized crime .
Comics were often blamed for crime as delinquent teenagers would claim that comics had influenced them .
The cry against comics became a fury when Wertham published his bestselling book Seduction of the Innocent .
In the book Wertham claimed that Batman and Robin were “ a wish dream of two homosexuals living together ” and that Wonder Woman was a “ lesbian counterpart of Batman ” .
He was critical of Superman for giving kids the idea that they could fly .
But Wertham ’s real attack came against a new generation of crime and horror comics , especially the gruesome creations of William Gaines .
Gaines through his EC Comics had created a series of horror comics with titles like “ Tales of the Crypt ” and “ The Vault of Horror ” .
They would be considered extremely bloody even by today ’s standards .
Wertham was a media darling , writing for popular magazines and speaking around the country .
When Congress again took an interest in his critique in 1954 , Wertham was the star witness , appearing before the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency .
The only representative of the comics industry to testify was Gaines .
The subcommittee investigation was a disaster for the comic book industry .
The following testimony between Senator Estes Kefauver and Gaines was especially damaging :
KEFAUVER ( holding up an especially gory EC Comic title ) : “ This seems to be a man with a bloody ax holding a woman ’s head up , which has been severed from her body .
Do you think that is in good taste ? ”
GAINES : “ Yes sir , I do for the cover of a horror comic .
A cover in bad taste might be defined as holding the head higher so that the blood could be seen dripping from it . ”
KEFAUVER : “ You ’ve got blood coming out of her mouth ”
GAINES : “ A little . ”
Gaines did n’t tell the Senator he had rejected the bloodier version of the cover when it was presented to him earlier .
To avoid government censorship , just like the entertainment industry of today , comic book producers were forced to draw up a self imposed code of standards .
It was called the Comics Code Authority and it ’s stamp on the corner of a comic book would certify that the comic book was safe for America ’s kids .
The code restricted sex and violence , forbade the criticism of religion , the use of slang words and a long list of other unacceptable practices .
Many distributors would not carry a comic book without the code appearing on it .
Gaines waged a number of battles with the Comics Code Authority , in an attempt to keep his magazines free of censorship during the later days of EC .
One notable incident involved his threatening the members of the Comics Code Authority board with a lawsuit after being ordered to alter the climactic scene of a science fiction story , so that one of the characters would not be seen sweating .
Eventually EC
Comics disappeared along with many other comic book publishers .
Marvel Comics ( then called Atlas Comics ) was almost forced to fold and DC Comics became a shadow of its former self .
But William Gaines had the last laugh . . . literally .
When Gaines canceled the EC line he saved one magazine .
It survived because it did n’t look like a comic book , so it was n’t a target⁠⁠ — which did n’t mean children were n’t reading it .
Its name was Mad Magazine and today it survives , 50 years after it ’s creation .
However , it would take the 60’s to arrive before the so - called Silver Age of comics would begin .
They did so with such titles as Spiderman and The Justice League of America .
And virtually every comic displayed the CCA Seal of Approval .
Wertham continued to rail against teenage violence through the 50’s and 60’s .
He did make an appearance at a comic book convention in 1973 where he found out that fans have a long memory .
They booed him off the stage claiming he had “ killed ” comics back in the 50’s .
He died in 1981 .
Today we have graphic novels and comic books that are considered to be in the Platinum Age .
And the Code itself is still around if you look hard for it .
I went looking for it recently at a supermarket magazine rack and there it was on only two comics ; Archie and The Powerpuff Girls .
They were sitting together right next to Mad Magazine .
Physicist discovers a formula of laughter
A sense of humor is a strong male quality , a sign of good intellect
U.S. scientist Igor Krishtafovich discovered a formula of laughter .
He came to Moscow to spread the formula among his former compatriots .
As it turned out , humor is a weapon .
Igor Krishtafovich is confident that humor always implies aggression .
“ It is a bloodless verbal fight aiming to raise your status and strengthen your position .
Even a friendly banter is a sort of intellectual clash , a kind of training before serious battles .
In fact , we try to figure out who 's the boss in the family when we poke fun at our loved ones , ” says Mr. Krishtafovich .
“ Why the man who just cracked a nice joke is normally laughing louder than the others ? ”
“ Well , he feels on top of the world , his moment of triumph has just arrivided . ”
“ If laughter is akin to aggression , why women have a liking for jesters ? ”
“ A sense of humor is a strong male quality .
It is a sign of good intellect .
Evolution stakes precisely on the intellect since a smart fellow has more chances of survival .
That is why a sense of humor can be a much bigger sign of masculinity than the pumped - up muscles .
Needless to say , I 'm talking about the subconscious level of perception . ”
Formula of laughter
According to Mr. Krishtafovich's theory , humor has always been around .
Even in prehistoric times when man was just a few steps away from monkey .
This is a prehistoric reaction on the level of reflex .
Humankind has refined humor over thousands of years of history .
Humor became more exquisite and complex .
These days it is hard to make people laugh yet you can succeed if you follow the formula by Igor Krishtafovich .
Using the formula , you can even find out whether your joke was good or not .
“ The formula is primarily for comedians , writers who write satirical pieces , and politicians .
A good joke can effectively entice the voters .
Sure thing , you should bear in mind the mood of an audience and complexity of a joke , ” says Mr. Krishtafovish
The formula is as following :
HE = PI x C/T + BM
PI – personal involvement
C - complexity of a joke .
The higher degree of complexity the better provided that your audience can solve the problem within 1 or 2 seconds .
T – time spent by a person solving a joke .
The longer the time , the weaker the effect .
BM – background mood .
A joker can have an advantage if an audience enjoys the show .
However , a real good joke can “ blow up ” the most dismal audience .
HE – humor effectiveness .
I find myself thinking of my country and my industry – and what I see confuses and confounds me .
This is a tiny little country that remains a world power , one of the few trillion dollar economies in the world .
It has 50 % take - up of broadband , some huge telecommunications companies and thousands of people working on and around the internet .
But still our industry seems dominated by a few moribund and clumsy giants leading a culture that ’s inarticulate , unadventurous and profoundly constrained .
There ’s something very wrong here .
My main question is this :
Where are all the bloody start - ups ?
Where are the small passionate groups of creative technologists ( people with clue ) getting together to build web applications and public - facing products that push things forward ?
Where is the Blogger or Flickr or Odeo or Six Apart of the UK ?
What aspect of this country is it that confounds these aspirations ?
And I know that Audioscrobbler is wonderful .
I really love it .
But eventually you have to ask – is that really all we can do ?
So is it a lack of money or a poverty of ambition ?
The UK has some of the world ’s best and most creative film directors – but they do n’t make films in the UK , they make adverts .
Some of the world ’s best ( and most expensive ) advertisements are made in this country , arranged around home - made TV programming that costs a fraction of the price .
But when film directors get bored of selling sugar water they move on to make their proper movies .
And for the most part , they go to the States .
The same seems true online .
The web industry over here is dominated by advertising and marketing because London is dominated by advertising and marketing .
People think that the States is the home of this stuff , but it ’s not true – American advertising is clumsy and blatant compared to the calculating work done over here .
Everything is put to the end of selling something else and I ’m routinely surprised by what is for sale .
Every event is sponsored by one multi-national or another , from the BAFTAs to the equivalent of the Grammys .
On the web , some of the work is absolutely stunning – but it ’s all bloody agency stuff – support sites , brochureware , Flash .
There ’s money all around the place to make things , but still such boring stuff gets made .
It ’s all just another shiny thing on a conveyer belt already groaning under the weight of shiny things – an environment where the only way to innovate is to get shinier and more illusory , rather than more useful .
All this work is churned out by the ton by great people ( and not so great people ) hired by marketeers – because apparently there is no one else out there who will harness them to make neat new things that the world could use .
The major internet companies have presences in the UK of course , but they ’re mostly localisation departments / sales departments / advertising departments .
They have technical and creative people working for them , but on the whole they ’re not making new products .
They ’re just selling and supporting the existing ones .
The whole bloody place seems to be about selling things made elsewhere , working for the unambitious .
There are exceptions of course – but even then the tiny fragments of things that we do create seem resolutely parochial – little products aimed at exploiting the tiny idiosyncratic spaces in British culture that huge initiatives from the major net powers have missed – albeit momentarily .
So what is it that stops us making great things , starting start - ups and building for money ?
I contend that in part it ’s shame .
Certainly the business people of Britain seem to be – at a certain level – highly uncomfortable with the existence of technical people .
They ’re not a resource to be exploited , or people to collaborate with .
The nerdy people who make and create seem to be shuffled to the side , kept in the background , so as not to curdle the canapés at the business meet and greets that are the real motivators of British business .
The businessman and the creative technologist seem to be forced into two camps so repulsed by one another ( betrayed by dot.com ? ) that they just circle at a distance , each almost refusing to admit the other exists .
So the business people look towards the stable money and wait for the innovations to come in from abroad , or leap clumsily onto bandwagons with the help of the visionless , while the technologists dogmatically avoid anything that looks like it might have been sullied with the hint of a business model .
I look at many of my peers and I ’m delighted by the projects that they get involved in – they ’ve connected people with politics , connected people with their representatives , found ways for people to work together to make the world better , opened up the writings of incredible diarists , created incredible local information services and worked on open calendaring projects .
But would it really be so bad for them to spend some of their time building products that were aimed at changing the world by changing how people do everyday things all over the world , or opened up new spaces for creativity or sharing or self - expression or shopping or whatever ?
There ’s a wonderful creative culture here that cannot commercialise itself .
But we all use Flickr and del.icio.us so we can’t have that much trouble with people trying to make a business out of being great , surely ?
Or is it just when the British do it that we ’re all expected to rend and tear ?
What is it about this place that there is so little energy in these directions – are we so hamstrung by geography or history or culture that we cannot innovate , build and then commercialise ?
I look around and I see some of the brightest and best people I know in the world creating world - class ideas that get exploited elsewhere , or are simply thrown away .
It ’s not right and we should do something about it – I ’m just unclear about whether that ’s stand up and be counted , or burn it all down and never look back .
Back to curling for a moment .
The U.S. women may have crashed out of the Olympics with a 2 - 7 record , but judging by some of the comments posted to their blog , the Curl Girls are well worth an endorsement deal or two :
“ Cassie Johnson is a doll !
Mesmerizing eyes with the delicate touch of an angel . ”
“ Cassie : For a hot geek babe , you are a skilled stone strategist .
Actually , a stoic leader , a sleeping dragon .
And I like your hair up . ”
“ Jessica has a tattoo of a curling rock on her lower back !
HOW COOL IS THAT ?! ”
“ Cassie you are so hot but a choker . ”
“ My friends think I ’m nuts , since I keep watching while I ’m studying for the bar exam this week , but I have to say that I am so proud of you all , since no matter what happens , you keep smiling . …
I wish I could say more , but space and good taste prevent that . ”
“ Cassandra is seriously hypnotizing .
I cannot stop thinking about her .
Plus I ’m not even kidding when I say I think I am in love with her . ”
“ I hope I am not coming on too strong , for it is my fear she can throw the 42 lb. stones and ricchot them off of my face .
It does n’t matter because CASSIE I LOVE YOU ! ”
“ Cassie , I recognize that you would never take any of my attempts to ask you out like everyone else , so I will just wish you the best and hope you receive and love the fan mail that I will send .
BEST OF LUCK ! ”
“ Maureen , I am totally in LOVE with YOU .
Marry me , and you ’ll never see the inside of a Home Depot again . ”

DISMAL scientists are finding more reasons than ever to worry about the prospects for America 's economy — even though the country 's GDP somehow still manages to grow at a decent lick .
Oil prices are high , of course ; partly as a result , inflation is rising .
Consumer debt is at record levels .
America is borrowing from abroad on a gargantuan scale to finance its current - account gap .
And the housing bubble may be bursting .
For a growing number of economists and policymakers , however , the greatest fear of all — not least because its long - term consequences may be so deep — is that America is losing its global lead in technology .
In the battle to invent and innovate , China and India , in particular , with their gazillion - strong cohorts of engineering and science graduates , will soon overwhelm the dullards and liberal arts students churned out by America 's education system .
Nor is this a uniquely American worry .
You hear similar worries in Europe too , although there the fear is less of losing the lead than of falling even further behind .
Such ideas , expressed in alarming books such as “ Three Billion New Capitalists : The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East ” , by Clyde Prestowitz , once a trade negotiator in the Reagan administration , are being cited increasingly by supporters of a wide range of potential remedies .
These include getting more Americans to study science and engineering , bigger tax breaks for research and development , and trade protection to prevent the innovative hordes from China and India from storming America 's gates .
Innovative thinking
In a marvellously contrarian new paper * , Amar Bhidé , of Columbia University 's business school , argues that these supposed remedies , and the worries that lie behind them , are based on a misconception of how innovation works and of how it contributes to economic growth .
Mr Bhidé finds plenty of nice things to say about many of the things that most trouble critics of the American economy : consumption as opposed to thrift ; a plentiful supply of consumer credit ; Wal - Mart ; even the marketing arms of drug companies .
He thinks that good managers may be at least as valuable as science and engineering graduates ( though given where he works , perhaps he is talking his own book ) .
But he has nothing nice to say about the prophets of technological doom .
Mr Bhidé says that the doomsayers are guilty of the “ techno - fetishism and techno - nationalism ” described in 1995 by two economists , Sylvia Ostry and Richard Nelson .
This consists , first , of paying too much attention to the upstream development of new inventions and technologies by scientists and engineers , and too little to the downstream process of turning these inventions into products that tempt people to part with their money , and , second , of the belief that national leadership in upstream activities is the same thing as leadership in generating economic value from innovation .
But nowadays innovation — a complex , gradual process , often involving many firms making incremental advances over many years — is not much constrained by national borders , argues Mr Bhidé .
Indeed , the sort of upstream innovation ( the big ideas of those scientists and engineers ) most celebrated by those who fear its movement to China and India is the hardest to keep locked up in the domestic market .
The least internationally mobile innovation , on the other hand , is the downstream sort , where big ideas are made suitable for a local market .
Mr Bhidé argues that this downstream innovation , which is far more complex and customised than the original upstream invention , is the most valuable kind and what America is best at .
Moreover , perhaps the most important fact overlooked by the techno - nationalists , notes Mr Bhidé , is that most of the value of innovations accrues to their users not their creators — and stays in the country where the innovation is consumed .
So if China and India do more invention , so much the better for American consumers .
The most important part of innovation may be the willingness of consumers , whether individuals or firms , to try new products and services , says Mr Bhidé .
In his view , it is America 's venturesome consumers that drive the country 's leadership in innovation .
Particularly important has been the venturesome consumption of new innovations by American firms .
Although America has a lowish overall investment rate compared with other rich countries , it has a very high rate of adoption of information technology ( IT ) .
Contrast that with Japan ( the original technology bogeyman from the East ) where , despite an abundance of inventive scientists and engineers , many firms remain primitive in their use of IT .
One reason why American firms are able to be so venturesome is that they have the managers capable of adapting their organisations to embrace innovation , says Mr Bhidé .
Pressure to be venturesome may have come from America 's highly competitive markets .
And America 's downstream firms are arguably the world 's leaders in finding ways to encourage consumers to try new things , not least through their enormous marketing arms and by ensuring that there is a lavish supply of credit .
No doubt , even venturesome consumers can overdo their enthusiasm for innovation , just as venturesome investors overdid it during the dotcom bubble .
Yet , if Mr Bhidé is right — and a lot more hard data would do wonders for his case — then America 's policymakers should worry more about how to keep consumers consuming than about the number of science and engineering graduates , at home or in the East .

America and France clashed openly yesterday over the proposed United Nations ceasefire plan which is opposed by Lebanon and other Arab states .
US and French teams at the UN headquarters in New York returned to the drawing board to devise a fresh draft resolution , but the mood among diplomats was pessimistic .
One diplomat described the situation in Lebanon as " intractable " and warned that there was no plan B if a resolution could not be thrashed out fast .
The French president , Jacques Chirac , broke from his holiday to deliver an implicit rebuke to Washington .
Mr Chirac warned the Bush administration that an immediate ceasefire was the only solution to the conflict and said giving up on this was " immoral " .
He urged the US to speed up its response to Arab nations ' demands for changes to the ceasefire plan .
" It appears today that the Americans have reservations about adopting this project , but I do n't want to imagine there not being a solution . "
He added : " To accept the present situation and renounce an immediate ceasefire would be the most immoral of solutions . "
The difficulty of finding a diplomatic solution was also underscored when Hassan Nasrallah , the Hizbullah leader , in his first comments on the original UN draft , rejected it .
" The least we can describe this [ draft resolution ] is as unfair and unjust .
It has given Israel more than it wanted and more than it was looking for , " he said .
Diplomats at the UN said that even if the US and France were able to agree a new draft , the security council could not vote on it until tomorrow at the earliest .
The Washington - Paris rift is over the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon .
The US is backing Israel 's position that the proposed deployment of the Lebanese army in the south is insufficient : the Israelis say the Lebanese army is not strong enough to deal with the Hizbullah militia and it needs the support of an international force .
The French team argues that the deployment of the Lebanon force is a good first move and that it would take weeks , or months , to deploy the international force .
The French and US governments have been struggling for more than a week to find a draft resolution that stands a chance of securing a ceasefire .
The US , France and Israel agreed at the weekend on a draft , but underestimated the level of opposition from Lebanon and the Arab states .
Lebanon protested that , under the draft resolution , Israel would be allowed to stay in southern Lebanon for an undefined period and could take " defensive " action against Hizbullah .
Dan Gillerman , Israeli ambassador to the UN , said : " I do not see any bridging of the disagreements ... they had both agreed on a document , [ but ] the French at the moment seem to have had second thoughts , which are so wide apart [ from the US ] that a lot of work will have to be done to turn the document into a viable resolution . "
Israeli diplomats have said they will stop fighting within days of a ceasefire resolution being adopted .
But one Israeli diplomat said the government was happy to see negotiations bogged down because it gave it longer to continue its offensive .
David Welch , the US state department assistant secretary , gave no ground when he visited the Lebanese prime minister , Fouad Siniora , in Beirut yesterday , the first US visit since Condoleezza Rice was told last week in the aftermath of the Qana bombing she would not be welcome in the Lebanese capital .
According to a Lebanese official , Mr Welch told Mr Siniora that Israel would not withdraw until the international force was in place .
Mr Welch also met Nabih Berri , the speaker of the Lebanese parliament who acts as a conduit for Hizbullah .
He said afterwards : " Mr Welch , as I expressed to him , is a skilful embellisher for an ugly resolution and , therefore , I agree with prime minister Siniora by saying that there is no progress until now . "
Hopes at the UN are pinned on a two - stage process , with two UN resolutions - a cessation of hostilities , followed by an international force - on a timescale tight enough to placate both sides .
Britain appeared to playing little role in the negotiations , amid claims at the UN that Tony Blair has angered France and other European nations by taking a strongly pro-Israel line with George Bush in private .

50 - year mortgage hits the market
Lenders have begun offering a half - century home loan as incentive in face of record - high home prices , rising interest rates , report says .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -
As home prices and interest rates keep rising , lenders have figured out a way to keep the dream alive for millions of people who want to own their own home .
It 's called the 50 - year mortgage .
According to a report Wednesday in USA Today , a handful of small lenders have begun offering 50 - year adjustable - rate loans to buyers who need to keep payments low in the current economic environment .
Most banks already offer 40 - year mortgages , which account for about 5 percent of all home loans , the report said .
" One of the biggest things in California is the high costs of homes .
With rates going up , there 's demand from customers ( for ) longer loans , " Alex Diaz Jr. , with Statewide Bancorp in Rancho Cucamonga , Calif. , was quoted in the report as saying .
Statewide , which introduced its 50 - year loan in March , has already received about 220 applications , Diaz said , according to the report .
The 50 - year mortgage also signals that the cooling real estate market is heating up competition among lenders , the newspaper said .
" Mortgage lenders are getting craftier to get the attention of consumers , " Anthony Hsieh , CEO of LendingTree , told the newspaper .
But he added that consumers first need to understand the product .
Two issues to keep in mind : A borrower with the 50 - year mortgage builds equity very slowly .
And because rates on the loans are adjustable , a borrower 's monthly payments could rise , the report said .
Mortgage experts caution that the 50 - year mortgage is best - suited for those who plan to stay in their home for about five years , while the loan 's interest rate remains fixed , the report said .
" If you 're going to be there for more than five years , you 're gambling , " Marc Savitt of the consumer protection committee for the National Association of Mortgage Brokers told the newspaper .
" You do n't know what interest rates are going to be .
I would n't do it . "
The report of the new 50 - year loan comes as the signs mount that the nation 's real estate market is cooling .

Since last summer 's announcement that Apple would be shifting its entire computer product line to Intel processors , PC enthusiasts have been trying to answer two questions .
Would we be able to run Windows natively on Macintel hardware , and would we be able to run Mac OS X on commodity PC hardware ?
So far , the answer to the first question has been negative , with little or no prospect for success until Vista ships later this year .
The second question is a different matter .
Apple does n't want Mac OS X running on anything other than Apple hardware , and as a result , has slapped the OSx86 Project with a DMCA violation notice .
After Pentium 4 developer systems and Intel - native builds of Mac OS X were shipped out , copies of the x86 - native Mac OS X began showing up in the usual places .
Naturally , people started trying to get it running on commodity x86 hardware , and with some success .
They needed somewhere to collaborate as well , so the OSx86 Project was born .
Several months prior to the shipment of the iMac Core Duo , enthusiasts were able to get Mac OS X 10.4.3 running on PCs .
Once the iMacs began shipping with 10.4.4 installed , hackers were having a much more difficult time getting OS X to run on non-Apple Intel and even AMD hardware .
( One Russian site claims to have a workaround for 10.4.4 ) .
The EULA for Mac OS X states explicitly that the OS is only licensed to run on Apple hardware .
Apple may have been content to more or less ignore the OSx86 Project in the months after the transition began ; now that there are Intel - based Macs available , Apple wants to be sure that its high - margin hardware sales are not eroded by people running its OS on Dells , HPs , and home - built systems .
As the OSx86 Project forums were arguably the best resource for figuring out how to do exactly that , it makes sense that Apple would bust out the lawyering stick on them .
For the time being , visitors to the forums are greeted with a message that they are closed while the OSx86 Project " evaluates its contents to remove any violations present . "
The problem for Apple is that the hacking community will continue to function , likely on servers out of the reach of Apple 's lawyers and the DMCA .
Apple will continue its efforts to lock down Mac OS X so that it runs only on Macs , whether with the Trusted Platform Module , or by other means including some poetry embedded deep within the OS and decrypted via the TPM .
Your karma check for today :
There once was a user that whined
his existing OS was so blind ,
he ’d do better to pirate
an OS that ran great
but found his hardware declined .
Please do n’t steal Mac OS !
Really , that ’s way uncool .
( C) Apple Computer , Inc .
Unlike Lexmark and TracFone , Apple may be using the DMCA appropriately in this instance .
In order to get Mac OS X running on non-Apple system , it is necessary to circumvent Apple 's technological protections along with the EULA included with Mac OS X .
As nice as it would be to buy a cheap Dell or build yourself a sweet dual - core Athlon system and dual - boot into Windows and Mac OS X , Apple does n't want that to become commonplace .
Ultimately , hacking will happen , and Apple realizes it .
What the Mac maker will do is make it as much of a hassle as possible to ensure that only the truly hardcore hackers do it .
The United States Senate yesterday demanded that President Bush provide a coherent Iraq strategy and passed an amendment calling for “ changes to the policy of the United States on Iraq and to require reports on certain matters relating to Iraq . "
" It is the sense of the Senate that , in order to succeed in Iraq the Administration needs to explain to Congress and the American people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq , " read the text of S. Amdt.
2518 , which passed by a bipartisan vote of 79- 19
“ It 's not often you see in our legislative halls here in Washington votes of no confidence on an administration , " said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid after the vote .
" Today you saw a vote of no confidence in the Bush administration 's policy on Iraq .
Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that staying the course is not the way to go .
And , therefore , this is a vote of no confidence on the Bush administration policy in Iraq . ”
The amendment further says that the president should issue a report on U.S. policy and military operations in Iraq " ... not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act , and every three months thereafter until all United States combat brigades have redeployed from Iraq . "
The GOP - controlled Senate had earlier defeated a more strongly - worded Democratic bill with the same intent – the big difference being that the Democratic amendment would have required Bush to explain his administration 's actions , while the GOP - sponsored measure simply calls for such an explanation .
Even so , the amendment represents a significant rebuke to the Bush administration and a near - unanimous call for less excuses and more real answers .
Republican senators are clearly feeling the pressure of severely waning public support for the war and looming mid-term elections that will have all of the House and a third of the Senate up for re-election .
But the thing that Republicans found most unpalatable in the Democratic bill was the paragraph calling for the president to offer a plan for a phased withdrawal of the 150,000 plus U.S. troops now in Iraq .
That would have taken way too much guts on the part of the average Bush - controlled GOP senator .
But the message to Bush is still clear , according to Harry Reid : " The no-plan , no - end approach is no longer acceptable . "
Senator Chuck Hagel ( R - NE ) called the vote a " significant event " and said that , despite the defeat of the Democratic bill , the Bush administration should begin drawing down troop strength in Iraq next year .
He also took the time to scold Bush for his ongoing contention that anyone who disagrees with the administration 's Iraq approach is hurting troop morale and " comforting the enemy . "
" The Bush administration must understand that each American has a right to question our policies in Iraq and elsewhere , and should not be demonized or condemned for disagreeing with them , " Hagel said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations .
" Suggesting that to challenge and criticize policy is undermining and hurting our troops is not democratic , nor what this country has stood for over 200 years . "
It was the first time the International Olympic Committee eliminated any sports in 69 years .
Both baseball and softball suffered from low international support because they are not widely played , despite their Olympic inclusion , and remained dominated by North American teams .
Cuba won three of the four baseball gold medals and the United States won the other .
The United States won all three softball gold medals .
Moreover , Major League Baseball never allowed its players to participate and the International Olympic Committee has expressed concern over any sport that is not played in the Olympics with its best players .
" Those who bear most of the blame are the owners of the professional leagues , who refuse to free up their ballplayers to compete , " Carlos Rodriguez , president of the Cuban baseball federation , told The Associated Press .
" It 's a shame because this decision will disappoint millions of young people who practice and love this sport . "
Major League Baseball is about to unveil a world baseball tournament that will include the top players and that will be played before the regular season , a plan that did not help the sport 's standing with the International Olympic Committee .
" I feel like somebody who has been thrown out - it 's certainly not a good feeling , " said Aldo Notari of Italy , the president of the International Baseball Federation .
" I do n't think the I.O.C. members know our sport deeply enough . "
I ’ve worked in offices , and I ’ve worked in cubicles .
( I ’m actually writing this in a double - wide that I share with another writer .
Thankfully , she ’s busy transcribing a tape , so I have a moment ’s peace . )
And I ’m here to tell you : Collaboration is great , but sometimes I ’d kill for a door .
I will confess :
Once , I almost did .
I got into a loud bar fight with an architect on the topic of cubicles .
Fittingly , this outburst took place just down the road from the University of Colorado , where in 1968 , a fine - arts professor named Robert Propst came up with the “ Action Office . ”
Propst ’s vision was to give white - collar workers , then toiling amid rows of desks in huge open spaces , both more privacy and a way to individualize their space .
By that measure , cubicles were an improvement .
But in the hands of space - mad facilities planners , the idea was perverted to justify an officescape that resembled the Chicago stockyards .
Dilbert was born .
Scott Adams got rich .
The vogue for one - size - fits - all offices reached its apotheosis in the dotcom years , when Intel CEO Andy Grove famously foreswore his suite for an 8 - foot - by - 9 - foot cubicle .
Endearing as that egalitarian gesture was , nobody has yet been able to prove that shoehorning knowledge workers into . . .
( Young colleague plunks himself down on my desk .
Wants advice on an upcoming story .
Go away ! )
Where was I ?
Oh , yes .
Productivity .
Lost .
Right .
Like many problems in the work arena , this one turns on numbers .
The savings that accrue from jamming employees into cubes rather than offices , particularly in high - rent markets , can be huge .
The productivity gains that come from giving workers a space where they can do uninterrupted , heads - down work — those are harder to quantify .
Shockingly , there has been no defining Frederick Taylor - esque research on knowledge - worker productivity .
But Tom Davenport , professor of management and information technology at Babson College , has tried to crack the code with a yearlong survey of workers , academics , and executives in HR , IT , and facilities planning .
He found that three factors determined white - collar performance : management and organization , information technology , and workplace design .
The last , he says , has a measurable effect — for good and ill .
“ Open offices do lead to more unstructured communication , ” he says .
But “ those same offices can lead to problems of concentration .
If you value reflection or deep thought , it gets tough . ”
Call it the attention - deficit office .
Office - design companies are struggling to remedy the problem .
Herman Miller is rethinking both the cubicle and the office landscape and plans to unveil new designs in the near future .
Its engineers are experimenting with a signal light that could connect from your phone — or a Word document — to the name tag on your “ workstation ” ( to Millerites , using the word “ cubicle ” is like cussing in church ) , glowing red if you do n’t want to be interrupted .
They ’ve also developed a sound - muffling technology that allows workers who deal with confidential information to have voice privacy , although it creates too much of a din for widespread adoption .
But Gervais Tompkin , regional design director of architectural firm Gensler ’s San Francisco office , says simply designing a better cube is like putting lipstick on a pig .
“ Dilbert was a real - estate effectiveness issue , ” he says .
“ The effectiveness of the employee is now worth more than the real estate . ”
That ’s why some progressive companies are relocating the space - planning function from the COO ’s office to the HR department .

I first glanced at Ruby a few years ago , round about the time I first glanced at Python .
The two were , at least superficically , similiar .
As I was more heavily into web development at the time Python looked the better option because of Zope , WebWare and other packages ; Ruby then ( as far as I know ) just had plain CGI .
Now Ruby has stormed the web development world with the Rails platform , leaving Pythonistas dazed and confused .
Nevertheless we rallied round two excellent packages , TurboGears and Django , while the Zopeheads worked on their interesting but rather esoteric Zope 3 .
And Python is not short of web development platforms ; I wrote a large document management application using Quixote +
Durus , about which more later .
But Ruby , once an obscure Japanese cousin to Python , is now the darling of the tech media .
Rails has been around now for about 15 months , 3 times longer than TurboGears ( though not TG's individual components ) and so I decided that as a more stable platform it would be worth a look .
Plus , and this is something I forgot to mention in my last post about Java , you should always look for possibilities to beef up your resume with buzzwords .
Even if I just wrote a little wiki for handling work projects in Rails I could put that on my CV .
Such is the benefit of hype .
Others have written on the differences between Ruby and Python ; I 'll not add to that here , except that it was in a way harder to switch between Ruby and Python than between Python and Java , because the small differences in syntax keep catching you out .
Anyway , on to Rails .
The immediate first impression is that TurboGears is more verbose ( or explicit , if you like ) than Rails .
For example : RoR:TG : One thing to note is how you have to tell TG what methods to expose to the web , which template to use , and what data goes in the template .
In RoR this is decided for you ; every method by default is exposed , any data in the method goes in the template , and the name of the template is the same as that of the method ( in this case , index.rhtml ) .
You can override these , but a lot of assumptions are made on your behalf .
Let 's look at how each system handles the model : RoR : TG : Again RoR 's ActiveRecord works implicitly : it looks for a corresponding database table and maps rows to Article objects .
With SQLObject you define the columns in Python code and then the object creates the corresponding database table as needed ( in this case , Article.createTable ( ) ) .
You can do things the RoR way in SQLObject , but in general this is only done with legacy databases .
This is the basic difference in philosophy between the two platforms .
The Pythonic way is " explicit over implicit " .
Everything is out for show : you know what modules are imported , you know what methods are exposed , you know what columns are defined and so on .
It may take more keystrokes but the extra code let 's you know what is happening when things go wrong .
The Ruby way ( or at least the Rails way ) is the opposite : take the burden off the developer , do n't bother them with the petty details that get in the way and add to the line noise .
RoR does make for more readable code .
However , there is a caveat : when things go wrong , or when you want to do something different , it 's a lot more work to fix the problem than if it 's always obvious what 's going on .
In that way RoR is the anti-J2EE ; it assumes everything for you .
I can see the advantages , but I also find it annoying and presumptious : I want to decide upfront what methods to expose and how my data model should look .
In fact , Zope has inspired such hatred amoing Pythonistas for just that reason : things like acquisition doing mysterious business behind the scenes that cannot be explained , which is lovely when it works but a source of immense frustration when it does n't .
Finally , one should also consider features available in TG that are not in RoR and vice versa .
TG has the Toolbox , an over the web admin application that comes with a set of goodies like a relational model designer and data browser , localization tool , and so on .
More importantly , it has good internationalization support , including localized date formatting and the like .
This is really , really important if you work in Europe : in Finland , for example , I often have to develop sites that are available in Finnish and Swedish ( Swedish is Finland 's second official language ) as well as for example English , Estonian and Russian .
I 'm not sure how well RoR supports internationalization .
Both have form widgets , though in different ways : RoR just uses simple functions in templates , whereas in TG you create form and widget objects and insert them into your templates .
RoR uses ASP or PHP style text - based templating , TG uses Kid , an XML - based template engine that ensures well - formed HTML or X ( HT ) ML. RoR has scaffolds , TG has DataControllers .
Which features you need and which is the better way of doing things is again down to requirements and preference .
In summary , both are well - designed and fun to work with .
Both kick Java 's fat corporate ass .
They have different approaches to the same problem , but that 's OK : I like the Pythonic way of TurboGears but I can see that others prefer RoR 's magical implicitness .
RoR has better marketing which makes it easier to persuade your boss to let you use it .
It is also more stable , being in existence 3 times longer than TG , but TG makes use of well - designed , mature components like CherryPy and SQLObject .
Python has more libraries than Ruby , Ruby has nice features for closures and the like .
As always , YMMV .
My next comparison will be TurboGears vs the various Python web development frameworks .
The Singer Solution to World Poverty
A contentious ethicist explains why your taste for foie gras is starving children .
By PETER SINGER Illustrations by ROSS MacDONALD
The Australian philosopher Peter Singer , who later this month begins teaching at Princeton University , is perhaps the world 's most controversial ethicist .
Many readers of his book " Animal Liberation " were moved to embrace vegetarianism , while others recoiled at Singer 's attempt to place humans and animals on an even moral plane .
Similarly , his argument that severely disabled infants should , in some cases , receive euthanasia has been praised as courageous by some — and denounced by others , including anti-abortion activists , who have protested Singer 's Princeton appointment .
Singer 's penchant for provocation extends to more mundane matters , like everyday charity .
A recent article about Singer in The New York Times revealed that the philosopher gives one - fifth of his income to famine - relief agencies .
" From when I first saw pictures in newspapers of people starving , from when people asked you to donate some of your pocket money for collections at school , " he mused , " I always thought , ' Why that much — why not more ? " '
Is it possible to quantify our charitable burden ?
In the following essay , Singer offers some unconventional thoughts about the ordinary American 's obligations to the world 's poor and suggests that even his own one - fifth standard may not be enough .
n the Brazilian film " Central Station , " Dora is a retired schoolteacher who makes ends meet by sitting at the station writing letters for illiterate people .
Suddenly she has an opportunity to pocket $ 1,000 .
All she has to do is persuade a homeless 9 - year - old boy to follow her to an address she has been given .
( She is told he will be adopted by wealthy foreigners . )
She delivers the boy , gets the money , spends some of it on a television set and settles down to enjoy her new acquisition .
Her neighbor spoils the fun , however , by telling her that the boy was too old to be adopted — he will be killed and his organs sold for transplantation .
Perhaps Dora knew this all along , but after her neighbor 's plain speaking , she spends a troubled night .
In the morning Dora resolves to take the boy back .
Suppose Dora had told her neighbor that it is a tough world , other people have nice new TV 's too , and if selling the kid is the only way she can get one , well , he was only a street kid .
She would then have become , in the eyes of the audience , a monster .
She redeems herself only by being prepared to bear considerable risks to save the boy .
At the end of the movie , in cinemas in the affluent nations of the world , people who would have been quick to condemn Dora if she had not rescued the boy go home to places far more comfortable than her apartment .
In fact , the average family in the United States spends almost one - third of its income on things that are no more necessary to them than Dora 's new TV was to her .
Going out to nice restaurants , buying new clothes because the old ones are no longer stylish , vacationing at beach resorts — so much of our income is spent on things not essential to the preservation of our lives and health .
Donated to one of a number of charitable agencies , that money could mean the difference between life and death for children in need .

Princeton 's New Philosopher Draws a Stir ( April 10 , 1999 )
Of course , there are several differences between the two situations that could support different moral judgments about them .
For one thing , to be able to consign a child to death when he is standing right in front of you takes a chilling kind of heartlessness ; it is much easier to ignore an appeal for money to help children you will never meet .
Yet for a utilitarian philosopher like myself — that is , one who judges whether acts are right or wrong by their consequences — if the upshot of the American 's failure to donate the money is that one more kid dies on the streets of a Brazilian city , then it is , in some sense , just as bad as selling the kid to the organ peddlers .
But one does n't need to embrace my utilitarian ethic to see that , at the very least , there is a troubling incongruity in being so quick to condemn Dora for taking the child to the organ peddlers while , at the same time , not regarding the American consumer 's behavior as raising a serious moral issue .
n his 1996 book , " Living High and Letting Die , " the New York University philosopher Peter Unger presented an ingenious series of imaginary examples designed to probe our intuitions about whether it is wrong to live well without giving substantial amounts of money to help people who are hungry , malnourished or dying from easily treatable illnesses like diarrhea .
Here 's my paraphrase of one of these examples :
Bob is close to retirement .
He has invested most of his savings in a very rare and valuable old car , a Bugatti , which he has not been able to insure .
The Bugatti is his pride and joy .
In addition to the pleasure he gets from driving and caring for his car , Bob knows that its rising market value means that he will always be able to sell it and live comfortably after retirement .
One day when Bob is out for a drive , he parks the Bugatti near the end of a railway siding and goes for a walk up the track .
As he does so , he sees that a runaway train , with no one aboard , is running down the railway track .
Looking farther down the track , he sees the small figure of a child very likely to be killed by the runaway train .
He can't stop the train and the child is too far away to warn of the danger , but he can throw a switch that will divert the train down the siding where his Bugatti is parked .
Then nobody will be killed -- but the train will destroy his Bugatti .
Thinking of his joy in owning the car and the financial security it represents , Bob decides not to throw the switch .
The child is killed .
For many years to come , Bob enjoys owning his Bugatti and the financial security it represents .
You should n't take that cruise , redecorate the house or get that pricey new suit .
After all , a $ 1,000 suit could save five children 's lives .
Bob 's conduct , most of us will immediately respond , was gravely wrong .
Unger agrees .
But then he reminds us that we , too , have opportunities to save the lives of children .
We can give to organizations like Unicef or Oxfam America .
How much would we have to give one of these organizations to have a high probability of saving the life of a child threatened by easily preventable diseases ?
( I do not believe that children are more worth saving than adults , but since no one can argue that children have brought their poverty on themselves , focusing on them simplifies the issues . )
Unger called up some experts and used the information they provided to offer some plausible estimates that include the cost of raising money , administrative expenses and the cost of delivering aid where it is most needed .
By his calculation , $ 200 in donations would help a sickly 2 - year - old transform into a healthy 6 - year - old — offering safe passage through childhood 's most dangerous years .
To show how practical philosophical argument can be , Unger even tells his readers that they can easily donate funds by using their credit card and calling one of these toll - free numbers : ( 800 ) 367-5437 for Unicef ; ( 800 ) 693-2687 for Oxfam America .
Now you , too , have the information you need to save a child 's life .
How should you judge yourself if you do n't do it ?
Think again about Bob and his Bugatti .
Unlike Dora , Bob did not have to look into the eyes of the child he was sacrificing for his own material comfort .
The child was a complete stranger to him and too far away to relate to in an intimate , personal way .
Unlike Dora , too , he did not mislead the child or initiate the chain of events imperiling him .
In all these respects , Bob 's situation resembles that of people able but unwilling to donate to overseas aid and differs from Dora 's situation .
If you still think that it was very wrong of Bob not to throw the switch that would have diverted the train and saved the child 's life , then it is hard to see how you could deny that it is also very wrong not to send money to one of the organizations listed above .
Unless , that is , there is some morally important difference between the two situations that I have overlooked .
Is it the practical uncertainties about whether aid will really reach the people who need it ?
Nobody who knows the world of overseas aid can doubt that such uncertainties exist .
But Unger 's figure of $ 200 to save a child 's life was reached after he had made conservative assumptions about the proportion of the money donated that will actually reach its target .
One genuine difference between Bob and those who can afford to donate to overseas aid organizations but do n't is that only Bob can save the child on the tracks , whereas there are hundreds of millions of people who can give $ 200 to overseas aid organizations .
The problem is that most of them are n't doing it .
Does this mean that it is all right for you not to do it ?
Suppose that there were more owners of priceless vintage cars — Carol , Dave , Emma , Fred and so on , down to Ziggy — all in exactly the same situation as Bob , with their own siding and their own switch , all sacrificing the child in order to preserve their own cherished car .
Would that make it all right for Bob to do the same ?
To answer this question affirmatively is to endorse follow - the - crowd ethics — the kind of ethics that led many Germans to look away when the Nazi atrocities were being committed .
We do not excuse them because others were behaving no better .
We seem to lack a sound basis for drawing a clear moral line between Bob 's situation and that of any reader of this article with $ 200 to spare who does not donate it to an overseas aid agency .
These readers seem to be acting at least as badly as Bob was acting when he chose to let the runaway train hurtle toward the unsuspecting child .
In the light of this conclusion , I trust that many readers will reach for the phone and donate that $ 200 .
Perhaps you should do it before reading further .
ow that you have distinguished yourself morally from people who put their vintage cars ahead of a child 's life , how about treating yourself and your partner to dinner at your favorite restaurant ?
But wait .
The money you will spend at the restaurant could also help save the lives of children overseas !
True , you were n't planning to blow $ 200 tonight , but if you were to give up dining out just for one month , you would easily save that amount .
And what is one month 's dining out , compared to a child 's life ?
There 's the rub .
Since there are a lot of desperately needy children in the world , there will always be another child whose life you could save for another $ 200 .
Are you therefore obliged to keep giving until you have nothing left ?
At what point can you stop ?
Hypothetical examples can easily become farcical .
Consider Bob .
How far past losing the Bugatti should he go ?
Imagine that Bob had got his foot stuck in the track of the siding , and if he diverted the train , then before it rammed the car it would also amputate his big toe .
Should he still throw the switch ?
What if it would amputate his foot ?
His entire leg ?
As absurd as the Bugatti scenario gets when pushed to extremes , the point it raises is a serious one : only when the sacrifices become very significant indeed would most people be prepared to say that Bob does nothing wrong when he decides not to throw the switch .
Of course , most people could be wrong ; we can't decide moral issues by taking opinion polls .
But consider for yourself the level of sacrifice that you would demand of Bob , and then think about how much money you would have to give away in order to make a sacrifice that is roughly equal to that .
It 's almost certainly much , much more than $ 200 .
For most middle - class Americans , it could easily be more like $ 200,000 .
sn't it counterproductive to ask people to do so much ?
Do n't we run the risk that many will shrug their shoulders and say that morality , so conceived , is fine for saints but not for them ?
I accept that we are unlikely to see , in the near or even medium - term future , a world in which it is normal for wealthy Americans to give the bulk of their wealth to strangers .
When it comes to praising or blaming people for what they do , we tend to use a standard that is relative to some conception of normal behavior .
Comfortably off Americans who give , say , 10 percent of their income to overseas aid organizations are so far ahead of most of their equally comfortable fellow citizens that I would n't go out of my way to chastise them for not doing more .
Nevertheless , they should be doing much more , and they are in no position to criticize Bob for failing to make the much greater sacrifice of his Bugatti .
At this point various objections may crop up .
Someone may say : " If every citizen living in the affluent nations contributed his or her share I would n't have to make such a drastic sacrifice , because long before such levels were reached , the resources would have been there to save the lives of all those children dying from lack of food or medical care .
So why should I give more than my fair share ? "
Another , related , objection is that the Government ought to increase its overseas aid allocations , since that would spread the burden more equitably across all taxpayers .
Yet the question of how much we ought to give is a matter to be decided in the real world — and that , sadly , is a world in which we know that most people do not , and in the immediate future will not , give substantial amounts to overseas aid agencies .
We know , too , that at least in the next year , the United States Government is not going to meet even the very modest Umited Nations - recommended target of 0.7 percent of gross national product ; at the moment it lags far below that , at 0.09 percent , not even half of Japan 's 0.22 percent or a tenth of Denmark 's 0.97 percent .
Thus , we know that the money we can give beyond that theoretical " fair share " is still going to save lives that would otherwise be lost .
While the idea that no one need do more than his or her fair share is a powerful one , should it prevail if we know that others are not doing their fair share and that children will die preventable deaths unless we do more than our fair share ?
That would be taking fairness too far .
Thus , this ground for limiting how much we ought to give also fails .
In the world as it is now , I can see no escape from the conclusion that each one of us with wealth surplus to his or her essential needs should be giving most of it to help people suffering from poverty so dire as to be life - threatening .
That 's right : I 'm saying that you should n't buy that new car , take that cruise , redecorate the house or get that pricey new suit .
After all , a $ 1,000 suit could save five children 's lives .
So how does my philosophy break down in dollars and cents ?
An American household with an income of $ 50,000 spends around $ 30,000 annually on necessities , according to the Conference Board , a nonprofit economic research organization .
Therefore , for a household bringing in $ 50,000 a year , donations to help the world 's poor should be as close as possible to $ 20,000 .
The $ 30,000 required for necessities holds for higher incomes as well .
So a household making $ 100,000 could cut a yearly check for $ 70,000 .
Again , the formula is simple : whatever money you 're spending on luxuries , not necessities , should be given away .
Now , evolutionary psychologists tell us that human nature just is n't sufficiently altruistic to make it plausible that many people will sacrifice so much for strangers .
On the facts of human nature , they might be right , but they would be wrong to draw a moral conclusion from those facts .
If it is the case that we ought to do things that , predictably , most of us wo n't do , then let 's face that fact head - on .
Then , if we value the life of a child more than going to fancy restaurants , the next time we dine out we will know that we could have done something better with our money .
If that makes living a morally decent life extremely arduous , well , then that is the way things are .
If we do n't do it , then we should at least know that we are failing to live a morally decent life — not because it is good to wallow in guilt but because knowing where we should be going is the first step toward heading in that direction .
When Bob first grasped the dilemma that faced him as he stood by that railway switch , he must have thought how extraordinarily unlucky he was to be placed in a situation in which he must choose between the life of an innocent child and the sacrifice of most of his savings .
But he was not unlucky at all .
We are all in that situation .

In the bizarre and rule - bound world of quantum physics , every tiny spec of matter has something called " spin " - an intrinsic trait like eye color - that cannot be changed and which dictates , very specifically , what other bits of matter the spec can share quantum space with .
When fermions , the most antisocial type of quantum particle , do get together , they pair up in a wondrous dance that enables such things as superconductivity .
For the first time , researchers at Rice University have succeeded in creating and observing an elusive and long - sought quantum state - a superfluid of fermions with mismatched numbers of dance partners .
Despite more than 40 years of theoretical musings about what would occur in such a case , the result - a cluster of matched pairs surrounded by a cloud of would - be dance partners - was largely unexpected .
The research , which appears online this week , is slated to appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Science , together with a paper from MIT reporting related results .
The experiments offer physicists a new window into two of the least understood and most intriguing phenomena in physics - superconductivity and superfluidity .
Both phenomena result from a change in the phase of matter .
Anyone who has seen ice melt has seen matter change phases , and when electrons , atoms and other specs of matter change quantum phases , they behave just as differently as do ice and water in a glass .
Superconducting and superfluid phases of matter occur in fermions - the antisocial particles that can't share quantum space - only when quantum forces become dominant .
Because thermodynamic forces are typically so powerful that they overwhelm quantum interactions - like loud music overwhelms the whisper of someone nearby - superconductivity and superfluidity only occur in extreme cold .
In the Rice experiment , when temperatures drop to within a few billionths of a degree of absolute zero , fermions with equal but opposite spin become attracted to one another and behave , in some respects , like one particle .
Like a couple on the dance floor , they do n't technically share space , but they move in unison .
In superconductors , these dancing pairs allow electrical current to flow through the material without any resistance at all , a property that engineers have long dreamed of harnessing to eliminate " leakage " in power cables , something that costs billions of dollars per year in the U.S. alone .
advertisement
The superconducting and superfluid phases are analogous except that superconductivity happens with particles carrying an electrical charge and superfluidity occurs in electrically neutral particles .
In superfluids , fermionic pairing leads to a complete absence of viscosity - like a wave rippling back and forth in a swimming pool without ever diminishing .
" Conventional theory tells us superconductivity or superfluidity occurs only in the presence of an equal number of spin - up and spin- down particles , " said lead researcher Randy Hulet , the Fayez Sarofim Professor of Physics and Astronomy .
" Physicists have speculated for almost 50 years about what would happen if this condition were not met .
" Because of the pristine and controlled nature of our ultracold atoms , we 're able to offer definitive evidence of what happens with mismatched numbers of spin - up and spin - down particles . "
Ultracold experiments at temperatures just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero are Hulet 's specialty .
It 's only been technically possible to chill atoms to these temperatures for the past 10 years , but in that time , this ability has proved remarkably useful for testing the predictions of quantum mechanics and for exploring the properties of what physicists call " many - body phenomena , " including superconductivity and superfluidity .
In the latest experiments , Hulet 's team - which includes graduate students Guthrie Partridge , Ramsey Kamar and Yean - an Liao and postdoctoral researcher Wenhui Li - cooled a mixture of fermionic lithium - 6 atoms to about 30 - billionths of a degree above absolute zero .
That 's far colder than any temperature in nature - even in deepest interstellar space - and it's sufficient to quell virtually all thermodynamic interaction in the atoms , leaving them subject to superfluid quantum pairing .
advertisement
Using radio waves , Hulet 's team altered the ratio of spin- up and spin - down atoms in the cooled atoms with great precision .
They found that the superfluid was able to tolerate an excess of up to 10 percent unpaired fermions with no detrimental effects .
Hulet 's team found that increasing the ratio of spin-up to spin - down atoms eventually caused a phase change .
When unpaired spin - up atoms rose above 10 percent of the total sample , the unpaired loners were suddenly expelled , leaving a core of superfluid pairs surrounded by a shell of excess spin - up atoms .
It is the unbalanced yet seemingly unaffected superfluid , however , that is capturing most of the scientific attention at the moment .
" The gas behaves as if it is still perfectly paired , which is quite remarkable given the excess of spin - up atoms , " Hulet said .
" This was unexpected , and it could signal a new , exotic form of superfluidity that may be akin to the electron pairings in unconventional superconductors or to the quark soup that 's predicted to exist at the heart of the densest neutron stars . "
In the largest neutron stars - known as " quark stars " - a mass about five times greater than the sun is pressed into a space smaller than the island of Manhattan .
Some physics theorists believe gravity is so strong at the heart of these stars that it creates something called a " strange matter , " a dense superfluid of up quarks , down quarks and strange quarks .

The strangest , easiest way to lose weight
You have a legacy brain .
We 've talked about that a lot on this blog , and in my presentations .
Your brain thinks you 're still living in a cave .
Although your mind knows you 're in the 21st centry , your brain never got the memo .
A big part of the learning theory we use in the Head First books is figuring out how to " trick " your brain into thinking that learning Java is as important as watching for tigers .
We pay a great deal of attention to what your brain cares about , especially when the concerns ( tigers - but - not - java ) are in direct conflict with what your mind cares about ( java - but - not - tigers ) .
Besides caring about tigers - and - not - java -- and the problems that creates when we 're trying to pay attention , learn , and remember -- our legacy brain does something else we all struggle with -- it thinks you wo n't get much to eat all winter , so it better store it up while it can .
Your brain thinks that food is scarce for you , so it better hang on to it .
In other words , for almost all adults ( especially in the US ) , our brain wants us to be weigh more than our conscious mind wants .
The brain never got the memo about how you probably are n't going to starve this winter .
Given how interested we are here into hacking and creating workarounds for the legacy brain issues , a new diet book that claims to take this approach got my attention .
The claims are outrageous , the " plan " is absurd and counter - intuitive , but when the publisher sent me a copy of the book I figured it would n't hurt to try it .
I say " would n't hurt " because it is ridiculously easy to try .
And since the Freakonomics guys were recommending it , I figured there had to be something interesting .
Plus ...
I loved the name : the Shangri -La Diet .
It 's been two weeks since I started and oh - my - god .
It is almost impossible to describe what this " diet " ( it 's not really a diet ) does .
( All links are at the end of this post ) A UC Berkeley professor named Seth Roberts claims to have found a way to trick the legacy brain into thinking it needs to weigh less .
( Which means " lower your set point " , for those who are familiar with that term )
It does not cause you to suddenly burn more calories .
It does not increase your metabolism .
It is not a drug .
It does not require counting calories .
It does not require changing what you eat ( although for many people , it will anyway )
It does not require exercise ( although I 'm always going to strongly recommend it ! )
[ Update :
It is based on quite a lot of different scientific research ( rat studies , especially ) that the author has managed to piece together into a theory and approach that works .
It is not simply a psychological trick . ]
It claims to do just one thing -- cause your body to want / need less food .
Period .
In other words , you know that feeling you have after you 've eaten a huge dinner and you think , " I 'll never eat another bite ever again " -- this so - called " diet " makes that feeling happen much earlier , after a much smaller meal .
Quite simply , it reduces your appetite , but in a really freakish way .
It is not an artificial appetite supressant ; it works by using your body 's natural appetite supressant -- the desire to keep you at a particular weight .
For me , in two weeks , it 's been working too well .
I do n't have a weight problem , so I was n't interested in losing weight .
I wanted to try it because it 's fascinating , seems impossible to believe , and MAINLY for the claim that by reducing cravings , it helps you make better eating choices .
My goal on this " diet " was that when it was time to eat , I wanted to find carrots and broccoli as viable an option as Ben and Jerry's .
That has n't completely happened ( although cravings have virtually disappeared ) , but within three days , I was actually forgetting to eat .
For the last ten days I 've had to remind myself -- as a purely cognitive activity -- that " this is probably a good time to eat something . "
Is there a danger that I 'll become too thin ?
Sure , if I 'm not paying attention .
But that 's easy enough to correct -- there 's basically a body - back guarantee .
If I just stop the program , I 'll get my old body back soon enough ...
I was worried that this loss of desire for food would mean a loss of pleasure when eating .
But this is not food aversion -- while nothing beckons you or even sounds particularly good , everything tastes just as wonderful as before .
And it is the weirdest damn feeling ... it 's a kind of " not hungry " that is unlike anything I 've ever experienced .
It seems too good to be true .
And maybe it is ...
I only have two weeks ' experience .
Maybe the effect will wear off ( although there 's little reason to think that ) .
And the research might turn out to be complete crap -- some believe it might even be some kind of elaborate hoax .
But I have two other friends on it now , and after five days , they 've noticed the effect as well .
So I 'm not so much recommending it ( since that would require more time ) as reporting my thoughts about it , my short - term experience , and why I find it so fascinating .
The downside :
* It does n't seem to work for everyone .
Some people claim it had no effect ( I have a suspicion that some of the folks for whom it does n't work were n't actually doing it with the kind of rigorous adherence to one simple rule that 's required ) .
* Some people take much longer to see an effect , although it seems that most people notice it in less than a week .
* You must MUST be able to find at least one two - hour time window each day where you have nothing but water .
Nothing with any flavor of any kind is allowed -- NO EXCEPTIONS -- during that period , including brushing your teeth .
For most people , two hours is no problem at all ... but you have to be extremely careful or you risk not just eliminating the positive effect , but potentially ruining your chance of using it correctly in the future .
* In the middle of that two hour window , you must ingest one of two things ... either a tablespoon of sugar dissolved in water , or a tablespoon of extra light olive oil .
If either of those are not do - able for you , you 're out of luck .
* The sugar water comes with the potential for a blood sugar reaction , so if you choose that instead of the olive oil , you can reduce or eliminate the effect by sipping slowly .
I heat up the water , dissolve the sugar , and sip it over a half hour like really weak , sweet tea .
I tried the olive oil and hated it .
* You must also ... well , no , there IS nothing else .
Seriously .
Nothing .
Eat whatever you want , do whatever you want , just take in the extra calories from either the sugar or the oil , and there 's nothing more .
THAT is the Shangri - La Diet .
Sugar , or oil .
End of story .
While I 've more or less revealed the diet here , the Shangri -La Diet book is needed if you 're going to try it , or you 're interested in the research / science behind it .
There are a lot of subtle variations and tweaks and tunes , and recommendations based on how much weight you want to lose , etc .
So , again , if you 're going to try it , I 'd definitely get the book despite finding most of the information about it on the internet .
Links :
Extensive article with comments on CalorieLab .
The original NY Times piece by the Freakonomics guys .
Shangri-La Diet book ( on Amazon ) .
Aaron Swartz blog post about it .
Disclaimer : I was given this book by the publisher .
However , it would have come to my attention because of the similarity of our approaches -- hacking the legacy brain .
Indeed , within a week of getting the book , I was sent a related link by fellow blogger Scott Reynen who thought I might be interested .
I do not use Amazon affiliate links , so I am not benefitting in any way from recommending the book here or elsewhere , and I have no relationship with the publisher or author .
In fact , I 'm buying my own extra copies now for others .
Also , I 'm not a dietician or nutritionist !
I have absolutely NO authority in this field -- this is simply my personal thoughts about it .
( However , I did major in exercise physiology , and spent ten years in the health / fitness industry , including a stint as the Training Director for The Sports Club Company , the group behind some of the largest and most exclusive health clubs in the world -- The Sports Club / LA , Sports Club Reebok / New York , etc .
But I specialized only in exercise , and had nothing to do with diets and nutrition . )
OK , now back to our regularly scheduled " creating passionate users " topics ; )

I 've been doing this on and off for years without the sugar / olive oil , although I can see how that might help .
I have a tendency to eat too much .
It is n't that the food I eat is generally really bad , I just eat more than I need .
However , with a little mental acrobatics I can noticably teach my body to want less food .
I feel hungry less often , have cravings less and even come to despise the taste of junk foods .
The biggest challenge I have is getting the collaboration of my partner .
It is really hard to keep this up if you have someone around you that is n't doing the same thing .

Hey !
I 'm extremely passionate about wanting to regain the marathoning body I had prior to injury !
I eat good food , but too much of it for the non-marathoner that I 've become .
If this works , I 'll be extremely passionate about it too :-)

So basically some guy wrote a book on using control to lose weight , slapped a fancy name on the cover and promoted to influencers like yourself ?
Sounds like every other diet book our there to me .
Nothing really new here .
Sorry Kathy , looking forward to your next post on marketing .
I 'll stick to the nutrition sites for diet info .
thanks anyhow
Posted by : George Harris | May 1 , 2006 7:49:18 PM
Thanks for the positive comments about eating less , Kathy .
The reality is , there is simply too much food and not enough Java .
( And there may be something to this if someone thin is losing weight ... )

If you do n't eat for four hours , then put a raisin under your tongue and give yourself a sharp poke in the eye you 'll lose twice as much .
Posted by : Patrick Fitzgerald | May 1 , 2006 10:22:57 PM
I suspect the effectiveness of this diet has nothing to do with nutrition and everything to do with psychology .
People with a weight problem generally have a negative emotional relationship with food .
Often eating becomes a way of self - expression , possibly the only part of their lives they can control .
This book , by saying eat what you want , gives the dieter the permission to eat normally .
Permission is a very strong psychological factor in conformity experiments ( e.g. Millgram 's electric shock study ) .
By saying eat what you want the diet is giving the dieter permission to have a normal relationship with food .
The two hours a day abstention period is a device that allows the dieter to practice not eating .
Its only two hours and they can eat what they want at the end of it .
Most people can manage this and when they achieve it they feel good about ' sticking to the diet ' , reinforcing the behaviour of not eating .
During the two hours free of stimulants you are likely to become re-tuned to your body 's signals of hunger and thirst .
Promoting a heathly , eat when you are hungry , behaviour pattern .
The sugar / oil requirement is odd .
I think it serves two functions .
Firstly its a choice , giving the dieter control over what they consume .
There is a lot of research on how choice and control effects stress levels .
Secondly its a ritual .
A marker point that reminds the dieter about the diet and what they are hoping to do .
It also acts as a badge , or a t - shirt , for the brand .
e.g. being the one on the office who makes that strange drink once a day .
Behaviour can mark your allegiance to something just as much as a t - shirt or tribal scarring can .
Once you belong to a tribe , this reinforces your belief or ' buy - in ' to the tribe 's beliefs .
This is beneficial in this case because you will loose weight and be healthier but also because you will promote the book to your friends , the authors and publishers are happy as well .

I have some serious doubts about this diet , because it ignores the point of weight loss .
Why does one want to lose weight ?
To put it in Kathys terms , what is the " ? " in " It 's the [ ? ] , stupid ! " here ?
For me it is " health " .
" Looking good " would be nice , but I 'm not willing to sacrifice my health just to look good .
Does the Shangri - La diet help me here ?
I do n't think so .
( or only a little bit ) .
The main problem is not that we eat way too much , but that we eat crappy food and we eat it way fast .
We eat way too much processed foods filled with trans - fats and HFCS .
The Shangri-La diet basically says there is no problem with eating crappy food with little nutrional value .
That is just plain wrong .
My advice would be to stay away from hamburgers and chips .
Learn to cook , instead of eating microwave food , and eat more vegetables , fruits , whole grains , fish , .. Oh , and enjoy .
Take some time to actually taste your food , and relax .
You 'll also want to excersise offcourse .
Personally , I just do n't believe in quick diets , that promise lots of weight loss without any effort .
They usually sacrifice your health to get quick results .

Ohh I simply cant understand why dieting .
Just by doing it you can not stay fits .
So many factors are related with good health and if one does n't consider it dieting alone can't help .

Wow Kathy .
Lots of comments on this one .
I think I 'll give it a shot before I declare it Good or Bad .
I know that eating Bad food wo n't make one healthy , but I also know that eating too much Good food will still make you fat .
Seems like trying the experiment should n't be too hard and does n't seem like I 'd be risking my health .
So , sugar water or olive oil ?
Decisions , decisions ...
Posted by : Burk | May 2 , 2006 8:21:57 AM
Well ...
I did say it was absurd and that the claims were outrageous .
But , I think it 's still worth looking at the science behind it ( granted , mostly rat studies , but it 's the rat studies that have led to a great deal of what we now know about the brain ) .
The heart of it is tied to the brain registering calories without flavor , and the associations it makes .
Sugar has bizarre properties of its own ...
Again , I encourage ya'll to have an open mind until you 've at least looked at the research and his theories about the science behind it .
( Granted , he makes some big leaps here and there , but there 's evidence to suggest those leaps might be right .
He 's the first one to have put all the pieces together from some of the studies that date back 30 years or more , motivated to go down that path by his own self - experimentation - - a fun story on its own . )
George :
It 's not about control ; his whole point is about making control a non-issue .
You wo n't need control , because you wo n't be in a huge fight with your brain over just how much you need to weigh .
Patrick :
True on the whole poke - in - the - eye thing , but downing a little sugar water is somewhat less painful ; )
Chris :
You may be right , although I do n't think that can explain people like me who are n't overweight and for whom two hours without anything but water defines most of my day anyway -- my day has n't changed one bit other than that one drink .
But I think a lot of what you said is probably a big part of it , especially that you do n't have to do anything .
And while I HEARTILY agree with you about the effects of " tribe " , I would put drinking sugar water at the bottom of the list of things that have tribe characteristics .
It 's pretty much the opposite of things with community support and involvement like , say , Weight Watchers or Atkins .
Jan :
There 's nothing in here that asks you to sacrifice your health .
But I agree with your advice , and indeed the author makes the same claims in the book ( has a whole chapter on what 's wrong with processed food , etc. ) .
His notion ( which seems to be true for me , since eating healthier was my goal for this , not weight loss ) is this :
While you CAN eat anything you want , if you do this calories - without - flavor brain trick , you just ... wo n't .
Without really thinking much about it , it takes away the associations your brain makes with certain foods , and you quit wanting them .
In other words , it 's not a requirement that you make any changes , but the end result is that you will ... without having to try .
True , it has n't made broccoli as appealing to me as ice cream , but it 's probably closed 80 % of the gap .
I do n't believe in quick diets either , but this is n't technically a diet - - it 's a way to stop your brain from fighting you on the whole long - winter - in - the - cave thing .
Or at least that 's the claim .
This could , though , as you said -- lead people into unhealthfully quick results .
For some people it works so well that if they 're * greedy * about weight loss , they 'll lose muscle mass and end up in worse shape than before they started .
( But that 's why I 've never recommended diets , even as a fitness trainer .
Exercise is always the better way , especially combined with eating less processed food , etc .
Burk : I have no idea if it 's really good or bad , but it 's very strange , and for me -- as I said -- working TOO well .
There is another explanation ... that it 's simply a coincidence that I 've lost most of my appetite ( especially for the bad things ) .
I considered that , and that 's why I waited for two weeks to see if anything else turned out to be wrong with me ( even had another check - up just to be sure this was n't some new problem with MY brain ) .
I can't really believe I 'm defending this diet I know almost nothing about , but I think it 's the bizarre nobody - can - believe - it - could - possibly - work part that I like .
Almost nobody thought the Head First books could possibly work -- regardless of the research behind it -- and today they represent half of the O'Reilly bestseller list on their main page .
So , I encourage y'all to have an open mind ; )
Besides , we do n't seem to be doing all that well with any OTHER diet program , even the more traditional research ends up contradicting itself ...
" Fat is bad . "
" No , we were wrong ...
Fat is Good and Carbs are Evil . "
People can make the most progress by eating very sensibly and exercising , but if it were that easy -- the weight loss industry would n't be a multi-billion dollar one , and obesity would n't be a continually - rising health care crises in the US .
I say sugar water is at least as worth a try as anything else .
And if at least part of what Chris says is right , it 's an easy way to get people to make a positive change .

I know that eating Bad food wo n't make one healthy , but I also know that eating too much Good food will still make you fat .
That 's true , but good food tends to be less calorie dense than bad food .
So eating too much good food tends to be more difficult than eating too much bad food .
I 'm just saying , start with eating healthy , never skip breakfast , only eat healthy snacks and excersise three times a week .
If you still do n't feel a lot more healthier and slimmer after 2 months , then Shangri - La might be usefull .
I think that would be rather rare .
Posted by : Jan | May 2 , 2006 9:29:47 AM
Ah , so if I understand this correctly , it does talk about what food to avoid , and what food is good for you .
The sugar water is like a little trick to help you stick with it .
In that case it does look pretty interesting .
Posted by : Jan | May 2 , 2006 9:41:58 AM
You 're a remarkably interesting person . :o )
Posted by : JimDesu | May 2 , 2006 10:22:32 AM
I 'll try it .
I 'll try anything once .
It does sound outrageous , but I also know that a good deal of why we overeat is partly psychological .
It 's something they start discussing about parenting these days , that you do n't necessarily want to tell your children to clean everything off their plate .
Not like my generation where you were made to feel guilty if you did .
What happens when you go out to eat and have the typical American restaurant portions ?
So , yeah , I 'm dubious but I 'll try ( most ) anything once .

I read this last night , then woke up this morning thinking -- I know just how to describe this : supercalifragilisticexpialidocious !

Thanks for posting this , Kathy , I 'm really intrigued .
I 've been going up and down in weight for many years , cycling through various diets ( Atkins , South Beach , etc. ) generally I can lose weight in the summer when I can get out and walk / play a lot and somehow the emotional need for calories seems to wane .
But come winter I just gain it all back as my resolve to maintain a speciality diet cracks .
This year I 've been trying more excercise , which is good , but my weight has been constant -- presumably I just eat more as I burn more calories .
I 'm a pretty big believer in the Set Point , so if there 's a way to control that , that would be a major breakthrough .
Posted by : Charlie Evett | May 2 , 2006 1:30:31 PM
When I first read about this diet I thought it was rubbish , but now that I see smart people defending it , I am intrigued .
I found your comparison with the Head First books interesting .
While I love your blog , the Head First book I read ( Design Patterns ) did do not work for me at all .
On the other hand , I did not find losing weight all that hard ( I lost 100 pounds by eating healthier and exercising more ) .
I guess research can prove a lot of things , but in the end everybody is different .
I think the unhealthy part of this diet is that you 'll consume ( according to one of the links you posted ) 300 calories of nutrient - less food .
That 's 20 % of a 1500 calorie diet .
If you are eating a low calorie diet , you should make sure that all calories are full of vitamins and minerals .
If you 're following this diet , at least make sure to eat very healthy ( lots of vegetables and fruit ) and consider taking a multivitamin .

I do n't know very much about this " diet " , and , as a wellness and fitness coach , I really do n't want to know much .
It 's true that you can " forget " to eat , but it 's actually MUCH more healthful to REMEMBER to eat , and on - schedule .
It 's very hard to over - eat if you have smallnutritious meals 5 - 6 times a day .
This author 's sugar and olive oil supplements are easy to understand : the sugar is providing carbohydrate so your tissues do n't entirely each each other ( the body will cannibalize your tissues -- like muscle , etc -- first , so it can save the brain for last ) and the olive oil is a fat source , once again for the energy in the fat .
Any ' weight loss ' is temporary with this " diet " .
Only decreasing adipose tissue ( " fat " ) and increasing active tissue ( lean muscle , more blood vessels , capillaries = increased metabolism ) will you sustain a leaner body .
This can be done only by :
- decreasing food intake each meal ( but eating often )
-eating nutrient - dense foods and not garbage
- drinking water to flush & hydrate the system
- exercising ( and building lean muscle )
Everything beyond these details come down to mind - and habit- control .
It 's not as if you can ONLY 'eat clean ' , but you should eat nutritiously most of the time , and diet is 80 % of your fitness goals anyway .
As I said , I teach this to clients ( and on my website ) every day .
Best to you , be healthy ,
Lauren

Here 's an uber simple and effective way to lose weight : do n't eat meat .
You'd be surprised how effective this strategy is plus you get the bonus karma points for not causing suffering .
Posted by : g | May 2 , 2006 9:51:13 PM
For me , the explanation for this so called " diet " is quite obvious .
American people have such bad eating habits that they need to trick themselves not to eat ANYTHING FOR TWO HOURS .
Let 's be honest , in any other part of the world , not eating for two hours is just something you do everyday .
So off course , I strongly believe in the fact that forcing yourself not to eat for two hours , if you do n't do that naturally everyday , can help you reduce the feeling of hungriness and therefore help you get slim .
And concerning the oil OR sugar ( I could also recommend a nicely spiced glass of water ... ) , they are just here to make you believe there is indeed a concept behind this diet , kind of a placebo effect in fact .
So I 'd say it can be an effective diet ... for the people with really bad eating habits , but you should be careful with it because any kind of self conditionning can become dangerous when not well thought of ( you could really loose your appetite ... ) .
Posted by : laurent | May 3 , 2006 2:08:28 AM
I think some of the people criticising the diet seem to forget that the most straight - forward diet ( eat less , eat healthy , exercise more ) simply does not work for everyone .
It seems that it does n't work even for the majority .
Sure , it works in theory , but in practice it does n't .
The overwhelming majority of overweight people just do n't have the willpower of sticking with such a diet .
There are exceptions , of course , but the fact is that the western world does a have HUGE ( sorry for the pun ) obesity problem .
Most of the overweight people do want to lose weight and are constantly trying to .
And failing .
Again and again .
In contrast , the Shangri - La diet , if it indeed works as advertised , makes losing weight pretty much automatic .
Say your weight is now 120 kilograms .
Soon after you start the Shangri - La diet , your body starts to think that your " target " weight is , say , 80 kilograms .
And it is damn hard to fight against your set point .
It is not as if you could consciously make yourself hungry .
If you do n't believe , ask those millions who have tried to lose weight but failed !
Shangri - La diet is , if you do n't mind computer programming terminology , somewhat orthogonal to aspects such as healthiness and exercise etc .
For millions and millions of people , too much weight itself is the most acute health problem .
Eliminate that , and you 've at least won one major problem .
Posted by : Jarno Virtanen | May 3 , 2006 5:34:32 AM
I love how thin people assume that all overweight people are eating crappy food .
I eat a great , whole - foods diet with good veggies , meats , fruits , nuts , and some dairy .
I have n't had an item with HFCS in years !
YEARS !
I do n't do sugar , flour , or corn syrup .
And I do n't OD on red meat ( maybe once a week or week and a half ) .
I eat salmon twice a week .
I have flax every morning for breakfast .
AND I work out for an hour every single day .
I run , mostly , or I do an aerobics video with weights .
I have put on five pounds when I already needed to lose 10 .
Due to some female issues , I am simply unable to lose weight .
I 've been stuck at this weight for a long , long time .
Tell me : what harm could it possibly do to add a tablespoon of sugar or oil a day to my healthy diet ?
Even if it is snake oil or mind over matter or placebo , there 's still no harm in it .
Because if your brain thinks it 's going to work , then , by golly , it probably will .
Gotta love the mind / body interchange .
Thanks for posting this .

My goodness !
By people 's reactions , it sounds like this diet is asking people to eat poison .
Look , it 's not even a " diet " : it 's a way to suppress your appetite so that you eat less , and it does so by aiming at a brain mechanism that associates eating more with tasty food .
With this approach , it does n't mean that you 'll be anorexic either , or that the appetite will totally disappear ( i.e. , you starve to death , obliviously ) .
If your weight becomes less than what you think it should be , cut back on this olive oil / sugar water stuff and get your appetite up a bit more .
If you have n't been able to lose weight , it 's because your intake of calories has been equal to your expenditure .
Suppress the appetite this way and you 'll eat less , take in fewer calories and lose weight .
The proof of the pudding is in the eating .
Or in this case , the proof of the pudding is in not necessarily wanting to eat the whole thing .
Posted by : Ray | May 3 , 2006 8:26:50 AM
I 'll try it .
I 'm not overweight but I have a layer of " thick skin " I 'd like to trim .
More intriguing to me is the idea that it suppresses the hunger feeling .
I * always * feel hungry .
I often feel so hungry it feels like I 'm starving .
Even if I do n't lose weight , if I stop feeling hungry this will be worth it .
I drink a lot of water and certainly have more than a 2 hour window of not consuming anything but water .

For the first time ever , scientists have observed and photographedwild gorillas using tools , in one instance employing a stick to testthe depth of a pool before wading into it , according to a study by the Bronx Zoo-based Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) and otherorganizations .
Up to this point , all other species of great apes , including chimpanzeesand orangutans , have been observed using tools in the wild , but nevergorillas .
" This is a truly astounding discovery , " said Thomas Breuer of the Wildlife Conservation Society .
" Tool usage in wild apes provides uswith valuable insights into the evolution of our own species and theabilities of other species .
Seeing it for the first time in gorillas isimportant on many different levels . "
According to the study published in the open access journal PLoS Biology , on two separate occasions in the northern rain forests ofthe Republic of Congo , researchers observed and photographed individualwestern gorillas using sticks as tools .
The observations were made inMbeli Bai - - a swampy clearing located in Nouabalé - NdokiNational Park where monitoring has been ongoing since February 1995 .
The first instance occurred when a female gorilla nicknamed Leah byscientists attempted to wade through a pool of water created byelephants , but found herself waist deep after only a few steps .
Climbing out of the pool , Leah then retrieved a straight branch from anearby dead tree and used it to test the depth of the water .
Keepingher upper body above water , she moved some 10 meters out into the poolbefore returning to shore and her wailing infant .
Then another female gorilla named Efi used a detached trunkto support herself with one hand while digging for herbs with theother .
As she moved from location to location , she used the stick forone last job , a bridge over a muddy patch of ground .
In the past , gorillas have been observed using tools in zoos , but not in the wild .
And , while most other observed instances oftool - usage in great apes are related directly to processing food ( i.e . the cracking of nuts with rocks or extracting termites with longsticks ) , these two examples of using tools for postural support weretriggered by other environmental factors .
The Wildlife Conservation Society has been studying gorillasand other wildlife in the Republic of Congo since the 1980s .
In 1993 , the Congolese Government , working in tandem with technical assistancefrom WCS , establishedNouabalé - Ndoki National Park .
The Mbeli Bai site is being managed to meet long - term gorilla research and ecotourism objectives .
" These protected areas are not only important for theconservation of species they contain , they also hold the key tocomparing our own development as a species with our next of kin , " added Breuer .
" Places likeNouabalé - Ndoki , and the nearby Goualougo Triangle , are places where we see the process unfolding before our very eyes . "
An exclusive look at this scientific discovery , includingnever - before - seen photographs and interviews in Africa with the fieldscientists who observed and documented the behavior for the first time , will be broadcast as the lead segment in the launch episode of " WildChronicles , " a brand new series airing nationally on PBS stationsbeginning October 1 , 2005 ( check local listings ) .
Hosted by BoydMatson , the weekly , half - hour , science and nature adventure TV serieswill be presented nationally by PBS member station WLIW New York .

Salary Salary
Topics including : Divulging salary history Entry - level salary Taking a cut Back to FAQ Categories Q " Divulging salary history "
I am in the process of looking for a new job .
One of the things I frequently see in various advertisements is a request for salary history .
I am hesitant to give out my salary history because I am looking for an increase in salary .
Also , I am not sure how to include salary history .
If I provide a prospective employer with this info , do I include it on my resume or in the cover letter ?
A
You 've brought up one of the more serious flaws in the Employment System .
Employers have no business asking for your salary history .
It 's confidential .
It has nothing to do with hiring you .
Imagine what they 'd say if you asked to see the history of salaries they 've paid for this job over the past ten years .
Or , if you were to ask the manager what his current salary is .
Sorry , Mr. Manager , but what 's good for the goose is good for the gander .
The excuse employers make is that your past salary helps them determine your experience level , it pegs your value , and it helps them establish a new salary for you .
Hogwash .
By that logic , they do n't need to interview you .
All they need is your salary history and you 're off to the races .
By using the figures other employers have used , they 'll know what their job is worth and what you are worth .
And they 'll win the lottery , too .
Salary is a judgment of value .
It 's incumbent on an employer to figure out what the job he wants done is worth , quite apart from who you are , what you 've done , or what you 've been paid before .
In the interview , the employer factors in his judgment of how you would contribute to the success of that job .
That 's how an offer should be derived .
It should n't matter what you were making at your last job , especially in a world where 17 - year - olds who were earning five bucks an hour flipping burgers last year are earning $ 40 k this year designing web pages , and where $ 100 k executives are seeking $ 50 k sales jobs .
Bottom line : when you divulge your salary history , you put yourself in a corner that 's very difficult to negotiate your way out of .

One problem with cameras is that you ca n’t trust the watchers not to misuse them :
Two council CCTV camera operators have been jailed for spying on a naked woman in her own home .
Mark Summerton and Kevin Judge , from Sefton Council , Merseyside , trained a street camera into the woman ’s flat .
[…]
The images from the camera , including the woman without her clothes on , were shown on a large plasma screen in the council ’s CCTV control room in November 2004 , Liverpool Crown Court heard .
Over several hours , she was filmed cuddling her boyfriend before undressing , using the toilet , having a bath and watching television dressed only in a towel .
Judge Gerald Clifton told the three men : “ To dismiss what was happening as laddish behaviour , something that the 21st Century apparently condones , is absurd .
“ You only have to read the impact statements of the lady to realise the harrowing effect that this had on her .
“ Her life has almost been ruined , her self - confidence entirely destroyed by the thought that prying male eyes have entered her flat . ”

You were killed yesterday Xmas a .m.. in Richmond , CA .
You were the coolest cabbie I ever met .
Plus you had icy cool Indian sapphire blue eyes .
You were impressed that an American chick like me could speak a little Hindi , and I always greeted you like " Sastree Kahl , keelahleeeey !!!!! "
You let me slide when I was a little short between paychecks , and I always tipped you well .
You told me that money meant nothing to you , and unlike most folks who say that , you meant it .
I remeber when you almost got a ticket by CHP for speeding to get me to BART on time , and when i gave the CHP guy a dirty look , he backed off of you , and did n't give you a ticket .
You said I was your good luck charm .
You went back to India to get your wife last summer .
I met her , and she was really sweet .
You used to wait to make sure that I made it in the house safely .
when I sent you to pick up friends of mine , my friends told me that you spoke highly of me , and you told them what a good person I was .
Maybe this note means nothing to anybody else reading this , but you did n't deserve to die like that .
Shot in the shithole streets of Richmond for a few dollars .
all you went thru to get to this country for a better life , and you died like a dog in the streets of the ghetto .
At the hands of two young women , no less .
Goodbye , my friend .
You will be missed .

Great business ideas often come from strange places , but no one expects to find one at the bottom of a river .
Yet that 's what happened to George Goodwin .
When he went fishing in shallow Florida riverbeds during the early 1970s , Goodwin often caught more logs than bass .
" I used to snag my lures on them , " he remembers .
Most fishermen would have cursed their luck ; Goodwin , now 59 , reeled in a multi-million - dollar business instead .
What Goodwin found are known as deadhead logs .
In the 1800s loggers felled centuries - old cypress and pine throughout the South for use in construction .
They would float the logs downstream to the nearest mill , but often the heaviest logs -- those filled with the most resin-- sank to the muddy riverbed .
At a time when the South was blanketed by tens of millions of acres of untouched forest , it was n't much of a loss .
But today overharvesting has reduced that old - growth forest to just 5,000 to 10,000 acres , most of it protected , and the logs once lost to the rivers have newfound value .
As Goodwin got interested in logs , he discovered that , although the outside decomposes after being underwater for nearly a century , resin keeps the inside perfectly preserved .
Prized for flooring and paneling , this interior wood is known as " heart pine " and " heart cypress . "
Goodwin spent $ 105,500 - - his entire savings -- to purchase 20 acres of land in Micanopy , Fla. , ten miles south of Gainesville , and move an old sawmill to the property , where he and his wife , Carol , the company 's 59 - year - old vice president , live and work .
They pay divers $ 2 to $ 3 per board foot of wood in the logs recovered from Florida riverbeds .
Then they clean up the logs and mill them into flooring that sells for $ 5 to $ 20 a foot .
Carol estimates that the demand for antique wood has risen tenfold in the past decade , thanks to the housing boom and changing tastes .
That has sent the company 's annual revenue on a steady climb , from $ 5,000 in 1977 to $ 3 million in 2004 .
By last year their company had 25 employees and enough cash flow to take out a $ 140,000 loan to build a 15,000 - square - foot warehouse for the nearly two million board feet of wood it has in inventory .
That saved a lot of aggravation when several hurricanes tore through the area just months after the building had been completed .
( The Goodwins were unaffected by Katrina and Wilma . )
Had the logs been soaked , the company would have had to spend months drying them out .
Goodwin Heart Pine has supplied flooring for the homes of celebrities such as Paul McCartney , Morgan Freeman , and Ted Turner .
The wood is also popular for historical sites , including the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum in Key West , Fla .
Six years ago the termite - infested flooring in the 150 - year - old structure needed replacing .
" Goodwin flooring was the closest to what Hemingway had originally , " says Hemingway Home event director Linda Mendez .
The growing popularity of antique wood , however , has more would - be entrepreneurs flocking to the business , not all with the best intentions .
" There 's a joke in the South that anyone with a pickup sells a little bit of heart pine , " says Carol Goodwin .
" But you never know what you 're getting . "
Because there are no up - to - date guidelines on what constitutes heart pine -- the most recent standards were published in 1924 - - unwitting customers may purchase heart pine from younger trees , which is not nearly as dense and durable as what the Goodwins sell .
When a hurricane knocks down any of the remaining old - growth forest -- as happened last year -- the Goodwins often buy that wood .
They also buy and resell antique heart pine salvaged from old barns and buildings .
Branching out from flooring , George and a local cabinet - maker have teamed up to craft and sell a line of wood furniture .
In July the Goodwins opened a showroom in Palm Coast , Fla. , for both their furniture and flooring .
While George Goodwin jokes that " cashing the checks " is one of his favorite parts of the business , he loves the other parts more than he lets on .
" If George had $ 1 million in the bank , he 'd just go and buy more wood , " says Carol , laughing .

With so many existing companies looking to expand their reach into the automobile market , when the call went out for an electric ...
I was reading the May issue of Fortune Small Business , when I stumbled upon a great article .
Inspired by TiVo , one company decided to create a device that cuts your electricity bill by 10 - 15 % .
How do they do it ?
Simple .
Utility companies charge you different rates , depending on the day and time that electricity is consumed .
The cheapest rate is at 3 AM ( no wonder ) .
So this device accumulates electricity when it ’s cheap and then releases it during peak hours , when the rates are much higher .
Brilliant , is n’t it ?
Here is more from that article .
" Our product will allow customers to trim their bills painlessly , " says CEO Peter Corsell .
" Think of it as a kind of TiVo for electricity . "
The device , called GridPoint Protect , is the size of a small file cabinet and connects to the circuitbreaker panel .
( The company also offers a lower - capacity version designed for homes , which costs $ 10,000 . )
A built - in computer powered by a Pentium chip will make intelligent purchase decisions , buying when prices are low , then storing the electricity for later use .
That will make it possible to run your company during the workday with cheaper electricity that you purchased at 3 A .M .
Corsell , 28 , estimates that his device will shave a business 's electric bill by about 15 % .
Assuming monthly charges of $ 2,500 , the system would pay for itself in less than four years .
GridPoint Protect offers a second function : Because it stores electricity , it can double as a backup generator that is safer and faster than many models currently available .
Standard generators run on gas or diesel , and their carbon - monoxide exhaust fumes can be dangerous .
By contrast , GridPoint Protect uses safer gel - style batteries , similar to those that back up cellphone towers .
Standard generators also take a few seconds to power up , but GridPoint Protect kicks in within about 30 milliseconds , fast enough to prevent a company 's computers or other sensitive devices from crashing .
Founded in 2003 , GridPoint has raised $ 18 million from venture capital firms and private investors and now employs a staff of 50 , with no revenues until it sold its first units this spring .
The company features an all - star board of advisors , including tech guru Esther Dyson and Bill Bradley , the former presidential candidate and longtime member of the Senate Energy Committee .
" It 's a smart company , focused on a couple of regions where there 's a real need in the marketplace , " says Daniel Violette , a Boulder energy consultant .
Picture it - one day soon you might be at a cocktail party and encounter someone bragging not about his hot stock picks but about how much he saved on his electric bill .

The Flying Spaghetti Monster Hat
The Pope has a special hat .
Rabbis have special hats .
Rastafarians have special hats .
Why not Pastafarians ?
This hat is crocheted ( I assume you could knit something similar ) .
Unfortunately , I do n't how to write patterns -- my grandma taught me how to crochet in a rather freeform manner ( she also made the best spaghetti and meatballs , EVER - coincidence ? ) .
So here 's a very rough guide :
INGREDIENTS
Body of hat : 2 balls Lion Brand Wool - Ease in Fisherman 99
Spaghetti tendrils & trim : 1 ball of fluffy Lion Brand Chenille in Antique White
Eyeballs : a little bit of any old white yarn
Meatballs : 1 ball Caron " Jewel Box " in Rubellite 0028 .
This is the most meatballistic yarn I could find .

Mr. McNeill , one of the first mentors to sign on , draws from his own experience .
His father died when he was 6 years old , and at 21 , he was co-manager of the family grain elevator business and farm operations in Thomas , Okla .
Currently , a managing partner in SPP Mezzanine Funding , Mr. McNeill works with students from Suitland High School .
The best part of being a mentor , he said , is watching the students gain the self - confidence and poise to run their own business .
Across the nation , there has been increasing interest among young people in running their own businesses .
" The nation 's youth are looking at entrepreneurship as a major alternative career as they are being shut out of a shrinking job market in inner cities , " said Carl J. Schramm , president and chief executive of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation .
Marie Harrison , 15 , lives in a violence - ridden section of the Mission District of San Francisco where she struggles to get by as she cares for her 71 - year - old grandmother , Maria , who recently suffered a stroke .
Marie monitors her grandmother 's blood pressure and helps prepares her food .
She also helps raise her 12 - year - old sister , Megan , as well as attend Immaculate Conception Academy .
Marie has lived with her grandmother , who is her legal guardian , on the same block since she was just over a year old .
" The area where I live is n't safe .
There 's lots of drug and gang violence , " she said .
Last July , her cousin David was hit by a stray bullet .
Every Saturday , she said , she looks forward to attending a sewing and fashion program sponsored by the Turning Heads Project , which helps poor young people in San Francisco become more economically self - sufficient .
" Marie gained a lot of self - confidence and new skills attending our sewing and fashion programs and learning entrepreneurship , " said Jane Segal , her mentor and director for special projects .
Marie said , " We make pillows , skirts and purses in class . "
Piecing together fabrics donated by the Turning Heads Project , Marie fashioned her own prom dress .
" One of my high school friends bought one of my creations for $ 40 , " Marie said in a telephone interview .
" I 'm saving the money for college .
One day I would like to become a designer and own my own business . "
One of her Turning Heads classmates , Patrice Moananu , 15 , also lives with her grandmother , as well as five sisters in public housing in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco .
" I work as a youth intern at my school almost every day to help with the family finances , " Patrice said .
" I 've attended the Turning Heads fashion and sewing program for about a year , where I learned about starting my own business .
At first I was n't good at sewing , but the class has given me a new skill and new self - confidence . "
That was 30 years ago , but in time measured out by the psyche it was yesterday .
Thank God such things are now illegal .
But there remain those determined to turn back the clock .
" We are told that in England it is a crime to spank children , " writes Debbi Pearl from No Greater Joy Ministries , following a row that has erupted over the distribution of their literature in the UK .
" Therefore Christians are not able to openly obey God in regard to biblical chastisement .
They are in danger of having the state steal their children . "
The Pearls are evangelical Christians who believe corporal punishment is " doing it God 's way " .
With a mailing list of tens of thousands of parents , the Pearls say that the justification for their approach is in scripture : " He that spareth his rod hateth his son : but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes " ( Proverbs 13:24 ) .
Chastening begins early .
" For the under - one - year - old , a little , 10 - to 12 - inch long , willowy branch ( stripped of any knots that might break the skin ) about one - eighth inch diameter is sufficient , " writes Michael Pearl .
With older children he advises : " After a short explanation about bad attitudes and the need to love , patiently and calmly apply the rod to his backside .
Somehow , after eight or 10 licks , the poison is transformed into gushing love and contentment .
The world becomes a beautiful place .
A brand - new child emerges .
It makes an adult stare at the rod in wonder , trying to see what magic is contained therein . "
It 's incredible to me that books such as this are readily available on Amazon ; it is little short of incitement to child abuse .
What makes the whole thing doubly sick is that it 's done in the name of God .
Apparently , the " proper application of the rod is essential to the Christian world - view " .
Note " essential " .
Perhaps it should n't come as a surprise .
For , as evangelicals , the Pearls believe that salvation only comes through punishment and pain .
God punishes his Son with crucifixion so that humanity might not have to face the Father 's anger .
This image of God the father , for whom violence is an expression of tough love , is lodged deep in the evangelical imagination .
And it twists a religion of forgiveness and compassion into something dark and cruel .
It 's terrifying how deep this teaching penetrates into a philosophy of child rearing .
Just as divine anger is deemed to be provoked by the original sin of human disobedience , the beating of children is seen as punishment for rebellion .
According to Ted Tripp , in his monstrous bestseller Shepherding a Child 's Heart , even babies who struggle while having their nappy changed are deemed to be rebellious and need punishment .
Last month Lynn Paddock of North Carolina was charged with the murder of her four - year - old son , Sean .
She had apparently beaten him with a length of quarter - inch plumbing line - plastic tubing .
Like many in her church , Paddock had turned to the Pearls ' resources on Biblical parenting .
The Pearls say chastisement with plumbing line is " a real attention getter " .
Sean Paddock 's autopsy describes layers of bruises stretching from his bottom to his shoulder .
What Jesus said about those who would harm children comes inevitably to mind : " It would be better for them if a millstone was hanged about their neck , and that they were drowned in the depth of the sea . "

When is lying illegal ?
That 's a fundamental question in any system of laws .
If you and I agree that you 'll give me a dollar , and in return I 'll give you two back later , we have a contract .
If I skip town , I have committed a crime : fraud .
It 's the most basic of crimes , and simply boils down to lying .
Of course , there are a thousand ways to lie and be nothing more than a cad .
If I tell you I 'm a lousy pool player , we bet a dollar on a game , and it turns out I 'm better than you , you 're a sucker , I 'm a con artist , and there 's been no crime .
Yes , I misrepresented myself , but it was a matter of judgment , not fact .
And there are plenty of cases where lying is a sanctioned risk .
If we play a poker tournament -- a legally constructed one , regulated by our fine system of government -- it 's not only acceptable to lie , it 's expected .
The card player who fails to lie effectively will almost always lose .
It 's a condition of the game .
Consider if you will , Eve Online .
Last , week , Dentara Rast -- a character in CCP 's Eve Online massively multiplayer online world -- pulled off an impressive stunt .
He ran a classic Ponzi scheme and walked off with 700 billion ISK ( in game money , and quite a lot of it ) .
Normally , this kind of in - game bravado would generate nothing but a confuse stare from someone not deep inside the Eve universe , and little more than scandal - of - the - week titillation and subsequent yawns there .
But I believe this case is more interesting than that .
I believe Dentara Rast committed fraud .
I believe he owes the IRS a lot of money .
Admittedly these are bold statements likely stuffed with straw , but they have deep implications , and bear argument .
The Scene of the Crime
Eve Online is a unique persistent world .
It 's the only successful , long term Science Fiction world .
Science Fiction is hard .
As our friends - in - spirit at 2d6 feet posited recently , it 's harder because of the details .
Fantasy worlds have extensive shorthand .
Toss me into a quasi - medieval setting , tell me there are elves and magic , and I 've got a whole library in my head to fill in the blanks .
But in a science fiction world , you need to tell me a LOT more .
Are there aliens ?
What do they look like ?
What 's the technology do ?
What does a spaceship look like , and how does it work ?
What are the moral codes and motivations ?
Is there money ?
It 's a real question .
The two largest competing SF universes have radically different answers .
Star Wars ' Han Solo works for cash .
We see him loading the Millennium Falcon with crates of the stuff .
His world is filled with the crimes of acquisition .
Star Trek 's James .
T Kirk lives in a universe that grew beyond the need for commerce .
It 's never explained in great detail , but some sort of vast communism or invisible spirit guides the known worlds of the Federation .
Eve takes the Star Wars route .
Money is n't only important , it 's everything .
Piracy and scheming drive most of the Player - vs - Player ( PVP ) interactions , and PvP is what Eve is all about .
Eve embraces capitalism in a way that goes far beyond the auction houses and crafting of World of Warcraft .
Eve embeds the idea of a corporation into the roots of the game .
A corporation , by definition , is an entity created to act like an individual person in a marketplace .
Anywhere from one to an infinite number of biological individuals create a commune of ownership , and drive that new fictional individual towards a common goal .
In Eve , corporations are formed , engage in exploration , exploitation and extermination in the pursuit of wealth for their members .
Thanks to the efforts of a dedicated community , corporations can create initial public offerings to grab new investors .
Most often these public corporations are formed to pool the capital required to purchase the blueprints for the games most powerful ships .
These blueprints can then be copied and sold , generating cash for dividends .
Shares can be traded on the open market , portfolios managed , speculations made .
This user - controlled market is entirely unregulated .
Eve is a pocket universe for students of unfettered capitalism .
As one would expect , there are good actors and bad actors .
And it 's the bad actors that are interesting .
Financial scams have an easy time of it in Eve .
Anything beyond a simple purchase involves a transfer of wealth between players .
Someone has to give a real person in - game cash to buy something -- in this case shares in a corporation .
And once that money 's sitting in the corporate account , the CEO can just transfer that wealth to an alternate character , and disappear .
There is no SEC to go after the bad guy .
There is no court in which to make an accusation and seek recompense .
CCP is well aware that they have created a world where bad actors can thrive .
Their own FAQ makes this clear :
" A scam is the act of obtaining goods from other players through misinformation , confusion , pressure or by taking advantage of basic trust .
Players enter into business dealings with others at their own risk and are strongly urged to exercise good judgment and common sense when trading .
Scams that relate to issues such as password scams or account theft scams are more serious and will result in an immediate ban . "
The Offense
But if you 're playing for fame , not just fortune , you need to put on a show .
This is where Dentara Rask made good theater .
His scheme was interesting , but unoriginal .
He ran the EVE Investment Bank , in which he promised a return on deposits .
And he delivered .
If you got in early , he paid you your return , and most likely , you reinvested .
It was , of course , just a Ponzi scheme .
Investors were paid out of the capital from new investors .
When the pyramid become too big to manage , he pulled back the curtain and proclaimed himself the victor .
He 'd amassed more than 700 billion ISK ( in game cash ) , perhaps 10 times the previous record for a market scam .
He gloated in the forums about his prowess .
He basked in the glory of hatred , even posting a video confession complete with I 'd - like - to - thank - the - academy antics .
He took out a bounty on his own head , so people would hunt him down .
The act of me writing about this plays further into the ego trip .
But there 's a catch .
What if he committed a real crime ?
If this was a " real world " scam , few would argue that this was fraud .
In the US ( and we do n't know where he lives ) he would mostly likely be guilty of racketeering under RICO .
The first argument against the fraud case is one of substance .
After all , this was imaginary money , right ?
Not really .
Eve ISK is a fungible asset .
While no regulated market exists for converting ISK into cash directly , there are markets available .
CCP sells 30 day time cards for 120 million ISK .
Time cards are available legally for $ 14 a piece .
So the implied value of an ISK is roughly $ 1.17E - 07 .
Put another way , that 700 billion ISK is worth 5,834 time cards , or $ 81,667 .
( A figure worthy of note , as it bumps the value up into the realm of the money laundering -- a swiss - army - knife - meets - sledgehammer of a law if ever there was one . )
The second argument is that somehow this path of conversion is illegal , and thus in itself not a crime .
This is spurious : fraud does not require the underlying transaction to be in legal goods .
If I bilk you on a drug deal , I still committed fraud , I 'll just never sue you for it .
The third argument is that according to the EULA for the game , CCP retains ownership of all in game assets .
Note that this is not a law , this is an agreement between CCP and an individual player , and I do n't believe it frankly matters what CCP claims , as long as the market exists to convert the in game assets into real world assets ( which it clearly does ) .
CCP can ban you for it , they could even sue you for copyright violation , but none of this matters to the fraud argument .
The last remaining argument is that of poker : implied consent .
Did the players who lost money to Dentara Rast enter into the transaction with an implied consent to be deceived as part of the game ?
Honestly , I do n't think there 's a clear cut answer .
Certainly , CCP admits that scams can happen as part of the game .
They denounce them in public forums , but they also make it clear that whether they do anything about them is a decision they will make on a case by case basis .
They have , in the past , made victims whole .
This is clearly different than a poker bluff -- I do n't believe that the Bellagio has ever given a penny back to a loser at their poker tables .
At least not me .
My opinion ( and no , I 'm not a lawyer ) -- there 's at least a case for fraud .
The Punishment
The second major issue here is taxation .
Taxing in - game earnings is n't remotely a new idea , and a bevy of academics are already front - running the IRS .
The logic is simple in concept ( if complex in application ) .
Dentara has acquired wealth – as clearly as Al Capone acquired wealth in his bank accounts and rum-running operations .
The IRS does n't particularly care if that wealth is US currency or not ( Topic 140 ) .
If I work for a company who pays me in gold bars or candy bars , I still got paid , and I still owe taxes .
Remember , the IRS did threaten to assess whomever caught McGuire 's 62nd home run ball , and it took the White House to calm them down .
The fact that this wealth , if converted into US dollars , would crash the real - world market for ISK or game time cards is also irrelevant -- just ask anyone who excercised a non-qualified stock options at the end of the dotcom boom .
The alternative minimum tax caused people to sell their houses to pay taxes on worthless stock .
Dentara 's only real defense would be one of recognition .
If he hangs onto the ISK , never converting them into a more tangible asset , he could argue that he had not yet realized any gain or income on which he could be taxed .
He would argue that -- at most -- he had a taxable gain on the difference between his investment ( the amount he has paid to CCP as an Eve Online customer ) and his return ( the $ 81,666 ) , and as a capital gain , it should n't be payable until the asset is sold .
He might win that argument .
And should he choose never to sell on the open market or convert into game time cards , he might avoid all taxes .
The reality is that the IRS has remained relatively silent on the issue of in - game earnings , but I do n't expect that to last long .
He might , in fact , owe the IRS $ 12,250 .
Or , if the IRS was feeling particularly frisky , they might see this as self - employment income and hit him up for $ 15,077 ( assuming he 's otherwise unemployed ) .
How are these two issues connected : fraud and taxation ?
While the IRS has so far declined to pursue virtual earnings , they 've been known to be spurred into action when faced with criminal activity outside the realm of tax evasion .
Frank Wilson only grabbed on to Al Capone 's leg after the FBI was unable to bring him down on prohibition charges .
If Dentara was actually pursued under RICO , the FBI might be inclined to use the tax - hammer once again , as rounding up injured parties to testify in a fraud case could be exceptionally difficult .
And once the FBI walks into the room , everyone pays attention -- not just Business Week and Terra Nova .
Imagine a world where this happens .
Where someone drops the dime on Dentara Rask ( hey , there is a 15 % bounty on tax evaders ) , and he has to cough up the dough .
Imagine the implications .
Whole genres of gaming now become taxable activities .
Does Blizzard establish two sets of servers : one where you can transfer accounts and assets , one where you can't ?
Does over - the - air television start generating an implied receipt of a good , and thus trigger a gift tax ?
Can a hacker who downs your server now be the subject of a class action suit for all those " workers " denied their place of employment ?
Do I owe someone money because I listen to Pandora all day long and have never paid a dime ?
And what if Dentara Rast is underage ?
Has CCP somehow violated child labor laws ?
It does n't really matter , the IRS will still want their pound of flesh .
The tax man must be paid .
The going rate in my neighborhood is $ 20 for a small front lawn by a entrepreneurial teenager .
Best case , this kid's got 612 lawns to go .
A metal rod protrudes through the skin
The breakthrough , developed by researchers at University College London , allows the prosthesis to breach the skin without risk of infection .
The team says early clinical trials have been " very promising " .
It hopes the work - which is to be published in the Journal of Anatomy - may help survivors of the 7 July bombings , as well as other amputees .
The work paves the way for bionic limbs which are controlled by the central nervous system .
In the deer antlers it is very much to do with the structure and shape of the bone , and the porosity of the bone
Dr Paul Unwin
The metal implant passes through the skin and the artificial limb can be directly attached to it .
Currently , artificial limbs are fixed or strapped to an amputee 's stump .
Risk of infection , which could be caused by bacteria passing from the external limb through the rod to the bone , is avoided because the skin tissue meshes around the rod to form a seal .
Deer antlers
To work out how to attach live tissue directly to metal , the scientists from the Centre for Biomedical Engineering , UCL , led by Professor Gordon Blunn and Dr Catherine Pendegrass , looked at how deers ' antlers can grow through the animals ' skin without infection .
The scientists based their design on the bone in a deer 's antlers
Dr Paul Unwin , managing director of Stanmore Implants Worldwide , a medical devices company that worked in collaboration with the scientists , said : " The mobility of tissue is a big factor ; you do n't want the tissue to rip away from the piece of metal , so you need a structure under the skin that will allow the dermal tissues to attach into the metal .
" What we had seen in the deer antlers was that it is very much to do with the structure and shape of the bone , and the porosity of the bone .
" The tissue attaches in with long fibres , and it is like anchors attaching directly into it . "
He said that early clinical trials , which had taken place at Mount Vernon Hospital , Middlesex , on a small group of patients who had lost fingers or thumbs had been very encouraging .
The next stage , he added , would be to carry out trials on upper and lower limb replacements .
He said he expected victims of last year 's London bombing attacks who lost limbs to be involved .
He said that the technology could be widely used for thumb and forefingers in a few years , and upper and lower limb replacements using this method could be in place in five years .
Zafar Khan , chairman of the Limbless Association , said : " As an amputee , residual limbs are currently inserted into a socket , to which a prosthetic limb is attached .
" And when you walk or use the limb there is a movement and that causes rubbing and pressure sores .
The real benefit is that would not happen with this new technique .
" But on the downside , I would still be worried about infection . "

The origin of ' My bad '
The best evidence obtainable at present points to Manute Bol ( above ) , the 7 ' 7 " Sudanese NBA player whose native tongue was Dinka , as the inventor , sometime in the 1980s , of this now–ubiquitous phrase .
Geoffrey K. Pullum told the story in his December 7 , 2005 blog post .
Here is the relevant portion : Ken Arneson emailed me to say that he heard the phrase was first used by the Sudanese immigrant basketball player Manute Bol , believed to have been a native speaker of Dinka ( a very interesting and thoroughly un-Indo - Europeanlike language of the Nilo - Saharan superfamily ) .
Says Arneson , " I first heard the phrase here in the Bay Area when Bol joined the Golden State Warriors in 1988 , when several Warriors players started using the phrase . "
And Ben Zimmer 's rummaging in the newspaper files down in the basement of Language Log Plaza produced a couple of early 1989 quotes that confirm this convincingly : St. Louis Post - Dispatch , Jan. 10 , 1989 : When he [ Manute Bol ] throws a bad pass , he 'll say , " My bad " instead of " My fault , " and now all the other players say the same thing .
USA Today , Jan. 27 , 1989 : After making a bad pass , instead of saying " my fault , " Manute Bol says , " my bad . "
Now all the other Warriors say it too .
So all of this is compatible with a date of origin for the phrase in the early 1980s ( Manute Bol first joined the NBA in 1985 but came to the USA before that , around 1980 ) .
Professor Ron McClamrock of the Philosophy Department at SUNY
Albany tells me he recalls very definitely hearing the phrase on the basketball court when he was in graduate school at MIT in the early 1980s , so the news stories above could be picking the story up rather late ; but it is still just possible that Manute Bol was the originator , because he played for Cleveland State and Bridgeport University in the early 1980s , and his neologism just could have spread from there to other schools in the northeast , such as MIT .

Dear Author ,
I uttered this phrase in 1974 to a friend of mine .
My tongue got twisted when I mean't to say , " my fault " for a bad move .
I take the credit for beginning this phrase .
I knew it would take off because my friend Barry continued to say it .

This came up today in a conversation and a couple of the older guys said that they used to say it in their high school basketball teams here in North Carolina back in the 70's .
I have a suspicion the origin goes back further than that .
Wish I had a source , but you might look back further than you had been .

Case By Kevin Wolf , AP AOL founder is " sorry " for Time Warner merger NEW YORK ( Reuters )  Steve Case , co-founder of the one - time biggest online service AOL , apologized for the company 's merger with media conglomerate Time Warner ( TWX ) in an interview with journalist Charlie Rose .
In the interview broadcast on Friday , Case , who was shoved aside as chairman in 2003 and who left the board entirely in 2005 , said , " Yes , I 'm sorry I did it , " referring to the 2001 merger of Time Warner and AOL .
The deal , known as one of the worst corporate mergers in history , destroyed approximately $ 200 billion in shareholder value .
Last October , Case argued in a Washington Post article that AOL should be split from Time Warner , echoing sentiments shared by billionaire investor Carl Icahn , who earlier this year sought to break up the world 's largest media company to boost shareholder value .
Although Case called the deal 's aftermath a " disappointment , " he said he still believed it was " a good idea , " according to the interview with Rose .
" I 'm disappointed and frustrated that it has n't developed in the way that we all hoped at the time it could , " Case told Rose .
Time Warner is expected to discuss a new strategy for AOL on Aug. 2 , after it reports its second - quarter financial statement .
Sources have said the company is exploring a plan to give away AOL services for free to users who already have Internet connection but it does not plan to give away dial - up Internet service .

One in 10 Britons suffer migraines
Studies have indicated a strong link between migraine with aura - the type associated with bright flashing lights - and a hole in the heart .
Scientists found repair of the defect cut the severity of migraine attacks by 37 % .
Details of the study , led by doctors in London and Shrewsbury , were presented to the American College of Cardiology .
PATENT FORAMEN OVALE
A flap or valve - like opening in the wall between the two upper ( atrial ) chambers of the heart
It is frequently found before birth , but seals shut in about 80 % of people
When pressure is created inside the chest - for instance by coughing - the flap can open , allowing blood to flow in either direction
This can allow blood to bypass the filtering system of the lungs
If debris is present in the blood , such as small blood clots , it can pass through the left atrium and lodge in the brain , causing a stroke
Around one in ten in the UK suffer from migraines - more than diabetes , asthma and epilepsy combined .
A migraine is a severe headache often accompanied by bright flashing lights in front of the eyes and long periods of sickness .
There is currently no cure for the condition .
Some sufferers struggle by with available drug treatments , but for many it seriously affects their ability to live a normal life .
Unfiltered blood
A hole in the heart , known technically as a patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) , is a minor defect in the wall that separates the two upper chambers of the heart , the atria .
In most cases it causes no health problems , but can , in a small minority of people , lead to a stroke .
It has changed my life dramatically
Zoe Willows
It is also thought that failure completely to filter the blood of impurities in the normal way may result in migraines .
The link was in part discovered after work on divers , who are more susceptible to decompression sickness - the bends - if they have a PFO .
Several who had the heart problem fixed , also found their migraines got better .
The latest study screened 432 migraine with aura patients , and found 24 % had a moderate or large PFO - six times greater than the number found in the general population .
Six months after the procedure to repair the defect , patients reported a 37 % reduction in migraine burden - calculated by multiplying the number of headaches by their length .
In patients who underwent a sham procedure the reduction was just 17 % .
The researchers had hoped to achieve a 40 % reduction - but argue the results are still significant .
Better life
Dr Andrew Dowson , of King 's College Hospital , London , one of the lead researchers , said : " For the first time we can see trends in a prospective study to suggest that PFO closure may be an effective way to treat certain types of migraine .
" A reduction in headache burden for a patient with severe migraine may allow that individual to gain more control and lead a more fulfilling and productive life .
" The key now will be establishing the criteria that will help to determine which patients should be referred to the interventional cardiologist for further treatment . "
Anne Turner , of the Migraine Awareness Association , said : " Migraine is a very individual condition and although we 've got lots of effective treatments available , it is very much a matter of trial and error to find the one that works for you .
" This study has opened a whole new avenue which may provide a potential answer for some people . "
Dramatic improvement
Zoe Willows , 29 , from Reading , took part in the trial .
She used to have five or six severe migraine attacks each month during which she would experience numbness down one side of her body , blurred vision , and an inability to speak as well as an intense headache .
Since the procedure last July to close the hole in her heart Zoe has only had one migraine attack - coming out of the operating theatre immediately after the procedure was completed .
She said : " It has changed my life dramatically .
I have got so much more energy . "

An Originalist Argument Against Rigid Originalism Brian Tamanaha James Madison wrote in Federalist 14 :
Is it not the glory of the people of America , that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations , they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity , for custom , or for names , to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense , the knowledge of their own situation , and the lessons of their own experience ?
Madison was not presenting a theory of consitutional interpretation in this passage ; rather , he was making a more general observation about the entire constitutional design .
On originalist terms , it is fair [ and perhaps required ] to ask whether a person who wrote these words would have signed up for a theory of interpretation , like Scalia 's original meaning theory , if the result of such a theory would be a " veneration for antiquity ... [ or ] names " that would " overrule the suggestions of [ our ] own good sense , the knowledge of our situation , and the lessons of [ our ] own experience " ?
What would Jefferson -- who repeated that the world belongs to the living and not the dead -- have thought about a theory of interpretation that directs us to search through two century old texts to divine answers to questions they never conceived of or entertained ?
Interestingly -- and once again demonstrating that originalist theories can operate at various levels of abstraction -- this way of framing the issue shifts the question away from an inquiry into Madison 's specific theory of how a written Constitution should be interpreted .
Instead , it poses the more general question of whether Madison would have endorsed a particular original meaning theory of interpretation if , in practice ( given the reality of the extreme difficulty and rarity of amending the constitution ) , it would commit our constitutional system to a decision - making process that relies upon old and spotty sources to trump our present knowledge and experience .
As Jack points out in his detailed posts on the subject , no one engaged in this discussion denies that the Constitution is binding law .
The dispute is over how the language of that binding text should be interpreted .
Relying upon the above quote ( and other ideas circulating at the time , which can be found in Bailyn , To Begin the World Anew ) , my sense is that Madison ( to invoke a venerated " name " ) would be on Jack 's side , at least on the core proposition that the Constitution is a legal document for our time and should be interpreted as such .
I 'm not a constitional theorist or a historian -- so I 'll duck now and get out of the way .

The legendary computer game Sim City has been used as the basis for a new programme which is being used to project what the world 's cities will look like in the future .
Gaming technology is being used by urban planners globally
MetroQuest , a piece of software put together by Canadian developers Envision , allows the users to input the decisions that are being made by city planners and see how these areas will change over the next 40 years .
They can also manipulate various factors and explore " what if " future scenarios for their community .
Envision 's co-founder Dave Biggs told BBC News that Sim City was very much the inspiration for the software , which has been in development for 15 years - virtually since the release of the original game .
" We thought if we can just get a fraction of the excitement that people have playing Sim City - but use real information , with real data , from real cities - then we could actually mobilise a huge amount of people , " he said .
" We used the idea of Sim City to develop a process where the community can play games with their own future and see the consequences . "
Manchester 's ' doughnut '
The software works by allowing the user to alter certain aspects of their city , such as poplulation location , urban density , and transport - much as the original game did .
Users can then see the effect of their decisions 40 years down the line , both on a satellite - view map and in a graphical display .
One of the places to put it to practical use has been Manchester , in the north of England .
USERS CAN ALTER : Population location Job location Housing density Roads v transit Transport policy Energy and air quality Water conservation Reduce and recycle Population and economy
Metro Quest worked in partnership with Manchester University 's Urban Planning Department to study the whole of the north - west , looking at alternative scenarios for the region .
Mr Biggs said a conversation had been developed with people in the area about the evolution of the region , after the software showed the " doughnut - like " effect of cities emptying out as more people move to surburbs .
" They 're now looking for ways to re-invigorate the downtown areas to try to curb some of this sprawl that 's happening , " he added .
The software has also been used with planners in Bali , Indonesia - where it showed the island was heading for serious trouble .
The island 's tourism - based economy is so linked to its environment " that they 're inseperable " - but the environment was under serious strain , the programme showed .
" When we went there , we discovered that they were reaching their carrying capacity on so many sustainability issues - overcrowded streets , congested arteries , brownouts for electricity on a regular basis , and at their capacity for water supply , " Mr Biggs said .
" Their plans were as simplistic as trying to increase the economic growth by expanding the airport .
" So by running some scenarios with them , they really woke up to the fact that their entire economy was being compromised , because tourists were having an unpleasant experience because of the rapid growth . "
Unlimited cash
Similarly , the Canadian ski resort of Whistler switched its tourism strategy after using the tool .
Planners had been looking at further enhancing winter tourism , until the model showed the potentially devastating effects of " continuing to build up the hillside " .
Now the resort is focusing instead on attracting more visitors during the quieter summer months .
" Their plans changed right where we got involved , " Mr Biggs added .
However , a demonstration of the tool at the World Urban Forum showed one of the limitations of the tool , which is that , unlike in the real world - and , indeed , unlike in Sim City - money is unlimited .
Given the options , the sustainability experts using MetroQuest invariably selected to go for the expensive " best practices " - which made the city much more sound , but are options perhaps beyond the budget of the average city mayor .
However , Mr Biggs explained that when the tool is used by people other than the gathered for the demonstraton , people are much more cautious .
" Sustainable development cannot be defined academically - it is defined by the people living in the community , " he said .
The other drawback of MetroQuest , of course , is that when you get bored of it , there is no option of unleashing a giant green monster across your city .
Brad Pitt is reportedly furious his mother is talking to his ex-wife , Jennifer Aniston .
The ' Troy ' star 's brother Doug alleges Pitt - who is expecting a baby with new love , Angelina Jolie - thinks she is being " unfair and unjust " for staying touch with the former ' Friends ' actress .
He revealed to Britain 's Star magazine : " Brad is not happy about mum talking to Jennifer .
" He feels that mum should move on now and cut the link that was there .
" But mum is in a difficult position - she has great affection for Jennifer , born out of the fact that Brad once loved her and did marry her . "

The single most basic fallacy underlying the present American catastrophe in Iraq is the belief that the U.S. can somehow solve that country 's problems , however extreme and intractable they may seem ; that , in short , we are part of the solution in Iraq , not part of the problem .
Once you 're thinking that way , it 's always a matter of setting the latest incorrect or inept tactics right , or of changing a policy that has been incompetently put into operation by unprepared administrators wielding too few resources too poorly .
But the belief in the power of the United States to solve problems for others -- by force -- reflects a deep - seated imperial mind - set that exists not just in the Bush administration , but among its mainstream critics as well .
You can see it everywhere , if you care to look .
You can note it in the way , as things continue to devolve in Iraq , the military and its various internal critics have been bobbing and weaving from one set of counterproductive counterinsurgency tactics to another ( each time claiming that the previous set had somehow overlooked basic insurgency doctrine or the lessons of Vietnam ) .
The latest of these is a modified version of the old ( failed ) Vietnam " ink blot " strategy in which we pull troops back to Baghdad , a city now evidently in utter , violent disarray , to nail down at least some of the capital 's neighborhoods ( while denuding troop strength in areas of Sunni Iraq where the insurgency rages ) .
Or consider the latest in Bush administration thinking .
In a superb front - page New York Times piece last week , Bombs Aimed at G.I.'s in Iraq Are Increasing , reporters Michael R. Gordon , Mark Mazzetti and Thom Shanker offered impressive evidence that , since the killing of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the Sunni insurgency against the Americans and allied Iraqi forces has only heightened .
Perhaps most striking were the final paragraphs of the piece , meant only for news junkies and buried deep inside the paper ( reinforcing my sense that the imperial press can sometimes most profitably be read from back to front ) :
" ' Everybody in the administration is being quite circumspect , ' the expert said , ' but you can sense their own concern that this is drifting away from democracy . ' "
" ' Senior administration officials have acknowledged to me that they are considering alternatives other than democracy , ' said one military affairs expert who received an Iraq briefing at the White House last month and agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity .
" ' Senior administration officials have acknowledged to me that they are considering alternatives other than democracy , ' said one military affairs expert who received an Iraq briefing at the White House last month and agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity .
" ' Everybody in the administration is being quite circumspect , ' the expert said , ' but you can sense their own concern that this is drifting away from democracy . ' "
White House spokesman Tony Snow was forced to deny this at a press briefing the next day , but it makes complete sense .
This was , after all , the solution the elder Bush 's top officials looked to after the first Gulf War .
They hoped a war - weakened Saddam would be overthrown by a Baathist strongman from within his own military , someone we could deal with -- as we had with him in the 1980s .
( Juan Cole speculates that this time around it would be " a Shiite ex-Baathist officer in the old Iraqi army who knew how to make people an offer they could n't refuse . " )
Even in the unlikely event that it were possible to put such a plan into effect , it 's a given that it , too , would fail .
That the Bush administration is looking for new solutions to the Iraqi conundrum , however , should be unsurprising .
So many situations in our world make a mockery of all attempts at prediction ; and yet Iraq , since March 2003 , has seemed otherwise .
There is a terrible logic to the situation in that country , which has only worsened incrementally under three - plus years of American ( and British ) occupation .
Whatever the promises , whatever the " turning points , " whatever the provisional good news offered at any moment , the situation in that country ( and the region ) only gets worse .
In this case , history should be our guide .
As long as Americans believe that Iraq is some kind of imperial Rubik 's cube , where what 's at stake is hitting on just the right combination of tactics , plans , and political mix inside Baghdad 's Green Zone , as long as we believe that we are indeed part of the solution , not part of the problem , matters will only continue to worsen .
Michael Schwartz , a Tomdispatch regular , offers seven facts that help explain why the lethal brew our invasion let loose in that country will have no hope of " solution " under present conditions .

With a tenuous cease - fire between Israel and Lebanon holding , the ever - hotter war in Iraq is once again creeping back onto newspaper front pages and towards the top of the evening news .
Before being fully immersed in daily reports of bomb blasts , sectarian violence , and casualties , however , it might be worth considering some of the just - under - the - radar - screen realities of the situation in that country .
Here , then , is a little guide to understanding what is likely to be a flood of new Iraqi developments -- a few enduring , but seldom commented upon , patterns central to the dynamics of the Iraq war , as well as to the fate of the American occupation and Iraqi society .
1. The Iraqi Government Is Little More Than a Group of " Talking Heads "
A minimally viable central government is built on at least three foundations : the coercive capacity to maintain order , an administrative apparatus that can deliver government services and directives to society , and the resources to manage these functions .
The Iraqi government has none of these attributes -- and no prospect of developing them .
It has no coercive capacity .
The national army we hear so much about is actually trained and commanded by the Americans , while the police forces are largely controlled by local governments and have few , if any , viable links to the central government in Baghdad .
( Only the Special Forces , whose death - squad activities in the capital have lately been in the news , have any formal relationship with the elected government ; and they have more enduring ties to the U.S. military that created them and the Shia militias who staffed them . )
Administratively , the Iraqi government has no existence outside Baghdad 's heavily fortified Green Zone -- and little presence within it .
Whatever local apparatus exists elsewhere in the country is led by local leaders , usually with little or no loyalty to the central government and not dependent on it for resources it does n't , in any case , possess .
In Baghdad itself , this is clearly illustrated in the vast Shiite slum of Sadr city , controlled by Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army and his elaborate network of political clerics .
( Even U.S. occupation forces enter that enormous swath of the capital only in large brigades , braced for significant firefights . )
In the major city of the Shia south , Basra , local clerics lead a government that alternately ignores and defies the central government on all policy issues from oil to women 's rights ; in Sunni cities like Tal Afar and Ramadi , where major battles with the Americans alternate with insurgent control , the government simply has no presence whatsoever .
In Kurdistan in the north , the Kurdish leadership maintains full control of all local governments .
As for resources , with 85 % of the country 's revenues deriving from oil , all you really need to know is that oil - rich Iraq is also suffering from an " acute fuel shortage " ( including soaring prices , all - night lines at gas stations , and a deal to get help from neighboring Syria which itself has minimal refining capacity ) .
The almost helpless Iraqi government has had little choice but to accept the dictates of American advisors and of the International Monetary Fund about exactly how what energy resources exist will be used .
Paying off Saddam - era debt , reparations to Kuwait from the Gulf War of 1990 , and the needs of the U.S. - controlled national army have had first claim .
With what remains so meager that it cannot sustain a viable administrative apparatus in Baghdad , let alone the rest of the country , there is barely enough to spare for the government leadership to line their own pockets .
2. There Is No Iraqi Army
The " Iraqi Army " is a misnomer .
The government 's military consists of Iraqi units integrated into the U.S. - commanded occupation army .
These units rely on the Americans for intelligence , logistics , and -- lacking almost all heavy weaponry themselves -- artillery , tanks , and any kind of airpower .
( The Iraqi " Air Force " typically consists of fewer then 10 planes with no combat capability . )
The government has no real control over either personnel or strategy .
We can see this clearly in a recent operation in Sadr City , conducted ( as news reports tell us ) by " Iraqi troops and US advisors " and backed up by U.S. artillery and air power .
It was one of an ongoing series of attempts to undermine the Sadrists and their Mahdi army , who have governed the area since the fall of Saddam .
The day after the assault , Iraqi premier Nouri Kamel al - Maliki complained about the tactics used , which he labeled " unjustified , " and about the fact that neither he , nor his government , was included in the decision - making leading up to the assault .
As he put it to an Agence France - Presse , " I reiterate my rejection to [ sic ] such an operation and it should not be executed without my consent .
This particular operation did not have my approval . "
This happened because the U.S. has functionally expanded its own forces in Iraq by integrating local Iraqi units into its command structure , while essentially depriving the central government of any army it could use purely for its own purposes .
Iraqi units have their own officers , but they always operate with American advisers .
As American Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad put it , " We 'll ultimately help them become independent . "
( Do n't hold your breath . )
3 . The Recent Decline in American Casualties Is Not a Result of Less Fighting ( and Anyway , It's Probably Ending )
At the beginning of August , the press carried reports of a significant decline in U.S. casualties , punctuated with announcements from American officials that the military situation was improving .
The figures ( compiled by the Brookings Institute ) do show a decline in U.S. military deaths ( 76 in April , 69 in May , 63 in June , and then only 48 in July ) .
But these were offset by dramatic increases in Iraqi military fatalities , which almost doubled in July as the U.S. sent larger numbers of Iraqi units into battle , and as undermanned American units were redeployed from al - Anbar province , the heartland of the Sunni insurgency , to civil - war - torn Baghdad in preparation for a big push to recapture various out - of - control neighborhoods in the capital .
More important , when it comes to long - term U.S. casualties , the trends are not good .
In recent months , U.S. units had been pulled off the streets of the capital .
But the Iraqi Army units that replaced them proved incapable of controlling Baghdad in even minimal ways .
So , in addition , to fighting the Sunni insurgency , American troops are now back on the streets of Baghdad in the midst of a swirling civil war with U.S. casualties likely to rise .
In recent months , there has also been an escalation of the fighting between American forces and the insurgency , independent of the sectarian fighting that now dominates the headlines .
As a consequence , the U.S. has actually increased its troop levels in Iraq ( by delaying the return of some units , sending others back to Iraq early , and sending in some troops previously held in reserve in Kuwait ) .
The number of battles ( large and small ) between occupation troops and the Iraqi resistance has increased from about 70 a day to about 90 a day ; and the number of resistance fighters estimated by U.S. officials has held steady at about 20,000 .
The number of IEDs placed -- the principle weapon targeted at occupation troops ( including Iraqi units ) -- has been rising steadily since the spring .
The effort by Sunni guerrillas to expel the American army and its allies is more widespread and energetic than at any time since the fall of the Hussein regime .
4. Most Iraqi Cities Have Active and Often Viable Local Governments
Neither the Iraqi government , nor the American - led occupation has a significant presence in most parts of Iraq .
This is well - publicized in the three Kurdish provinces , which are ruled by a stable Kurdish government without any outside presence ; less so in Shia urban areas where various religio- political groups -- notably the Sadrists , the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , Da'wa , and Fadhila -- vie for local control , and then organize cities and towns around their own political and religious platforms .
While there is often violent friction among these groups -- particularly when the contest for control of an area is undecided -- most cities and towns are largely peaceful as local governments and local populations struggle to provide city services without a viable national economy .
This situation also holds true in the Sunni areas , except when the occupation is actively trying to pacify them .
When there is no fighting , local governments dominated by the religious and tribal leaders of the resistance establish the laws and maintain a kind of order , relying for law enforcement on guerrilla fighters and militia members .
All these governments -- Kurdish , Shia and Sunni -- have shown themselves capable of maintaining ( often fundamentalist ) law and ( often quite harsh ) order , with little crime and little resistance from the local population .
Though often severely limited by the lack of resources from a paralyzed national economy and a bankrupt national government , they do collect the garbage , direct traffic , suppress the local criminal element , and perform many of the other duties expected of local governments .
5. Outside Baghdad , Violence Arrives with the Occupation Army
The portrait of chaos across Iraq that our news generally offers us is a genuine half - truth .
Certainly , Baghdad has been plunged into massive and worsening disarray as both the war against the Americans and the civil war have come to be concentrated there , and as the terrifying process of ethnic cleansing has hit neighborhood after neighborhood , and is now beginning to seep into the environs of the capital .
However , outside Baghdad ( with the exception of the northern cities of Kirkuk and Mosul , where historic friction among Kurd , Sunni , and Turkman has created a different version of sectarian violence ) , Iraqi cities tend to be reasonably ethnically homogeneous and to have at least quasi-stable governments .
The real violence often only arrives when the occupation military makes its periodic sweeps aimed at recapturing cities where it has lost all authority and even presence .
This deadly pattern of escalating violence is regularly triggered by those dreaded sweeps , involving brutal , destructive , and sometimes lethal home invasions aimed at capturing or killing suspected insurgents or their supporters .
The insurgent response involves the emplacement of ever more sophisticated roadside bombs ( known as IEDs ) and sniper attacks , aimed at distracting or hampering the patrols .
The ensuing firefights frequently involve the use of artillery , tanks , and air power in urban areas , demolishing homes and stores in a neighborhood , which only adds to the bitter resistance and increasing the support for the insurgency .
These mini -wars can last between a few hours and , in Falluja , Ramadi , or other " centers of resistance , " a few weeks .
They constitute the overwhelming preponderance of the fighting in Iraq .
For any city , the results can be widespread death and devastation from which it can take months or years to recover .
Yet these are still episodes punctuating a less violent , if increasingly more run-down normalcy .
6 . There Is a Growing Resistance Movement in the Shia Areas of Iraq
Lately , the pattern of violence established in largely Sunni areas of Iraq has begun to spread to largely Shia cities , which had previously been insulated from the periodic devastation of American pacification attempts .
This ended with growing Bush administration anxiety about economic , religious , and militia connections between local Shia governments and Iran , and with the growing power of the anti-American Sadrist movement , which had already fought two fierce battles with the U.S. in Najaf in 2004 and a number of times since then in Sadr City .
Symptomatic of this change is the increasing violence in Basra , the urban oil hub at the southern tip of the country , whose local government has long been dominated by various fundamentalist Shia political groups with strong ties to Iran .
When the British military began a campaign to undermine the fundamentalists ' control of the police force there , two British military operatives were arrested , triggering a battle between British soldiers ( supported by the Shia leadership of the Iraqi central government ) and the local police ( supported by local Shia leaders ) .
This confrontation initiated a series of armed confrontations among the various contenders for power in Basra .
Similar confrontations have occurred in other localities , including Karbala , Najaf , Sadr City , and Maysan province .
So far no general offensive to recapture the any of these areas has been attempted , but Britain has recently been concentrating its troops outside Basra .
If the occupation decides to use military means to bring the Shia cities back into anything like an American orbit , full - scale battles may be looming in the near future that could begin to replicate the fighting in Sunni areas , including the use of IEDs , so far only sporadically employed in the south .
If you think American ( and British ) troops are overextended now , dealing with internecine warfare and a minority Sunni insurgency , just imagine what a real Shiite insurgency would mean .
7 . There Are Three Distinct Types of Terrorism in Iraq , All Directly or Indirectly Connected to the Occupation
Terrorism involves attacking civilians to force them to abandon their support for your enemy , or to drive them away from a coveted territory .
The original terrorists in Iraq were the military and civilian officials of the Bush administration -- starting with their " shock and awe " bombing campaign that destroyed Iraqi infrastructure in order to " undermine civilian morale . "
The American form of terrorism continued with the wholesale destruction of most of Falluja and parts of other Sunni cities , designed to pacify the " hot beds " of insurgency , while teaching the residents of those areas that , if they " harbor the insurgents , " they will surely " suffer the consequences . "
At the individual level , this program of terror was continued through the invasions of , and demolishing of , homes ( or , in some cases , parts of neighborhoods ) where insurgents were believed to be hidden among a larger civilian population , thus spreading the " lesson " about " harboring terrorists " to everyone in the Sunni sections of the country .
Generating a violent death rate of at least 18,000 per year , the American drumbeat of terror has contributed more than its share to the recently escalating civilian death toll , which reached a record 3,149 in the official count during July .
It is unfortunately accurate to characterize the American occupation of Sunni Iraq as a reign of terror .
The Sunni terrorists like those led by Abu Musab al - Zarqawi have utilized the suicide car bomb to generate the most widely publicized violence in Iraq -- hundreds of civilian casualties each month resulting from attacks on restaurants , markets , and mosques where large number of Shia congregate .
At the beginning of the U.S. occupation , car bombs were nonexistent ; they only became common when a tiny proportion of the Sunni resistance movement became convinced that the Shia were the main domestic support for the American occupation .
( As far as we can tell , the vast majority of those fighting the Americans oppose such terrorists and have sometimes fought with them . )
As al - Qaeda leader Ayman al - Zawahiri wrote , these attacks were justified by " the treason of the Shia and their collusion with the Americans . "
As if to prove him correct , the number of such attacks tripled to current levels of about 70 per month after the Shia - dominated Iraqi government supported the American devastation of Falluja in November 2004 .
The Sunni terrorists work with the same terrorist logic that the Americans have applied in Iraq : Attacks on civilians are meant to terrify them into not supporting the enemy .
There is a belief , of course , among the leadership of the Sunni terrorists that , ultimately , only the violent suppression or expulsion of the Shia is acceptable .
But as Zawahiri himself stated , the " majority of Muslims do n't comprehend this and possibly could not even imagine it . "
So the practical justification for such terrorism lies in the more immediate association of the Shia with the hated occupation .
The final link in the terrorist chain can also be traced back to the occupation .
In January of 2005 , Newsweek broke the story that the U.S. was establishing ( Shiite ) " death squads " within the Iraqi Ministry of Interior , modeled after the assassination teams that the CIA had helped organize in El Salvador during the 1980s .
These death squads were intended to assassinate activists and supporters of the Sunni resistance .
Particularly after the bombing of the Golden Dome , an important Shia shrine in Samarra , in March 2006 , they became a fixture in Baghdad , where thousands of corpses -- virtually all Sunni men -- have been found with signs of torture , including electric - drill holes , in their bodies and bullet holes in their heads .
Here , again , the logic is the same : to use terror to stop the Sunni community from nurturing and harboring both the terrorist car bombers and the anti-American resistance fighters .
While there is disagreement about whether the Americans , the Shia - controlled Iraqi Ministry of Defense , or the Shia political parties should shoulder the most responsibility for loosing these death squads on Baghdad , one conclusion is indisputable :
They have earned their place in the ignominious triumvirate of Iraqi terrorism .
One might say that the war has converted one of President Bush 's biggest lies into an unimaginably horrible truth : Iraq is now the epicenter of worldwide terrorism .
Where the 7 Facts Lead
With this terror triumvirate at the center of Iraqi society , we now enter the horrible era of ethnic cleansing , the logical extension of multidimensional terror .
When the U.S. toppled the Hussein regime , there was little sectarian sentiment outside of Kurdistan , which had longstanding nationalist ambitions .
Even today , opinion polls show that more than two - thirds of Sunnis and Shia stand opposed to the idea of any further weakening of the central government and are not in favor of federation , no less dividing Iraq into three separate nations .
Nevertheless , ethnic cleansing by both Shia and Sunni has become the order of the day in many of the neighborhoods of Baghdad , replete with house burnings , physical assaults , torture , and murder , all directed against those who resist leaving their homes .
These acts are aimed at creating religiously homogeneous neighborhoods .
This is a terrifying development that derives from the rising tide of terrorism .
Sunnis believe that they must expel their Shia neighbors to stop them from giving the Shiite death squads the names of resistance fighters and their supporters .
Shia believe that they must expel their Sunni neighbors to stop them from providing information and cover for car - bombing attacks .
And , as the situation matures , militants on both sides come to embrace removal -- period .
As these actions escalate , feeding on each other , more and more individuals , caught in a vise of fear and bent on revenge , embrace the infernal logic of terrorism : that it is acceptable to punish everyone for the actions of a tiny minority .
There is still some hope for the Iraqis to recover their equilibrium .
All the centripetal forces in Iraq derive from the American occupation , and might still be sufficiently reduced by an American departure followed by a viable reconstruction program embraced by the key elements inside of Iraq .
But if the occupation continues , there will certainly come a point -- perhaps already passed -- when the collapse of government legitimacy , the destruction wrought by the war , and the horror of terrorist violence become self - sustaining .
If that point is reached , all parties will enter a new territory with incalculable consequences .

With Eggs and simpler installation and dependencies there 's more opportunities to distribute smaller packages and split large packages up into pieces .
I was reading this post on Zope :
I think this [ splitting up of packages ] is a big deal and too hope that we can " explode " Zope 3 into many eggs soon .
Jim wants to do it for Zope 3.4 , yay !
Having smaller , more easily distributable Zope packages will also reduce the buy - in into Zope as a platform .
For example , you wo n't have to ship with the ZMI anymore if you not only think it sucks but also find it disturbing to develop with .
Of course , I like this direction .
But not because of small distributions ; there 's a small number of places where that matters ( e.g. , mobile phones ) , but for most of us the download time and disk space is n't a big deal .
And after all , just because one app does n't require the ZMI does n't mean you do n't have it installed -- if it is already there you are n't saving any disk space .
The advantage I see in breaking up pieces is discipline , extensibility , and creating a hierarchy to the concepts in your library or framework .
Discipline :
Given a big package , developers will sometimes say that the package is loosely coupled on the inside , and if you want to use foo . x but not foo.y that 's fine , because they do n't depend on each other .
How do you know they do n't depend on each other ?
How do you know they wo n't depend on each other in the future ?
How do you know someone wo n't read about DRY and factor out pieces that are shared between the two modules ?
How do you know someone wo n't " fix " a bug in foo . z that both modules use , breaking something you depended on in some interface ?
If you use two different distributions for these two modules , you actually have lots of ways of detecting these problems and truly keeping the modules decoupled .
It 's not automatic -- there 's always opportunities to break things .
But the discipline of distribution boundaries ( and other separations like separate release schedules ) will tend to keep you honest about coupling .
Extensibility :
One argument for keeping things packaged together is that it allows for optional integration , so that people who want to use all the features get a more convenient tool .
This means that , for instance , an object may have a method that binds it to another module in the package .
But it 's optional , because you do n't have to call the method .
The programmer asked to trust that this " optional " feature is truly optional may consider all the questions raised under Discipline , but imagine that these issues are addressed .
So what 's the problem ?
In this case , the optional integration has a privileged position .
The original author 's libraries get special hooks , but the developer using those libraries does n't get the same access .
You could monkey patch your own extension , but you 'll only have created a horrible coupled mess .
You could avoid the extension entirely , of course , but if the original author thought it was sufficiently useful to create the extension it is likely that another user of the library will feel the same .
Hierarchy of Concepts :
Ideally a system will be layed out with a nice hierarchy of concepts : Library - A Library - B | \ / | \ / | \ / Library - C \ / \/ Library - D | | Library - E
To understand Library A you have to understand all of Library C , D , and E .
To understand Library D you only need understand Library E. Given a hierarchy like this , there 's actually an advantage to not using the entire framework / system .
You do n't need to understand nearly as much , and learning a library is probably the biggest overhead to using a library .
It can be argued that if you want to use Library A , you only need to read about Library A .
If the documentation is very good , this is somewhat true .
It is true if you use it perfectly and write no buggy code and the libraries themselves have no bugs and you do n't need to do anything that goes outside the bounds of what Library A provides .
This is n't my experience programming , and is n't typical when using F / OSS .
There is also a hierarchy of stability .
If Library E is a moving target then you are just plain hosed .
If someone keeps making API changes in Library D you are also hosed .
If stability does not increase as you move down your stack then the stack is a big ball of mud , even if at one isolated moment it might seem like an elegant and stable system .
For all these reasons when someone claims their framework is all spiffy and decoupled , but they just do n't care to package it as separate pieces ... I become quite suspicious .
Packaging does n't fix everything .
And it can introduce real problems if you split your packages the wrong way .
But doing it right is a real sign of a framework that wants to become a library , and that 's a sign of Something I 'd Like To Use .

When Code Is n’t Law
Most of my time is spent writing and teaching about law for the Internet society , or proposing and helping to implement legal strategy for the free software movement .
As a Linux user , you know that free software , because of the way it ’s made , achieves levels of quality that proprietary software rarely meets , and delivers reliable cutting - edge technology at a price every individual user and small business can afford .
But from where I sit , free software is also central to the biggest legal and political issues that the global Internet society will face in the next twenty - five years .
We often discuss “ the Internet ” as though it were either a thing or a place , but we do better at grasping the legal and political issues the net presents if we think of “ the Internet ” as the name of a social condition : the fact that everyone living in the networked portions of the world can now communicate with anyone else directly , without intermediaries , reaching very large numbers of people at almost no cost .
A society in which everyone is connected to everyone else behaves differently from any society that has ever existed before ; past “ principles ” of social and economic law , things that seemed always true everywhere , are n’t anymore .
Free software — like the Linux kernel , GNU Emacs , \ LaTeX , Apache , Perl , and all the other tools you use all the time — exists because in this pervasively interconnected society , non-traditional means of production can be amazingly efficient .
Large numbers of programmers can collaborate easily on enormous projects without having to be locked into a hierarchical organization .
Everyone can participate in finding and fixing bugs and everyone can readily incorporate all the fixes , so the quality of free software can be much higher than that of programs produced by a limited number of developers and testers inside a commercial proprietary manufacturer .
At first glance , free software seems to pose a problem mostly for commercial proprietary software firms .
And it is a problem for them : they ’re going to have to learn to compete against excellent products that everyone can copy , use , improve and redistribute at no cost .
But there are more serious forms of confrontation ahead .
Instead of thinking of the net as a place called “ cyberspace , ” think of it for a moment as a collection of pipes and switches .
Information flows through all the different kinds of pipes , and is modified or sent to particular destinations by the switches .
The switches determine who gets what information , how privately or publicly , and what — if anything — users downstream from the switch have to pay to receive the information .
For you , the most important switch of all is the one closest to your eyeball and eardrum .
It shows you the text and video you ask for , plays your music , carries your voice calls and video conferences , and so on .
But there are other people too who want to control the switches nearest you .
They want to be able to deliver music or movies , for example , that you have to pay for each time you listen or watch .
Copyright law protects them already , by making it illegal for you to copy music or movies and give those copies to other people .
But in the world of the net , where copies cost nothing and move everywhere instantly , the distributors of proprietary media think that legal protection is not enough .
They want to be sure that your computer ca n’t make copies of the music they ’ve just delivered you over the net .
In the phrase of Professor Larry Lessig of Harvard , they want code to substitute for law .
In the world of proprietary software , the user does n’t control the switch he himself owns : the software manufacturer does .
If Microsoft makes the Windows Media player so that there ’s no way to save streaming audio on the hard drive , it ’s almost impossible for the user to unmake that decision .
But free software is code that any user can change , and therefore it ca n’t be used to substitute for law .
And because free software often replaces proprietary software , it can act subversively , to undo “ laws ” made by proprietary programs .
Free software browsers can remove the ads from web pages , a free software DVD player can let you fast - forward through commercials .
Any free software media player could be modified to save the music or video it is playing .
“ Who controls the switches ? ”
That ’s the most important legal and political question in the Internet society .
Free software says that , as individuals , we do .
So sometimes “ code is law ” and sometimes code is freedom .
Which makes for many complex legal issues , a few already raised in the courts and many more that we ’ll see in the next year or two , as free software finds itself at the center of conflict over the politics of the Net .
[ In future issues of this magazine I ’ll be writing more about these cases , and about why Free Software Matters . ]

A lot of words are expended here and elsewhere on the topic of what constitutes good management and what constitutes bad management .
It ’s fair to say there is no absolute answer to this question as the relative importance of different elements will vary depending on the perspective from which you view the situation .
Working life and the decisions that affect it look different depending whether you are a skilled worker , unskilled worker , manager , finance director , CEO , shareholder , customer or omnipotent deity who gets to decide the fate of everyone ’s immortal soul .
The US Constitution holds certain truths to be self - evident and most people have very definite ideas on what truths of good management are self - evident .
It ’s just a shame that exactly what is evident varies so much from self to self .
The following real - life stories showing the actions of good bosses and bad bosses are told from the perspective of an IT worker but when I ’ve shared them with others in the past , I ’ve found that the experiences are very broadly shared .
Although the companies involved were very different , they had the following things broadly in common : they had a requirement to make a profit , losing good staff would be negative both in terms of the loss of expertise and experience as well as the costs incurred in replacing them and finally , there were certain “ deliverables ” expected of the department and you could objectively measure whether or not these things were delivered .
Scenario 1 – an outside entity attacks the team in a game of office politics .
Good Boss
The first thing a good boss did in this situation was to treat me specifically and the team generally as grown ups who were capable of dealing with the truth .
He told us exactly what was happening , what had been said and what the potential implications were .
He then asked for our side of the story and if we had any evidence to support our version of events .
Fortunately we did have a paper and data trail that covered our collective butts so our boss told us not to worry and went off and dealt with the situation .
In short , he trusted us and recognised we were his best asset so went and represented us .
Bad Boss
The worst response I have suffered from a bad boss in this type of situation is from a boss who constantly attempted to deflect criticism away from her and straight onto her team .
She seemed to think that actually defending her own team was too high risk and so responded to almost every attack by automatically agreeing with the attacker and blaming an individual on the team .
“ Oh yeah , that Mr Angry .
He ’s always screwing that up no matter how many times I tell him . ”
There are three major drawbacks to this strategy that all cowardly managers really need to consider .
One , it makes you an easy target because other parts of the business realise you never mount a defence so they can blame you for everything .
Two , it makes your team regard you as the enemy because they sure as hell ca n’t trust you to be an ally .
Whether you realise it or not , one day you will need their support .
Three , when your scapegoat (s ) eventually quit , the whole strategy falls apart when things do n’t get any better .
If the problem does n’t go away when the person you always blamed leaves , it becomes slightly more obvious where the blame might lie .
Scenario 2 – There really is a performance problem you have to deal with
Bad Boss
I ’m not perfect and I have screwed things up in the past .
The classic way for a bad boss to deal with this is to be punitive from the outset .
This is where the boss conducts a performance review or ( shudder ) “ counselling session ” in three distinct stages .
When the session starts the bad boss has already reached a negative conclusion – “ You are bad for this reason . ”
The second stage involves piling on damning “ evidence ” that is often arguably true but all spun to present the recipient in the worst possible light .
The third and final stage is the threat , sometimes known in doublespeak as “ improvement criteria ” but could be more honestly described as the manager ’s plan for screwing the employee no matter what .
This whole process can be documented to look extremely fair .
The problem is , when you make your conclusion before starting this process , everything after that is done simply to justify the conclusion already reached which sucks the fairness right out of it .
If all you want to do is punish someone , go right ahead but that sort of mentality is not maintainable long term .
Good ( or salvageable ) employees will leave for a more positive environment .
Truly bad employees will make your life a misery no matter what process you follow so may as well hang onto your own integrity and deal with situations in a productive way .
Good Boss
The way a good boss shows themself to be a good boss in this situation is to be open and honest .
If you start with the point of view that the situation can be remedied then you ’re far more likely to actually reach a positive resolution .
Be honest with the employee about what the issue is and why it ’s serious but be open to the possibility that there ’s something you do n’t know about that could paint things in a different light .
In one situation , I was called to account for not doing some paperwork that turned out to be critical for an audit .
My boss dragged me in to tell me what was happening and why it was important ( the fact the paperwork was missing had been discovered by an auditor who was making a big scene about it ) and asked me for my side .
I came clean and admitted I had n’t done it because , well , it was a pain .
He took a “ what ’s done is done ” attitude and asked me how I could recover the situation .
I said I could have the paperwork all done within a week and I would work with the auditor to make sure it was all OK .
He accepted this and gave me a gentle “ do n’t let it happen again ” nudge .
Then he told me he probably would have sacked me if I had lied about it or tried to blame someone else .
He probably also would have kicked my arse if I did n’t follow through on my commitment as well .
Scenario 3 – Getting staff to do what you want
Bad Boss
Bad bosses almost alway try to enforce their will through fear or at least through the threat of retribution .
They do n’t trust their staff to do well and think they have to constantly threaten them with what will happen if they do n’t do the right thing .
The trouble with negative motivation is that it produces negative results .
You might get the output you are demanding but the staff will have no emotional commitment to the work .
In my experience , staff subjected to negative management approaches will find a way to make sure they are producing the bare minimum to escape negative attention .
If the staff do n’t care about their work , there is no motivation to reach new heights .
When your motivation is solely to avoid the metaphorical stick , you can safely stop the moment you are out of the stick ’s reach .
And do n’t underestimate the negative payback you will get from staff .
There is no end to how devious workers will get when they feel they are being treated unfairly .
At the more benign end of the scale are simple “ go slow ” strategies but the worse you make staff feel , the easier many people find it to justify sabotage or outright theft from the company .
Good Boss
The most powerful tool at the good boss ’ disposal is respect .
When staff respect their boss they want to earn the respect of the boss in turn .
The horrible feeling of disappointing someone you want to impress is a far more powerful motivator than the threat of retribution .
This does not mean a boss has to be smarter or better than employees ( although that helps ) .
It means leading with integrity , encouraging positivity and recognising achievements .
Above all , it means showing respect to your staff and letting them see you treat everyone you deal with in an ethical manner .
As old fashioned as it sounds , at the end of the day being a good boss or a bad boss is an ethical choice .
Many environments seem to reward negative behaviour .
When the ruthless and self - interested rise more rapidly up the corporate ladder it can be hard to avoid following suit .
Positive management practices promote positive outcomes , both commercially and in terms of the well - being of staff ( managers included ) .
Sociopaths sometimes get exactly what they want but no matter how much they get , they ’re still sociopaths .
And if being the tyrant king of a steaming shitpile populated by angry , negative people is your idea of success then I guess you wasted a few minutes of your life by reading this piece .
The New Yorker magazine has an article on hemispherectomies – surgical procedures which remove half of the cortex , usually in an attempt to cure otherwise life - threating epilepsy .
These operations are usually carried out on children , as remarkably , those in their early years can often develop normal adult skills and abilities if surgery is carried out early enough .
For example , a 2001 book by Antonio Battro ( sample chapter : pdf ) describes a three year old boy named ‘ Nico ’ who had the whole of his right hemisphere removed to control life - threatening epilepsy .
Nevertheless , he has developed with very little impairment and has turned out to be a bright and engaging child , despite the fact that a similar operation in adults would be profoundly disabling .
The New Yorker article charts the development of this procedure from the first operation on a human in 1923 , to the latest in neurosurgical technology and practice .
Two of the pioneers of the procedure , Dr John Freeman and Dr Ben Carson are also featured , who explain how the team at John Hopkins first tackled a left hemispherectomy .
Potentially hazardous , because the left side of the cortex has the majority of the language function in most people .
The article also introduces us to some of the patients who have had the procedure .
Christina now drives , graduated from high - school and is studying at university , despite on having only one hemisphere of her brain left .

From 2002 until this year , NASA ’s mission statement , prominently featured in its budget and planning documents , read : “ To understand and protect our home planet ; to explore the universe and search for life ; to inspire the next generation of explorers ... as only NASA can . ”
In early February , the statement was quietly altered , with the phrase “ to understand and protect our home planet ” deleted .
In this year ’s budget and planning documents , the agency ’s mission is “ to pioneer the future in space exploration , scientific discovery and aeronautics research . ”
David E. Steitz , a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , said the aim was to square the statement with President Bush ’s goal of pursuing human spaceflight to the Moon and Mars .
But the change comes as an unwelcome surprise to many NASA scientists , who say the “ understand and protect ” phrase was not merely window dressing but actively influenced the shaping and execution of research priorities .
Without it , these scientists say , there will be far less incentive to pursue projects to improve understanding of terrestrial problems like climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions .
The comment period for the new draft Massachusetts office - file - format policy ended last Friday the 9th .
During the week before that date , there was some pretty intense back - room politics going on .
There are a ton of industry associations and lobbying groups , including : Mass Software Council , Technet New England , Mass High Tech Council , Mass Network Communications Council , Associated Industries of Massachusetts , and AeA .
You can bet that every one of them was coming under pressure last week to speak up pro or contra the state ’s position .
Since you have IBM and Sun on one side of this issue and Microsoft on the other , you can also bet that they were getting pulled both ways .
I ’m pretty sure that a lot of them ended up with a statement along the lines of “ On the subject of the new draft from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , we ’re in favor of motherhood and apple pie . ”
But , I got my hands on a copy of the other side ’s talking points , and I think they make interesting reading .
[ Update : I hear unofficially from someone at Adobe corporate that they ’re “ generally happy with how things went ” , so I was wrong , sorry .
Fixed . ]
Somebody at one of those associations knows somebody who ’s on a mailing list with me and thus I got these talking points ; I ca n’t say for sure who wrote them , but I can guess .
Let ’s give them a look , then walk through point by point .
The direction toward interoperability using XML data standards is clearly a good one .
However , limiting the document formats to the OpenOffice format is unnecessary , unfair and gives preferential treatment for specific vendor products , and prohibits others .
The proposed approach and process for use of XML data is quite open to multiple standards , yet the proposed standard for documents is quite narrow , preferential , and may not enable optimal use of the data - centric standards .
The proposed policy would create significant costs and problems for state agencies , for the private sector and for citizens , which have not been evaluated , considered , or factored in .
There are practical considerations for conversion of documents in older formats which apparently have not been considered .
This policy would prohibit certain innovations and solutions from technology vendors , denying future benefits to MA agencies .
There are less costly , less limiting , non-preferential policy options to achieve the same goals .
Bottom line :
We feel strongly that this proposed policy is costly and unnecessary and would result in limiting the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to desktop software that is less functional , less open and less flexible than the State of MA already has .
We will continue to work with a variety of State officials to help them achieve their various public and organizational goals .
On the Other Hand ... · Recently we spent a few days on a farm on Saskatchewan , during which I had occasion to help clean the floor of the barn , one of whose inhabitants was a Hereford bull named “ El Presidente ” , being boarded for a friend .
So , when I assert that these talking points are , by and large , Dung of Male Bovine ( DoMB for short ) , I do so in an educated voice .
Let ’s take them up one by one .
The direction toward interoperability using XML data standards is clearly a good one .
Well yes , but just standardizing on “ XML ” is laughably inadequate .
XML just labels parts of files ; it does n’t tell you what they mean ; by itself , it does n’t do semantics at all .
But interoperability and business value are all about shared semantics ; for example , once everyone publishing documents onto the Internet decided to agree to use HTML , the Web revolution was born .
So “ standardizing on XML ” is useless ; the business benefits are in standardizing on an actual individual set of tags and what they mean .
For example , in Massachusetts ’ case , OpenDocument 1.0 .
However , limiting the document formats to the OpenOffice format is unnecessary , unfair and gives preferential treatment for specific vendor products , and prohibits others .
DoMB .
Not only is anyone free to implement OpenDocument 1.0 without any legal or licensing issues , anyone is free to join the committee which defines and maintains it .
The claim that any product is “ prohibited ” casts serious doubt on the intelligence and integrity of whoever has the nerve to make it .
The proposed approach and process for use of XML data is quite open to multiple standards , yet the proposed standard for documents is quite narrow , preferential , and may not enable optimal use of the data - centric standards .
The first half of this is pretty well DoMB , anyone who claims that the combination of OpenDocument 1.0 and PDF ( what Massachusetts is proposing ) is “ narrow ” clearly has n’t taken the time to study either of them .
The second part of this , I suppose , is code for “ lets you use InfoPath ” .
They might have a point here , except for I ’ve seen outfits like Propylon build the same kind of application using OpenOffice data , and there are all sorts of standard approaches like XForms and so on just coming over the horizon .
Abandoning the benefits of standardization to enable the use of a frankly experimental and unproven product from one vendor strikes me as a lousy trade - off .
The proposed policy would create significant costs and problems for state agencies , for the private sector and for citizens , which have not been evaluated , considered , or factored in .
Really ?
How do they know that Massachusetts has n’t been evaluating , considering , or factoring in ?
Seems like a pretty offensive claim , frankly .
But there ’s some real meat here .
There are significant costs in converting away from a proprietary , vendor - controlled data format , and you can be sure that such vendors take those costs into account when they set their licensing prices .
Let ’s see , in the year ended June 30 , 2005 , I see that Microsoft reported 7.915 billion profit on $ 11.013 billion in revenues for “ Information Worker ” products ( i.e. Office ) .
Yes , proprietary data formats are are a big part of the story behind that remarkable profit margin .
Once the world has converted to a common file format so everyone has to compete on features and quality , this will still be a good business to be in , but nobody will be reporting 72 % operating profits , which in this particular case means less money going from Massachusetts to Redmond , year after year , forever .
Put it another way : every so often in coming generations , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is going to change its office software .
Assuming they ’ve standardized the file format , the cost of changing the software will be just the cost of changing the software .
If they have n’t , it ’ll also include the cost of changing over all the data .
Unless the cost of conversion right now is awfully damn high , this sounds like a good investment .
There are practical considerations for conversion of documents in older formats which apparently have not been considered .
Once again , whoever wrote this had a lot of nerve accusing Massachusetts of failing to consider obvious issues .
Let me tell a little story .
A couple of months ago , I bought my Mom a new Macintosh , and also Microsoft Office for the Mac .
We transferred her files over from her old Windows computer , but Office would n’t open a bunch of them .
That was OK , I went and got NeoOffice / J , a free OpenOffice - based software suite , and it opened most of them just fine .
This is a story you hear over and over , on the net .
Having said that , there are going to be cases ( particularly heavily - engineered Excel spreadsheets ) , where there will be some pain transferring to the open alternative .
But ( see previous discussion ) there will also be some pay - offs ; you take the pain now or you support a 72 % profit margin forever .
This policy would prohibit certain innovations and solutions from technology vendors , denying future benefits to MA agencies .
This is particularly gloppy ugly stinky DoMB .
The notion that using standardized formats and protocols gets in the way of innovation is twenty - year - old thinking , it was wrong then and it ’s wrong now .
I remember perfectly well , back in the Eighties , IBM and Wang and Pr1me and DEC explaining why their proprietary networking stacks were much more innovative and better than this new - fangled least - common - denominator “ Internetworking ” thing , and why their proprietary operating systems were more innovative than Unix .
( Hey , most of those companies are out of business , are n’t they ? )
These days , anybody trying to sell a one - vendor proprietary networking stack would be laughed out of the market .
I am quite certain that in another decade or two , anyone trying to sell a proprietary office - document format will be too .
Massachusetts is smart enough to be a little ahead of the game .
There are less costly , less limiting , non-preferential policy options to achieve the same goals .
Well , I have a new car - engine technology to sell that runs on tap - water and accelerates a Ford Expedition 0 - 60 in 2.7 seconds .
You should n’t take either my statement or the one before it seriously , because each lacks supporting evidence and flies in the face of common sense .
Bottom line :
We feel strongly that this proposed policy is costly and unnecessary and would result in limiting the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to desktop software that is less functional , less open and less flexible than the State of MA already has .
We will continue to work with a variety of State officials to help them achieve their various public and organizational goals .
That barn - floor stench threatens to overcome me .
In particular , the claim that office technology based on an open , standardized , file format that has already been implemented multiple times is necessarily “ less functional , less open , and less flexible ” is outrageous .
In free - market economies , functionality and flexibility generally arise as a result of competition , not of monopoly control of key standards .
As for open - ness , the notion that a proprietary technology unilaterally controlled and licensed by a single vendor can be “ more open ” than a public soon - to - be - ISO standard is simply , well , that ’s what El Presidente produces and what I was pitchforking out last August .
$ 10 To Answer This Question I ’m completely unable to find an answer , so I ’ll give ten bucks via PayPal ( or whatever ) to the first person to give me a working answer to this question :
How do I force an ATI X1550 card to output YPrPb signals on VGA under Windows Vista ?
Even if it ’s a stupid answer , if it works , I ’ll pay you .
It ’s probably a registry key , or maybe there ’s software , or maybe the Russians know something .
If I have to buy the ATI HDTV dongle , and you can confirm that for me , I ’ll give you five bucks .
Thanks for the assistance .
Google Reader Recommends Feeds , Adds Drag -n - Drop Organization Google Reader has added a feature to the sidebar that recommends RSS feeds you might be interested in subscribing to based on your current subscription .
They list three feeds , but click a link and you ’ll get a page with 20 pretty good recommendation .
Reader recommended for me Dave Naylor , Michael Gray , Ross Mayfield , Dave Sifry , the Google News Blog , the AdWords API blog , the Google Checkout Blog , the Vista Team blog , Microsoft ’s JobsBlog , Channel 10 , Jeff Sandquist , Tim Sneath , Matt Haughey , Eileen Brown and Dosh Dosh , among others , pretty much good recommendations all around .
By contrast , Bloglines has a similar feature which has n’t been updated in a while ( possibly not since I first posted about the emergence of blogging over 3 years ago ) that is biased towards more popular blogs you may already read in another form , or do n’t subscribe to for a reason .
They include Slashdot ( already subscribe ) , CNET ( I do n’t subscribe to all of CNET , just specific areas ) , kuro5hin ( they ’re still around ? ) , MacRumors , Gizmodo ( already subscribe ) , Dilbert , all of Wired , Fast Company , 43 Folders ( already subscribe ) , Kottke , Think Secret and Extremetech .
Reader ’s ahead already on day one .
Reader also added the ability to re-arrange feeds via drag - and - drop .
This was a long one coming , given that Bloglines had it in the previous version since February 2006 , and a necessary one .
Google still does n’t provide a means for renaming folders , but at least you can improve things by moving them around .

Google Experimental Adds Suggest , Search Digging Google Experimental , where Google runs experimental search interfaces which you can subscribe to and add to your regular search experience , has added two new experiments .
Keyword Suggestions is Google Suggest , the Google service that offers search suggestions as you type , is now available as an Experiment .
This is great , being able to add it as part of your personal search experience , since Yahoo and Ask.com already offer it in their main search engines .
A limited number of users are also being offered this experiment , which allows them to delete and re-order search results .
It ’s been described as almost a Digg - like system , in that the eventual goal would be to improve Google results through the wisdom of crowds by changing the results for everyone based on a mass consensus in the voting up and down ( and deleting ) of search results .
This feature was originally developed on Google ’s SearchMash test engine .
The voting experiment is a tasty one , so much that those who have n’t been offered it are clamoring for it , while the Google Suggest experiment has so much potential appeal , it should be an option in Google ’s preferences .
One limitation of the Experimental program is that you can only “ install ” one experiment to your search results at a time .

The YouTube blog has put together this playlist of what YouTube users who attended last night ’s CNN / YouTube Republican Presidential Debate had to say after the debate : 46 videos in all , so take your time .
Google Helps You Read Experts Exchange For Free Experts
Exchange is a website that answers questions on computer issues , and it ranks very well in Google search results .
Problem is , it costs money to read the answer , $ 12.95 a month .
Luckily , they expose the full answers to search engines ( which is why they are able to rank so well ) , so you can easily read the whole answer without registering and paying for an account .
Any time you see Experts - exchange.com in Google search , just hit the cache link to read the page with the complete answer .
Do n’t even bother trying to view it normally , because they expect you to pay for content .
Hopefully they left this loophole open on purpose , because we all know paying for content is a loser of a business model .
The Wall Street Journal has a back door for Digg users , and this is a type of back door as well .
Sites can lock down their communities to paid users , but do n’t expect search engine visitors to pay .
After all , why would I pay for a website if I ca n’t even see the quality of the “ Expert ” answers ?

With this Gadget , you can set rules for theme switching , using a different theme based on which computer you ’re using , the time of day , the weather outside , the day of the week , and choose from 70 user - created themes while doing so .
The possibilities for theme combinations are endless , and you can do a different theme per iGoogle tab , giving you more options than you know what to do with .
Google Gadgets Now Run On Mac ’s Dashboard Google Desktop ’s Gadgets are now cross-platform compatible with Apple ’s Mac OS X Dashboard .
That means you can run Gadgets alongside Widgets in the Dasboard , on Google ’s Sidebar , and on the iGoogle personalized homepage , making them amazingly versatile , and letting Google ’s platform pick up the slack when Dashboard is missing something important .
If Google does the same for Windows Vista , and helps Gadgets run on Vista ’s Sidebar , that would be amazing .

Infinite Nanoseconds !
Google ’s calculator has all sorts of stuff we mere mortals can’t understand , and here ’s another one : 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 millenium = inf nanoseconds
Well , I did n’t know that !
So , Google is saying that “ infinite ” is actually 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,000 years .
Good to know that there ’s a definite limit on infinite .

Stars Of The YouTube Debate Hopefully you already read my liveblog report of the Republican presidential debate , presented by YouTube and CNN , but whether you have or not , here are the top YouTube user videos used tonight :
The debate led off with this song introducing the eight candidates .
It ’s funny , and says it all well :
This was the first question , which sparked a huge arguement between Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney .
Rudy lost a lot of votes thanks to the term “ sanctuary city ” tonight , but Romney could be hurt in the long run :
The first cartoon question :
All the candidates knew this guy , who heads up a tax watchdog group :
This is the “ throwing gun ” question :
This was a hugely difficult question , even making my wife nervous :
Another cartoon question , and Fred Thompson briefly thought the figure in it was supposed to be him :
This gay Brigadier General asked one of the toughest questions of the night , plus he got the chance to respond from the audience : Retired Brigadier General Keith Kerr did not disclose that he is a member of a Hillary Clinton steering committee .
Anderson Cooper said afterwards that if CNN had known that beforehand they seriously would have had to consider his prominent role in the debate .
And the final , more lighthearded Yankees vs. Red Sox question :
CNN / YouTube Republican Debates : LIVEblog
The CNN / YouTube Republican Presidential debates are starting in a moment , and I ’ll be posting updates here as they happen .
8:00 : And they ’re off .
8 candidates , all the questions are from YouTube videos ( 5,000 in all , 2,000 more than the Democrats , though there was more time due to the delay ) .
The candidates are not on stage , but instead the Florida governor comes out ( after a very flattering introduction ) to introduce them .
They are : Duncan Hunter
Ron Paul
John McCain
Fred Thompson
Rudy Guiliani
Mitt Romney
Mike Huckabee
Tom Tancredo
This does not seem to be a Ron Paul - packed crowd , as far as I could tell from the applause .
You get that sometimes , the crowd acting like Paul is Jesus .
8:07 : They will insist candidates stay on the question , not answer previous questions .
Good luck !
8:10 : What a great start !
A YouTuber singing about each of the candidates .
8:11 : First question is to Giuliani accusing him of making a sanctuary for illegal immigrants .
Giuliani answers well , that they only allowed illegal children to attend school to avoid having 70,000 people on the street when crime was bad , but gave the names of arrested immigrants to the government .
Romney ’s response was devastating , that New York actually filed a lawsuit to protect its illegal status , and that you have to arrest all illegals because they are already committing a crime by being here .
I may not agree with that , but it was a great answer .
8:14 : Giuliani accuses Romney of hiring illegals to work on his house , Romney says he can’t check the papers of everyone who works for a contractor he hires .
They are slugging it out , and my wife is loving the fight .
8:16 : They refused to allow the debate to continue , until Anderson Cooper stopped them by playing another clip , also asking if candidates will pledge to veto any bill that grants amnesty to illegals .
Thompson answers it well , saying they must enforce the borders and eliminate sanctuary cities , a shot at Giuliani .
Then he takes a shot at Romney as a flip - flopper , and accuses Giuliani of fighting to keep New York as a sanctuary city .
The words “ Sanctuary City ” are going to hurt Giuliani coming out of this debate .
8:21 : McCain answer the question , saying that we have to work harder to get the American people to trust us after our recent failures .
He refused to yield when Cooper said “ time ” about five times .
Tancredo seems very pleased with himself , giving a speech about how everyone wants to be like him .
8:24 : About Americans losing their jobs due to illegals , Tancredo answers well that there are no jobs Americans wo n’t work , just jobs Americans wo n’t do for the wages illegals will accept .
8:26 : Huckabee is asked why he allowed illegals to get in - state tuition prices , but wo n’t allow military children from other states to get same .
He says the question is misinformed , but then explains exactly how the bill would do just that .
He also says the way we treat our veterans is disgraceful .
8:29 : Romney strikes back , fighting with everyone on stage .
He ’s annoying my wife with his attack stance , but it sure is entertaining .
8:30 : Question for Ron Paul , something about Paul supporters on the internet who say he believes in a conspiracy to form a North American Union of the U.S. , Canada and Mexico .
He says that our sovereignty is definitely under threat , and there are moves toward such a union , just like there were moves towards a European Union .
8:33 : McCain asked if we need to get the government spending under control , and he says the Republicans have lost their way on limiting spending , and he agrees .
He says he vetoes every pork barrel bill that crosses his desk with a veto pen he got from Ronald Reagan , and he makes the writers of that pork famous .
Romney talks about it without attacking anyone , and says we need to get this under control .
Giuliani says we need to have across the board cuts , no filling the jobs of government workers who retire over the coming years .
8:36 : Asked about increased government spending , and about 3 government programs that would be cut .
Thompson says that he would cut from the OMB ’s report on 100 programs that need to be cut , cutting all of them , and reform Social Security and Medicare with individual spending accounts and re-indexing .
8:39 : Paul lists 3 programs , he ’d cut , and you can see the Paul supporters in the crowd getting loud .
Huckabee says he ’d get rid of the IRS and revamp Social Security .
8:40 : Cartoon Uncle Sam asks a question about eliminating the federal income tax for a national sales tax .
McCain says no .
He also attacks Paul , saying Paul ’s attitude of isolationism caused World War II and allowed Hitler to go to power .
Lots of cheers , a few very loud boos .
The audience is mostly behind McCain , although McCain broke the rules by addressing a prior issue .
Paul says he is not an isolationist and has many military supporters .
8:43 : Question about opposing vetoing efforts to raise taxes , and everyone says they would pledge not to raise taxes .
Thompson and McCain say they pledge it to the American people , not independent groups .
Tancredo ( I think ) says he would not raise taxes , unless there was an emergency .
8:45 : Romney says he supports farm subsidies to protect our food supply and encourage new technologies .
Giuliani says we can’t lower subsidies , because they are higher in Europe than here , so if we lower them without them being lowered in Europe , we ca n’t compete .
8:48 : Giuliani asked by Anderson Cooper about something in the news today about records over security expenses when he was mayor .
He says he hid nothing , that as far as he knows nothing was hid , and that ’s all .
8:50 : Tancredo asked about toxic toys from China , Hunter also responds .
Hunter says China is cheating with the trade deficit , buying arms , and asks Americans to buy American with the Christmas shopping .
First commercial break , or it would be if a video ran by Fred Thompson did n’t so badly attack the other candidates .
Cooper lets the other candidates respond .
Romney says , “ I was wrong ” about being pro-choice many years ago .
Huckabee says he barely ever rose taxes , and he cut many other taxes .
8:59 : A guy with and tossing a gun asks about gun control , and Hunter ( ironic , right ? ) answers well , and says you ca n’t toss guns around safely .
9:00 : Giuliani asked about gun control and his record .
He says they had to be aggressive to protect New York , but that Americans have the right to bear arms , and nationally we can only have loose requirements , but states have the right to be a little more strict based on their local culture .
Thompson responds that gun laws in D.C. banning all firearms did n’t work , and Giuliani says he agrees that what works in New York will often not work elsewhere .
9:04 : Question about what guns the candidates have .
Thompson jokes , I will not tell you what guns I have , or where I keep them .
McCain talks about his war experience with guns , but does not own guns .
Giuliani has no guns .
9:05 : Question about black - on - black crime .
Romney says you need to have a mom and a dad to have values and prevent crime , and better prepare kids in inner city schools .
Giuliani says Romney has a mixed record on crime , with some categories going up , some down , while his record was all successful in reducing crime , especially in inner city neighborhoods .
9:08 : New topic : Abortion .
Asking pro-life candidates what crime those who get abortions would be charged with .
Paul says he does n’t think women should be charged with a crime , but that he never , as a ob / gyn , saw a medically necessary abortion , and that the abortionist should be charged with a crime .
However , he says it should be up to the states , not the federal government .
Thompson says we need to put the right judges on the Supreme Court to change things , but that things should be like they are now .
9:09 : Question : If Congress passed a federal ban on abortions , would you sign it ?
Giuliani says “ I would probably not sign it , I would leave it up to the states to decide ” .
Romney says he ’d love to see that kind of consensus , but it ’ll never happen , and it will probably be left to the states .
9:13 : Huckabee asked about the death penalty .
He says he is the only one on stage who had to decide to put someone to death , and that it is a very tough decision , and explains the difference between the death penalty and abortion .
The question is what would Jesus do , and Huckabee says Jesus was too smart to run for public office .
Tancredo says he ’d ask Jesus for advice .
9:16 : Guy holds the Bible , and asks if you believe every single word .
Giuliani says you ca n’t take every work literally , but he believes in it and reads it frequently and lets it guide him .
Romney says he believes it is the word of god .
Huckabee says that it is the word of god , regardless of the meaning of every word , it ’s all there for a reason .
Commercial break 9:23 : Question for Giuliani about Islamic terrorists .
He says a small group is ruining the good name of a great religion .
He says “ September 11 ″ twice , for the first time in the debate .
He says Democrats bury their head in the sand , and are afraid to even say that the terrorists are Islamic , that saying such only offends the terrorists , not the rest of normal Islamic people .
9:25 : McCain says we ca n’t set a date for withdrawl , but that he was the only one who said Rumsfeld ’s strategy was a failure , and that our current strategy is working .
9:27 : Question that McCain is an expert on waterboarding , and opposes it , and whether the other oppose it .
Romney says he should n’t debate specific methods , but opposes torture .
McCain comes out fighting , and says “ I ’m astonished you do n’t know what waterboarding is ” , Romney says he does , and McCain asks how he could not be against it then .
Romney clarifies that he does not want to lay out accepted an unaccepted types .
McCain says we ’d have to withdraw from the Geneva Convention under Romney , that we ca n’t be Jack Bauer .
Yes , he said Jack Bauer !
9:32 : Question about who ’d make a long term commitment to the people of Iraq .
Thompson says we should n’t be there forever , but as long as it takes .
Paul says the best commitment is to give the Iraqi people their country back .
McCain says Vietnam sent an important message to the enemy , and that Iraq will keep the terrorists from coming to our cities .
Paul says our bases in other countries cause them to want to fight us .
Tancredo says
Paul ’s idea of not going overseas is nice , but that ’s not the word we live in .
9:37 : Question for Giuliani about whether he is trying to use September 11 to get into the White House .
He says his record , both in the Justice Department and as mayor , all before September 11 , show why he should be President .
9:39 : Question from a computer animated Dick Cheney , who asks if the Vice President will be allowed as much power as Cheney did .
Thompson jokes he thought the animated character was him , and says that the most important thing is that the Vice President be prepared to be President .
McCain says Bush had to rely on Cheney because of his limitations , but that he would not have to .
My wife says McCain is very cuddly .
Last commercial break .
9:47 : A retired Brigadier General says that he is openly gay , and wants to know why the armed forces cannot be allowed to serve with gays .
Hunter says he agrees with Colin Powell that soldiers cannot co-exist as a unit because of the type of person who becomes a soldier and how hard it would be for them to deal with it .
Huckabee says we can not put our soldiers at risk by affecting unit cohesion .
9:49 : Romney is quoted as saying that he can’t wait for the day gays can serve openly .
He responds that this not the day for that .
My wife is screaming at the screen , saying he ’s worse than Kerry at sticking by what he says .
9:50 : The soldier who asked the question gets up and says he was not given a good answer .
9:51 : McCain responds , saying that those who serve right now say that the policy is working .
9:52 : Question about whether candidates accept support of log cabin Republicans .
Huckabee says he needs all the support he can get , and will accept it , but will not change his positions because of that .
9:53 : Question by guy inside a dollar bill graphic showing social security being squandered .
Thompson says we need to protect young people from being hurt by his own generation .
Romney says we face so many problems , including these entitlements , and we need to take America in a new , stronger direction .
9:55 : Question about space exploration and Mars .
Huckabee says our lives have been greatly improved by the space program ( makes a joke about people being late to the debate because they do n’t have GPS ) , and says that Hillary Clinton should be on the first rocket to Mars .
Tancredo says we have been talking about spending all night , and that we ca n’t afford to go to Mars .
9:58 : Question about why black people do n’t vote Republican .
Giuliani says the party does n’t communicate well what it has to offer , as well as improving schools for them .
He says his efforts on welfare show how he can improve things for the African American community .
Huckabee says he does have the support of the black community , and that he got 84 % of the vote from them .
10:01 : Question about the Confederate flag and what it means .
Romney says that with the problems we have we should n’t waste our time on that , and that we face extraordinary challenges and should n’t be divisive like the Democrats .
It ’s a great answer .
Thompson says that people who fly that flag are not racists , but it has a racist connotation , and we do n’t need to go out of our way to bring up things like that .
10:04 : Question about investing in infrastructure in this country .
Giuliani says he did a good job investing in that as mayor , and that we need to make serious efforts at a sustained program over the next several generations .
Paul says we are building bridges overseas and not here , and we need to get out of other countries .
10:06 : McCain says he will use veto to oppose all pork barrell spending and takes a shot at Giuliani for fighting against the line item veto .
Giuliani demands the chance to respond , and gets it , and says that the line item veto is unconstitutional .
He also mentions that he beat Bill Clinton to do it .
10:08 : Question for Paul about his chances .
Paul mentions how much money he ’s made , and rants about his beliefs .
10:09 : Last question , for Giuliani about supporting the Red Sox .
Giuliani says he always roots for the American League team , and that the Yankees won when he was mayor .
Romney retorts that he is a Red Sox fan , and that he was proud when his team beat the Yankees in 2003 .
And that the end of the debate .
Giuliani was not perfect , but he did a good job holding as the front runner .
He was hurt early on but did solidly as the debate went on .
Romney attacked too much and looked desperate .
Huckabee won the debate , coming off as well - tempered and with well - developed viewpoints .
Thompson came off better prepared and sounded better than he has in the past .
McCain came off strongly , but not necessarilly enough .
Great debate , very exciting and a great look at the views .
CNN is saying that tonight was the first time any candidate made an attack ad , that being the Fred Thompson video showed midway through the debate .
All in all , a great two hours of TV , and covered enough bases to give anyone a good view of the field .
If you only watched one debate , this one was definitely the right one to watch .
Wait , So I ’m Not A Trained Server Technician ?
This site has been down for two days , which , you know , is always fun and profitable .
The reason ?
Me and GoDaddy came up with this wonderful sponsorship agreement , which would allow this site to move to a dedicated server and thusly be more stable and not ever go down for two days , as well as allowing me the flexibility to install lots of useful plugins I could n’t otherwise on a shared host .
Problem is , that did n’t work out so well .
Turns out running a server is hard
In the end , I ’m glad to say the problem was not my fault , I ’m just the one suffering for it .
Turns out that GoDaddy ’s default server provisioning enables a service called iptables , which manages a lot of NAT and firewall stuff on Linux , but installed it without enabling the ports for HTTP and FTP access ( which are kind of important ) .
Also , I have to change a setting in an “ A - Record ” , whatever the hell that is .
Anyway , I ’m going to re-attempts the server move this weekend .
Until then , enjoy some speedblogging .
Also , I ’m still looking for someone interested in helping me sell some ads for this site .
Traffic has been spiking like crazy , and on a 30 % commission , it ’s a nice way to make some side money .
If you ’re interested , just hit the contact form or comment on this post .
Google Prioritizes Sales Over Content Google has removed the Video link on its search results pages with one to Google Product Search , relegating the very useful Video link to the “ More ” menu .
The Video link is fourteen items down the More menu , making it a lot of work to reach .
Previously , on any Google search , you could hit Video to get results from dozens of popular and unpopular video sites , making it the easiest way to find video on the internet .
Now ?
Not so much .
Google seems to be prioritizing Product Search , with its huge links to Google Checkout , over Video , which is actually a very popular and fast growing segment of the internet .
It ’s a decision that , unless backed up by traffic number saying no one used the Video link , makes no sense and implies Google ignored the needs of its users over its need to sell stuff .
That ’s dissapointing .
I ’ve been trying to find a video card for my wife ’s computer all week , and Google has been no help .
Every search on a product name reveals site after site that is selling that product .
Why Google ca n’t do powerful integration with Product Search , and then remove the product results from the web results , I have no idea .
I could not find forums discussing my various technical issues , because Google listed site after site with the same useless sales information .
Google needs to do a non-commercial search engine .
They ’d be able to sell more ads , since the results would contain no stores , and users would finally have a way to get answers to their questions .
I posted my questions to my two blogs because Google was a waste of my time .
Three years ago , when I started doing this , Google was the place that indexed blogs and forums and ranked them high , now it ’s the place that ranks every outdated deal and online store above actual information .
Google ’s mission is to organize the world ’s information .
When it comes to searching for anything anyone is selling , there is n’t any information to be found .
The Editors of the Microsnooze .
The week before the next company meeting the Micronews had a drawing on the front page of a bunch of happy Softies in a car .
A little sign pointing in the direction of the car showed that they were headed to the meeting .
In those days we had two meetings a year and they were even more boring than they are now .
So we decided to put out a prank Micronews .
A person who has asked to remain anonymous had recently referred to the Micronews as " Microsnooze " , so we borrowed the name .
A little hacking with a pen and scissors and the cover drawing showed happy Softies leaving the meeting .
And we came up with many more funny stories , mostly referring to various things that had happened in the previous year or so .
Again , a midnight dispersal ( by the four of us , with the help of one of Raymond 's friends , Michel Jackson ) .
For some reason , a whole bunch of people decided that Karl Schulmeisters and Dave Perlin had done it .
While they were good friends of ours , they in fact had nothing to do with it .
One of the articles in the next issue was adamant about this point ... which of course merely convinced those people that they 'd done it all the more .
We did a second issue timed for April First , which was preceded by a press release announcing it .
SteveB had liked the first issue quite a bit , so we made even more fun of him in the second one .
Apparently we pushed it too far , although I think most people still enjoyed it .
But we decided that we should quit while we were ahead .
About a year later , Raymond and Todd left the company .
The Editors of the Microsnooze were dead .
A few years later , Dave Norris and I found out that the company had paid an enormous amount of money to some logo designer for an astonishingly bland new logo .
We got some buttons made , and made a memo showing the history of the Microsnooze logo ( 6 of them ! ) , with some sarcasm attacking the need to change logos and various other silly labeling and packaging things , and signed it " The Editors of the Microsnooze " , even though Todd and Raymond were gone .
One Sunday night Dave and I and several others ( for the first time including the maligned Karl Schulmeisters and Dave Perlin ) distributed 1000 of these memos and a " Save the Blibbet " button to every office chair on campus .
We ran a little short , so we had to have a few more made and distributed them a few days later .
Apparently a lot of people knew who'd done it , as one old timer pointed out to me one of the logos we 'd missed .
Arriving at JFK from Dubai recently , I was stopped at customs by an officer from the Department of Homeland Security and directed to a drab backroom filled with Arabs , South Asians and Africans .
I was n’t surprised , really , having just spent six months working and traveling in the Islamic world -- Turkey , Lebanon , Egypt and Pakistan .
If ever there were a DHS red - flag candidate ,
I was it , and I assumed this was just protocol .
Four of those months were in Pakistan , and I had just spent a week with a journalist friend going to different madrasas , including one Islamic school visited by one of the bombers in the July 2005 attacks in London .
Possibly I caught their attention by poking around the Karachi Marriot ’s parking lot , across from the U.S. consulate , where a suicide bomber ’s attack had killed a U.S. diplomat just two months before .
How about the hundreds of phone calls I made from Pakistan to friends and family back home that inevitably mentioned the Taliban ’s resurgence and criticized President Bush .
Was I wiretapped ?
Certainly Homeland Security , whose stated mission is to “ lead the unified national effort to secure America ... prevent and deter terrorist attacks and protect against and respond to threats and hazards to the nation , ” had detained me for such a reason .

Or maybe officers had questions about the Jamaat - ud - Dawa rally I ’d witnessed in Kashmir .
The group was protesting against the United States because it recently had been added to the State Department ’s list of groups designated as terrorist organizations .
Then there was Lebanon , where I ’d traveled deep into the Hezbollah - held south .
If only .
No , these frontline warriors in the global war on terrorism at Homeland Security had far more pressing issues to question me about .
“ Why did you infringe on the Boston Celtics ’ copyright in Boston in 2003 ? ” asked my case officer , Malik -- ironically a Pakistani -- from behind his high desk .
Uh , because I used to sell T - shirts outside sporting events , I said , wondering what this had to do with national security .
“ You ’ve got a long record , ” he said .
Sure , for peddling “ Yankees Suck ” T - shirts -- sans permit , which is n’t a crime but a code violation -- not for promoting “ Bin Laden Rulz ! ” DVDs or the “ Idiot ’s Guide to Suicide Bombing . ”

“ You know , we could have you sent up to Boston for the unresolved T - shirt infractions , ” Malik said .
“ But what we ’re holding you for is an NYPD bench warrant from 2004 .
You were in a fight with a parking attendant , found not guilty and then missed a court date . ”
All true .
But how and why does Homeland Security share the NYPD ’s jurisdiction in cases unrelated to counter - terrorism ?
A fight over a parking space hardly counts as terrorism .
“ We ’re calling NYPD to come to pick you up , ” Malik told me , without asking a single question about Pakistan , terrorism , Islam or madrasas .
So I sat and waited .
Four DHS officers working two cases -- a Senegalese guy who was caught with $ 100,000 in a suitcase and mine -- could n’t even get the NYPD on the phone .
A debate then broke out among Malik , his co-worker and their boss about how to call the NYPD .
Six hours later , the DHS still had n’t gotten word from the NYPD .
A shift change was coming up , and officers are n’t allowed to leave until finishing all their cases .
Instead of protecting the homeland from such a dangerous T - shirt - selling , off - road - rager like me , Malik set me free , so he could get home in time to watch Mike and the Mad Dog ( “ Eh , is Pedro pitchin ’ tonight ? ” I overheard an officer ask ) .
As he closed out my paperwork , Malik asked , “ So , ah , Mr. LeMoine , why did you miss that court date anyway ? ”

“ I was in Iraq . ”
“ Doing what ?
Like a contractor , soldier ? ”
“ No .
I had volunteered to run a humanitarian program for the Coalition Provisional Authority but left when they started killing Westerners . ”
“ Damn terrorists .
Take care of that warrant .
And welcome home . ”

Welcome home indeed .
Homeland Security , the $ 40 - billion - a - year agency set up to combat terrorism after 9/11 , has been given universal jurisdiction and can hold anyone on Earth for crimes unrelated to national security -- even me for a court date I missed while I was in Iraq helping America deter terror -- without asking what I had been doing in Pakistan among Islamic extremists the agency is designated to stop .
Instead , some of its actions are erasing the lines of jurisdiction between local police and the federal state , scarily bringing the words “ police ” and “ state ” closer together .
As long as we allow Homeland Security to act like a Keystone Stasi , terrorism will continue to win in destroying our freedom .
The star shade would orbit a million miles from Earth
The daisy - shaped " occulter " , as it is known , would use a powerful telescope trailing thousands of miles behind .
The shade , described in the journal Nature , would stop light from the planet 's star swamping the telescope .
The concept by Professor Webster Cash of the University of Colorado has already received funding from Nasa .
He believes an occulter could be in space within seven years " stalking " Hubble 's successor , the James Webb Space Telescope , scheduled for launch in 2013 .
" We have proposed to build a star shade to launch a couple of months later and follow it out to its orbit , " he said .
" We believe this the fastest way to get operational . "
Planetary search
Scientists are already searching for planets orbiting stars other than the Sun .
Researchers hunt for these extra-solar planets , or exoplanets , using a number of techniques .
More than 170 have so far been discovered .
Other concepts to look for small planets are being considered
For example , astronomers look for the dimming of light as planets pass in front of their parent stars .
Indirect techniques like this mean that only relatively large planets tend to get identified .
Astrobiologists , though , are really interested in finding smaller , Earth - like planets which could , in theory , have the right conditions for supporting life .
To do this , astronomers need a method of directly imaging the dim planets .
Numerous proposals have been put forward , including massive optical telescopes on Earth , or flotillas of space - based telescopes such as the Europe 's Darwin mission or Nasa 's Terrestrial Planet Finder .
All these schemes are still in development .
Sun block
Dubbed the New World 's Observer , Professor Cash 's design would use a giant 45 m ( 148 ft ) daisy - shaped , plastic shield in tandem with a powerful telescope , trailing 15,000 km ( 9,300 miles ) behind .
The pair would orbit about a million miles ( 1.6 million km ) from the Earth at a position known as a Lagrange point .
It 's like a cricketer holding up his hand to block out the sunlight
Professor Webster Cash
To search for a planet , astronomers would pick a target star and move the shield in front of the telescope , using thrusters .
When the two align , the position of the shade ensures that excess light from the star is blocked , giving astronomers the maximum chance of spotting any small orbiting planet .
" It 's like a cricketer holding up his hand to block out the sunlight as he tracks a ball in the air , " said Professor Cash .
The pair would be held in position to give scientists time to image the planet and analyse its atmosphere for the chemical signatures of life .
It could also be used to map entire planetary systems trillions of miles away .
Future mission
The idea has already been given a huge boost by Nasa .
The US space agency 's Institute for Advanced Concepts gave the proposal $ 400,000 ( £ 220,000 ) .
Professor Cash and his team have also submitted a proposal to build a shade for the infra-red and visible James Webb Space Telescope .
However , some researchers believe that the Professor Cash and his team may still have some way to go before a star shade blasts into space .
" It 's an interesting alternative idea but I suspect that there are enormous technical challenges , " said Professor Timothy Naylor , an astrophysicist at Exeter University , UK .
Potential obstacles include carrying enough fuel for the thrusters and developing a method for keeping the shade and telescope in alignment .
" If you are trying to collect the light from a planet then you are going to have to stare at it for a relatively long period of time to do anything really useful , " he said .
The colour maps are the most detailed yet ( Image : Nasa / JPL / Space Science Institute )

The stunning maps were pieced together by researchers from images taken by the Cassini spacecraft as it approached Jupiter on 11 and 12 December 2000 .
Raw images exist in only two colours so the maps were coloured to show how Jupiter would appear to the naked eye .
They consist of one cylindrical map of the planet along with north and south polar maps of Jupiter .
The maps were created from 36 frames captured by Cassini as it passed the giant planet on a gravity assist manoeuvre to get it to Saturn .
Cassini arrived in Saturn orbit on 1 July 2004 .
Chaotic scene
The maps show a variety of colourful cloud features , including parallel reddish - brown and white bands , the Great Red Spot , multi-lobed chaotic regions , white ovals and many small vortices .
Many clouds appear in streaks and waves due to continual stretching and folding by Jupiter 's winds and by turbulence .

Recently , astronomers have noted that Jupiter appears to be " growing " another red spot , which they have nicknamed " Red Jr " .
Both red spots are actually raging storms in Jupiter 's cloud layer , but scientists do n't yet know how they get their characteristic brick colour .
Jupiter 's Great Red Spot is twice as wide as our planet and at least 300 years old .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of Nasa , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( Asi ) .

Posted on : Thursday , April 6 , 2006 Spill may have led to critical sickness By Beverly Creamer and Loren Moreno
Advertiser Staff Writers Johnson WHAT INFECTED OLIVER JOHNSON ?
Three bacteria types identified in Oliver Johnson ’s infection include : • Vibrio vulnificus :
A potentially deadly marine bacterium that lives in brackish seawater , but usually in small quantities .
Under certain conditions , such as when extra nutrients are available , the water is dirty or temperatures increase , its numbers can multiply .
The bacteria create toxins in humans that cause a flesh - eating cascade in the body .
• Aeromonas : Another virulent group of bacteria that can be devastating if they find their way into the bloodstream .
Can create disease rapidly , including flesh - eating symptoms that kill tissue .
They also can be contracted from eating shellfish , and restaurants have been known to warn people with significant liver disease or who are immuno - suppressed against eating shellfish .
• Enterococci :
These bacteria are found in sewage , and tested regularly as a measure of contamination .
Can cause gastrointestinal illnesses .

Zobel Dela Cruz photo GOT EVEN A TINY WOUND ?
STAY ASHORE
Anyone with injuries or wounds that provide germs with easy entrance into the body should clean the wounds well , said a state Health Department official .
" It goes back to using common sense for wound care , " said Dr. Sarah Park , deputy chief of the department ’s Disease Outbreak Control Division .
" If you ’ve got an open wound , be aware and take some time to think about whether it ’s worth exposing yourself to danger . "
Wounds should be washed thoroughly with soap and water , Park said .
It does n’t need to be anti-bacterial soap , she said .
If you must take risks  such as being in water with an open wound  make sure it ’s covered well with a waterproof dressing .
But first , said Park , " think twice about water exposure . "
" Whether it ’s a small nick or a huge cut , it does n’t matter .
It ’s still a break in your skin . "
And , " if a wound is red , warm , swollen or painful , go see your physician . "  Beverly Creamer Experts say a massive sewage spill could have combined with brackish conditions in the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor to create a bloom of virulent bacteria that has Oliver Johnson fighting a flesh - eating infection .
Johnson , 34 , a Honolulu mortgage broker , remained in extremely critical condition in intensive care last night at The Queen 's Medical Center , said Queen 's spokeswoman Monica Ivey .
Friends of Johnson said he was unconscious and on life support .
Police said Johnson reported being assaulted and thrown into the harbor Thursday night .
By Sunday he was in Queen 's with severe leg pain and swelling .
Doctors have amputated his left leg and were concerned that all four limbs would have to be taken to save his life .
Yesterday , friends said his condition has barely improved .
While a state health official said it 's unclear whether the 48 million gallons of raw sewage that poured into the Ala Wai Canal more than a week ago contributed to Johnson 's medical condition , University of Hawai 'i scientists said the sewage could have played a part .
Dr. Sarah Park , deputy chief of the state Health Department 's Disease Outbreak Control Division , said there 's no way to know if the sewage caused or affected Johnson 's infection .
" Is it because of sewage ?
We do n't know , " Park said .
" No one can answer that . "
However , UH scientists note that the raw sewage that flowed out of the canal , and into the boat harbor and the ocean , would have provided nutrients for the deadly bacteria to suddenly flourish .
FLESH - EATING EFFECT
Two bacteria  Vibrio vulnificus and aeromonas identified in Johnson 's wounds , according to the Health Department  are potentially deadly , and both can cause a flesh - eating effect .
" That would be an organism that can kill very quickly , " said Roger Fujioka , a UH microbiologist familiar with the vibrio bacteria that grow in seawater .
" It gets into the bloodstream . "
It 's the same bacteria that killed a man on the Big Island in 2001 , after he swam in brackish hot springs .
Fujioka said the bacteria are in the water all the time , but in very low concentrations .
There are n't enough bacteria to create infections , he said , " until something unusual happens like the sewage spill . "
Dr. Alan Tice , an infectious disease specialist with UH and Queen's , said several conditions combined in Johnson 's case to increase the danger : the bacteria bloom because of the sewage spill ; wounds Johnson suffered beforehand , giving bacteria easy access ; and the fact he had been drinking , which could have reduced his liver 's ability to filter them out .
But Fujioka said that safety need not be an issue for most people concerned about going into the water .
Fujioka said he does n't see a danger for coastal waters but believes signs should be posted at the harbor and the canal .
" Now that we know it 's there , signs at this point would be appropriate , " he said .
While most of the pollution warning signs along Waikiki beaches have been removed , some remain along the Ala Wai Canal , at the harbor and at Magic Island Lagoon .
Tice agreed with Fujioka about the role the sewage could have played .
" The Ala Wai likely had these organisms , but when you put sewage in , it 's a nutrient for the organisms and they grow more and become more concentrated , " Tice said .
" These organisms do n't cause disease or infections unless there 's some unusual exposure . "
But once that occurs , these bacteria " can cause a tremendous amount of disease very rapidly , " Tice said .
" The toxins will rupture the cells and shut down blood vessels and stop the circulation , " he said .
" Bacteria grow in dead tissue like wildfire . "
Early yesterday , doctors told Johnson 's friends and family that amputation of his right leg and arms may not be necessary after blood flow had improved , said retail consultant Stephany Sofos , a close friend of Johnson's .
But Zobel Dela Cruz , another friend who spent several hours yesterday at Queen 's , said doctors reported in the afternoon that it may still be necessary to amputate the right leg .
" Every day , his condition changes .
That 's the problem , " Dela Cruz said .
POLICE INVESTIGATION
City officials said they could not comment on this case .
" We remain concerned for the health of the public , and again urge people to heed the signs the city posted warning them to stay out of waters that may be contaminated , " said Bill Brennan , city spokesman .
The events leading to Johnson 's infection are sketchy , but Honolulu police spokeswoman Michelle
Yu said yesterday that officers responded to a " medical assist " call at Johnson 's Tradewinds apartment on Ala Moana at 6:30 p.m. Friday .
Johnson told police he had been assaulted the night before and thrown into the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor .
Police have opened an investigation , Yu said .
Dela Cruz , 35 , said Johnson told her an altercation occurred , but she was unwilling to share details so as not to compromise possible criminal investigations .
Friends pieced together these events leading to Johnson 's hospitalization , based on bits and pieces he had related to them :
On Thursday night , Johnson went to a bar near the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor .
That night he was drinking with people he had just met and was later assaulted .
He was thrown into the waters in the harbor and then climbed out .
Johnson returned to his apartment , where Dela Cruz said he took a shower and went to bed .
When Dela Cruz saw him on Friday , " He had scratches all over him , " she said .
" His feet  you could pretty much tell he was stepping on coral or something . "
' EXCRUCIATING PAIN '
According to the police report , Johnson called for emergency help on Friday night and was to be taken to Straub Hospital .
Dela Cruz said he was instead transferred to Queen 's because of his injuries .
She took him home from the Queen 's emergency room around 10:30 p.m. Friday .
" He left the hospital without any antibiotics or painkillers , " Dela Cruz said .
She said she suspected that Johnson did not inform emergency room personnel that he had fallen into the harbor .
" Maybe if they would have known , they would have treated him differently , " she said .
The next day , Johnson told friends he was still feeling sick .
Dieter Giblan , 34 , one of Johnson 's close friends , was supposed to go out with him on Saturday night .
But when Giblan called to confirm their plans , Johnson told him he had injured his leg .
" I told him to give me a call if he needed anything , " Giblan said .
" So he did and I went down there and gave him some Motrin . "
Giblan said Johnson had scratches and cuts on his legs and feet and complained about excruciating pain .
Johnson even suggested that he might lose his leg , Dela Cruz said .
" By Sunday his legs had ballooned , he was in excruciating pain , " Sofos said .
He was rushed to the Queen 's emergency room by ambulance .
There , his kidneys shut down , his liver failed and he had full - blown pneumonia , doctors told his friends .
Friends later were told that Johnson 's body was being attacked by a flesh - eating bacteria .
ORGANS SHUT DOWN
Doctors told friends that he was experiencing septic shock  an overwhelming infection that shuts down organs  and also had three different bacteria in his body .
While laboratory reports did not show the presence of type A strep that is usually associated with flesh - eating , Johnson 's friends insisted yesterday they were told differently by doctors .
Friends said Johnson is an outgoing , athletic guy who is always the life of the party .
" Oliver is what you call a connector , " Giblan said .
" He is just a dynamic person who brings different people together . "
Johnson kept friends in many different circles including colleagues .
Dela Cruz , also a mortgage broker , met Johnson 2 1/ 2 years ago when he first moved to Hawai'i and was working as a loan officer .
" We used to surf Bowls and Kaiser together , " Dela Cruz said .
" We were pretty close . "
Sofos said Johnson taught her to surf and that he loved the ocean .
" This is really hard , really tough on all of us .
It 's been such a roller coaster ride .
All we can do is hang in there and support each other , " Sofos said .
Johnson is originally from North Carolina but grew up in Florida , said Dela Cruz .
He moved to Hawai 'i after visiting a few years before .
" He fell in love with Hawai'i and he wanted to fall in love with an island girl , " she said .
Giblan said this incident has brought all of Johnson 's friends together , many of whom never knew each other .
" There are few people who can have no family in Hawai 'i but still have 20 people sitting in a waiting room hoping for the best , " Giblan said .
Johnson 's mother arrived from Florida on Monday .
" She 's a strong woman .
She 's hanging in there , " Dela Cruz said .
His father is expected to arrive today , she said .
Johnson 's mother declined to talk to media yesterday .

' Mumbai plane passengers were treated inhumanely '
August 25 , 2006 16:49 IST
" The way they got arrested inside the plane with everybody seeing how they got treated , I thought it was inhumane ... they were treated like dogs , " said Antunius Slotboom , who was on Northwest flight No 42 with 149 passengers that was escorted back to Schipol airport by F - 16 fighters on Wednesday .
The behaviour of the men , all residents of Mumbai , shortly after the plane took off from Amsterdam had triggered the security alert .
They did not put on their seat belts , changed seats and exchanged their mobile phones , arousing the suspicion of the crew and air marshals .
Slotboom , who arrived in Mumbai on Thursday night along with 17 other Mumbai - bound passengers of the Northwest flight , however , said their arrest seemed part of an " offensive against Arabic people " .
" They did not hit them ( arrested men ) but they pushed them .
They let them feel that they have no power , that the people who arrested them had all the power , " he said .
Slotboom said he too was kicked off the plane after he remarked that the arrests were akin to what the Germans had done under Hitler during World War II .
" They came to me and said , " You come with us and you are not allowed to fly any more , " he said .
Nitin Dalal , another passenger , said the arrested men " were not listening to the crew " and did things that made the crew " suspicious . "
Another passenger Bharat Menon told PTI , " The cabin crew was repeatedly asking the passengers to fasten their seat belts when one of the passengers received a call on his cell phone .
The person , who was travelling in Economy Class along with his friends then spoke bit excitedly over the phone ....
The behaviour of these men was suspicious and they were handing the cell phones to each other . "
The men were released after Dutch authorities found no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities .
Why Do We Need Government ?
May 2 , 2006
About twenty years ago a very intelligent man , whom Ill call Robert ( hes actually a sort of composite of several men ) , told me he was an anarchist .
He didnt believe in any government , period .
At the time I considered myself a conservative , with libertarian leanings .
Much as I respected Robert , I believed in limited government under the U.S. Constitution  but none at all ?
That was taking a good idea too far , I thought .
Notice the illogic of my reaction .
I was thinking of a philosophy as a matter of personal taste , as if you could draw an arbitrary line and stop there .
 Would you prefer a little bit of government , a moderate amount , or a lot of it ? 
After a while ( years , actually ) it sank in that Robert wasnt just telling me what quantity of government hed prefer .
He was saying that the whole idea of it was wrong in principle  no matter whether it was democratic , Communist , monarchist , Christian , or something else .
He would agree that some are worse than others , but he insisted that all were wrong .
Any government is a monopoly of organized force , inherently unjustifiable ; and once accepted , its bound to get out of control sooner or later .
This notion is hard for Americans to grasp , let alone assent to .
After all , we have what looks like a solid rationale for government in our Declaration of Independence , plus a practical plan for keeping it within due limits in our Constitution and Bill of Rights .
True , American government has become a staggering tangle of laws , powers , regulations , and taxes , with recurrent wars , public debt , debased money , and countless other evils , but couldnt this be cured by returning to the Constitution ?
That s what I used to think .
Besides , what would we replace the government with ?
Who would protect us from violent crime and foreign enemies ?
Who would coin the money ?
Who would pave the streets and fix the potholes ?
Others would ask who would feed the destitute , care for the sick and elderly , protect minorities , and cope with myriad other crises , emergencies , and easily imaginable disasters  most of which , by the way , didnt use to be thought of as responsibilities of government .
Everyone has a horrible fantasy that makes the actual horror seem ( to him ) worth putting up with .
Read the label on a can of soup , and think how many laws and regulations the vendor has to comply with .
The rationale for these is that the public has to be protected  from what ?
Unhealthy ingredients of some sort , I suppose .
But would we really be in any peril if there were no government enforcing these costly restrictions ?
Would it be in the sellers interest to poison his customers , even if there were no legal penalty for doing so ?
How often did that happen before all these laws were imposed ?
Roadside fruit stands are still unregulated .
Are these dangers to the purchaser ?
The other day I was ticketed , and my car briefly impounded , when a policeman noticed that I was driving with a cracked windshield .
My car had passed the required safety inspection and had the required sticker before some vandal had thrown rocks at it , so I thought I was legal .
I wasnt hurting or threatening anyone ; I posed no danger I could see .
The cop was as polite as a man with a pistol can be , but as he ordered the car towed away I asked him quietly ,  Just who are you protecting from me ?
The answer was a vague mumble about  the public . 
Later I joked to friends that Id been carjacked .
An armed man had seized my car , I explained .
Of course he had a badge , a uniform , and some sort of law on his side , so I , not he , was the criminal .
Heaven help me if I d tried to defend my property .
Self - defense would have been an even more serious offense .
By submitting to force , I confined the evil to a mere nuisance .
This time .
Carjacking or impoundment ?
We now have two vocabularies for wrongs , depending on whether private persons or government agents commit them .
This is the difference between mass murderand national defense .
Between extortion and taxation .
Between counterfeiting and inflation .
And so on .
Other examples will occur to the astute reader .
Do you smell a fault ?
No wonder Frédéric Bastiat described government as organized plunder . 
Yet for most of my life , I believed that social order depended on government .
That is , I believed that freedom depended on force , and ultimately that a great good depended on a great evil .
Im afraid most people believe such things , and accept armed men in uniforms as their benefactors .

For more than a decade , Beijing helped give Tehran a head start in its nuclear program 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
2006-09-18 04:00:00 PDT
Beijing -- With Iran 's nuclear enrichment program at the center of high - stakes multinational negotiations , China is in the awkward position of passing judgment in the U.N. Security Council on the very technology it helped the Islamic republic accumulate .
For more than a decade , starting in 1984 , China aided Iran with its fledgling nuclear program .
Although Beijing no longer is providing such assistance , Tehran 's weapons program would be far less sophisticated had it not received significant Chinese help .
That assistance included training Iranian scientists , helping to build facilities , and direct military aid and hardware sales , according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative , a Washington - based research group .
China also supplied Iran 's first nuclear reactor in 1991 , in addition to hardware and support .
" Between 1985 and 1997 , China was Iran 's most important nuclear partner , " said John Garver , associate at Georgia Institute of Technology 's China Research Center and author of " China and Iran : Ancient Partners in a Post - Imperial World . "
In 1997 , after years of intense criticism from the United States and others , China pledged to end its nuclear assistance .
Since then , there has been no direct evidence otherwise .
But to some experts , China is working to help Iran -- with which it has significant oil deals -- in more subtle ways .
" Tehran 's intransigence in this standoff has been made possible in part by its strategic partnership with Beijing .
Since the start of international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program some three years ago , China has worked actively to dilute the effectiveness of any global response .
It has done so initially through its vociferous opposition to Iran 's referral to the United Nations Security Council , and more recently by its resistance to the imposition of multilateral sanctions against Tehran , " Ilan Berman , vice president for policy of the American Foreign Policy Council , said in testimony last week before the U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission , which advises Congress on matters concerning China .
As the Bush administration has led the drive to rein in Iran 's nuclear ambitions by pushing for Security Council sanctions , China has strived to mollify its top trading partner , the United States .
But at the same time , the Beijing government is pushing for more talks and fewer threats of sanctions against its longer - term ally and closer political confederate , Iran .
If push comes to shove , analysts say , it 's difficult to tell which side China would ultimately choose .
Some contend that China will do its best to ensure it does n't have to choose , while also continuing its cautious route of bolstering economic ties to buffer Iran against potential U.S. - led economic sanctions .
" The Chinese will work very hard to make it look like they are not choosing ( the ) U.S. over Tehran , but they will also have to not appear obstructionist , " said Adam Segal , senior fellow for China studies with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York .
The situation , said Segal , is markedly similar in many ways to China 's current position in the North Korean weapons imbroglio .
As Beijing consistently calls for more negotiations and publicly condemns its longtime Asian ally , it shies away from the U.S. - led push for tough sanctions .
At a European Union summit last weekend , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said his country is unlikely to support sanctions against Iran .
" To mount pressure or impose sanctions will not necessarily bring about a peaceful solution , " Wen said .
" China helps to move things along , but does not make the difficult choices that could resolve the crisis , " Segal said of the Iranian and North Korean nuclear standoffs .
Indeed , China 's mantra throughout the recent escalation with Iran has been a call for more talking .
" We have consistently stood for the resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue through negotiation and dialogue , " Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in Beijing earlier this month .
In its opposition to U.N. sanctions on Tehran , China has echoed the stance of Russia , Iran 's more forthright ally .
Both China and Russia are permanent , veto - wielding members of the Security Council , both have important trade ties with Iran , and both chafe at being pressured to follow U.S. policy initiatives .
In the past five years , China and Iran have significantly deepened and expanded their economic ties .
That two - way trade totaled $ 6 billion in the first half of 2006 , more than double the annual trade just five years ago .
China , a burgeoning economic superpower whose 10.9 percent growth last year made it the world 's fourth - largest economy , has an unceasing appetite for energy .
In part thanks to major deals reached in the past three years , Iran now supplies 11 to 13 percent of China 's oil , according to government and analyst estimates .
China committed $ 3 billion this year to help increase yields from Iran 's oil fields -- an important investment , noted Jephraim Gundzik , president of Condor Advisers , which specializes in emerging - markets research .
" Beijing is essentially helping Tehran to lessen the impact of sanctions by increasing the country 's domestic fuel production , " said Gundzik .
Yet the relationship is not only about oil , and it stretches back centuries .
Both nations are proud , ancient non-Western civilizations that " deeply resent perceived contemporary Western presumptions of superiority , " said Garver , the Georgia Tech scholar .
The two see each other as kindred spirits in an era of rapid global Westernization .
In 2001 , Chinese President Hu Jintao , then the vice president , made an official state visit to Tehran marking 30 years of diplomatic relations .
Hu lobbied for more trade between the two nations and harkened back to their ancient ties .
That theme -- of two countries doing business over the centuries as part of the ancient Silk Road trade route -- has often been repeated in state - run media in China over the ensuing years .
" Mega - Chinese investment in Iran is a strong demonstration of trust between Iran and China , but the relationship between the two is much deeper , " said Gundzik .
" In geopolitical terms , neither country wants the U.S. to become the dominant power in the Middle East .
" Iran does n't want to be controlled by Washington , and China does not want its energy supply controlled by the U.S.
As a result , the two countries are working together to thwart the U.S. "
What keeps Iran and China tied , and tilts the balance at the United Nations as negotiators seek a solution , may be a simple distaste for U.S. world dominance .
As Garver put it , " Neither likes the fact that the United States is a sole global superpower . "

Virginia Court Strikes Down Law Against Sex by Singles
AP January 15 , 2005 Also see Virginia and Six Other States Still Classify Cohabitation as Illegal
The Virginia Ruling suggests sodomy law is unconstitutional as well , but leaves it alone .
RICHMOND : Supreme Court on Friday struck down an ancient and rarely enforced state law prohibiting sex between unmarried people .
The unanimous ruling strongly suggests that a separate anti-sodomy law also is unconstitutional , although that statute is not directly affected .
The justices based their ruling on a U.S. Supreme Court decision voiding an anti-sodomy law in Texas .
" This case directly affects only the fornication law but makes it absolutely clear how the court would rule were the sodomy law before it , " said Kent Willis , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Virginia .
" It 's a strong message to legislators that they must repeal Virginia 's sodomy law , " he said .
" Now both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme Court have spoken on essentially the same issue . "
Virginia 's anti-sodomy law prohibits oral and anal sex even for married couples , but gay - rights advocates say the statute is only used to target homosexuals .
Legislators for years have rejected efforts to repeal the law .
They left it on the books again last year even after the Lawrence v. Texas decision held that such laws is unconstitutional .
" We find no relevant distinction between the circumstances in Lawrence and the circumstances in the present case , " the Virginia justices said in voiding the fornication law .
The court said , " decisions by married or unmarried persons regarding their intimate physical relationship are elements of their personal relationships that are entitled to due process protection . "
The ruling stemmed from a woman 's lawsuit seeking $ 5 million in damages from a man who infected her with herpes .
She claims the man did not inform her that he was infected before they had sex .
Richmond Circuit Judge Theodore J. Markow threw out the lawsuit , ruling that the woman was not entitled to damages because she had participated in an illegal act .
The Supreme Court reinstated the lawsuit .
" The ruling recognizes that a sin greater than fornication is not telling someone you have a sexually transmitted disease and then not practicing safe sex , " said the woman 's lawyer , Neil Kuchinsky " The rule now should be : If not asked , do tell . "
The law against fornication had been on the books since the early 1800s but was last enforced against consenting adults in 1847 , according to Paul McCourt Curley , attorney for the defendant in the lawsuit .
Curley said he sees nothing wrong with having laws on the books , even if they are not enforced , that say , " these are the ideals and morals of the state of Virginia . "
He said the ruling sends a message that virtually anything goes even adultery as long as sex is consensual .
However , the justices noted that their ruling " does not affect the commonwealth 's police powers regarding regulation of public fornication , prostitution , or other such crimes .
Dolphins sing ' Batman ' theme Discovery News

The findings , outlined in two studies , are the first time that nonhuman mammals have demonstrated they can recognise rhythms and reproduce them vocally .

" Clearly , aspects of those domains are available to other species . "
The studies will be presented at the joint meeting of the

Harley , who is associate professor of social sciences at the
The researchers first had an adult male bottlenose dolphin position itself in front of an underwater sound projector , called a hydrophone , that produced six different 14 kiloherz , 4 second rhythms .
The dolphin was rewarded for performing a certain behaviour to each rhythm .
For example , when rhythm 1 played , it waved its pectoral fin and when rhythm 2 played , it tossed a ball .
The various rhythms were played at different frequencies and tempos to ensure the dolphin was recognising rhythms instead of just frequencies or sound durations .
Another adult male was trained to produce similar rhythms using a pneumatic switch , essentially a small , air - filled ball connected to a computer that then generated sounds whenever the dolphin pressed the switch .
" The dolphin was reinforced for producing a specific rhythm to a specific object , " says Harley .
" For example , when we presented him with a Batman doll , he received a fish for producing a specific rhythm , in this case , a short sound and then a long one . "
" If you recall the original Batman TV series musical intro you 'll probably remember the way they sang ' Bat - maaaaaaaan ' , " she adds .
The dolphin spontaneously vocalised to the rhythms , so the researchers started to reward the male with fish whenever it matched its ' singing ' to the rhythms .
By the end of the studies , the scientists could show an object , such as the Batman doll , which represented a certain rhythm - vocalisation combo to the dolphin , and it would create the correct sounds both vocally and using the switch .
Batmaaaaaaan
Gordon Bauer , associate professor of psychology at the New College of Florida who did not work on the studies , says , " This is the first report , to my knowledge , of a nonhuman mammal 's ability to discriminate rhythmic patterns . "
But Bauer doubts that dolphins realise they are producing what people consider ' music ' .
" I think music is a human construct , " he says .
" I doubt that it has pertinence to animals , although the elements of music , such as pitch , time , timbre , rhythm , etc , may be incorporated into animal communication . "
Harley agrees , and hopes the everyday vocalisations of dolphins will be analysed in terms of their rhythmic content .
In the near future , she and her team are planning to test the dolphins on their ability to recognise recordings of their own rhythms by having them associate their own sound creations with identifying objects similar to the Batman doll .
Scientists have taught dolphins to combine both rhythm and vocalisations to produce music , resulting in an extremely high - pitched , short version of thetheme song .

Whistleblower 's Attack on the Fed
by George F. Smith
Exclusive to STR
August 30 , 2006
The July , 2006 issue of Whistleblower magazine , a monthly publication of WorldNetDaily.com , is devoted to educating its readers about ' America 's all - powerful banking cartel , the Federal Reserve . '
It relies heavily on articles by G. Edward Griffin and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas to tell us where the Fed came from , how it works , and what we ought to do about it .
Griffin 's essays are excerpted from his masterwork on the Fed , The Creature from Jekyll Island : A Second Look at the Federal Reserve , while Paul 's articles were previously published on LewRockwell.com .
Together their writing provides a devastating indictment of the Federal Reserve System .
In a lead editorial , editor / publisher Joseph Farah describes the Fed as 'a legalized counterfeiting operation -- pure and simple . '
He says further that ' rarely in the history of American journalism has this topic been so fully , factually and courageously explored ' as it has in this 47 - page issue of Whistleblower .
In a section called ' Voices from the past , ' which runs beneath the articles beginning on page 22 , readers are hit with pithy quotes on money and banking from familiar figures in history .
A personal favorite comes from Sir Josiah Stamp , a former central banker in England :
Bankers own the earth .
Take it away from them , but leave them the power to create money and control credit , and with a flick of a pen they will create enough to buy it back .
One of Ron Paul 's articles refers readers to Murray Rothbard 's book , What Has Government Done to Our Money ? , for an explanation of the origin of money as the market 's preferred commodity for exchanging up through its takeover and gradual destruction by bankers and politicians .
The July Whistleblower also includes a brief speech Paul delivered on the House floor in 2002 in which he introduced legislation to abolish the Fed .
He includes with his bill Lew Rockwell 's article on the benefits of a genuine gold standard called ' Why Gold ? '
Griffin on the Fed 's origin and methodology
In the first of his essays , Griffin explains why the world 's leading banking dynasties -- Morgan , Rockefeller , and Kuhn , Loeb -- wanted a central bank and how they had to promote it to win public support and get it through Congress .
Representatives from each banking group , along with two government sponsors , gathered in secret on Jekyll Island , Georgia in 1910 to devise a system that would address the following problems :
1 . How to thwart competition from small banks .
2 . How to create a more ' elastic currency .'
3 . How to coordinate the rate of inflation for each of its member banks .
4 . In the event the whole banking system fails , how to make the taxpayers pay for the losses .
5 . ' How to convince Congress that the scheme was a measure to protect the public . '
As Griffin writes :
To cover the fact that a central bank is merely a cartel which has been legalized , its proponents had to lay down a thick smoke screen of technical jargon focusing always on how it would supposedly benefit commerce , the public and the nation ; how it would lower interest rates , provide funding for needed industrial projects and prevent panics in the economy .
There was not the slightest glimmer that , underneath it all , was a master plan which was designed from top to bottom to serve private interests at the expense of the public .
This was , nevertheless , the cold reality , and the more perceptive bankers were well aware of it .
In his other article , Griffin describes in detail the Fed 's practice of converting debt into money , a process he calls the Mandrake Mechanism .
As with all his writing , it is presented with clarity and relevant references , making his call to abolish the Fed all the more compelling .
Overall , this special issue of Whistleblower -- thanks mostly to heavy hitters Griffin and Paul -- fights a good fight against one of the most nefarious scams ever created .
Nor is this WND 's first major assault on the Fed .
In March , 2001 , while Alan Greenspan was trying to inflate the economy out of its necessary period of readjustment following the boom of the '90s , WND published another issue on the Fed written by Anne Williamson in which she concluded ' that [ perhaps ] somewhere in America 's near future awaits a war that will be fought for no other purpose than to re-establish the financial elite 's profits and the political elite 's pride of place . '
Two years later Bush invaded Iraq to the hosannahs of WND , apparently forgetting the prophetic analysis of a veteran journalist .
Why Milton Friedman ?
The July Whistleblower also includes some remarks from Milton Friedman criticizing Federal Reserve policies of the early Thirties , seemingly as part of the argument for abolishing the Fed .
Whistleblower editor David Kupelian tells us that 1 ) according to the Noble - Prize winning Friedman , who Kupelian openly admires , the Fed caused the Great Depression , and 2 ) Fed chairman Ben Bernanke admitted the Fed 's culpability in a 2002 speech in honor of Friedman 's 90th birthday .
It sounds like an editorial fit until you examine the details .
Kupelian 's article includes an excerpt from a 2000 PBS interview with Friedman in which he makes a few comments on the relationship between the Fed and the Depression .
The Fed had been established to avoid ' what actually happened , ' according to Friedman , by which he means the Fed should 've prevented the recession following the Crash from turning ' into a major catastrophe . '
Yet from 1929 to 1933 , the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by a third , he points out .
In Friedman 's view , this was the Fed 's great failing because it triggered bank failures that resulted in heavy losses for millions of people who trusted the banks to keep their money safe .
The Fed had the knowledge and the power to prevent such a calamity , but failed to do so .
Kupelian quotes Bernanke as telling Friedman , ' You 're right , we [ brought on the Depression ] .
We 're very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wo n't do it again . '
Let 's clarify Bernanke 's remark .
When he says ' thanks to you , we wo n't do it again , ' he means he 'll follow Friedman 's general advice and try to destroy the dollar at a low and steady rate ( which he calls ' inflation targeting ' ) , but if the dollar should threaten to recover in value , he 'll bring in the helicopters and dump money in the laps of preferred investors .
The dollar will thus continue on its course to oblivion , but most people wo n't notice because it could take years to accomplish , and very importantly , it might postpone an economic collapse .
If the Fed is eager to follow Friedman 's advice , and if Kupelian believes his advice is correct , why is this presented as consistent with the views of Paul and Griffin ?
Friedman is a friend of the Fed. Paul and Griffin want it abolished .
They will never be the guests of honor at a dinner in which a Fed bigwig apologizes for its very existence .
Furthermore , Friedman likes fiat money .
He rejects gold because people have to dig it out of South Africa only to bury it in Fort Knox -- a waste of real resources .
Both Paul and Griffin want a free market dollar , and when people were ' free to choose , ' they chose gold and silver .
Yes , they require ' real resources , ' but they 're worth the price .
As Rothbard notes , gold ' must be extracted from the ground , by the same costly process as governs the supply of any other commodities on the market .
Essentially the choice is : gold or government .'
Or as Walter Block eloquently states :
[ G] old is like an insurance policy .
Just as locks , fences and doors are used to preclude losses from theft -- even though they come only at the expense of real resources -- so , too , does the costly use of gold attain something desirable , namely , protection from statist monetary depredations .
Though marred by the inconsistent discussion of Friedman 's views , the July Whistleblower is a gold mine of information about the founding of the Fed and the intricacies of its counterfeiting process .
Even if you 've read Griffin 's book and Paul 's many articles on the Fed , I strongly recommend it .

URLs changed to protect the innocent .
One of my favorite porn - erm , I mean , " content " downloading programs is Joe Drago 's URLToys .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's the Porn Hacker 's Swiss Army knife .
At its core , URLToys is a nothing more than a perl script .
Some people have added some fancy UIs and what not on top of it , but in the end , the script where the goodness lies .
Now initially the word " perl script " might scare some of you away , because it means we 'll be working with the command line interface .
But , my friends , the command line is good !
Not only does it make you feel all cool and h4x0ry when you are using it , but it also does n't clutter your system processes and memory with a bunch of pointless compu-bling .
When you 're downloading 4 gigs of porn , efficiency is good .
Additionally , if the boss comes by and sees some kind of involved terminal process going on , he or she might actually think you are working !
Anyway , let 's first get URLToys set up .
It may seem like a lot of work at first , but it will be worth it , trust me .
At the end of this tutorial I 'll show you how you can then use URLToys to perform a Fusk without having to sign up for websites like fusker .
lewww.com , much less use your web - browser at all .
No need to install Perl for Windows peeps !
I finally got to try out the stand - alone version of URLToys for Windows last night and it works great .
It 's highly recommended you go this route instead if you do n't yet have Perl installed on your machine .
Simply run the installer and then launch URLToys from the Start menu .
This will take you Windows people straight to the URLToys prompt - no need to install additional modules .
For the rest of us non-Windows users ( OS X , FreeBSD , Linux , etc. ) , step one will be to download the standalone version of URLToys , save it somewhere safe , and then try to run it by typing into your terminal program :
Or on Windows ( see this link for help ) :
Now it may very well be that after you hit enter you will get an error similar to this :
That 's no problem .
All it means is that your version of Perl is missing a module that URLToys needs .
In the case above , it 's LWP .
The easiest way to install Perl modules is via what is called the CPAN shell .
To start up the CPAN shell , run this command : ( You Windows people have it a little easier because you will have the Perl Package Manager which will let you browse - to and install modules via a user interface .
Or , again , just use the standalone URLToys installer to avoid all the module fuss . )
If this is the first time you have ever run the CPAN shell you might have to go through a few configuration steps .
Usually you are safe to simply go with the default answers .
Eventually , you should get a prompt like this :
From here , installing the LWP module is as simple as : The CPAN shell will then go through the rigamarole of compiling and installing the LWP module .
Once LWP is installed , you can type " quit " to exit the CPAN shell .
Then , try running URLToys again .
If you do n't need to install anything else , you will hopefully see :
Which means you 're in baby !
As I mentioned before , URLToys does A LOT of stuff .
Way too much to fit in a single post .
So , lets just try something we are already familiar with , a Fusk !
To Fusk the example from " A Fusking We Will Go " , it 's just a matter of entering :
And then pressing return .
Once you do , you will see the number " 50 " next to the URLToys prompt .
This number represents how many files we have in our URLToys queue thanks to our Fusk command .
To see a list of all these files , just type the " list " command and press return :
And then to download the files to your hard drive , use the " get " command : Awww , a cute little ASCII progress bar and everything !
Notice that URLToys nicely skips past the files that do n't exist .
Once your downloading is done , type " exit " to quit out of URLToys .
Your picutres will have been downloaded into whatever directory you ran URLToys from , typically in a folder called " 00000 . "
( This number represents your URLToys session .
If you were to start up URLToys agian immediately after this and perform another Fusk , those files would be in a directory called " 00001 . " )
There you go , from the web to your HD in only a few minutes and with no browser middle - man , no mess and no fuss .
Make sure you hang on to URLToys , because we have a lot more to talk about at a later date .
In the meantime , enjoy !
They routinely experience bleeding and nausea , according to a sworn statement by the camp 's chief doctor , seen by The Observer .
' Experience teaches us ' that such symptoms must be expected ' whenever nasogastric tubes are used , ' says the affidavit of Captain John S Edmondson , commander of Guantánamo 's hospital .
The procedure - now standard practice at Guantánamo - ' requires that a foreign body be inserted into the body and , ideally , remain in it . '
But staff always use a lubricant , and 'a nasogastric tube is never inserted and moved up and down .
It is inserted down into the stomach slowly and directly , and it would be impossible to insert the wrong end of the tube . '
Medical personnel do not insert nasogastric tubes in a manner ' intentionally designed to inflict pain . '
It is painful , Edmonson admits .
Although ' non-narcotic pain relievers such as ibuprofen are usually sufficient , sometimes stronger drugs , ' including opiates such as morphine , have had to be administered .
Thick , 4.8 mm diameter tubes tried previously to allow quicker feeding , so permitting guards to keep prisoners in their cells for more hours each day , have been abandoned , the affidavit says .
The new 3 mm tubes are ' soft and flexible ' .
The London solicitors Allen and Overy , who represent some of the hunger strikers , have lodged a court action to be heard next week in California , where Edmondson is registered to practise .
They are asking for an order that the state medical ethics board investigate him for ' unprofessional conduct ' for agreeing to the force - feeding .
Edmonson 's affidavit , in response to a lawsuit on behalf of detainees on hunger strike since last August , was obtained last week by The Observer , as a Guantánamo spokesman confirmed that the number of hunger strikers has almost doubled since Christmas , to 81 of the 550 detainees .
Many have been held since the camp opened four years ago this month , although they not been charged with any crime , nor been allowed to see any evidence justifying their detention .
This and other Guantánamo lawsuits now face extinction .
Last week , President Bush signed into law a measure removing detainees ' right to file habeas corpus petitions in the US federal courts .
On Friday , the administration asked the Supreme Court to make this retroactive , so nullifying about 220 cases in which prisoners have contested the basis of their detention and the legality of pending trials by military commission .
Although some prisoners have had to be tied down while being force - fed , ' only one patient ' has had to be immobilised with a six - point restraint , and ' only one ' passed out .
' In less than 10 cases have trained medical personnel had to use four - point restraint in order to achieve insertion . '
Edmondson claims the actual feeding is voluntary .
During Ramadan , tube - feeding takes place before dawn .
Article 5 of the 1975 World Medical Association Tokyo Declaration , which US doctors are legally bound to observe through their membership of the American Medical Association , states that doctors must not undertake force - feeding under any circumstances .
Dr David Nicholl , a consultant neurologist at Queen Elizabeth 's hospital in Birmingham , is co-ordinating opposition to the Guantánamo doctors ' actions from the international medical community .
' If I were to do what Edmondson describes in his statement , I would be referred to the General Medical Council and charged with assault , ' he said .
· Yesterday the new German Chancellor Angela Merkel became the latest leader to condemn the United States for practices at the prison .
In a magazine interview days before her first visit as premier to the US , Merkel said Washington should close Guantánamo and find other ways of dealing with terror suspects .
Dick Mol , a paleontologist in Holland , and Bernard Buigues , curator of the Mammoth Museum in Siberia , examine the remains of a woolly mammoth .
Scientists have mapped part of the genome of the woolly mammoth , a huge mammal that 's been extinct for about 10,000 years .
The breakthrough could lead to recreating the creatures .
A team led by Hendrik Poinar at McMaster University unlocked secrets of the animal 's nuclear DNA by working with a well - preserved 27,000 - year - old specimen from Siberia .
Colleagues at Penn State sequenced 1 percent of the genome in a few hours and say they expect to finish the whole genome in about a year if funding is provided .
" We were stunned , " Poinar said today .
“ Once you successfully sequence a genome , there are a million interesting questions one can begin to address . "
The researcher can now begin to determine what separates mammoths from their closest living relatives , the Indian elephant .
Make mammoths ?
“ More importantly our discovery means that recreating extinct hybrid animals is theoretically possible , " Poinar said .
The scientists are already pondering the ethics involved .
" McMaster is already planning the first conference devoted to the ethics of bringing extinct organisms back to life , " said Mamdouh Shoukri , vice - president research and international affairs .
" We have an obligation as scientists to explore and maintain the responsible use of research . "
Researchers admit , however , that creating an extinct beast from scratch is not something they know how to do yet .
“ While we can now retrieve the entire genome of the woolly mammoth , that does not mean we can put together the genome into organized chromosomes in a nuclear membrane with all the functional apparatus needed for life , " said Ross MacPhee , a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History who worked on the project .
" We can't even do that with modern DNA . "
The study will be detailed later this week in the journal Science .
The decoding was announced earlier than planned because a second study was reported in the media Sunday .
In the other work , researchers sequenced mitochondrial DNA from a mammoth , but that reveals only the maternal side of evolution .
Poinar said his project decodes both sides by looking at the nuclear DNA , where the majority of life 's software resides .
Hunted by humans
Mammoths roamed Siberia and America during the Pleistocene era , which ended 10,000 years ago as the last Ice Age retreated .
Studies have shown that their demise was due largely to hunting by humans , not from climate change as one theory held .
The breakthrough has been anticipated recently as other work has made similar progress .
Scientists in June said they had unraveled snippets of the genetic code of an extinct bear species .
Other researchers have expressed a desire to revive the mammoth by injecting frozen sperm DNA — if they can find some — into elephants .
Over several generations , they 'd create a creature that 's 88 percent mammoth .
The DNA revealed by Poinar 's groups is " very similar to the African elephant genome , " the group writes in their journal paper .
In August , an American research team proposed restoring elephants , cheetahs and other African animals to the American plains .
And a Russian team has created a Pleistocene Park to investigate mysteries of the mammoth .

The woolly mammoth stood 12 - feet tall and weighed seven tons [ illustration ] .
It had a shaggy , dark brown coat , a big head , small ears , small tail , and long , curved tusks .
Females were slightly smaller .
Both sexes had a hump at the top of their backs , which were actually mounds of hair and fat .

If I were to tell you about an actor that has worked consistently in major Hollywood movies for over two decades , has worked often with Academy - Award winning writers , actors and directors and has a legion of fans who follow him in all his movies no matter the genre or story , what would your immediate reaction to this person be ?
Would you think “ Wow , this guy must be great .
Twenty years of studio movies , he must be talented ? ”
Based solely on the description of the actor written above , with no names attached , would you ever in your right mind assume that the person was bad at his craft ; that he sucked ?
Chances are you would n’t .
And yet , if after giving you that description I told you the actor was Keanu Reeves , I bet I know what your reaction would be .
“ He sucks ! ”
I just do n’t get it .
In interviews he comes across as an insightful , cerebral , well - rounded person who does n’t mire himself in the vagaries of stardom and never asks for more than he needs .
His co-stars glow about him , and quality directors line up to put him in their movies .
And yet , for some inexplicable reason , he is plagued by this notion that he is dumb .
And that he is untalented .
And I just do n’t get it .
How can he suck if he ’s still making big movies twenty years into his career ?
The majority of his early peers are gone and forgotten ; actors like Christian Slater , Judd Nelson , Emilio Estevez , Andrew McCarthy , et al , and yet here he is coming out with a huge new movie this Friday ( The Lake House ) .
He has survived critical drubbings more severe than he deserves .
He has been heckled and flamed and deplored because he has good looks , but a vacant affectation .
He is perceived as a flat actor , devoid of charisma , empty of emotional depth .
And yet , he ’s still here making big movies .
I have been a fan of Keanu since his Bill & Ted days .
I have defended my love for the man who would be Neo to every one of my friends and family .
I have gotten into screaming matches with people I barely know , just because I heard them bash the man .
And I have never lost an argument about him , because no one can prove that he is n’t a gifted , talented performer .
They lose , because I can prove that he is .
But my arguing stops now .
Once and for all I am going to prove to the world that Keanu Reeves does NOT suck .
And I will prove it to you in 40 point list format .
I promise when you finish reading this piece you will respect , admire and appreciate the talent that is Keanu Reeves .
Let the proving begin …
1 . If you were n’t impressed by Keanu ’s mean , Southern Redneck in The Gift or at least agree he was impressively intense , well then we have nothing to talk about .
Just click the “ X ” and leave this site immediately .
2. Contrary to popular belief , has never won a Razzie Award .
Which is more than I can say for these actors : Halle Berry , Charlton Heston , John Travolta , Bruce Willis , Kevin Costner , Demi Moore , Marlon Brando , Dennis Hopper , Sylvester Stallone , Sharon Stone , Faye Dunaway , Woody Harrelson and Madonna
3 . Without being asked , gave $ 38 Million dollars to The Wachowski Brothers so they could properly finish the Matrix sequels .
$ 38 Million !
Let ’s see Tom Cruise drop that much for one of his clunkers .
4 . Has worked with the following critically acclaimed directors : Francis Ford Coppola , Ron Howard , Bernardo Bertolucci , Gus Van Sant , Sam Raimi , Taylor Hackford , Lawrence Kasdan , Stephen Frears , Richard Linklater
5. “ Whoa ”
6. Keanu ’s name means “ cool breeze over the mountains ” in Hawaiian , which is pretty cool .
Compare that to Jean Claude Van Damme , which is loosely translated in German as “ giant douchebag ” .
7 . The night before he was to shoot his kissing - heavy love scene for A Walk in the Clouds , Keanu took a hockey puck to his mouth , requiring six stitches .
He still showed up the next day for work and shot the scene over the course of six hours .
Let ’s see a pussyboy like Orlando Bloom do that !
Keanu is hardcore .
8 . Showing extreme foresight and good judgment ( which is more than I can say for Sandra Bullock ) , passed on an easy $ 10 million payday to star in Speed 2 , because he did n’t think the script was any good .
And he was right .
Tell me again why people think he ’s stupid ?
9 . Deferred part of his salary on The Replacements ( 2000 ) so Gene Hackman could be cast .
Obviously , the man knows what makes a movie great .
And that would be the Hack Man .
10 . Has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
They do n’t just give those out , you know .
11 . A personal quote : “ I ’m a meathead , man .
You ’ve got smart people , and you ’ve got dumb people .
I just happen to be dumb . ”
At least the man is brave enough to admit who he is .
12 . Is not nearly as stiff , wooden or stupid as Paul Walker .
13 . Has starred in six $ 100 Million grossing movies .
Which is more than the following actors who many claim are “ better ” than Keanu : Johnny Depp , George Clooney , Russell Crowe , Leonardo DiCaprio , Colin Farrell , Richard Gere , Hugh Grant , Ethan Hawke , Val Kilmer , Jude Law , Matthew McConaughey , Sean Penn , Joaquin Phoenix , Tim Robbins , Kevin Spacey , Vince Vaughn , Dennis Quiad and Al freakin’ Pacino !
14 . Almost never shows up in tabloids , an extremely welcome quality considering the glut of media whores we have today ( ahem , TomKat ! ) .
15 . Yeah , it gave people the impression he ’s an idiot , and no , it ’s not Shakespeare , but c’mon , who does n’t love Bill & Ted ’s Excellent Adventure !
16 . “ I am an F - B - I Agent ! ” That line rules .
17 . Decided to leave his band “ Dogstar ” so that the rest of the group would not be held back by his celebrity or by his busy schedule .
Which is more than I can say for a few other jackass actors / wannabe rockers ( ahem , Russell Crowe ) .
18 . Managed to keep a straight face all the way through the abysmally crappy Sweet November .
That takes talent people .
19 .
Has worked with the following Academy Award winning actors : Al Pacino , Gene Hackman , Rachel Weisz , Charlize Theron , Jack Nicholson , Diane Keaton , Marisa Tomei , Morgan Freeman , Anthony Hopkins , Emma Thompson , Denzel Washington , Anthony Quinn , Kevin Kline , William Hurt , and the guy who played Bill in Bill & Ted ’s .
I ’m pretty sure he ’s won a couple Oscars by now .
20 . Is “ The One ” .
Warrants mentioning .
21 . Knows his acting limitations and in doing so , does not try to overextend himself in roles he could n’t do ; which means not only are his movies better , but so are the ones he turns down .
He ’s making movies he ’s NOT EVEN IN better !
Someone please give it up for this man !
22 . Does not own a computer .
So you know what that means … is not a MySpace whore .
23 .
In his review for Speed , Roger Ebert had this to say about Keanu : “ Keanu Reeves has never had a role like this before .
In fact , in his previous film , he played the mystical Prince Siddhartha , and generally he tends toward dreamy , sensitive characters .
That ’s why it ’s sort of amazing to see him so cool and focused here , a completely convincing action hero who is as centered and resourceful as a Clint Eastwood or Harrison Ford in similar situations . ”
24 . Has made movies in every single genre .
25 . He played Buddha .
No , I ’m serious , “ the ” Buddha .
Between playing the freaking Buddha and playing a stoner in Bill & Ted ’s , why do people think he has no range ?
26 . Back in the 80’s , he taught stoners of the world something about history ( and brought Napoleon to Waterlube ) .
Also , I ’d be remiss if I did n’t add that he ’s totally non , non non , non non , non , non heinous .
27 .
And despite being viewed as a “ stoner ” , has never been pigeonholed on screen .
In his various film roles , he has played : an FBI agent , a cop , a serial killer , a lawyer , a doctor , a dentist , the One , a Quarterback , a musician , an ad exec , a nuclear physicist ( hello ! ) , a redneck , a soldier , the freakin ’ Buddha , a gay hustler , and a Dog Boy .
28 . He knows kung fu .
So , you know , do n’t screw with him .
29 .
When Keanu decides to do a sequel : Bill & Ted ’s Bogus Journey .
When Keanu decides not to do a sequel : Speed 2 .
Can this guy pick winners , or what ?
30 .
Is none of the following : a Scientologist ( Tom Cruise ) , a john ( Hugh Grant ) , a drug addict ( Robert Downey Jr. ) , a cheat ( Jude Law ) , a phone - thrower ( Russell Crowe ) , hard to work with ( Val Kilmer ) or a mean bastard ( Sean Penn ) .
31 . Besides his obvious acting talents , Keanu also : surfs , rides motorcycles , was a good enough hockey goalie to earn the nickname “ The Wall ” , performs Shakespeare , reads philosophy , plays guitar in a slew of rock bands , ballroom dances , horseback rides , and “ knows ” kung fu .
Is there anything he ca n’t do ?
32 . His name is actually pronounced “ kay - ah - nu ” , not “ key - ah - nu ” , and yet never makes a fuss out of it ( ahem , DEMI ! ) .
33 .
Has romanced on - screen : Charlize Theron ( twice ) , Sandra Bullock ( twice ) , Monica Bellucci ( twice ) , Rachel Weisz ( twice ) , Carrie - Anne Moss ( thrice ) , Diane Lane , Connie Nielson , Dina Meyer and Uma Thurman .
This does not necessarily prove his specific level of suckage , but it does prove that hot actresses want to bang him on - screen , which is an important quality in today ’s movie stars .
For example , nobody wants to nail Adam Sandler , and he ’s not nearly as good an actor as Keanu , even if you count Punch - Drunk Love twice .
34 . Was in the Pilot episode of the awesome short - lived Jay Mohr show , Action .
And since that show ruled all , he in turn , receives a percentage of the ruling .
Let ’s say 17 % .
35 .
To his everlasting credit , never made a cameo appearance on Will & Grace , which makes him only one of five movie stars in the world never to have done so .
36 .
Was the host for a documentary show called “ Children Remember the Holocaust . ”
He supports the faith , I support him .
37 .
Has a college class based around his movies .
“ The Films of Keanu Reeves ” at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena , CA .
Name another supposedly “ sucky ” actor that has a college class named after him ?
That ’s right , you can ’t , because Keanu ’s the only one .
Because he kicks ass AND educates the youth of tomorrow .
38 . Turned down the Val Kilmer role in Heat to do a production of Hamlet in Canada .
If I have n’t said it before , let me say it now , the man is devoted to his craft .
He works on it , he tries new things .
He keeps working .
Even if you think he ’s not getting better , at least he ’s trying .
How many movie stars keep pushing themselves after they hit it big ?
How many just coast along on generic roles and unspectacular performances ?
Keanu pushes himself .
Fuck all to his limitations , he pushes himself and I respect him for it .
39 .
British theater critic Roger Lewis of the Sunday Times in London ( who knows something about Shakespeare , after all he is British ) had this to say about Keanu ’s Winnipeg - based performance of The Prince of Denmark in Hamlet : “ He quite embodied the innocence , the splendid fury , the animal grace of the leaps and bounds , the emotional violence , that form the Prince of Denmark .
He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen , for a simple reason : he ‘ is ’ Hamlet . ”
40 .
Brought unto the world the phrase “ Bogus , dude ” , for which we are all eternally grateful .
Now tell me , after reading this piece , do you still think he sucks ?
I did n’t think so .
Bangarang !

Diddy had Lindsay Lohan thrown out of a party .
The rapper 's security removed the ' Mean Girls ' star from a private concert by Prince at exclusive Los Angeles club Butter last Friday ( 16.06.06 ) after she got into a blazing row with rival Paris Hilton .
An eyewitness told America 's New York Post newspaper : " She went back to her table , there were only six tables , and everyone was sharing .
Diddy and his people wanted to sit with her on her table but Lindsay refused and began mixing it up with him .
" His bodyguards came over and picked Lindsay up to get her out .
" However , another reveller had a different take on the fracas .
They explained : " She kidded with him , asking what he was doing at her table .
" He did n't realize she was joking and he then yelled at her and told her to get
out .
Diddy was really mean to her . "
When asked about what happened , a spokesman for Diddy 's camp said : " Lindsay was being so loud and obnoxious .
His security became
concerned and came over to escort her away . "
Lindsay and Paris have been at loggerheads ever since the ' Mean Girls ' actress was spotted getting intimate with the hotel heiress ' ex-boyfriend Stavros Niarchos .
Maryland Governor Wants To Scrap E-Voting Machines ; Go All Paper For The Election

Following all the problems ( both technical and human ) in last week 's primaries in Maryland , combined with the rather damning report on the security of the machines put out by Ed Felten ( which Diebold has responded weakly to , making all sorts of claims that do n't refute anything Felten put in the paper ) , Maryland 's Governor , Robert Ehrlich is calling for the state to scrap all of the e-voting machines for the November election and focus on paper ballots .
This comes as even more problems were found with the electronic voting machines used in the election .
Of course , the head of the Elections Board and the state Senate President are fighting against this plan , saying that they can " correct " the problems with the machines .
That would be impressive , considering just how many problems have been found with Diebold e-voting machines over the years , and the company 's blatant unwillingness to deal with them .
The rationale for keeping the machines also leaves us scratching our heads : " We paid millions .
These are state - of - the - art machines . "
Two responses :
The evidence is pretty clear that these arestate of the art machines .
They 're badly made , with ridiculously weak security , and a company behind them that bullies its critics , blatantly misleads in its responses to security problems and cracks jokes about their weak security when confronted .
Therefore , it really does n't matter how many millions you spent on them , the machines are a problem .
The Senate President also accused Ehrlich of simply using this issue as a political ploy to rally his supporters .
By the way , for those of you who want to believe e-voting is simply a big Republican conspiracy ( based on some offhand remarks by Diebold 's former chief ) , we should note that Ehrlich ( who wants to scrap the machine ) is a Republican , and the folks who want to keep the machines are Democrats .
So , once again , we 'll note that this is not a partisan issue .
It 's an issue about having secure , fair and accurate voting .

Even billionaires need to budget .
That 's the message delivered to Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison , one of the world 's richest men , by his personal financial adviser in a series of e-mails obtained by The Chronicle .
In the e-mails , which stem from a recent shareholder lawsuit against the technology titan , Ellison 's accountant , Philip Simon , warns the billionaire about his habitual runaway spending .
Like a concerned parent , Simon chides Ellison for overextending himself on a new yacht , on his America 's Cup team and on his new houses in Woodside and Malibu .
" I 'm worried , Larry ... " Simon wrote to Ellison in a 2002 e-mail .
" I think it 's imperative that we start to budget and plan . "
According to documents unsealed by a judge in the shareholder lawsuit , Ellison habitually pushes his credit limit of more than a billion dollars to its maximum to finance his yachts and homes .
And that 's not even counting some $ 20 million a year he burns through in miscellaneous lifestyle expenses .
Of course , there 's no question that Ellison , 62 , is good for the loans .
Forbes ' famous list of wealthy people says the maverick entrepreneur is the nation 's fifth richest individual , worth $ 17 billion , mostly in Oracle stock .
Still , Ellison 's spending and his reluctance to part with Oracle shares have caused his financial adviser fits of anxiety , the documents show .
Simon expressed concern that Ellison would follow in the footsteps of wealthy entrepreneurs who ran into hard times in their personal or business finances , people like Carl 's Jr. founder Carl Karcher and Computer Associates founder Charles Wang .
Simon went so far as to write , " I do n't want you to end up like ... Bernie Ebbers , and the countless others . "
Ebbers , the former WorldCom CEO , famously borrowed heavily against his own stock holdings , ultimately resigning in disgrace before being charged with and convicted of securities fraud .
Ebbers is serving 25 years in federal prison .
The lawsuit that revealed these communications was a shareholder action that accused Ellison of acting on insider information when he sold more than 29 million Oracles shares in January 2001 , just weeks before Oracle issued a disappointing earnings statement and the stock plummeted .
Ellison generated nearly $ 900 million with that sale , making his 2001 income more than any other executive had ever taken in during a single year , the Washington , D.C. , think tank Institute for Policy Studies disclosed .
The suit was settled in November in San Mateo Superior Court -- Ellison agreed to donate $ 100 million to charity and pay $ 22 million to lawyers out of his own pocket -- but the settlement is being appealed by a shareholder .
In court depositions , Ellison argued that he had sold the shares not because he thought Oracle 's stock would soon decline in price but because Simon had been pressuring him to unload some of his vast company holdings .
For instance , in a 2000 e-mail , Simon urged Ellison to " take some money off the table " because the adviser said he had grown increasingly concerned .
Simon did not return an e-mail from The Chronicle regarding this story .
An Oracle spokesman offered no comment .
The personal e-mails and other documents originally were filed under seal as confidential , but San Mateo County Superior Court Judge John Schwartz unsealed them in November .
A holding pattern
So how could someone with $ 17 billion cause his accountant to worry about running low on cash ?
Ellison , who identifies strongly with the company he founded in 1977 , has been famously unwilling to sell Oracle shares over the years .
Instead of selling them , he has financed his lavish lifestyle -- the 23 - acre Japanese - style estate in Woodside , the yachts , the airplanes , the Armani suits -- by borrowing against his stock .
" I know this e-mail may / will depress you , " Simon wrote in a 2002 note about diversification .
" However , I believe it 's my job to address issues you 'd prefer not to confront .
You told me years ago that it 's OK to raise the ' diversification issue ' with you quarterly .
...
Well , I 'm doing so .
View this as a call to arms . "
This was n't the first time Simon had sounded the alarm .
In 2001 , Ellison 's spending was on an upswing , and his debt level was increasing rapidly , Simon said in a 2004 deposition .
Simon tried to explain to Ellison the seriousness of his debt , saying , " We have a freight train going down a track , hitting a debt wall , " he said in the deposition .
Ellison apparently did n't view his way of operating as risky .
Court documents quote him as pointing out that his net worth was always at least 10 times his debt .
But financial experts agree that borrowing against stock holdings is n't generally accepted as a good way to operate .
" If you were to look in the textbook for how a financial plan should work , this would be in chapter one under , ' Never do this , ' " said Cynthia Harrington , a former money manager who now writes about finance for journals and magazines .
The danger is that if Oracle 's stock value drops steeply , the banks could call in their loans , forcing Ellison to sell masses of stock at bargain - basement prices to cover them .
Ellison has already found himself facing a situation like that .
In 1990 , Oracle ran into hard times , and its stock fell to $ 5 a share , causing big cash flow problems , recalls Nicola Miner , the daughter of Oracle co-founder Bob Miner , in the biography , " The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison , " by Mike Wilson .
( The famous subtitle to the book is : " God does n't think he 's Larry Ellison . " )
At that time , Ellison managed to avoid having to sell his Oracle shares cheaply by selling nearly $ 3 million worth of shares he owned in another company , Cadence Design Systems , and by arranging a line of credit with securities firm Morgan Stanley .
Then again , Ellison owns so much stock that the value would have to decline pretty severely before banks would ever consider calling in his loans , Harrington said .
Simon 's comparison to WorldCom founder Ebbers is apt , though certainly not in a criminal sense .
Ebbers , too , financed lavish spending by borrowing against his WorldCom shares .
When they declined in price and his loans were called in , he turned to borrowing heavily from the company itself , and when he resigned in 2002 , shortly before Simon wrote the e-mail mentioning him , he owed WorldCom $ 408 million .
Ellison , by contrast , has not borrowed from Oracle but from a number of banks .
As risky as it can be , Santa Clara University finance Professor Meir Statman said it is not uncommon for senior executives to borrow against their stock to avoid parting with it .
Statman studies behavioral finance , which examines how people often make financial moves based on emotional perceptions instead of rationally following the path that maximizes income .
" It is really a sense of , ' I know this company better than others do , ' and , second , ' The entire world is not appreciating my company as it should be appreciated , ' " Statman said .
Indeed , even when Simon persuaded Ellison to sell shares of Oracle in 2001 , Ellison set a price floor of $ 30 , below which he felt the stock would be undervalued .
Oracle shares fell to $ 16.88 in March of that year after Oracle warned that its third - quarter profit would not meet market expectations .
Big risk , bigger spending
Oracle and other tech companies were headed for further declines .
This is something Simon , if not Ellison , saw coming .
As the stock market ran to a fever pitch in 2000 , Ellison 's undiversified portfolio increasingly worried Simon .
" Query -- have you seen the reviews on Robert Shiller 's new book ' Irrational Exuberance ? ' " Simon wrote in a March 29 , 2000 , e-mail urging Ellison to start a sales program that would divest him of 0.5 percent of his Oracle stock each quarter .
As usual , that did n't result in a big change in Ellison 's behavior .
The CEO finally did start a regular diversification program , but not until 2004 .
In his most recent sale through this plan , Ellison sold more than a quarter of a billion dollars worth of stock earlier this month .
Getting back to the scary days of 2000 , when the tech stock market was imploding , a list of Ellison 's debts as of July 13 , 2000 , showed that he owed $ 1.022 billion to five banks : JP Morgan , Bankers Trust , CMB , Merrill Lynch and UBS .
At that time , those loans came from credit lines that had a combined limit of $ 1.35 billion , putting Ellison a mere $ 328 million from maxing out .
By 2001 , when Ellison made the stock sales that triggered the lawsuit , that debt was up to $ 1.22 billion .
At the bottom of a document that detailed Ellison 's 2000 debt load , Simon had scrawled a rough accounting of Ellison 's lavish spending , according to deposition testimony :
"1) Life Style -- annual $ 20 m
2 ) Interest Accrual -- annual $ 75 m
3 ) Villa in Japan -- $ 25 m
4 ) New Yacht -- $ 194 m -- over 3 yrs
5 ) America's Cup -- $ 80 m -- over 3 yrs
6 ) UAD -- 12 m over 3 yrs . "
It 's not clear what UAD refers to .
Since this rough budget , Ellison has reportedly spent $ 200 million building a Japanese - style estate in Woodside , which includes a reproduction of a 17th - century Kyoto teahouse .
He has also bought multiple properties in Malibu -- $ 180 million worth , by one report .
Where does it all go ?
Ellison 's charitable giving also caught his accountant 's eye .
Although Ellison 's generosity to charity does not rival that of richest American Bill Gates , Ellison 's giving seemed to give Simon ulcers , as well .
In the 2002 e-mail , Simon frets that the Ellison Medical Foundation 's leaders believed Ellison would support increasing its budget to $ 100 million a year from $ 35 million annually .
" $ 100 million is a lot of money ... " Simon wrote .
" There 's nothing wrong with keeping the ( foundation ) budget at $ 35 M / year ... or even reducing it in a sensible manner . "
And when Oracle executive Safra Catz mentioned in a 2000 e-mail that Ellison might want to donate $ 1 billion worth of expiring stock options to charity , Simon seemed shaken .
" I had no idea that Larry was even considering donating $ 1.0 bn to charity .
Such a large amount . "
When asked in a deposition about considering a $ 1 billion gift , Ellison said he vaguely remembered discussing this with Catz , but nothing came of it .
The documents obtained by The Chronicle certainly show that Ellison did not break any laws , but some experts say they are a symptom of an economy with larger and larger gaps between haves and have - nots .
Sarah Anderson , director of the global economy project at the Institute for Policy Studies , said the details of Ellison 's spending shows " how different these peoples ' realities are .
You have to wonder how much they can connect with the people who work for them and the people they 're serving with their business . "
Early warning
Larry Ellison 's financial adviser , Philip Simon , encouraged the Oracle founder to sell his company 's shares when the stock market got soft in March of 2000 .
Simon wrote March 29 , 2000 :
" Dear Larry . ... "
" I 'm getting increasingly concerned about stock market valuations ( query -- have you seen the reviews on Robert Shiller 's new book " Irrational Exuberance ? " ) -- and believe this would be a good time to take some money off the table .
... I 'd just like to start cashing out . "
High anxiety
In an e-mail to Ellison dated May 3 , 2002 , Simon expresses grave concerns about the Oracle founder 's spending .
" I 'm worried , Larry .
... I know you view me as a pessimist .
Maybe you 're right , though I would disagree .

SHANGHAI , Oct. 16 - Move over , New York .
This year alone , Shanghai will complete towers with more space for living and working than there is in all the office buildings in New York City .
That is in a city that already has 4,000 skyscrapers , almost double the number in New York .
And there are designs to build 1,000 more by the end of this decade .
China 's real estate market is so hot that miniature cities are being created with artificial lakes , and the country 's nouveau riche suddenly seem eager to put down as much as $ 5.3 million for a luxury apartment in skyscrapers with names like the Skyline Mansion .
For decades after the Communists took over in 1949 , there was relatively little housing construction or office building under central planning .
But since the early 1990's , Shanghai and other cities have been making up for lost time .
And this year the building boom is at a frenzy , with the nation expected to lay down the finishing blocks on 4.7 billion square feet or more of construction , a record , up from 2 billion in 1998 .
Stop at a traffic light in Delhi or Bombay ( Mumbai ) , and magazine hawkers descend , pressing against your car window a fan of Bollywood gossip rags , newsweeklies , and ... the IKEA catalog ?
India , like most of Asia , has no IKEA outlet .
The Swedish superstore , known for its inexpensive yet stylish home furnishings , has swept across Europe and North America - but not here .
Indians who buy the catalogs are n't interested in mail order .
Instead , they do what middle - class Indians have always done - have local carpenters make the furniture .
" Whenever we think of doing something for the house , one of the things we always hope we can get our hands on are a few IKEA catalogs , " says Arundhati Ray , a consultant who works with nongovernmental organizations in Calcutta .
" It 's shameless pirating , " Ms. Ray adds , showing off an elegant wrought - iron chandelier she commissioned from a local artisan , based on an IKEA picture .
Ray also had dining - room chairs and a CD rack copied , though the rack now holds various spices and masalas .
Locally made knockoffs of IKEA pieces are ubiquitous in the homes of professionals in India 's rapidly modernizing big cities .
Educated and westernized , many of them prefer IKEA 's minimalist Scandinavian style to homespun Indian handiwork or the clunky British colonial pieces they grew up with .
" It 's the need to break away from the traditional , " says Gita Rana , owner of a high - end home accessories company based in Bangalore .
" IKEA furniture represents modern design .
It 's easy to maintain ....
It 's the look , the lightness .
You can move it around . "
Getting furniture made from scratch is nothing new in India , where labor is cheap and mass - produced products are often low quality .
But the changing aesthetic reflects changes in the lifestyles of middle - class Indians over the past decade .
International companies opening offices and call centers in India , combined with astronomical growth in the information - technology industry , have created a lucrative urban job market for a tech - savvy generation .
Instead of living at home with parents until marriage , many young Indians are moving into their own apartments , postponing marriage , and even cohabiting .
Real estate is booming and city living is getting more expensive , so many find themselves squeezed into tight quarters with a need for modern , space - saving furniture .
" I like the big colonial furniture fine in big houses , but I do n't like them in modern houses , " says Tripti Bose , a retired psychologist who divides her time between Washington , D.C. , and India .
" If something 's so ornate and heavy , it better go in a palace . "
When Ms. Bose built her Indian house 10 years ago , she cut pictures from an IKEA catalog and brought them to a carpenter , who furnished her entire two - bedroom bungalow with pieces modeled after them .
King - size beds provide extra storage with built - in drawers .
A wall - sized wardrobe has closets , shelves , shoe racks , and a dressing table .
A desk , bookshelves , tables , and other pieces of furniture were made with plywood and painted in Bose 's favorite colors - red and black .
" The design is IKEA , but this is all pure wood , " she says , referring to IKEA 's use of particle board .
The price was right - about $ 2,250 for everything .
That would be an unimaginable cost for the 80 percent of Indians who live on $ 2 a day , but it 's a fraction of what IKEA would sell all that furniture for in the West ( even with its bargain prices ) , and it 's affordable for most middle - class Indians .
For the richest Indians , IKEA has become a stylistic stepping - stone toward higher - end European design , says Vikram Phadke , co-owner of Evoluzione , a Madras store that specializes in imported furniture .
Three years ago , when Mr. Phadke opened his store , $ 500 was the most retailers in India dared charge for any piece of furniture , he says .
Now , Evoluzione has nurtured a small but growing clientele that wants the best in European design and will spend $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 on a sofa .
" In the last two years , it 's a sea change in attitude , in purchasing power , " Phadke says .
IKEA is aware of the copying , but has no plans to open stores here .
" We take copying of our products seriously , " says IKEA spokeswoman Tracey Kelly in a prepared statement .
But , she adds , " We are happy that the Indian people like IKEA design . "
Part of the reason IKEA does n't have plans to open stores in India , she says , is India 's strict licensing laws for foreign - owned companies .
IKEA , which started in a small Swedish village in 1943 , now has stores in 33 countries with nearly $ 19 billion in sales last year .
But its retail operations are confined to the world 's wealthier countries - mostly in Europe , North America , and Australia .
With its reliance on mass marketing and efficient transportation of its assembly - required products , the IKEA model probably would not work in India or other poor countries , says Abhijit Banerjee , an economics professor at MIT .
" Its prices would not be a bargain for most Indians , and those who could afford real IKEA products are too few . "
For now , Indians say they are happy to hire locals to make knockoffs - and avoid the hassle of putting furniture together .
If you buy from IKEA , Bose says , " then who 's going to assemble it for you ? "
Stem cells can be programmed to become many kinds of tissue
It is hoped the newly - created cells will eventually help scientists find new treatments for diseases such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh said the cells should help researchers test the effectiveness of new drugs .
Stem cells are " master " cells that can become many kinds of tissue .
Nerve stem cells are those which help build the brain and central nervous system .
STEM CELL MILESTONES
1960s : Research begins on stem cells taken from adult tissue 1968 : Adult stem cells used to treat immunodeficient patient 1998 : US scientists grow stem cells from human embryos and germ cells , establishing cell lines still in use today 2001 : Embryonic stem cell turned into a blood cell 2004 : South Korean scientists clone 30 human embryos and develop them over several days 2005 : Korean team develops stem cells tailored to match individual patients
The university 's Dr Steven Pollard said : " This is incredibly exciting in terms of curing disease .
" We may be able to create the disease in a dish .
If we do that , we 'll be able to better understand the disease and also to test drugs . "
Our correspondent said the long - term aim of the Edinburgh research is for cells to be used to build replacement neural tissue for Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's sufferers .
But he said the more immediate use for the artificially - created cells is to test out the effectiveness of new drugs .
Professor Austin Smith , who led the research at the University of Edinburgh , told the BBC : " We 're already talking with the bio-technology and bio- pharmaceutical companies about taking these cells into screening systems for new drugs .
Hopefully that will come to pass within two to three years .
" In terms of the possibility of using the cells for transplantation , that 's a much more difficult and longer term thing and I think there we 're talking more of the five to ten year range . "
However , critics say it is unethical to use human embryos in scientific research .
Previous attempts at creating the nerve cells have produced contaminated samples that have not been scientifically useful .
Robert Meadowcroft , of the Parkinson 's Disease Society , welcomed the news : " The purity of these cells should prove particularly valuable in studying the possibilities for transplantation and replacement of damaged tissue . "
The Alzheimer 's Society echoed this view , saying that the inability to grow nerve cells from human embryonic stem cells had previously been a major obstacle to progress in this area .
The breakthrough comes three months after scientists at Newcastle University announced they had successfully produced a cloned embryo using donated eggs and genetic material from stem cells .
It was the first time a human cloned embryo had been created in Britain .
First in Europe and now in the United States , Muslim groups have petitioned to establish enclaves in which they can uphold and enforce greater compliance to Islamic law .
While the U.S. Constitution enshrines the right to religious freedom and the prohibition against a state religion , when it comes to the rights of religious enclaves to impose communal rules , the dividing line is more nebulous .
Can U.S. enclaves , homeowner associations , and other groups enforce Islamic law ?
Such questions are no longer theoretical .
While Muslim organizations first established enclaves in Europe , [ 1 ] the trend is now crossing the Atlantic .
Some Islamist community leaders in the United States are challenging the principles of assimilation and equality once central to the civil rights movement , seeking instead to live according to a separate but equal philosophy .
The Gwynnoaks Muslim Residential Development group , for example , has established an informal enclave in Baltimore because , according to John Yahya Cason , director of the Islamic Education and Community Development Initiative , a Baltimore - based Muslim advocacy group , " there was no community in the U.S. that showed the totality of the essential components of Muslim social , economic , and political structure . " [ 2 ]
Baltimore is not alone .
In August 2004 , a local planning commission in Little Rock , Arkansas , granted The Islamic Center for Human Excellence authorization to build an internal Islamic enclave to include a mosque , a school , and twenty - two homes . [ 3 ]
While the imam , Aquil Hamidullah , says his goal is to create " a clean community , free of alcohol , drugs , and free of gangs , " [ 4 ] the implications for U.S. jurisprudence of this and other internal enclaves are greater : while the Little Rock enclave might prevent the sale of alcohol , can it punish possession and in what manner ?
Can it force all women , be they residents or visitors , to don Islamic hijab ( headscarf ) ?
Such enclaves raise the fundamental questions of when , how , and to what extent religious practice may supersede the U.S. Constitution .
The Internal Muslim Enclave
The internal Muslim enclave proposed by the Islamic Center for Human Excellence in Arkansas represents a new direction for Islam in the United States .
The group seeks to transform a loosely organized Muslim population into a tangible community presence .
The group has foreign financial support : it falls under the umbrella of a much larger Islamic group , " Islam 4 the World , " an organization sponsored by Sharjah , one of the constituent emirates of the United Arab Emirates .
[ 5 ]
While the Islamic Center for Human Excellence has yet to articulate detailed plans for its Little Rock enclave , the group 's reliance on foreign funding is troublesome .
Past investments by the United Arab Emirates ' rulers and institutions have promoted radical interpretations of Islam . [ 6 ]
The Islamic Center for Human Excellence may seek to segregate schools and offices by gender .
The enclave might also exercise broad control upon commerce within its boundaries — provided the economic restrictions did not discriminate against out - of - state interests or create an undue burden upon interstate commerce .
But most critically , the enclave could promulgate every internal law — from enforcing strict religious dress codes to banning alcohol possession and music ; it could even enforce limits upon religious and political tolerance .
Although such concepts are antithetical to a free society , U.S. democracy allows the internal enclave to function beyond the established boundaries of our constitutional framework .
At the very least , the permissible parameters of an Islamist enclave are ill defined .
The greater American Muslim community 's unapologetic and public manifestation of belief in a separate but equal ideology does not bode well .
In September 2004 , the New Jersey branch of the Islamic Circle of North America rented Six Flags Adventure Park in New Jersey for " The Great Muslim Adventure Day . "
The advertisement announcing the event stated : " The entire park for Muslims only . "
While legal — and perhaps analogous to corporate or other non-religious groups renting facilities , the advertisement expressly implied a mindset that a proof of faith was required for admission to the park .
In his weblog , commentator Daniel Pipes raises a relevant and troubling question about the event : because it is designated for Muslims only , " Need one recite the shahada to enter the fairgrounds ? " [ 7 ]
While U.S. law might give such Muslims - only events the benefit of the doubt , flexibility may not go both ways .
There is precedent of Islamists taking advantage of liberal flexibility to more extreme ends .
Canada provides a useful example into how Islamist groups can exploit liberal legal tolerance .
In 1991 , Ontario , Canada , passed a seemingly innocuous law called the " Arbitration Act . " [ 8 ]
This act permitted commercial , religious , or such other designated arbitrators to settle civil disputes outside the Canadian justice system so long as the result did not contradict Canadian law .
Like U.S. authorities are beginning to do now , Canadian legislators decided to give religious groups the benefit of the doubt , assuming that they would still hold national law to be paramount .
In October 2003 , under the auspices of the Ontario legislation , the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice created Muslim arbitration boards and stated its intent to arbitrate on the basis of Islamic law . [ 9 ]
A national furor erupted , particularly among Canadian Muslim women 's groups that opposed the application of traditional Islamic ( Shari‘a ) laws that would supersede their far more liberal and egalitarian democratic rights .
After nearly two years of legal wrangling , the premier of Ontario , Dalton McGuinty , held that religious - based arbitrations " threaten our common ground , " and announced , " There will be no Shari ‘a law in Ontario .
There will be no religious arbitration in Ontario .
There will be one law for all Ontarians . " [ 10 ]
On November 15 , 2005 , McGuinty 's provincial government submitted legislation to amend the arbitration act to abrogate , in effect , all religious arbitration . [ 11 ]
Requests for Muslim enclaves within larger U.S. communities may signal that U.S. jurisprudence will soon be faced with a similar conundrum .
Islamist exceptionalism can abuse the tolerance liberal societies have traditionally extended to interface between religious and secular law .
Prior to the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice demands to impose Shari‘a , the Arbitration Act worked well .
Unfortunately for Canadian Jews , the repeal ended state - enforcement of agreements reached by the use of a millennia - old rabbinical court system called beit din ( house of law ) that had for decades quietly settled marriage , custody , and business disputes .
Joel Richler , Ontario region chairman of the Canadian Jewish Congress , expressed his lament : " If there have been any problems flowing from any rabbinical court decisions , I 'm not aware of them . " [ 12 ] Canadian Catholics likewise were stopped from being able to annul marriages according to Canon Law and avoid undue entanglement in civil courts .
Abuse of the spirit of the law , though , ended up curtailing local liberty .
Rather than soften the edge between religion and state , the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice threatened to eliminate it with the imposition of Shari‘a .
The Canadian experience demonstrates how flexibility can backfire when all parties do not seek to uphold basic precepts of tolerance .
The Little Rock application raises the specter of a parallel situation .
While The Islamic Center for Human Excellence may state it wants to create a clean - living community , might the community 's extreme interpretation of Shari ‘a force a reconsideration of just how much leeway the U.S. government gives religious communities ?
As the Muslim community in the United States grows , an increasingly active Islamist lobby has submitted numerous white papers and amicus briefs to legislators and courts arguing for the religious right of Muslims to apply Shari‘a law , particularly in relation to family law disputes . [ 13 ]
This looming jurisprudential conflict is significant for it raises issues about the rights of community members to marry outside the community , forced marriages , and the minimum age of brides , and whether wives and daughters may enjoy equal inheritance .
In cases of non-family law , it raises the question about whether the testimony of women will be considered on par with that of men .
No previous enclave in U.S. history has ever been so vigorously protected by agents of group identity politics or so adamantly defended by legal watchdogs ; nor has any previous religious enclave possessed the potency of more than one billion believers around the world .
Islamic - only communities may also benefit from the largess provided by billions of petrol dollars to finance growth .
The track record of Saudi and other wealthy Persian Gulf donations and charitable efforts are worrisome .
There is a direct correlation between Saudi money received and the spread of intolerant practices .
In 2004 , for example , the U.S. Treasury Department froze the assets of Al - Haramein Foundation , one of Saudi Arabia 's largest nongovernmental organizations , because of its financial links to Al - Qaeda . [ 14 ]
Additionally , American graduates of Saudi academies advance Wahhabist interpretations of Islam inside the U.S. prison system , [ 15 ] and Saudi - subsidized publications promote intolerance inside U.S. mosques . [ 16 ]
A Muslim enclave is uniquely perilous because there are few if any internal enclaves that adhere to a polity dedicated to the active abrogation of secular law and the imposition of a supreme religious law .
The concept of Shari‘a is so fundamental to Islam , that even today , prominent Muslim jurists argue over whether a Muslim can fully discharge Shari ‘a obligations while residing in a non-Muslim territory . [ 17 ]
Yet , in spite of this apparent conundrum , Muslims have resided peacefully in non-Muslim lands since the seventh century .
In the greater context , there may be a breach in the dike for Islamist groups residing in the United States because the Baltimore and Little Rock enclaves must acknowledge the U.S. Constitution as the paramount basis of civil law .
A dissident Islamic sub-community is filled with dichotomous propositions : from the presumed supremacy of Shari ‘a - based law over secular law ; the melding of religion and polity versus the constitutionally mandated separation of same ; to the politics of group and factionalism , versus assimilation and pluralism .
To deny the settlement of a Muslim - only community based solely upon prejudices formed after September 11 would be illiberal .
But the alternative , opening the door to Islamic enclaves without scrutiny , is as dubious .
The Enclave under U.S. Law
Existing U.S. legal precedent , though , may provide some grounds for handling expansive demands for Islamic enclaves .
U.S. legal views of internal enclaves derive from the famous 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision , in which the Supreme Court ruled the concept of separate but equal to be unconstitutional . [ 18 ]
While the case revolved around the right of black children to attend white schools , it promulgated a concept that is anathema in today 's world of multiculturalism : neither the state nor any constituent group could claim equality through separation .
Enclaves can exist , though .
As courts have ruled on issues relating to equality under the law and upon the autonomy of religious practice , two distinctive features of internal U.S. enclaves have taken shape : first , the boundaries of the enclave should be recognized by local inhabitants .
Second , the enclave cannot supersede the constitutionally protected rights of the citizens of a state .
Because most rights secured by the constitution are protected only against infringement by government action , the Supreme Court has avoided establishing a bright - line test as to the limits of religious liberty .
Any religious group or individual seeking to establish an internal enclave has the right to limit residency , promulgate local rules , and perhaps even collect fees or taxes to support nominal community services .
Such enclaves do not hold final sway over the rights of non-residents , however .
In Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Company [ 19 ] and Flagg Brothers v. Brooks , [ 20 ] the court outlined constitutional protections for private citizens in which any entity , religious or otherwise , exercising governmental authority over private citizens remains subject to the provisions of the First and Fourteenth amendments .
In both cases , the court affirmed that citizens of a state retain their right to " due process of law " under the Fourteenth Amendment , even when inside an enclave .
These holdings , however , do not prevent enclaves from restricting the individual freedoms of their inhabitants .
The Supreme Court has ruled upon the limits of religious liberty .
In Cantwell v. Connecticut , the court outlined the circumstances in which the government could act to restrict religious independence .
The court held that the free exercise clause " embraces two concepts — freedom to believe and freedom to act .
The first is absolute , but in the nature of things , the second can not be .
Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society . " [ 21 ]
Christopher L. Eisgruber , professor of law at New York University , explained .
He argued that , " the Constitution permits government to nurture ideological sub- communities founded upon premises inconsistent with the constitution 's own commitments . " [ 22 ]
He maintained that such dissident sub-communities can provide important " sources of dissent " [ 23 ] and asserted that even if an enclave embraced ideals contrary to constitutional ideals , it should still be granted the right to pursue its own vision of good .
For example , he wrote :
[ Though ] it is regrettable that young women in Kiryas Joel [ a Satmar Hasidic enclave ] will grow up in a starkly sexist culture , and it is regrettable that the Amish children of Yoder will find it very hard to become astronomers or lawyers … it would also be regrettable if the United States were not home to any sub-communities which , like the Satmars or the Amish , rejected principles of justice fundamental to the American regime . [ 24 ]
According to Eisgruber , tolerance of the intolerant is fundamental to the freedoms espoused by Western liberal democracy .
While Islamists might use such logic to argue for the permissibility of Shari ‘a communities , such tolerance has limits .
Enclaves do not have carte blanche to act .
Both the state and national legislatures must retain control over the extent of accommodation , and there should be no subsidization of the enclave by the government . [ 25 ]
Such limits ensure that the government can constrain those sub-communities that might espouse more radical , violent , or racist views . [ 26 ]
It is usually when the U.S. government moves to uphold the rule of law that most Americans first learn of an internal enclave .
Few Americans knew of the philosophy espoused by anti-government activist Randy Weaver until 1992 when the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms raided his compound at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , killing Vicki Weaver , their infant son , Sam , and the family dog . [ 27 ]
Nor did many Americans know about David Koresh and his religious views until a raid the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas , in which a resulting fire killed fifty adults and twenty - five children under the age of fifteen . [ 28 ]
While tragic , such events involved cults or political splinter groups .
The growth of Muslim enclaves raises the specter of such conflicts occurring on a much larger scale .
While the court has interpreted the establishment clause to empower the government to constrain dissident sub-communities when necessary to protect public safety , it has been wary of addressing legal issues requiring intrusion upon the religious polity .
Because the First Amendment provides for religious freedom , the court has confined itself to ruling upon three basic issues : property disputes between national religious hierarchical organizations with affiliated breakaway entities ; accommodations under the free exercise clause ; and the prohibition against the establishment of a state religion .
New challenges , though , may lead to new interpretations .
The Antithesis to Democracy
Is concern over internal Muslim enclaves justified ?
On their face , the fundamental principles of the internal Muslim enclave are no more invidious than any other religious enclave .
But ideology matters .
Many proponents of an Islamic polity promote an ideology at odds with U.S. constitutional jurisprudence and the prohibition against the establishment of a state - sponsored religion .
The refusal to recognize federal law makes Islamist enclaves more akin to Ruby Ridge than to the Hasidic and Amish cases cited by Eisgruber .
Muslim theologians describe Islam not only as a religion but also as a system of state .
The Qur'an — viewed by Muslims as the word of God — is replete with instructions about governance .
An enclave promoting Islamic mores does not necessarily restrict itself to a social atmosphere but also one of governance .
Traditional Islamic law controls the most basic aspects of everyday life and may make any Islamic enclave irreconcilable with the basic presumptions of Western liberal democracy and secular law .
While many American Muslims practice Islam and embrace the fundamental principles of the U.S. Constitution , others do not .
There are consistent attempts by Islamist elements overseas to strengthen their own radical interpretation of Islam at the expense of moderation and tolerance .
Saudi donors , for example , have propagated the ideology of Islamism , which seeks to interweave a narrow and often intolerant interpretation of religion into an all - encompassing political ideology .
The number of imams and jihadists who have been outspoken in identifying the supremacy of Shari‘a to democracy underlines the incompatibility of Islamism and democracy .
The late Saudi theologian , Sheikh Muhammad bin Ibrahim al - Jubair , for example , stated ,
Only one ambition is worthy of Islam , to save the world from the curse of democracy : to teach men that they cannot rule themselves on the basis of man-made laws .
Mankind has strayed from the path of God , we must return to that path or face certain annihilation . [ 29 ]
Prior to Iraq 's January 30 , 2005 elections , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , leader of Al - Qaeda in Iraq , released an audiotape in which he declared war upon democracy and denounced its tenets as " the very essence of heresy , polytheism , and error . " [ 30 ]
Nor is Islamist antipathy for democracy limited to popular elections .
According to a Saudi publication distributed at a San Diego mosque , " [ Democracy is ] responsible for all the horrible wars … more than 130 wars with more than 120 million people dead [ in the twentieth century alone ] ; not counting victims of poverty , hunger and disease . " [ 31 ]
Such sentiments reflect a common theme among Islamists : democracy is the antithesis to everything pious and pure in Islam ; and , in truth , democracy is the direct and substantial causal effect of Muslim suffering and injustice in the world today .
This does not mean that Islamists are unwilling to use democracy for their ends .
But while they accept the trappings of democracy , they continue to reject its principles because the Shari‘a , to them the perfect rule of law , cannot be abrogated or altered by the shifting moods of a secular electorate .
Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi , editor - in - chief of the pan-Arab weekly Al - Mustakillah , explained ,
The heart of the matter is that no Islamic state can be legitimate in the eyes of its subjects without obeying the main teachings of the Shari‘a .
A secular government might coerce obedience , but Muslims will not abandon their belief that state affairs should be supervised by the just teachings of the holy law . [ 32 ]
He could draw from plenty of examples .
In 1992 , for example , Ali Balhadj , a leader of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria , declared , " When we are in power , there will be no more elections because God will be ruling . " [ 33 ]
While mayor of Istanbul , Islamist Turkish politician Recep Tayyip Erdoğan quipped , " For us , democracy is a streetcar .
We would go as far as we could , and then get off . " [ 34 ]
As he eviscerates the judiciary , many Turks wonder about his sincerity . [ 35 ]
Experience abroad is relevant , as it goes to the heart of the sincerity of proponents of the Little Rock and Baltimore enclaves , an issue compounded by the willingness to accept donations from Persian Gulf financiers .
Conclusion
How Muslims reconcile Islamic polity within the confines of Western liberal democracy is an unresolved issue .
This process will take years to evolve and is likely to convulse in further violent episodes .
Presently , many Muslims reject wholesale the notion of a dominant secular law and instead seek the imposition of a pan-Islamist state under the guidance of Shari‘a .
These Islamists view secular modernity and the democratic practices of radical egalitarianism , individual rights , and free exercise of religion as a direct and substantial threat to their belief system , and they are intent on employing violence against the West for the foreseeable future .
The remainder and majority of the Muslim world must reject nihilism and engage in widespread debate regarding Islam 's role within the world community .
The local planning commission in Little Rock , Arkansas , might proceed with the proposed Muslim enclave , but the Arkansas courts and its legislature should not abdicate its responsibilities to ensure that Western liberal rights and protections remain supreme .
The government should monitor both the rhetoric and behavior of these communities .
As the Supreme Court stated in Cantwell : the freedom to believe is absolute , but the freedom to act , in the nature of things , cannot be , especially as to the safety and preservation of the American democracy . [ 36 ]

What is more , for every $ 1 a company spends on search advertising , Google will waive the fees on $ 10 worth of purchases .
Factoring in the 2 percent fee , that represents a rebate of at least 20 percent of advertising spending .
Mr. Schmidt said the company was willing to lose money on transaction fees because it felt the package would increase advertising spending .
" The math works because we can have lower prices and higher volume , " he said .
Google 's decision to give free transaction processing to advertisers has the potential to disrupt its carefully cultivated electronic auction for ad placement .
Google has worked hard to ensure that the auction treats all advertisers equally , sometimes to the dismay of big companies that are used to discounts for major purchases .
It has not offered commissions to advertising agencies , as most media companies do .
Online merchants that do not want to use Google Checkout " might be a little peeved , " said Kevin Lee , chief executive of Did-it.com , a search advertising agency .
" They might say if you give that credit to some people for credit card processing , give it to me for something else . "
Mr. Schmidt said Google had not considered this issue .
While Google 's tactics may be seen as aggressive competition , the company is unlikely to run afoul of antitrust laws because it does not have a monopoly in the market .

Yahoo , the other main seller of advertising on search results , recently announced an alliance with eBay that among other things will encourage Yahoo advertisers to use PayPal for payment processing .
PayPal will also be promoted as the online wallet for use on Yahoo services .
Both companies declined to give financial details of the deal .

Have you ever looked at an animal and said , " How in the world does that thing do that ? "
Well , here are a few answers to those kinds of questions .
The liquid inside young coconuts can be used as a substitute for blood plasma .
Once a bull has impregnated a cow , it will never impregnate that same cow again .
So once a bull has had his way with your herd , he is useless .
Carnivorous animals will not eat another animal that has been hit by a lightning strike .
Mountain goats can walk almost straight up a cliff due to a supple pad on each cloven hoof .
These pads have extremely soft centers .
When the animal puts its foot down , each pad works like a powerful suction cup , enabling the wild goat to appear to defy gravity .
The average person falls asleep in seven minutes .
A group of geese on the ground is a gaggle , a group of geese in the air is a skein .
The underside of a horse 's hoof is called a frog .
The frog peels off several times a year with new growth .

If NASA sent birds into space ( inside a space capsule , that is ) , they would soon die because they need gravity to swallow .
It was discovered on a space mission that a frog can throw up .
The frog throws up its stomach first , so the stomach is dangling out of its mouth .
Then the frog uses its forearms to dig out all of the stomach 's contents and then swallows the stomach back down again .
Studies show that if a cat falls off the seventh floor of a building it has about thirty percent less chance of surviving than a cat that falls off the twentieth floor .
It supposedly takes about eight floors for the cat to realize what is occurring , relax and correct itself .

No animal , once frozen solid ( i.e. , water solidifies and turns to ice ) survives when thawed , because the ice crystals formed inside cells would break open the cell membranes .
However there are certain frogs that can survive the experience of being frozen .
These frogs make special proteins which prevent the formation of ice ( or at least keep the crystals from becoming very large ) , so that they actually never freeze even though their body temperature is below zero Celsius .
The water in them remains liquid : a phenomenon known as ' supercooling . '
If you disturb one of these frogs ( just touching them even ) , the water in them quickly freezes solid and they die .

In the last week I 've had the chance to play with a few new services that have begun to appear :
Pixoh : an on - line photo editor YouOS : a web operating system Wufoo : a web - based form builder and data collection / reporting service
All three were born out of the desire to solve existing real - world problems .
And they 've all been brought from idea to working prototype in the last few months by very small teams of people ( 4 or less ) .
They 're working under the guidance and funding of Y Combinator , the Paul Graham , Trevor Blackwell , and Robert Morris created startup incubator in Mountain View .
Each of those services manages to offer something easy to use that 's also groundbreaking in one or more ways .
However , this is n't inatended to be a detailed review of any .
I 'll save that for later .
Last night I had the opportunity to spend a few hours at their office meeting with the founders , watching product demos , and exchanging ideas about how they could expand and improve their services .
I also spent a bit of time watching Trevor 's latest robot creations , including the self - balancing robotic Segway .
Cool stuff . ;-)
I had a great time and was impressed by the drive , energy , and creativity of the young entrepreneurs present .
I would n't be at all surprised if we end up hearing a lot more about them in the coming months as their products become more public and further refined .
Thanks to Paul and others for the chance to drop by and hang out !

Charlize Theron has revealed she used to have to get directors drunk to get films roles .
The Oscar - winning actress is now an established Hollywood star , but when she fist moved to Los Angeles she insists many people were reluctant to hire her .
Theron claims she only got her role in ' The Yards ' alongside Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix because she softened - up director James Gray over a few drinks .
She said : " I got him drunk - that 's when my manipulation really works well . "
Meanwhile , Theron has confessed that some of her films are so bad she has felt suicidal after finishing them .
The 31 - year - old star won the 2004 Best Actress Oscar for her gripping portrayal of serial - killer Aileen Wuornos in ' Monster ' .
Although the South African star had a good feeling the movie , directed by Patty Jenkins , would be a success , she admits she has often chosen bad projects and felt the consequences .
She said : " There was nothing Patty had done to convince me she was a good director .
I just had a feeling .
But I have been wrong before .
Very wrong .
I 've been in situations when I 've said to myself , ' Can I have a rope please ?
Or some blades ? ' "

You see the problem .
You need the coffee early in the morning , and yet you have to make the coffee early in the morning .
People should not be required to make coffee until they have some coffee .
I know that many people purchase coffee at a Starbucks or other retail coffee purveyor .
In order for me to do that , however , I would have to get dressed , and one of the great blessings of my current job is that I do not have to get dressed to do it .
( Let me reassure you : I am in fact dressed as I type this .
Just because it's a clothing - optional profession does n't mean there are lots of naked writers around .
Composing prose while nude is unsanitary , marginally abnormal and , in warm weather , painful .
I know for a fact that John Updike was fully clothed while writing each and every one of his 92 novels , 436 short stories and 1,203 essays about art .
I 've had my coffee now .
Can you tell ? )
Because I am bound by the laws and customs of the East Bay , I buy my coffee at Peet's .
I used to buy coffee beans , which meant I would have to start each morning interacting with a machine whose operating principle is sharp blades whirling around at high speeds .
Was this a good idea ?
I think not .
Then one day , after having had a cup of coffee made from ground - at - the - store Sumatra , I realized : I can't tell the difference .
Indeed , I discovered that I do not have very many opinions about coffee .
I know this marks me as an outcast .
If the coffee is grown on the north side of the lush mountains of Jamaica and stored at a temperature of 47 degrees and hand - ground just moments before the hot ( but not too hot ) water comes into contact with it , swell .
If not , also swell .
I like my coffee fresh and hotter than room temperature ; beyond that , I really do n't care .
It 's not that I can't taste the difference between various kinds of coffee ; it 's that I do n't care about the differences .
I suffer from opinion deficit disorder .
To start the day , I enjoy a mock latte .
A mock latte is made with coffee , milk and a little spinning gadget that whips the milk up into a fine froth .
Mock lattes are not quite as good as -- well , yes , they are .
To my taste , anyway .
Just as good .
I could buy a $ 5,000 espresso machine and use up all of my remaining available counter space , but to what end ?
Besides : hot steam in the morning ?
Are you mad ?
So here is what I must do in the morning .
( Please pay attention to this , despite its boring details , as you would to the instructions for assembling your child 's dollhouse , or to an article on freight trains by John McPhee . )
I must take the coffee , the caffeinated coffee ( we have the other kind too ) , and put it in a cone - shaped filter made from wire mesh .
Then I must place the filter into a filter caddy that rests atop the coffee cup .
Then I must fill the back of the Krups coffee machine with water and turn it on .
Then I must take the large Pottery Barn glass and fill it one - quarter full with milk and pop it in the microwave for 40 seconds .
I remove the glass from the microwave , throw a little Splenda brand chemical sugar into the milk , whip the whole thing up and pour the coffee into the glass .
Imagine the possibilities for error .
I do n't have to imagine them , because I 've already done them .
Coffee , pot on , no water -- check .
Water , pot on , no coffee -- check .
Water , coffee , pot not on -- check .
Milk in microwave , but microwave not turned on -- check .
Milk in microwave , microwave turned to four minutes instead of 40 seconds -- check .
( I almost grasped the glass on that occasion , but the fiercely bubbling lava - pit - like milk tipped me off in time . )
Putting coffee where the water goes -- check .
Pouring cold water directly on the coffee -- check .
Putting the water in and starting the pot without putting the coffee filter back in -- check .
( Lovely flood . )
Putting salt into my coffee instead of fake sugar -- check .
( Do n't you think that the makers of salt should be required to put a harmless chemical dye into their product , so that it turns orange and becomes readily distinguishable from sugar ?
I do .
I once gave my granddaughter Cheerios with salt on top .
She loves telling that story .
She remembers nothing else from when she was 3 , but she remembers that . )
I understand we 're touching on addictive behavior here , but has anyone marketed injectable caffeine ?
Not much , you understand -- just enough to get the coffee started .
It 's a grand business opportunity .
There 's nothing like a good cup of coffee , unless it 's another good cup of coffee , which is actually like it in every way north of the atomic level .
A very successful lawyer parked his brand - new Lexus in front of his office , ready to show it off to his colleagues .
As he got out , a truck passed too close and completely tore off the door on the driver 's side .
The lawyer immediately grabbed his cell phone , dialed 911 , and within minutes a policeman pulled up .
Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions , the lawyer started screaming hysterically .
His Lexus , which he had just picked up the day before , was now completely ruined and would never be the same , no matter what the body shop did to it .
When the lawyer finally wound down from his ranting and raving , the officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief ...
" I can't believe how materialistic you lawyers are , " he said .
" You are so focused on your possessions that you do n't notice anything else .
" " How can you say such a thing ? " asked the lawyer .
The cop replied , " Do n't you know that your left arm is missing from the elbow down ?
It must have been torn off when the truck hit you . "
" Oh my God ! " screamed the lawyer .
" Where 's my Rolex ? "

T H A N K S !
I learned of science fiction and history in a single season .
History I found in the basement of an old brick house I happened to pass each day , on my way to elementary school , in a small town in Virginia .
This house stood vacant , but was in too conspicuous a state of repair to seem haunted , and had never interested me .
One afternoon , though , I noted that workmen had arrived , and that some sort of renovation was being prepared for .
Squeezing in past a sheet of plywood , I explored a series of cold , empty rooms .
One of these ( my heart beat faster ) contained a damp old trunk .
Having worked up the nerve to open it , I found only a few faded lithographs ( as I now imagine they were ) of airplanes .
But these were airplanes unlike any I had seen , and they held my attention in a peculiar way .
They were old , clearly of some other era , but exciting , and somehow frightening as well .
Squatting there , staring at them , I felt as though some enormous wedge of information was being driven into my head .
Various bits and pieces of half - knowledge were coming together , forming some new and utterly unexpected whole .
I already knew , as if by osmosis , that there had been a war , though I did n't know when , or with whom .
I had been raised , so far , by adults who sometimes spoke of " the war " as some previous time or era or world , but I had somehow never associated that with other , more vague ideas of some past and general conflict .
I had read comic books about war , and played with military toys , but had never considered how those might fit into some way the world had actually been .
I had found World War II , in that trunk .
I had discovered history , or it me , and I would never be the same .
Science fiction , then , I found on various wire racks , one of them offering a 15 - cent copy of the Classics Illustrated version of The Time Machine — which must have led me , just as its publishers claimed to have intended it to , to Wells 's text .
When George Pal 's film version was released , in 1960 , I already felt , though secretly , that The Time Machine was mine , part of a personal and growing collection of alternate universes , and that no one else in the theater really got it .
Even more secretly , I had filled a Blue Horse lined notebook with elaborate pencil sketches for my own , actual , working time machine .
It looked , I recall , rather more like the machine in the Classics Illustrated version than the one in George Pal 's film .
The Classics Illustrated time machine resembled a model of the atom , but I had imagined this , for my own purposes , as geared in some achingly complex spheres - within - spheres way that I could never quite envision in operation , but which would somehow allow it to move in three dimensions at once .
That , I imagined , just might do the trick .
I suspected , without admitting it to myself , that time - travel might be a magic on the order of being able to kiss one 's own elbow ( which had seemed , initially , to be quite theoretically possible ) but I was determined not to admit it .
The possibility was too delicious to relinquish .
Although I now think that I had no specific time - travel adventures in mind , no head - scratching paradoxes to be explored .
I do n't remember dreaming of exploring the past of the world around me , or of journeying to its future .
What I wanted was to attain the world of The Time Machine , the Morlocks ' garden .
Wells 's Victorian future nightmare had become a favorite fantasyland , for me .
Because it existed so far up the timeline as to be beyond history , and history , once acknowledged , had quickly become a sort of nightmare , one from which there seemed to be no escape .
History , I was learning , there at the start of the nineteen - sixties , never stops happening .
I had become an involuntary sponge for modern history , after my discoveries of World War II and science fiction .
Much of the science fiction I was reading , American fiction of the nineteen - forties and fifties , had already become history of a sort , requiring an acquired filter for anachronism .
I studied the patent Future History timeline Robert Heinlein appended to each of his novels and noted where it began to digress from history as I was coming to know it .
I filtered indigestible bits of anachronistic gristle out of this older science fiction , reverse - engineering a model of the real past through a growing understanding of what these authors had gotten wrong .
In another trunk , in my own family attic , I had unearthed World War I .
A much more substantial trove , this one : rolled memorial scrolls bearing the names of the hometown dead , and the lightly rusted and altogether astonishing mass of a Colt Model 1911 automatic pistol .
I watched the CBS documentary series Twentieth Century on Sunday nights , moved by the eminently sane Midwestern voice of Walter Cronkite , as he narrated aspects of the unimaginably complex and peculiar historical reality in which I was learning that I lived .
I learned about D - Day , the concentration camps , the atomic bomb , and the Cold War .
With these last two , Cronkite 's restrained narration met my growing and secret terror at where history and science ( or history as science fiction ? ) seemed almost certainly to be taking us .
And now , walking to school , past the house where I had discovered World War II , I passed the Post Office , newly marked with metal signs bearing the black - and - yellow Civil Defense symbol used to indicate fallout shelters .
Sirens were tested regularly , along with something called " the system " , and the dial of my first transistor radio was marked , twice , with that same symbol , indicating the two frequencies set aside for Civil Defense .
Freed by Wells and his literary descendants to roam , in my imagination , up and down the timeline , I had stumbled upon World War III , and the end of civilization .
Wells had discovered the end of civilization long before me .
It must have seemed that it kept coming back throughout his life to oppress him , the vision of cataclysm and systemic collapse , fuelled by some basic immaturity of the species — to bring an end , at least temporarily , to modern history and technological progress .
He must have expected it constantly , through World Wars I and II .
He would have been terribly aware of it looming again , in the years immediately before his death , with the military use of atomic energy an established fact .
In 1905 he had imagined it arriving with the military use of aerial bombs against civilian targets , but then he would see Zeppelins bomb London , and after that the Blitz , and then the advent of the German rocket - bombs .
In The Time Machine , wars are a thing of the immemorial past , something necessarily transcended on the way to some safer , more rational basis for society .
None of which mattered to me as I cringed my way through the heating up of the Cold War , expecting any moment the wailing of the sirens that would call us all into the basement of the Post Office .
The television dramatization of Pat Frank 's Alas , Babylon , a popular novel set in a small Florida town in the immediate aftermath of nuclear war , had sealed my fate .
Something akin to Sartre 's dictum that hell is other people was dawning on me , and part of the cloud of constant secret terror I inhabited was some conviction that my neighbors , confined in what I imagined as the stifling darkness of a Civil Defense fallout shelter , would prove to be my own personal Morlocks .
The appeal of The Time Machine for me , then , become one purely of escape .
I longed for Wells 's ellipsis , the long blur forward , " night follow ( ing ) day like the flapping of a black wing . "
I longed to find myself on the far side of whatever terrible , inevitable history was about to happen .
I saw , with utmost clarity , the World War II howitzers , on the town 's courthouse lawn , dusted with the falling detritus of Chicago , and the sky above glowing with a new and deadly clarity .
I did n't understand that Wells himself had written a more thorough end to humanity , in The Time Machine , than any I imagined descending on America as I knew it .
The perversely enjoyable melancholy that pervades the garden of the Eloi emanates not from the hidden underworld of the Morlocks , nor from their grisly symbiosis with their former masters , but from the exquisite and utterly deliberate job of world - wrecking Wells has performed for us .
Writers before and after Wells have enjoyed the heady pleasures of reducing the great monuments of their day to imaginary ruin , but few have attained the degree of symbolic elegance , nor the convincingly forlorn realism , of the Palace of Green Porcelain .
Here , in what once was Kensington , site of Wells 's scientific education and all of his early hope , everything Victorian civilization valued has long been ended , ruined not by war but by a devolution of the human species — brought about by the failure to recognize the eventual outcome of a disastrous course of affairs .
If Wells rejected socialism as a panacea , he also saw its diametric opposite as an inevitable road to ruin : " Ages ago , thousands of generations ago , man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and sunshine .
And now that brother was coming back — changed ! "
The Palace proves to be the ruin of a museum .
A single humble box of safety matches , preserved in an air - tight terrine , is the treasure the Time Traveler takes with him from that museum of man .
A last working token of technology : light and destruction both , in a palm - sized packet .
Matches , camphor , and a heavy lever broken from a nameless piece of machinery , to serve as club and pry-bar .
He leaves the museum with the tools of his early ancestors : fire and the club .
I had my own ancient tool of destruction , and taught myself , crouching in secret places , to disassemble it , my impossible , scary , secret provision from history .
I lightly oiled the parts and hid them separately , wrapped in rags .
This being Virginia in the early nineteen - sixties , I easily obtained a box of ammunition , alarmingly heavy finger - thick shells with bullets the color of a new copper penny .
I possessed the pistol , it seemed to me , much as the Time Traveler possessed his matches and his makeshift club , though far less purposefully .
He leaves the Palace of Green Porcelain with a plan , and I had no plan , only a global and unexpressed terror of impending nuclear war , and of the end of history , and the need to somehow feel in control of something .
Three years into my discovery of history , it was announced that Soviet ballistic missiles had been deployed in Cuba .
My encounter with history , I absolutely knew , was about to end then , and perhaps my species with it .
In his preface to the 1921 edition of The War in the Air , Wells wrote of World War I ( still able to call it , then , the Great War ) : " The great catastrophe marched upon us in daylight .
But everybody thought that somebody else would stop it before it really arrived .
Behind that great catastrophe march others today . "
In his preface to the 1941 edition , he could only add : " Again I ask the reader to note the warnings I gave in that year , twenty years ago .
Is there anything to add to that preface now ?
Nothing except my epitaph .
That , when the time comes , will manifestly have to be : ' I told you so .
You damned fools . '
( The italics are mine . ) "
The italics are indeed his : the terminally exasperated visionary , the technologically fluent Victorian who has watched the 20th Century arrive , with all of its astonishing baggage of change , and who has come to trust in the minds of the sort of men who ran British Rail .
They are the italics of the perpetually impatient and somehow perpetually unworldly futurist , seeing his model going terminally wrong in the hands of the less clever , the less evolved .
And they are with us today , those italics , though I 've long since learned to run shy of science fiction that employs them .
I suspect that I began to distrust that particular flavor of italics when the world did n't end in October of 1962 .
I can't recall the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis at all .
My anxiety , and the world 's , reached some absolute peak .
And then declined , history moving on , so much of it , and sometimes today the world of my own childhood strikes me as scarcely less remote than the world of Wells 's childhood , so much has changed in the meantime .
I may actually have begun to distrust science fiction , then , or rather to trust it differently , as my initial passion for it began to decline , around that time .
I found Henry Miller , then , and William Burroughs , Jack Kerouac and others , voices of another kind , and the science fiction I continued to read was that which somehow was resonant with those other voices , and where those voices seemed to be leading me .
And it may also have begun to dawn on me , around that same time , that history , though initially discovered in whatever soggy trunk or in whatever caliber , is a species of speculative fiction itself , prone to changing interpretation and further discoveries .

My Obsession
Agrippa : A Book of the Dead
Charles Whiteside , whose poster of Gibson among the Morlocks is photographed above , is a Seattle artist whose work can be seen in the galleries and on the streets .
Never try to introduce the same product twice .
That was the lesson from the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May .
A year earlier , at E3 2005 in Los Angeles , Sony had wowed the videogame industry with demonstrations of the upcoming PlayStation 3's unprecedented graphical muscle .
The machine would n't be available until months after Microsoft 's next - gen console , the Xbox 360 .
Yet based on the spectacular preview , many gamers had no problem waiting for the PS3 .
Then , early this year , Sony dropped a bombshell : The PS3 release would be pushed back until November .
So when E3 came around again this spring , everyone trooped out to the retro Hollywood lotusland of the Sony Pictures lot – only to view the same console they 'd been promised the year before .
Not great .
Delays are nothing new in tech , but Sony seemed intent on making the worst of it .
The crowd was kept waiting nearly an hour .
Then Kaz Hirai , who heads PlayStation in North America , took the stage to declare , " The next generation does n't start until we say it does ! "
He meant it as a dig at Microsoft , but to gamers who'd been salivating for a year , his words were like a bitch slap .
The demos that followed were no more impressive than those the year before .
Finally , PlayStation chief Ken Kutaragi came forward to make the one announcement everyone wanted to hear : the price .
$ 600 for the high - end model ?
The room gasped , then fell silent .
Almost immediately , the blogosphere lit up with denunciations :
Sony has turned its back on gamers .
The PS3 will be a failure .
Kutaragi and Hirai are idiots .
PR fiascoes tend to be a sign that nobody 's thinking about the customer .
E3 was Sony 's second in seven months .
Last October , a security researcher reported on his blog that CDs from Sony BMG – the music label half - owned by Sony – contained antipiracy software that covertly embedded itself in computer operating systems , spying on their owners and leaving the machines themselves vulnerable to identity theft and zombie takeover attempts .
Sony BMG pooh - poohed the problem and released a software fix that made it even worse .
Millions of CDs had to be recalled .
As class actions multiplied and even the Department of Homeland Security warned music labels against undermining computer security , angry consumers declared themselves ready to boycott anything with the Sony name on it .
Sixty years after its founding in the ashes of postwar Tokyo , the company that gave us the transistor radio and the Walkman portable music player is deeply wounded .
Only once in the past five years has Sony 's all - important electronics division posted a profit ; during that same period , the company 's share price has fallen by nearly half .
Its hit products of the '90s – Handycams , WEGA TVs , VAIO computers – were succeeded by stillborn wonders like the AirBoard , a $ 1,000 videoscreen that could be carried around like a laptop , and the Net MD Walkman , a too - little - too - late attempt to challenge Apple 's iPod .
Neither this latter - day Walkman nor Sony Connect , the online music store The New York Times once called " Sony Disconnect , " would have anything to do with MP3 files – only Sony 's cumbersome and proprietary Atrac3 format would do .
Now , having ceded to Apple the portable - music - player market , Sony desperately needs to stay on top in videogames .
It 's not just that Sony needs a win ; PS3 is critical to its entire strategy .
The PS3 is much more than a game box .
Kutaragi likes to say it 's actually a computer , one that 's designed to lie at the center of the networked home , serving up films , navigating the Internet , doing nearly everything a PC can do , and delivering jaw - dropping videogames besides .
The new console relies on two extremely ambitious yet untested technologies .
At its core is a highly sophisticated microchip that can cruise at teraflop speeds ( equal to the fastest supercomputers of less than a decade ago ) and that might someday revolutionize home electronics .
Also built into the machine is Sony 's new Blu-ray hi-def disc player , which is proudly incompatible with a rival format from Toshiba – and which represents a bold , some would say reckless , attempt to control the multibillion - dollar market in next - generation video discs .
All this makes for a daring strategy , but not one that plays to Sony 's strengths .
Sony has always been at its best as a personal hardware company , coming up with nifty gadgets that delight consumers .
In recent decades , though , it 's become oddly fixated on imposing its own standards – Betamax for VCRs , the Mini -Disc for digital music players , the Universal Media Disc for PlayStation Portable , the Memory Stick for anything you can think of – despite the world 's unwavering rejection of those standards .
And Sony has never displayed an aptitude for software or had great success with networking , the key feature Microsoft has built into the Xbox .
Yet Sony has to face Microsoft not just in videogames but across the entire panoply of home electronics , which Microsoft is determined to control through software .
And Sony has to do this with cash reserves of $ 6 billion – compared to Microsoft's $ 38 billion hoard – while losing hundreds of dollars in manufacturing costs alone for every PS3 sold .
Eventually , Sony 's costs will come down .
But in the meantime , Goldman Sachs projects , Sony will lose nearly $ 2 billion on the PS3 by the end of this fiscal year in March .
Sony lovers – and they are legion – have been watching all of this with awe and trepidation .
It 's not every day that a $ 64 billion - a - year corporation puts its future on the line .
" It 's very un - Japanese , " observes Rishad Tobaccowala , who tracks the entertainment business as a future - of - media specialist at the global ad giant Publicis .
" It 's betting the company .
If this thing bombs , there is no second coming .
Everything else about Sony is a sideshow .
This is the show . "
How did it come to this ?
There were missteps aplenty , but at their root is a common dynamic :
What once made Sony great has worked against it in the digital age .
Sony 's course was fixed in the 1946 prospectus drawn up by cofounder Masaru Ibuka , when he set forth the new company 's purposes of incorporation .
Number one on his list : " To establish an ideal factory … where engineers with sincere motivation can exercise their technological skills to the highest level . "
To succeed , engineers would need to form small development teams and compete to build the next great gadget .
Teams of hardware engineers locked in competition : " It 's the principle Sony is built on , " says Shin'ichi Okamoto , PlayStation 's former CTO , now a Tokyo entrepreneur .
" Personally , I believe it's not such a good principle nowadays .
I got this impression in the ' 80s , with the technological shift to semiconductors and software " – both of which require enormous development teams that collaborate with the hardware units their work is intended for .
" At Sony , most engineers want to invent something new by themselves .
That 's a very different goal . "
Phil Wiser , the former CTO of Sony's US operations , reached a similar conclusion after he was tapped to salvage Sony Connect .
" With digital entertainment , you have to think about hardware , software , and services that tie them all together , " says Wiser , who managed to heave Sony onto the MP3 bandwagon before leaving earlier this year for a Silicon Valley startup .
" But it 's very hard to quantify the advantage of good software .
If you 're in a hardware company and you analyze it from a financial perspective , you just want to do it as cheaply as you can .
Software and services are an afterthought . "
The need to replace small competitive teams with large collaborative ones did occur to a few key Sony executives .
Toshitada Doi , a legendary engineer , set up a computer science lab in 1988 because he saw that the future would require networked devices and large - scale software development .
Years later , then - CEO Nobuyuki Idei reorganized Sony into a series of " network companies " and charged a promising lieutenant , Yuki Nozoe , with pulling together random broadband offerings into an all - encompassing networked future .
But all this talk of networks was anathema to Sony 's entrenched engineering cadre .
Today , Doi , Idei , and Nozoe are all gone , victims of their failure to make a difference , swept away in the boardroom coup that in spring 2005 put Howard Stringer , a longtime media exec who'd been heading Sony 's US operations , in charge of the company .
The culture of the lone - wolf hardware engineer reached its apex when Ken Kutaragi triumphed over internal opposition to create the PlayStation .
In the early '90s , Kutaragi burst forth with a seemingly reckless scheme to take on Nintendo and Sega , the ruling powers of the game world .
Yet even then he viewed Microsoft as the ultimate enemy .
Shuji Utsumi , a former PlayStation exec who now heads the Tokyo - based game developer Q Entertainment , recalls an exchange in which Kutaragi declared , years before the Xbox was introduced , that his competitor was Microsoft .
" I thought , what is he talking about ? " Utsumi says .
" Is he nuts ?
But even before PlayStation was born , he was predicting a big war for the living room . "
PlayStation 3 is hostage to that prediction .
Because technology can be decisive in war , Kutaragi loaded the PS3 with the biggest , baddest armaments yet : the Blu-ray disc drive and the Cell microchip .
He and his team had barely gotten PlayStation 2 out the door when they started conceptualizing the silicon for its successor .
The result , developed in partnership with IBM and Toshiba , features a central processing unit and eight coprocessors on the same chip , working in parallel .
It 's optimized for high - speed networking and fast decoding of encrypted and compressed data – copy - protected video for HDTVs , for example .
Game developers now have to figure out how best to unlock its powers .
Sunlight on water , creatures half - hidden by fog , age lines on a human face – " for every pixel , you can do more to synthesize reality , " says Steve Pearce , CTO of Activision .
" But it 's a big challenge – our engineers have to start thinking in a new way . "
As a result , the Cell has caused a lot of headaches for developers .
The Xbox 360 , with its three - core PowerPC processor , has already made game development far more complicated and expensive than before .
Tim Sweeney , cofounder of the North Carolina - based developer Epic Games , figures it will take at least twice the effort to fully exploit the PS3's potential as to take the Xbox 360 to the max .
Until that happens , it 's unlikely there 'll be much discernable difference between games on the two platforms .
" The Cell has more theoretical computing power , " says Sweeney , " but it might be years before we see that reflected in actual performance .
So it 's a fundamental question whether the long - term direction in computing is with architectures like the Cell . "
Blu-ray is equally fraught .
For starters , the whole business of high - definition disc drives seems designed to invite cynicism .
With DVD players now in 85 percent of US homes , sales fell in 2005 for the first time – so some manufacturers may need a next - gen disc player , but it 's not clear consumers do .
Especially after August 2005 , when talks aimed at averting a standards war with Toshiba 's rival HD - DVD format ended in a stalemate .
Andy Parsons , who heads advanced product development at Pioneer USA ( a Blu- ray supporter ) , says compromise was impossible : " It 's kind of like saying , ' LCD and plasma – why do n't you combine the two ? ' "
True enough – but it's also true that Blu-ray offers
Sony yet another chance to establish a proprietary format .
During the '90s , a similar conflict over the original DVD ended with Sony 's surrender and Toshiba 's collection of most of the royalties on every DVD and DVD player sold .
This time , Sony had the support of the big US computermakers , most of Hollywood , and nearly all the Asian consumer electronics giants – so why not call Toshiba 's bluff ?
Then there was the decision to build Blu-ray into the PlayStation 3 .
Sony 's logic seemed ironclad :
Not only would the hi-def drive 's huge storage capacity allow for far - more - realistic and complex games , the PS3 would carry Blu-ray into millions of households and drive sales of HDTVs as well .
As it turned out , however , Blu-ray has done nothing good for the PS3 .
Blu-ray was the main reason gamers were n't able to get the new machine last spring :
The launch had to be postponed because the new format 's digital rights management system did not yet satisfy every Hollywood studio .
Blu-ray was also a big factor in the PS3's high price tag .
Of course , with stand - alone Blu-ray players starting at $ 1,000 , the PS3 is actually a bargain – if a Blu-ray player is what you really want .
If not , $ 600 is a lot of money .
" For rich , older people it 's attractive , " Utsumi observes .
" But I do n't know if they are gameplayers . "
Kaz Hirai has heard it all before : the jitters about a new disc format , the complaints from game developers , the charges of hubris .
When you 're this far ahead – more than 200 million PlayStations sold worldwide , compared to just 30 million Xboxes – it comes with the territory .
" With every generational change , there are going to be challenges for the development teams , " he says .
" If everybody said it 's a piece of cake , that 's telling me it's not a future - proof console , that it has no headroom to grow . "
And that remark at E3 ?
" I wanted to say , look – we 're the leadership company , and we take that responsibility seriously .
The next huge leap in technology does not come until we launch PlayStation 3 . "
Hirai has a point : PlayStation 3 is as high tech as it comes in gameland .
Thanks to the Cell , the console can transform raw computer code into imagery that looks startlingly , almost disturbingly , real – just ask the Tiger Woods simulacrum that popped up at E3 .
It can render virtual worlds of shimmering beauty and mesmerizing intensity , as Warhawk , the forthcoming update of Sony 's classic flying shooter , amply demonstrates .
Nonetheless , Hirai 's upbeat assessment of the PS3's prospects seems dangerously at odds with the feeling in the videogame business .
One prominent industry figure , not associated with a console maker , recalls having lunch a couple of months ago with a game - company development chief who wondered aloud if Sony was going to pull a Sega – that is , go from number one console manufacturer to out of the business .
At the root of Sony 's precarious position – not just in the industry , but with gamers at large – is the company 's overweening ambition .
The PS3 is all about power .
Sony has said curiously little about whether this amped - up Linux über - computer will actually be fun to play .
Meanwhile , Nintendo wowed everyone at this year 's E3 with the Wii , a console you can play simply by waving a wand at the screen .
And Microsoft has upped the fun quotient by making it easy to play with all your buddies online .
Sony 's response to online gaming is revealing .
When Microsoft launched its Xbox Live online service in 2002 , console gaming went from solo affair to global meet - up .
Back then , Sony was actually the leader in online gaming , with over 400,000 subscribers to EverQuest , its massively multiplayer online game .
But MMOGs were played on a computer , not a game console , and there was little communication between the San Diego - based EverQuest group and the Tokyo - based PlayStation group .
Xbox Live now has more than 3 million subscribers worldwide ; the only place it is n't big is Japan .
Kutaragi never fully developed his PlayStation 2 online service , which still requires game publishers to run multiplayer titles on their own servers , because it was n't something he saw as lacking .
Yet game developers certainly saw the need for technology that would take their games online .
" It 's a very important function , " says Ichiro Otobe , chief strategist of the Tokyo - based game publisher Square Enix , " and we want it coming from the platform developer – otherwise , we have to build it ourselves . "
Eventually , PlayStation execs got the idea .
For more than a year , San Diego and Tokyo have been working together to come up with an answer to Xbox Live .
Even so , Hirai says , " the fundamental approach is different from Microsoft's .
They name it Live and it's a big to - do .
We look at it the other way :
There 's the entertainment experience , what you have in the box , all those good things , and – oh , by the way – we have an online component . "
In Sony , Microsoft may have found the ideal opponent : large , slow , still fixated on hardware , still trying to find its footing in the networked world .
When Microsoft decided to move into the game business , it was because a handful of execs saw an opportunity to do for gaming what Windows had done for personal computing : transform it from a hardware - defined industry to one governed by software .
J Allard , the team 's leader , argued that the success of DirectX – a Microsoft software suite that made it easy to program a PC – meant the company could simplify game development , too .
Allard was just as committed to online services :
If Microsoft could hook up players worldwide , it could change the nature of gameplay and make Xbox the way of the future .
" This business used to be about hardware and a cartridge you popped in , " says Peter Moore , the new leader of Xbox , at his headquarters in an office park in Redmond , Washington .
" But hardware is a tough business .
You need it , but you also need great software and innovative services . "
A Liverpool native with an office full of autographed soccer memorabilia and a sleek new Aston Martin coupe in the parking lot , Moore knows the vulnerabilities of hardware all too well :
He headed Sega of America when PlayStation 2 overwhelmed its Dreamcast machine and pushed Sega out of the business .
Now he spends much of his time on what Microsoft calls " Dev Luv , " an all - out effort to give game developers the software tools and engineering support they need to make Xbox the platform of choice .
Meanwhile , Xbox Live keeps gaining new features – most recently , user profiles that allow other players to check out your skill level and reputation within the community .
( Too many " avoid this player " raps and you could find yourself shunned . )
And because the Xbox 360 acts as a bridge to Windows Media Center PCs , the console can serve up music and video from your hard drive and play it on any device in the house .
Still , Moore notes , " we 're not driving the 360 as the hub of the home .
Editing and manipulating media is better done with a keyboard and mouse . "
Like the PlayStation 3 , the Xbox 360 will get a hi-def disc drive , but it wo n't be built in , and it wo n't be Blu-ray .
Last September , Microsoft and Intel announced they were throwing their weight behind Toshiba 's HD - DVD , a move that prompted several companies from the Blu-ray camp to hedge their bet by accommodating both standards .
Amir Majidimehr , Microsoft 's point man on the decision , cites several reasons for siding with Toshiba , chief among them Blu-ray 's move – largely at the behest of some copyright cops at Fox – to supplement the already draconian DRM mechanism adopted by both camps with yet another layer of protection .
" We worry that this program could be hacked to do bad things , " Majidimehr says , alluding to last year 's Sony BMG fiasco .
Blu -ray partisans say that 's impossible – but in any case , Majidimehr argues , " if one or the other of these layers decides it does n't like what you 're doing , it wo n't let you play the movie . "
Was the competition with Sony a factor , too ?
" Of course , " he says .
" But our strategy is , people want to play games , so we build a game console .
Sony is like , all or nothing .
They 're going to have a world of hurt waiting for them at the end of this year . "
A couple of months ago , Howard Stringer and Ryoji Chubashi , Sony 's president , reported to a luxury hotel in Tokyo's Shinagawa district to face 7,200 shareholders at Sony 's annual meeting .
It was not an enviable assignment .
With the company in the red yet again in its most recent quarter , Japanese investors were in an unhappy mood .
" I bought shares in mighty Sony , " cried a woman whose holdings had lost nearly two - thirds of their value .
" What are you going to do about this ? "
It was hardly an unexpected question , and Stringer answered as best he could .
Citing runaway ticket sales for Sony Pictures '
The Da Vinci Code and the remarkable success of the Bravia digital TV line , he argued that Sony has entered a period of reemergence .
But The Da Vinci Code will have no more lasting effect on the bottom line than earlier Sony blockbusters like Spider - Man , and Bravia relies on LCD technology that Sony ignored for years – until finally it had to partner with its Korean archrival Samsung to get back in the TV business .
So while each was good news , they do n't add up to a sign that mighty Sony is back .
Stringer 's new mantra is " Sony United . "
It 's meant to get the company to perform in the digital world , to shed its antiquated ways and embrace network thinking .
Most of all , though , it 's meant to get Sony to perform as a single unit .
Blu-ray is the first product to get the full treatment , not just from PlayStation but from the film and music divisions as well .
This will be the test of the theory that was used to justify the billions
Sony spent to get into the entertainment business in the ' 80s – that Sony could have won the Betamax - VHS war if only it had had enough " content . "
Sony has had rah -rah moments in the past – too many of them .
Before " Sony United " there was " Transformation 60 , " which cut 20,000 jobs in hopes of returning the company to health by its 60th anniversary .
Before that there was " Symphony , " which was supposed to get all the different divisions to play the same tune .
But the megaproducts
Sony has come up with , whether the AirBoard portable TV / Internet screen or the PS3 , have n't sought to fill some simple , unrecognized need , as the Walkman had done ; they 've sought to do many things in the best way imaginable .
Simply reading their spec sheets is enough to make you suspect they were designed not to please customers but to beat Microsoft .
They make you long for Nintendo 's Wii , a game console whose singular appeal is that it 'll be fun to play .
The Wii is a product Sony might have developed in its heyday .
It does n't try to outdo anyone on graphics muscle or computational power – in fact , it opts out of the arms race entirely .
Faced with a shrinking videogame market in Japan even as it was being elbowed into third place worldwide by Microsoft , Nintendo had to do something fresh , so company president Satoru Iwata and game designer Shigeru Miyamoto put their heads together and came up with a gyroscopic controller that looks and feels like a TV remote .
The Wii transforms gameplay from an exercise in button - pushing to something you do by swinging the controller through the air – pretty nifty when you 're engaged in swordplay .
No wonder gamers use words like " wow " and " amazing " when they try it out .
All this makes you wonder if united is the way to go .
In 30 years , Sony has transformed itself from a consistently profitable consumer electronics company with annual sales of $ 1.6 billion to a dangerously wobbly consumer electronics - entertainment - financial services behemoth 40 times that size .
Sony Electronics needs to embrace the networked world , obviously , but does it really need to be allied with a Hollywood film studio and a consumer - wary global music label in a global campaign against Microsoft ?
Probably not .
It just needs to make cool products for the century we live in .
That shareholder in Tokyo had the right idea : Bring back mighty Sony .
Please .
That does n't mean gargantuan Sony or megalomaniac
Sony or rule - the - universe Sony ; it means a Sony that 's fun again .
And for God 's sake , no more wars in the living room – not unless they 're the kind we can play with our friends .

Hubble makes movie of Neptune 's atmosphere
SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE NEWS RELEASE
Posted : September 4 , 2005
New NASA Hubble Space Telescope images of the distant planet Neptune show a dynamic atmosphere and capture the fleeting orbits of its satellites .
The images have been assembled into a time - lapse movie revealing the orbital motion of the satellites .

Images were taken in 14 different colored filters probing various altitudes in Neptune 's deep atmosphere so that scientists can study the haze and clouds in detail .
These are several snapshots from the Neptune movie .
The natural - color view of Neptune ( to left ) , common to naked eye telescopic views by amateur astronomers , reveals a cyan colored planet .
Methane gas in Neptune 's atmosphere absorbs most of the red sunlight hitting the planet , making it look blue - green .
The image was created by combining images in red , green , and blue light .
Neptune 's subtle features are more visible in the enhanced - color view ( top right ) .
Images taken in special methane filters show details not visible to the human eye ( bottom right ) .
The features seen in this enhanced image must be above most of the sunlight - absorbing methane to be detectable through these special filters .
The planet is so dark at the methane wavelengths that long exposures can be taken , revealing some of Neptune 's smaller moons .
Clockwise from the top ( in composite image at left ) , these moons are Proteus ( the brightest ) , Larissa , Despina , and Galatea .
Neptune had 13 moons at last count .
Neptune is the most distant giant planet in our Solar System , orbiting the Sun every 165 years .
It is so large tht nearly 60 Earths could fit inside it .
A day on Neptune is between 14 hours and 19 hours .
The inner two thirds of Neptune is composed of a mixture of molten rock , water , liquid ammonia and methane .
The outer third is a mixture of heated gases comprised of hydrogen , helium , water and methane .
On April 29 and 30 , 2005 , Hubble images were taken every 4 - 5 hours , spaced at about a quarter of Neptune 's rotational period .
These where combined to create a time - lapse movie of the dynamic planet .
The Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy , Inc. ( AURA ) , for NASA , under contract with the Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , MD .
The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
The cooling of the U.S. housing market has begun to pull down the entire economy , just as experts had been predicting for several years now .
This was inevitable after the ludicrously overheated highs of the last few years , and we can only hope it ’s going to be a slow leak .

" The greater reality is that terrorism still exists in our world .

The 90 - minute film shows Mr Bush being targeted by a sniper during anti-war rally in Chicago in 2007 .
He is confronted by a demonstration when he arrives in the city to deliver a speech to business leaders and is shot as he leaves the venue .
The ensuing investigation focuses on a Syrian - born man .
' Irresponsible '
A White House spokesman said of the programme : " We are not going to comment because it does not dignify a response . "
The drama will have its world premiere at next month 's Toronto Film Festival before a screening on UK digital channel More4 .
John Beyer of UK TV pressure group MediaWatch said the film was " irresponsible " .
He said it could even trigger a real assassination attempt and told the Daily Mirror : " There 's a lot of feeling against President Bush and this may well put ideas into people 's heads . "
There will be people who will be upset by it but when you watch it you realise what a sophisticated piece of work it is
Peter Dale
Head of More4
Peter Dale , head of More4 , described it as a " thought - provoking critique " of contemporary US society .
He said : " It 's an extraordinarily gripping and powerful piece of work , a drama constructed like a documentary that looks back at the assassination of George Bush as the starting point for a very gripping detective story .
" It 's a pointed political examination of what the War on Terror did to the American body politic .
" I 'm sure that there will be people who will be upset by it but when you watch it you realise what a sophisticated piece of work it is .
" It 's not sensationalist or simplistic but a very thought - provoking , powerful drama .
I hope people will see that the intention behind it is good . "
Producers of the film , which is directed by Gabriel Range , hope to sell the broadcast rights to the US .
Death of a President will be shown on More4 on 9 October .
SYNOPSIS : A discussion of the ugly truth about race and the lethally inept Katrina response
By three to one , African - Americans believe that federal aid took so long to arrive in New Orleans in part because the city was poor and black .
By an equally large margin , whites disagree .
The truth is that there 's no way to know .
Maybe President Bush would have been mugging with a guitar the day after the levees broke even if New Orleans had been a mostly white city .
Maybe Palm Beach would also have had to wait five days after a hurricane hit before key military units received orders to join rescue operations .
But in a larger sense , the administration 's lethally inept response to Hurricane Katrina had a lot to do with race .
For race is the biggest reason the United States , uniquely among advanced countries , is ruled by a political movement that is hostile to the idea of helping citizens in need .
Race , after all , was central to the emergence of a Republican majority : essentially , the South switched sides after the passage of the Civil Rights Act .
Today , states that had slavery in 1860 are much more likely to vote Republican than states that did n't .
And who can honestly deny that race is a major reason America treats its poor more harshly than any other advanced country ?
To put it crudely : a middle - class European , thinking about the poor , says to himself , " There but for the grace of God go I . "
A middle - class American is all too likely to think , perhaps without admitting it to himself , " Why should I be taxed to support those people ? "
Above all , race - based hostility to the idea of helping the poor created an environment in which a political movement hostile to government aid in general could flourish .
By all accounts Ronald Reagan , who declared in his Inaugural Address that " government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem , " was n't personally racist .
But he repeatedly used a bogus tale about a Cadillac - driving Chicago " welfare queen " to bash big government .
And he launched his 1980 campaign with a pro-states ' - rights speech in Philadelphia , Miss. , a small town whose only claim to fame was the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers .
Under George W. Bush - who , like Mr. Reagan , is n't personally racist but relies on the support of racists - the anti-government right has reached a new pinnacle of power .
And the incompetent response to Katrina was the direct result of his political philosophy .
When an administration does n't believe in an agency 's mission , the agency quickly loses its ability to perform that mission .
By now everyone knows that the Bush administration treated the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a dumping ground for cronies and political hacks , leaving the agency incapable of dealing with disasters .
But FEMA 's degradation is n't unique .
It reflects a more general decline in the competence of government agencies whose job is to help people in need .
For example , housing for Katrina refugees is one of the most urgent problems now facing the nation .
The FEMAvilles springing up across the gulf region could all too easily turn into squalid symbols of national failure .
But the Department of Housing and Urban Development , which should be a source of expertise in tackling this problem , has been reduced to a hollow shell , with eight of its principal staff positions vacant .
But let me not blame the Bush administration for everything .
The sad truth is that the only exceptional thing about the neglect of our fellow citizens we saw after Katrina struck is that for once the consequences of that neglect were visible on national TV .
Consider this : in the United States , unlike any other advanced country , many people fail to receive basic health care because they can't afford it .
Lack of health insurance kills many more Americans each year than Katrina and 9/11 combined .
But the health care crisis has n't had much effect on politics .
And one reason is that it is n't yet a crisis among middle - class , white Americans ( although it 's getting there ) .
Instead , the worst effects are falling on the poor and black , who have third - world levels of infant mortality and life expectancy .
I 'd like to believe that Katrina will change everything - that we 'll all now realize how important it is to have a government committed to helping those in need , whatever the color of their skin .
But I would n't bet on it .

He is the man who beat Google to dominate the world 's fastest - growing internet market , and he has done it by building a search engine with a distinctly Chinese character .
Robin Li 's Baidu.com is a search engine that is weak on piracy and strong on censorship .
It is very much in keeping with a country that mixes ultra- capitalist economics with authoritarian communist politics .
To his many domestic admirers , the multimillionaire pin-up is a model internet entrepreneur who has beaten off some of the world 's most powerful multinationals .
But his detractors , particularly in the global entertainment industry , accuse him of being the navigator - in - chief for an armada of online music pirates .
The 37 - year - old founder and chief executive says he does not have much time either for plaudits or criticism .
He is too busy trying to keep ahead of the rapid changes in the Chinese internet and building an empire that may one day , he predicts , pose a challenge to Bill Gates ' Microsoft .
That may sound ambitious for a company that few people outside China have heard of , but Li has already come a long way in a very short space of time .
Since he entered the business four years ago , Baidu has rapidly overtaken Google and Yahoo ! as the leading Chinese search engine .
It is easily China 's most popular navigation site - its directory of a billion web pages is used by 90 m people a day out of an online population of 100m .
International investors are so excited that when the firm listed on Nasdaq in August , it created a frenzy not seen since the height of the dotcom bubble .
The value of the company quadrupled in 24 hours .
Li is now reputedly worth $ 600 m ( £ 350 m ) .
" It was a surprise to me .
I did n't expect this kind of performance , " Li says .
" But to me it was a branding event .
It educated the market .
More people now realise that Baidu is the biggest search engine in China . "
Li knows the big IT players in the United States .
A native of Shanxi province to the west of Beijing , in 1991 he went to the US for postgraduate study and worked for Dow Jones in New Jersey and then Infoseek in Silicon Valley .
Having seen the internet at first hand on both sides of the Pacific , he says there are major cultural differences that make it difficult for a foreign firm - no matter how wealthy - to make inroads in China .
The country 's top three portals are all Chinese , even though Yahoo ! has been trying for seven years to establish a presence .
The two big online game firms , Shanda and Netease , are also Chinese .
Li says the same home advantage applies to the search engine business .
" The market has exploded in a very short time , " he says .
" User information needs to change very quickly .
Because we were local and focused we were able to catch the changes quickly .
We understand the Chinese language and culture better . "
Tiananmen Square
Asked to illustrate the differences , Li says his firm 's search engine can distinguish between two - character and three - character Chinese names so that its results are more relevant than those of its rivals .
It has also created chatrooms related to the most common inquiries so that everyone who looks for the name of a pop star gets the chance to share opinions as well as find related sites .
Critics say these are minor adjustments to a design and business model that is largely a copy of Google .
The reason for Baidu 's success , they argue , is that it collaborates with the communist authorities on censoring sensitive political information more than its rivals do and is less stringent in blocking access to sites that offer pirate film and music downloads .
Look for the name of dissident writer Lu Xiaobo or references to the Tiananmen Square massacre on Baidu and no information appears .
But search for Radiohead or Britney Spears and Baidu offers a specific MP3 channel that directs you towards pirate downloads of every song the band and singer have ever made .
The record company EMI successfully sued Baidu in Beijing this week over this MP3 service - which accounts for 20 % of Baidu 's traffic - but Li said his company would appeal .
" You have to understand we are a search engine .
We do not host any content .
We just point people to information that is publicly available .
So we are not infringing any copyrights . "
He says Baidu blocks sites that are proved to contain pirated information , but he is unwilling to comply with record companies ' requests that even queries be taken out of the directory .
" We list 1 billion pages , we can not go through every one and find out if it is pirated , " he says .
However , it appears to be easier for Baidu , as well as its rivals Google and Yahoo ! , to block references to sensitive political information .
" As a locally operated company we need to obey the Chinese law .
If the law determines that certain information is illegal , we need to remove it from our index , " Li says .
In this respect , Baidu is very much a mirror of modern China : passive pirated entertainment is encouraged , politically sensitive information and criticism are heavily restricted .
But Li says this is as much about demographics as politics .
" One of the big differences in the Chinese internet is that the majority of users are much younger than in the US or UK .
If you only count people under 30 , we probably have the largest internet population in the world .
If a teenager goes online it is most likely they will play some sort of game rather than look for information . "
But even with the restrictions and the focus on entertainment , he says China is gradually being transformed .
" People can get information - on entertainment , politics , finance - much easier than before .
That will change the way people do business , the way people live . "
Bubble
Li is in a powerful position , but it has not been plain sailing .
True to the roller - coaster history of the dotcom market , Baidu 's share price surged from the initial float price of $ 27 to a giddy $ 154 before plunging back down below $ 70 , despite reporting a year - on - year tripling of quarterly profits , and more recently nudging upwards again .
Comparisons have been drawn with the US dotcom bubble five years ago , but Li says the big difference now is that the Chinese companies listed on Nasdaq are making profits .
" It is a young industry .
There are risks so it is natural that some people will lose money .
It does n't mean there is a bubble , " he says .
" The internet population is going up and up .
I am confident that this will be a huge market . "
He says Baidu is only now starting to hit its stride .
" We are still in a very early stage of the game .
We want to invest aggressively to make sure that we become the most dominant player in the most profitable area of the internet in China , " he says .
" Considering the fact that we are competing with some of the most powerful technology companies in the world , it is not an easy job . "
One of the big differences between the internet in China and elsewhere , he says , is the proportion of users to the overall population .
From 22 m five years ago at the start of 2001 it has grown to 100 m and is expected to reach 120 m by the end of this year .
" Although 100 m is a huge number , it is less than 10 % of the population of this country , so the network effect is not fully developed yet , " Li says .
" There is a lot of room to grow .
That is why I am more focused on long - term investment than short - term profits . "
The number of businesses using the internet to advertise and sell is even smaller .
Baidu's $ 1.1 m quarterly profit was tiny compared with its giant rivals , which are pulling in revenue from the more lucrative English - language segment of the web .
By one estimate , the entire Chinese search engine market was worth just $ 151 m last year , compared with more than $ 4bn in the US .
But speculation is reaping rewards .
Li boasts that Baidu 's initial investors , who paid 25 cents a share , have probably made the best return on any private investment deals ever made in Asia .
But competition is hotting up .
This year Yahoo ! has invested $ 1bn in a 40 % stake in the Chinese online retailer Alibaba and Microsoft has launched a Chinese web portal through a joint venture with Shanghai Alliance Investment , the state - owned investment firm .
Google has also begun recruiting high - profile senior executives from rival companies to run its business in China .
Asked about rumours that it has also offered to buy Baidu , Li pauses before replying : " I can not comment at this time . "
He could certainly become a great deal richer if he sold up .
But Li appears to have larger ambitions .
Asked about Bill Gates ' recent comment that Google is becoming more influential , Li says the Microsoft chairman should watch out for the challenge from China .
" If he is worried about Google he will probably be more worried about Baidu somewhere down the road , " he says .
" When the Chinese market stops growing faster than other countries in the world , we will look outside .
The reason we focus here now is that this is the fastest growing market we can access . "
Poetry and protest
Baidu 's name - meaning hundreds of times - comes from an 800 - year - old Chinese poem about the search for a " retreating beauty " , the company says .
" Hundreds and thousands of times , for her I searched in chaos , suddenly I turned by chance to where the lights were waning , and there she stood . "
Founded in 2000 and now employing 700 staff in Beijing , Shanghai and Shenzhen , it is not only China 's most used search engine but the fifth most popular website in the world .
It is not quite so popular with some other Chinese sites , which have formed an alliance called Fanbaidu ( " anti-Baidu " ) to fight its ranking of search results , known as P4P : pay for performance , under which they must bid for priority placement of links .
AUSTIN , Texas —
In general , I ’m against kicking ’em when they ’re down … unless really awful people are involved .
I figured Tom DeLay is so awful , plenty of people would gang up on him and I could pass .
Imagine my surprise when the toughest question one famous TV tough guy could come up with was , “ Do you think you invested too much in the Republican Party ? ”
Another inquired whether DeLay could think of any mistakes he ’d made .
I waited with bated breath for the immortal , “ I wish I could learn not to work so hard , ” but no , he could n’t think of a single one .
Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay first came to power promising to restore democracy to the House of Representatives , supposedly suffering from then - Speaker Jim Wright ’s tyrannical regime .
Even after the Rs drove Wright from office , however , bipartisanship was out of the question for DeLay .
In the budget fight and government shutdown of 1995 , for instance , DeLay rejected compromise and famously said , “ It ’s time for all - out war . ”
I never minded DeLay being a tough guy — it was his syrupy claims to carry the banner for Christianity that I found offensive , as he frog - marched the House toward being a cash - operated special - interest machine .
The idea of putting pressure on lobbyists to give only to Republicans , pressuring lobbying firms into hiring only Republicans and then letting lobbyists sit at the table during committee meetings where legislation was written — it was just screaming overt corruption .
Tom DeLay and Newt Gingrich turned the U.S. House of Representatives , “ the people ’s House , ” into a pay - for - play machine for corporations .
Put in enough money , get your special tax exemption , get your earmarked government contract , get your trade legislation and your environmental exemption , get rid of safety regulation .
I ’d like to address the idea that what DeLay did was only “ payback ” for the alleged sins of Jim Wright and then - House Majority Whip Tony Coelho , that it ’s “ our turn ” at the trough , so why not act like Dan Rostenkowski ?
It ’s a great way to rationalize misbehavior , even if the misbehavior is as disproportionate as Wright ’s ethical peccadillo compared to the open corruption of DeLay ’s “ K Street Project , ” selling Congress to the lobby .
I ’ve watched enough switches of political power and use of the “ payback ” excuse to realize that what the new Ins call “ payback ” has little to do with whatever the new Outs used to do .
It is , instead , a direct reflection — “ projection , ” the shrinks call it — of the ethical values of the Ins onto the Outs .
Every time you hear a misdeed justified by , “ Well , they used to do it , ” you can generally mark off a 50 % to 75 % exaggeration .
To get a real sense of DeLay ’s cynicism and recklessness , forget the stuff the press loves , like the “ free golfing trip ” to St. Andrew’s .
Instead , take note of the following example .
The Northern Marianas Islands are a U.S. protectorate ( so it can label goods “ Made in the USA ” ) being used as a sort of labor gulag in the Pacific , with workers imported from China and elsewhere and paid pitiful wages .
Jack Abramoff had a contract with the government of the Marianas to lobby against stopping the flow of immigrant labor to the islands and to prevent a minimum wage bill ( mandating a level higher than the island ’s standard $ 3.05 per hour ) from getting to the floor of the House .
The islands are home to classic sweatshops .
In 1996 and 1997 , Abramoff billed the Marianas for 187 contacts with DeLay ’s office , including 16 meetings with DeLay .
In December 1997 , DeLay , his wife and their daughter went on an Abramoff - arranged jaunt to the Marianas .
DeLay brunched with the Marianas ’ largest private employer , textile magnate Willie Tan .
Tan had to settle a U.S. Labor Department lawsuit alleging workplace violations .
According to the book “ The Hammer ” by Lou Dubose and Jan Reid , among the violations common on the islands is forbidding women to work when they are pregnant , thus leading to a high abortion rate .
Evidently , DeLay did n’t have time to look into such allegations , since he was busy playing golf and attending a dinner in his honor , sponsored by Tan ’s holding company .
According to The Washington Post , it was at this dinner that DeLay called Abramoff “ one of my closest and dearest friends . ”
He also reminded those present of his promise that no minimum wage or immigration legislation affecting the Marianas would be passed .
“ Stand firm , ” he added .
“ Resist evil .
Remember that all truth and blessings emanate from our Creator . ”
He then went with Tan to see a cockfight .
This is why DeLay ’s professions of Christianity make me sick .
He was there .
He could have talked to the workers .
Instead , he chose to walk with the powerful and do real harm to the very people Jesus mandated we especially care for .

Introduction
The USA government blames hatred of democracy and envy at the American way of life for this resentment .
Many people in the USA and a majority around the world look towards USA foreign policy for the answers .
Much of this policy , its history and consequences is under - reported by the American media .

If they knew one tenth of what their governments get up to around the world and in their dealings with foreign governments and people , there would be an enormous outcry .
For this reason much is hidden or obscurred .
Since the terrible events on 11 September 2001 , many Americans have taken to the internet to find out more about the world beyond their borders .
However , when you read these items , do not simply believe everything - always check for yourself .
Treat the stories and quotes in these pages as pointers and use the information to find out more .
Learn to think and check all information .

" We do n't really give a damn for what anybody thinks .
We rub everyone 's face in it .
We 're Americans and you 're not .
We 're really talking the Roman Empire here .
We 'll do anything we want to do and anywhere we want to do it .
You 're either with us or against us .
Multi-lateral institutions like the UN are incidental and irrelevant to the powers that be .
This is the image we 're sending to the world .
That is what much of the world feels about this country this minute . "
Dr. Robert M. Bowman , a retired Lieutenant Colonel from the USA Air Force , in an open letter to the USA President , George W Bush ( 2001 ) :
" We are not hated because we practice democracy , freedom , and human rights .
We are hated because our government denies these things to people in third world countries whose resources are coveted by our multinational corporations .
And that hatred we have sown has come back to haunt us in the form of terrorism ... "
" We are the target of terrorists because we stand for dictatorship , bondage , and human exploitation in the world .
We are the target of terrorists because we are hated .
And we are hated because our government has done hateful things .
In how many countries have we deposed popularly elected leaders and replaced them with puppet military dictators who were willing to sell out their own people to American multinational corporations ? "
" We did it in Iran when we deposed Mossadegh because he wanted to nationalize the oil industry .
We replaced him with the Shah , and trained , armed , and paid his hated Savak national guard , which enslaved and brutalized the people of Iran .
All to protect the financial interests of our oil companies .
Is it any wonder there are people in Iran who hate us ? "
" We did it in Chile when we deposed Allende , democratically elected by the people to introduce socialism .
We replaced him with the brutal right - wing military dictator , General Pinochet .
Chile has still not recovered . "
" We did it in Vietnam when we thwarted democratic elections in the South which would have united the country under Ho Chi Minh .
We replaced him with a series of ineffectual puppet crooks who invited us to come in and slaughter their people , and we did .
( I flew 101 combat missions in that war .... ) "
" We did it in Iraq , where we killed a quarter of a million civilians in a failed attempt to topple Saddam Hussein , and where we have killed a million since then with our sanctions .
About half of these innocent victims have been children under the age of five . "
" And , of course , how many times have we done it in Nicaragua and all the other banana republics of Latin America ?
Time after time we have ousted popular leaders who wanted the riches of the land to be shared by the people who worked it .
We replaced them with murderous tyrants who would sell out and control their own people so that the wealth of the land could be taken out by Domino Sugar , the United Fruit Company , Folgers , and Chiquita Banana . "
" In country after country , our government has thwarted democracy , stifled freedom , and trampled human rights .
That 's why we are hated around the world .
And that 's why we are the target of terrorists . "
" People in Canada enjoy better democracy , more freedom , and greater human rights than we do .
So do the people of Norway and Sweden .
Have you heard of Canadian embassies being bombed ?
Or Norwegian embassies ?
Or Swedish embassies .
No .
We are not hated because we practice democracy , freedom , and human rights . "
" Instead of sending our sons and daughters around the world to kill Arabs so the oil companies can sell the oil under their sand , we must send them to rebuild their infrastructure , supply clean water , and feed starving children .
Instead of continuing to kill thousands of Iraqi children every day with our sanctions , we must help them rebuild their electric power plants , their water treatment facilities , their hospitals ; all the things we destroyed in our war against them and prevented them from rebuilding with our sanctions . "
" Instead of seeking to be king of the hill , we must become a responsible member of the family of nations .
Instead of stationing hundreds of thousands of troops around the world to protect the financial interests of our multinational corporations , we must bring them home and expand the Peace Corps .
Instead of training terrorists and death squads in the techniques of torture and assassination , we must close the School of the Americas ( no matter what name they use ) .
Instead of supporting military dictatorships , we must support true democracy ; the right of the people to choose their own leaders .
Instead of supporting insurrection , destabilization , assassination , and terror around the world , we must abolish the CIA and give the money to relief agencies . "
" In short , we do good instead of evil .
We become the good guys , once again . "
" The threat of terrorism would vanish .
That is what the American people need to hear .
We are good people .
We only need to be told the truth and given the vision .
You can do it , Mr. President .
Stop the killing .
Stop the justifying .
Stop the retaliating .
Put people first .
Tell them the truth . "
John Gerassi , USA citizen :
" I can't help crying .
As soon as I see a person on TV telling the heart - rendering story of the tragic fate of their loved one in the World Trade Center disaster , I can't control my tears .
But then I wonder why did n't I cry when our troops wiped out some 5,000 poor people in Panama 's El Chorillo neighborhood on the excuse of looking for Noriega .
Our leaders knew he was hiding elsewhere but we destroyed El Chorillo because the folks living there were nationalists who wanted the USA out of Panama completely . "
" Worse still , why did n't I cry when we killed two million Vietnamese , mostly innocent peasants , in a war which its main architect , Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , knew we could not win ?
When I went to give blood the other day , I spotted a Cambodian doing the same , three up in the line , and that reminded me :
Why did n't I cry when we helped Pol Pot butcher another million by giving him arms and money , because he was opposed to " our enemy " ( who eventually stopped the killing fields ) ?
"
" To stay up but not cry that evening , I decided to go to a movie .
I chose Lumumba , at the Film Forum , and again I realized that I had n't cried when our government arranged for the murder of the Congo 's only decent leader , to be replaced by General Mobutu , a greedy , vicious , murdering dictator .
Nor did I cry when the CIA arranged for the overthrow of Indonesia 's Sukarno , who had fought the Japanese World War II invaders and established a free independent country , and then replaced him by another General , Suharto , who had collaborated with the Japanese and who proceeded to execute at least half a million ' Marxists ' ( in a country where , if folks had ever heard of Marx , it was at best Groucho ) ? "
" I watched TV again last night and cried again at the picture of that wonderful now missing father playing with his two - month old child .
Yet when I remembered the slaughter of thousands of Salvadorans , so graphically described in the Times by Ray Bonner , or the rape and murder of those American nuns and lay sisters there , all perpetrated by CIA trained and paid agents , I never shed a tear .
I even cried when I heard how brave had been Barbara Olson , wife of the Solicitor General , whose political views I detested .
But I did n't cry when the USA invaded that wonderful tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada and killed innocent citizens who hoped to get a better life by building a tourist airfield , which my government called proof of a Russian base , but then finished building once the island was secure in the US camp again . "
" Why did n't I cry when Ariel Sharon , today Israel 's prime minister , planned , then ordered , the massacre of two thousand poor Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila , the same Sharon who , with such other Irgun and Stern Gang terrorists become prime ministers as Begin and Shamir , killed the wives and children of British officers by blowing up the King David hotel where they were billeted ? "
" I guess one only cries only for one 's own .
But is that a reason to demand vengeance on anyone who might disagree with us ?
That 's what Americans seem to want .
Certainly our government does , and so too most of our media .
Do we really believe that we have a right to exploit the poor folk of the world for our benefit , because we claim we are free and they are not ? "
" So now we 're going to go to war .
We are certainly entitled to go after those who killed so many of our innocent brothers and sisters .
And we 'll win , of course .
Against Bin Laden .
Against Taliban .
Against Iraq .
Against whoever and whatever .
In the process we 'll kill a few innocent children again .
Children who have no clothes for the coming winter .
No houses to shelter them .
And no schools to learn why they are guilty , at two or four or six years old .
Maybe Evangelists Falwell and Robertson will claim their death is good because they were n't Christians , and maybe some State Department spokesperson will tell the world that they were so poor that they 're now better off . "
" And then what ?
Will we now be able to run the world the way we want to ?
With all the new legislation establishing massive surveillance of you and me , our CEOs will certainly be pleased that the folks demonstrating against globalization will now be cowed for ever .
No more riots in Seattle , Quebec or Genoa .
Peace at last . "
" Until next time .
Who will it be then ?
A child grown - up who survived our massacre of his innocent parents in El Chorillo ?
A Nicaraguan girl who learned that her doctor mother and father were murdered by a bunch of gangsters we called democratic contras who read in the CIA handbook that the best way to destroy the only government which was trying to give the country 's poor a better lot was to kill its teachers , health personnel , and government farm workers ?
Or maybe it will be a bitter Chilean who is convinced that his whole family was wiped out on order of Nixon 's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who could never tell the difference between a communist and a democratic socialist or even a nationalist . "
" When will we Americans learn that as long as we keep trying to run the world for the sake of the bottom line , we will suffer someone 's revenge ?
No war will ever stop terrorism as long as we use terror to have our way .
So I stopped crying because I stopped watching TV .
I went for a walk .
Just four houses from mine .
There , a crowd had congregated to lay flowers and lit candles in front of our local firehouse .
It was closed .
It had been closed since Tuesday because the firemen , a wonderful bunch of friendly guys who always greeted neighborhood folks with smiles and good cheer , had rushed so fast to save the victims of the first tower that they perished with them when it collapsed .
And I cried again . "
" So I said to myself when I wrote this , do n't send it ; some of your students , colleagues , neighbors will hate you , maybe even harm you .
But then I put on the TV again , and there was Secretary of State Powell telling me that it will be okay to go to war against these children , these poor folks , these USA haters , because we are civilized and they are not .
So I decided to risk it .
Maybe , reading this , one more person will ask :
Why are so many people in the world ready to die to give us a taste of what we give them ? "
George W Bush , USA president during the State of the Union address on 28 January 2003 :
" Throughout the 20th century small groups of men seized control of great nations , built armies and arsenals , and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world . "
Ann Coulter , USA commentator for the Republican Party discussing the Middle East :
" We should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity . "
Robert Hunter Wade , professor of political economy at the London School of Economics ( UK ) and author of " Governing the Market " ( Princeton University Press ) :
" Suppose you are a modern - day Roman emperor , leader of the most powerful country in a world of sovereign states and international markets .
What international political economy do you create so that , without having to throw your weight around too much , normal market forces bolster the economic pre-eminence of your country , allow your citizens to consume far more than they produce , and keep challengers down ? "
" You want autonomy to decide on your own exchange rate and monetary policy , while having other countries depend on your support in managing their own economies .
You want to be able to engineer volatility and economic crises in the rest of the world in order to hinder the growth of centres that might challenge your pre-eminence .
You want intense competition between exporters in the rest of the world to give you an inflow of imports at constantly decreasing prices relative to the price of your exports .
You want to invite the best brains in the rest of the world to your universities , companies and research institutes .
You befriend middle classes elsewhere and make sure they have good reasons for supporting your framework .
What features do you hard - wire into the international political economy ? "
" First , free capital mobility . "
" Second , free trade ( except imports that threaten domestic industries important for your reselection ) . "
" Third , international investment free from any discriminatory favouring of national companies through protection , public procurement , public ownership or other devices , with special emphasis on the freedom of your companies to get the custom of national elites for the management of their financial assets , their private education , healthcare , pensions , and the like . "
" Fourth , your currency as the main reserve currency . "
" Fifth , no constraint on your ability to create your currency at will ( such as a dollar - gold link ) , so that you can finance unlimited trade deficits with the rest of the world . "
" Sixth , international lending at variable interest rates denominated in your currency , which means that borrowing countries in crisis have to repay you more when their capacity to repay is less .
This combination allows your people to consume far more than they produce ( and it periodically produces financial instability and crises in the rest of the world ) .
To supervise the international framework you want international organisations that look like cooperatives of member states and carry the legitimacy of multilateralism , but are financed in a way that allows you control . "
" Is the above a Machiavellian interpretation of the US role in the world economy since the end of the Bretton Woods regime around 1970 ?
Certainly .
America 's engineering of its dominance has at times been for the general good , when it used its clout to " think for the world " .
But often its clout has been used solely in the interests of its richest citizens and most powerful corporations .
This latter tendency has been dominant lately .
We see it in its new single - minded unilateralism in international relations , much exacerbated by the mixture of rage at September 11 and gung - ho jubilation at " success " in Afghanistan .
And we see it in what the United States is now ramming through the international supervisory organisations . "
" The USA has engineered the WTO to commit itself to negotiate a general agreement on trade in services , which will facilitate a global market in private healthcare , welfare , pensions , education and water , supplied - naturally - by USA companies , and which will undermine political support for universal access to social services in developing countries .
It has engineered a " private sector development " agenda devoted to accelerating the private ( and nongovernmental ) provision of basic services on a commercial basis .
The World Bank has made no evaluation of its earlier efforts to support private participation in social sectors .
Its new private development thrust , especially in the social sectors , owes everything to USA pressure . "
" These power relations and exercises of statecraft are obscured in the current talk about globalisation .
The increasing mobility of information , finance , goods and services frees the American government of constraints while more tightly constraining everyone else .
Globalisation enables the US to harness the rest of the world to its own rhythms and structure . "
" Of course these arrangements do not produce terrorism .
But they are deeply implicated in the very slow economic growth in most of the developing world since 1980 , and in the widening world income inequality .
Slow economic growth and vast income disparities breed cohorts of partly educated young people who grow up in anger and despair .
Some try by legal or illegal means to migrate to the west ; some join militant ethnic or religious movements directed at each other and their own rulers .
But now the idea has spread among a few vengeful fundamentalists that the USA should be attacked directly . "
" The USA and its allies can stamp out specific groups by force and bribery .
But in the longer run , the structural arrangements that replicate a grossly unequal world have to be redesigned , so that markets working within the new framework produce more equitable results .
Historians looking back a century hence will say that the time to have begun was now . "

For A New Century , a document produced in 2000 by advisers to the USA government ( page 28 ) :
" This is especially important in light of the nascent European moves toward an independent defense ' identity ' and policy ; it is important that NATO not be replaced by the European Union , leaving the United States without a voice in European security affairs . "
Page 40 :
" American landpower is the essential link in the chain that translates U.S. military supremacy into American geopolitical preeminence . "
Gregg Easterbrook , journalist in the USA newspaper , The New York Times , writing about American military force :
" For years to come , no other nation is likely even to try to rival American might .
Other nations are not even trying to match American armed force , because they are so far behind they have no chance of catching up .
The great - powers arms race , in progress for centuries , has ended with the rest of the world conceding triumph to the United States . "
Major General Smedley D. Butler , USA strategist , 1935 .
" Lest this seem to be the bellicose pipedream of some dyspeptic desk soldier , let us remember that the military deal of our country has never been defensive warfare .
Since the Revolution , only the United Kingdom has beaten our record for square miles of territory acquired by military conquest .
Our exploits against the American Indian , against the Filipinos , the Mexicans , and against Spain are on a par with the campaigns of Genghis Khan , the Japanese in Manchuria and the African attack of Mussolini .
No country has ever declared war on us before we first obliged them with that gesture .
Our whole history shows we have never fought a defensive war .
And at the rate our armed forces are being implemented at present , the odds are against our fighting one in the near future . "

When Debbie Phillips tried to report a crime , police just snickered .
" I told him that someone came into my house and cleaned , " the president of the Putnam County School Board said .
" He just laughed . "
The problem was n't that her home smelled a little fresher or looked a little tidier .
The problem was that Phillips had no idea who the mystery cleaner was .
Her husband denied cleaning up the joint .
So did her next - door neighbor .
Everyone she asked denied responsibility .
All she knew was the rugs were n't where she had left them that morning in June .
Trinkets had been rearranged and in the master bedroom , the bed was made differently .
It did n't look like anything had been stolen , but she could n't be sure .
Nearly a month passed before the mystery was solved .
Her son called her at work recently after a cleaning lady arrived at the front door .
As it turns out , her neighbor across the street , with a similar house number , the same number of rooms to be cleaned and a house key hidden in a similar spot outside , had hired a cleaning service .
" They just came to the wrong door , " Phillips said .

PDF Version IN SEARCH OF THE NEW NEW PROGRAMMING THING
We are now emerging from the dark period earlier in the decade and many in the community are bemoaning the good old days when new languages appeared with great frequency and new paradigms abounded .
Unfortunately , we find ourselves in a world which increasingly ignores the experiences of past successes and failures to claim inventor rights are the new new thing .
Simple techno sound bites are easy to communicate using the web and academics have become as adept as major marketers in spin and mindshare capture .
Rather than evolving from the best of what we know to the better , each new thing in our field seems to need to kill off those that came before it .
A recent PhD student remarked that it was very upsetting to have to read old papers published in the mid to late 70s that contain immature versions of their new ideas which they must now read and cite .
It sometimes appears that scholarly work in our field is no longer a badge of honor but a burden forced on graduate students who have grumpy old supervisors .
We seem to be in denial that our industry is maturing , we are losing our elders , some of us do n’t code any more and many of our new things are really good ideas from 20 or more years ago .
Some good old ideas reappear because the technology is now available to commercially exploit them ; others become popular because they provide a better approach to solving a particular problem .
Reinvention and improvement of good old ideas is both scholarly and sound engineering provided the prior art is cited and explained as opposed to hyped or even patented .
This means we need to look for the important small improvements and not just the big bang !
We need to find the balance which builds from our best past work but also does n’t send a discouraging message that everything has been done before , or if it was that it was necessarily done correctly !
We need to benefit from the wisdom of our elders without being constrained by them .
We ’ve argued for the increased promotion of computational diversity ( http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2003_05/column1) rather than a narrow focus on using the right current industrial platform or language .
OBJECTS NEXT ?
In the OO community there seems to be a concerted search to either find what is “ Beyond Objects ? ” or to argue that “ Objects Are It ! ” .
To their credit OOPSLA ( http://www.oopsla.org/2006/) and ECOOP ( http://www.emn.fr/x-info/ecoop2006/) have been openly searching for new ideas in their calls for papers and workshops .
The OOPSLA Onward !
track deserves special mention in this regard as it provides a platform for new ideas .
The popular research area of AOP is one new next contender which has rapidly emerged from our own community and now has its own successful conference ( http://aosd.net/2005/).
Recently , there have been papers / proposals for Feature , Language , Law , DSL / Domain , and Context Oriented Programming etc .
There is also good work in integrated objects and transactions , unifying objects , info sets and tuples [ 1 ] .
Closely related to this is the interesting work on making relationships found in ER and UML models first class types in a programming language [ 2 ] .
Continued work on Actors [ 3 ] and more recently Chords [ 4 ] seeks to unify concurrency with object orientation .
Object Ownership has always proved a challenging problem especially when VM implementations refuse to allow objects to have an associated owner ; however , considerable progress has been made [ 5 , 6 ] .
There is also a resurgence in research on dynamic languages including prototype based languages and multi-paradigm languages .
Finally , work on using objects to build next generation multi-modal UI toolkits is very interesting [ 7 ] .
All of this work seeks to provide tools or language extensions which allow the OO model to address specific issues and / or broaden the applicability of OO .
While they do n’t promise a New Oriented Programming they provide the critical and difficult research to build better OO languages , tools and systems .
It is clearly a challenge to integrate all of these powerful concepts into a language / platform which is useable by those who are not advanced software professionals .
PEOPLE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
One of the more exciting changes in our field is the rapid and energetic emergence of Agile Software development initiated by Scrum and XP .
Unlike traditional process artifact centered approaches to development , Agile emphasizes human and business values .
Large , unfortunately unpublished internal studies have concluded that defects and timely delivery of software are most high correlated with the individuals and teams of individuals rather than the programming environments , languages or platforms .
We have for too long focused on the technical dimension of our field without considering the importance of the social aspects and especially the critical need to effectively communicate with our customers and between ourselves .
Even small progress in this area promises huge benefits .
OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
Open Source has provided the impetus for small global teams of open source project developers , some of whom have never met in person , to collaborate to build software together .
Other developers and users have full view of the source code they create and in many cases the interactions of team members .
Simple Open Source tools such as Wiki , JUnit and Fit have a major impact on allowing teams to build better software .
Eclipse has enabled many to contribute to the open source tooling .
Recently MS and Eclipse have initiated efforts to enable open process definitions which may lead to integration of processes and tools .
The availability of open tooling has allowed customers to innovate in their tools and processes , often accelerating the transition to things like Agile development .
The large open source code base provides a rich set of research data for social researchers as well as software engineers who can now finally look at large programs as they evolve over time .
The combination of sophisticated program analysis , text understanding and simple heuristics promises new tools for helping us understand how we work .
SOFTWARE WITH POLISH
It is well accepted that it takes time to polish a good essay , research paper or a program into something that we believe is correct and readable [ 8 ] .
Modern languages lack publication syntax and IDEs lack a nice way to publish / present the code using multiple fonts and indentations 2 so that it is readable [ 9 ] by others .
We need to make the technical and business case that clean , well - written software is a better investment and that “ send it back , refactor it and make it better ” is a necessity not a luxury .
SAYING MORE WITH LESS – THE NEED FOR A VHSL Despite the great progress in tools and languages there is still far too much stuff that gets in the way .
The latent and accidental complexity of current languages and platforms makes a 4GL of the past look like a dream .
Java and C# are just barely above the machine code of the VM .
VMs have lifted the level of the platform but we are still programming just above them .
There is too much code to be developed and maintained to keep using low - level languages even if they are supported with fancy visual tools and generators .
Even in old functional programming languages such as Lisp and APL all developers knew map reduce as a programming idiom and did n’t need a separate course in design patterns .
Perhaps we should take a tip from our colleagues in hardware design and think about languages which are simple , expressive and allow us to describe major applications in a small number of pages of code .
If electrical engineers can move to HDL and VHDL we should be prepared to move to at least a similar level of abstraction with a VHSL .
We need to move beyond the complexity , limitations and weaknesses of Smalltalk and Lisp but seek a language with at least as simple a syntax and more expressiveness .
We have the benefit of considerable research on advanced type systems which can used to work with the developer as opposed to against him .
Our hardware colleagues can help by using some of those transistors to support robust and efficient dispatch , true sandboxing and type and ownership information for every instance .
Small investments in hardware software co-design can have a huge impact on the robustness and adaptability of software .

Richard Ecob adapted a system for modelling atoms in radioactive decay to investigate how we look for partners .
He found that " super daters " , people who have many short relationships , have a good effect on others ' lives .
This is because they break up weak couples , forcing their victims to find better relationships .
Transit states
At the root of the system , says Mr Ecob , is the similarity between the probability of the nucleus of an atom decaying and that of a couple breaking up .
The decay of a nucleus is described in terms of " transit states " : the series of change it has been through to get to its current situation .
The probability of someone having been in two relationships , for example , is the same as that of a nucleus decaying twice .
" We had an inkling that it might be the same because we saw similarities , " he told the BBC News website .
" When we worked it out , the graphs we got were very similar . "
Having more varied tastes has no impact on finding a partner
Each single had a set of interests , which they also looked for in potential partners .
The research suggested that multiple daters , those who form many relationships , were less effective at finding the right partner than those who remained in one place and let others come to them .
" If you have a complex network and you stay in one site you see more traffic coming through , " he said .
" It 's a denser network , so there are more possible matches . "
Another surprising discovery was that an increased set of preferences made no difference to a single 's chance of ending up in a relationship .
Despite modern people having more complex and varied interests than before , said Mr Ecob , this had no impact on their ability to date .
So long as they were still willing to accept partners who met only a fraction of their criteria , the number of potential matches remained the same .
Prestigious contest
The next stage of the project is to show that it can also be applied to business and political matches as well as it can to personal relationships .
" We think it 'll match up the same , " said Mr Ecob .
" If you 're with a phone company and you know they 're not an ideal match , you 're going to look for someone who is .
It 's a very similar situation . "
Mr Ecob , who was recently awarded a first class Physics degree , undertook the study as part of his Masters research project .
He worked closely with his supervisors , David Smith and Neil Johnson , who are now taking the study further .
They have entered the project in the prestigious Science , Engineering and Technology Student of the Year awards , which will be presented in London 's Guildhall next month .
Despite repeated denials by Number 10 that the war made Britain a target for terrorists , a letter from Michael Jay , the Foreign Office permanent under - secretary , to the cabinet secretary , Sir Andrew Turnbull - obtained by this newspaper - makes the connection clear .
The letter , dated 18 May 2004 , says British foreign policy was a ' recurring theme ' in the Muslim community , 'especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq ' .
' Colleagues have flagged up some of the potential underlying causes of extremism that can affect the Muslim community , such as discrimination , disadvantage and exclusion , ' the letter says .
' But another recurring theme is the issue of British foreign policy , especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq .
' Experience of both ministers and officials ... suggests that ...
British foreign policy and the perception of its negative effect on Muslims globally plays a significant role in creating a feeling of anger and impotence among especially the younger generation of British Muslims . '
The letter continues : ' This seems to be a key driver behind recruitment by extremist organisations ( e.g. recruitment drives by groups such as Hizb - ut - Tahrir and al Muhajiroon ) .
The FCO has a relevant and crucial role to play in the wider context of engagement with British Muslims on policy issues , and more broadly , in convincing young Muslims that they have a legitimate and credible voice , including on foreign policy issues , through an active participation in the democratic process . '
Al Muhajiroon , formed by Omar Bakri Mohammed , the radical preacher who fled Britain after the 7 July bombings , was a recruiting organisation for young Islamic extremists in Britain .
Attached to the letter is a strategy document , also obtained by The Observer , which reveals further concerns .
It says Britain is now viewed as a ' crusader state ' , on a par with America as a potential target .
' Muslim resentment towards the West is worse than ever , ' the document , ' Building Bridges with Mainstream Islam ' , says .
' This was previously focused on the US , but the war in Iraq has meant the UK is now seen in similar terms - both are now seen by many Muslims as " Crusader states " .
' Though we are moving on from a conflict to a reconstruction phase in Iraq , there are no signs of any moderation of this resentment .
Our work on engaging with Islam has therefore been knocked back .
Mr O'Brien [ then a Foreign Office minister ] has expressed his concern . '
However , all mention of the Iraq connection to extremism was removed from ' core scripts ' - briefing papers given to ministers to defend the government 's position on Iraq and terror .
The document begins : ' We do not see the Muslim community as a threat .
Muslims have always made , and continue to make , a valuable contribution to society . '
The lines to be used by ministers include measures designed to address Muslim concerns , such as the introduction of religious hatred legislation and tackling educational underachievement among Muslims .
But there is nothing to address the concerns raised by Jay eight months earlier .
The documents reveal deep divisions at the heart of government over home - grown religious extremism and its connections to British intervention in Iraq .
The Prime Minister has consistently said that the bombers were motivated not by a sense of injustice but by a ' perverted and poisonous misinterpretation of Islam ' .
Although Iraq was clearly used as a pretext by extremists , he said he believed it was ideology that drove them to kill .
To press home the point , Downing Street issued a list of atrocities carried out before intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The claim was later undermined by the MI5 , which said that Iraq was the ' dominant issue ' for Islamic extremists in Britain .
Jack Straw , the Foreign Secretary , also rowed back from his comments immediately after the bombings that there was no connection with Iraq and the terror threat after it became clear that the public remained unconvinced .
But Jay 's letter shows that the Foreign Office was convinced that foreign policy played a key role in radicalising young Muslims .
The letter outlines a list of 11 ' work streams ' to discourage extremism .
They included delegations to the Islamic world , ministerial briefings for key members of the Muslim community and receptions to mark key Muslim festivals .
It is not known how Turnbull responded to the letter , although it is clear that , by January , there was a significant difference between what was being said within the Foreign Office and what ministers were officially being permitted to say in speeches .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten last night called on the government to come clean about the link between extremism among British Muslims and anger about Iraq : ' For the government to deny a link between the war in Iraq and dismay among the Muslim community is ridiculous .
But to try to cover it up , when senior civil servants have recognised the seriousness of the resentment , is even worse . '

The compound appears to stop HIV getting in to cells
Lab tests of the chemical - CSA - 54 - at Vanderbilt University show it disables the virus 's ability to infect cells .
It was shown to attack HIV in a new way - targeting the membrane of the virus to stop it locking on to cells .
UK experts said the research was interesting - but warned a great deal more research was needed before its true value could be known .
We will need to see tests on humans before we can know its true value
Roger Pebody , Terrence Higgins Trust
The family of chemicals from which CSA - 54 come - ceragenins - are synthetically produced small molecule chemical compounds .
They were developed by scientists at Brigham Young University 's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , and are licensed to a company called Ceragenix Pharmaceuticals , which sponsored this research .
The compounds work by being electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged cell membranes of certain viruses , fungi and bacteria , the researchers say .
This mechanism is also seen in antimicrobial chemicals in the body 's immune system .
Hype ' unwanted '
HIV specifically targets a type of immune cell called at CD4 + cell for infection .
The lab tests showed CSA - 54 blocked infection by disrupting HIV 's ability to interact with the cells .
But it was not toxic to skin cells when tested at higher concentrations than those needed to disable the virus .
Dr Derya Unutmaz , Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , who carried out the tests , told the Salt Lake Tribune : " We have some preliminary but very exciting results .
" But we would like to formally show this before making any claims that would cause unwanted hype . "
He added : " This is particularly important as a compound that targets the viral membrane is likely to be effective against all strains of the virus , regardless of mutations as the viral membrane remains unchanged . "
UK experts agreed the study was an interesting development .
Most HIV treatments attack the virus when it has already infected a cell .
Roger Pebody , Terrence Higgins
Trust 's treatment advisor said : " This is a novel approach to stopping the virus infecting other cells .
" However it is very early test tube research and is many years away from clinical trials .
We will need to see tests on humans before we can know its true value . "
Nicola Douglas , of the National Aids Trust said : " Any research which offers hope of a cure for HIV is extremely welcome .
" In the last few years , HIV treatments have come a long way towards giving people longevity and quality of life , but Aids continues to kill more people worldwide than any other infectious disease . "
Brigham Young University and Vanderbilt have jointly filed a patent on the compounds .
As we yawn and open our eyes in the morning , the brain stem sends little puffs of nitric oxide to another part of the brain , the thalamus , which then directs it elsewhere .
Like a computer booting up its operating system before running more complicated programs , the nitric oxide triggers certain functions that set the stage for more complex brain operations , according to a new study .
In these first moments of the day , sensory information floods the system — the bright sunlight coming through the curtains , the time on the screeching alarm clock — and all of it needs to be processed and organized , so the brain can understand its surroundings and begin to perform more complex tasks .
" The thinking part of the brain is applying a sort of stencil to the information coming in and what the nitric oxide is doing is allowing more refinement of that stencil , " says Dwayne Godwin , an associate professor at Wake Forest University and lead author of the study , which was funded by the National Eye Institute .
The little two - atom molecule , it seems , is partly responsible for our ability to perceive whatever it is we 're sensing .
The thalamus sits atop the brain stem .
Image courtesy 3DScience.com
The finding , published last week in the journal Neuroscience , changes the way scientists understand nitric oxide 's role in the brain , and it also has them rethinking the function of the thalamus , where it is released .
The thalamus was thought to be a fairly primitive structure , sort of a gate that could either open and allow sensory information to stream into the cortex , the higher functioning part of the brain , or cut off the flow entirely .
Godwin says the new research shows it 's more accurate to think of the thalamus not as a gate but as a club bouncer , who does n't simply allow a huge rush of people to go in or no one at all , but picks and chooses whom to let in and out .
" Instead of vision being a process going straight from eye to cortex , it 's more of a loop , " Godwin explained .
" This constitutes a new role for the thalamus in directing , not just modulating . "
While this study is the first to identify nitric oxide 's role in the thalamus , elsewhere in the body it was already known to have an important , if somewhat different function .
The molecule is actually integral to controlling blood flow and is , in fact , the molecule Viagra targets in order to increase blood flow to the penis .
The teeny molecule might have other medical uses .
" This study shows a unique role for nitric oxide .
It may help us to someday understand what goes wrong in diseases that affect cognitive processing , such as attention deficit disorder or schizophrenia , and it adds to our fundamental understanding of how we perceive the world around us , " Godwin said .
Three out of four Brits would happily hand over their civil liberties in exchange for better security against terrorist attacks , according figures from pollsters ICM .
It is interesting to note that this is the same general public that rails against any attempts to make them drive more slowly , or with more care .
This is in spite of the fact that in 2004 , 671 pedestrians were killed in traffic accidents , and a further 2,550 people died in other road accidents .
The ICM / Guardian - backed survey found that 73 per cent of Brits overall support a trade - off between liberty and security .
Tory voters are even keener than average to do so , with 79 per cent of respond ants backing the idea .
Labour voters and Lib Dems came in at 72 per cent and 70 per cent in favour , respectively .
Further , 62 per cent of respondents were in favour of deporting foreign radical Islamists , even if that deportation was to a country that used torture .
Only 19 per cent directly opposed this idea .
Similarly only 19 per cent opposed calls for terror suspects to be held for three months without charge , with 62 per cent welcoming the proposal .
Currently , the upper limit is 14 days .
However , the poll also revealed that a sizeable minority was still in favour of having an independent judiciary .
Although 52 per cent of those polled said judges should not be able to rule against government measures , 40 per cent said they agreed that judges should " protect our civil liberty and continue to overturn anti-terrorist measures if they feel it is right to do so " .
A spokesman for Liberty told The Guardian that the results of the poll were a cause for concern , but cautioned against knee jerk legislation .
He added that people would realise that defending our basic values would be a better way to protect our society , rather than passing " counterproductive " and " superficially attractive " security measures . ®
Which participant , Nicholas Crawford or Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem , do you agree with ?
An official from the UN's World Food Programme ( WFP ) , Nicholas Crawford , and Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem , a pan-Africanist and Director of Justice Africa , debate what is causing Africa 's deepening food crisis and what the solutions might be .
We also want to know what you think , so please use the link at the end of the page to join the debate .
Nicholas Crawford , World Food Programme
Let 's start by remembering that Africa is not a single country .
The reasons for the current food crisis - and the need for emergency aid , including food - vary from country to country .
MAPPING THE CRISIS
A country by country guide to the worst affected states
There are also some very positive developments in parts of Africa - experiences that point to solutions for solving the problems of hunger on the continent .
The causes for the present hunger crisis are multifold : countries in conflict or emerging from conflict and trying to rebuild their capacity such as West Africa , Sudan , Somalia , Uganda , Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Or countries beset with chronic environmental challenges combined with population growth like Ethiopia , Niger , Somalia and Kenya .
And countries in southern and eastern Africa ravaged by the HIV / Aids crisis , which in turn is further damaging agricultural and economic productivity ( already under stress from the structural adjustment period beginning in the 1980s ) .
Weak governance is also a thread that runs through many of the countries that have faced food crises over the past decade .
International trade barriers that weaken incentives for agricultural production are another factor .
Solutions
What are the solutions ?
Political will to carry out what we know can halve hunger by 2015 and eliminate hunger altogether , including : investment in Africa 's agriculture and rural sector dismantling of trade barriers and investment in African expertise to take advantage of trade opportunities reducing malnutrition among mothers and children so that the generational cycle of poor nutrition and poverty is broken improving and expanding basic education ; the adoption of governance approaches that ensure accountability to citizens , including the vulnerable among them and empowering the African Union and other regional bodies to take responsibility for peace and security on the continent Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem , Justice Africa
While the regional and national differences and particularities you mentioned are important the root of the problem in all of them remains the same as far as I am concerned : powerlessness .
Drought can and does happen in other places
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem
People are hungry because they are powerless and powerless because they are hungry .
It 's a vicious cycle .
Drought , can and does happen in other places ; wars do happen with equal ferocity in other places .
What turns drought and other natural or unnatural disasters into famine , chronic hunger , mass death , etc is the power relation between the victims and those who control , govern , rule or misrule them .
No African country has ever refused to go to war ( many of them unjust ones ) because the IMF / World Bank , Western NGOs or the so - called donors say there is no money .
Victims
It is only when it comes to feeding our peoples , educating our children , building roads and hospitals , creating jobs and looking after the welfare of our peoples that our governments plead lack of resources .
Until we are able to transform the seemingly infinite capacity of our states for war into one for peace and prosperity for our peoples we shall remain victims .
Also it is evidently clear that there are serious limitations on solving these problems in one country .
We need to be looking at sub-regional and continental solutions in order to arrest the absurdity of having surpluses in one country while another country ( sometimes even from the same region ) will be starving .
It happens even within the same country .
So of all the solutions you put forward , national political will and pan-African leadership is the most crucial without which other solutions will not be sustainable .
Nicholas Crawford , World Food Programme
Thanks for your very interesting take on the root causes of hunger in Africa .
Where we might differ is on what constitutes real solutions in the real world .
All the suggestions you make about relief and development aid going hand - in - hand with wider education ... are music to my ears
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem
I 'm a bit sceptical of any movements that start with the prefix " pan " .
Is empowerment likely to come from " national political will and pan-African leadership " as you suggest and if so , how long should we expect to wait for this to take hold ?
In the meantime , to state the obvious , people in many parts of Africa are hungry and without regular and healthy food they are not likely to build much of a groundswell of demand for accountability from the politicians .
What we have to do is make sure that the delivery of food and other assistance is regular and sufficient
Nicholas Crawford
What can we do to address immediate hunger and at the same time encourage a citizenship that demands their rights ?
My feeling is that relief and development food assistance ( and non -food assistance when this makes more sense to address hunger ) should not be delivered in a knowledge vacuum .
Refugee and IDP camp food assistance , school feeding programmes , general food distributions , food - for - work projects and nutrition projects can all be delivered in ways that expand people 's choices and knowledge .
Grassroots
What we have to do is make sure that the delivery of food and other assistance is regular and sufficient so that we are not constantly starting from scratch each time there is a new crisis .
Or barely helping to keep people 's heads above water as they survive year in and year out through chronic poverty and food insecurity .
Pan -African leadership will remain an abstraction - and some national political leaders will continue to be unresponsive - as long as the kind of people that WFP helps do not gain a voice .
Maybe consistent and sufficient support at grassroots level among hungry people - including with food assistance - is the way to achieve that voice .
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem , Justice Africa Pan-Africanism is no longer a utopian ideal .
It is a precondition for the survival of Africa and Africans .
India , China , both , probably have more people in poverty than all of Africa yet they are not the object of charity and aid the way Africa has become .
Who are the humanitarian agencies themselves accountable to
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem
All the suggestions you make about relief and development aid going hand - in - hand with wider education about rights , civic engagement for accountability , responsive and responsible leadership are music to my ears .
But where is the WFP , UNHCR or the army of humanitarian agencies working across Africa putting these ideas into practice ?
It is true that many African governments are not accountable to their peoples - that is why they can violate their basic right to live and the means of sustaining those lives .
Western wallets
But who are the humanitarian agencies themselves accountable to ?
Do the people they serve have any voice in their operations beyond being objects of their compassion ?
The sad truth is that humanitarian agencies are locked up in a " fire brigade " , compassion - driven negative image of Africa that helps to draw attention to perpetual " crisis " but cannot go beyond the stereotypical imagery of desperately poor Africans needing the help of others .
This template is what unlocks the wallets , treasuries and credit cards of the people and governments of the West .
That is why emergency responses are relatively easier than long term engagement that genuine development cooperation entails .
For fundraising , you are right , there is a certain image presented of Africa that sells in the West .
This raises money
Nicholas Crawford
One cannot help the cynical conclusion that Africa 's misery has become a career and a multi-billion dollar industry with many local , national and international stake holders in its perpetration .
I do not blame anybody but ourselves and especially myopic and irresponsible leaders .
The world does not owe us a living .
We owe this to ourselves .
It is not that we do n't need help but too many of our countries are too weak and vulnerable to be able decide where and how this help can be most useful .
Nicholas Crawford , World Food Programme
I might agree with you that the system of aid and relief , from a distance , seems to be failing and self - perpetuating .
But from the perspective of many of the communities we work in , accepting this conclusion and its logical implications is not so easy .
The involvement of women in our programmes , especially their control of resources , is standard practice and we believe it is politically transformative
Nicholas Crawford
Are the individuals in the relief and development business - those working at the field level , often dedicated , sometimes selfless , often delivering real assets ( like sacks of food ) and in most cases quickly disabused of any preconceived notions they might have had about the alleged powerlessness of poor African people and their communities - unconsciously contributing to the maintenance of a rotten system ?
Or are they and their programmes doing something towards preserving the dignity of people and further empowering them as political and governance forces on the continent evolve ?
For fundraising , you are right , there is a certain image presented of Africa that sells in the West .
This raises money .
But I do n't think Africans see themselves this way and while this ploy empties wallets in the West it does also transfer some of that money to wallets in Africa .
Is that such a bad thing ?
I do n't buy the theories ( which have been thoroughly discredited anyway ) that the system of relief and development food assistance is creating a culture of dependency .
Ideas Could we at WFP , UNHCR and other agencies do much better ?
Of course .
You ask what we are doing to put these ideas about rights and so forth into practice .
I do n't know where you stand on gender and women 's issues in Africa , but I will give you one example .
For WFP , the involvement of women in our programmes , especially their control of resources , is standard practice and we believe it is politically transformative .
Returnee women in up - country , post - conflict Sierra Leone running community agriculture projects funded by WFP and refugee women carrying family ration cards with their names and photos are two examples that spring to mind .
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem , Justice Africa
Your last comment is typical of the moral spasms of the average Westerner about aid and charity which often boils down to : even if one life is saved it is worth it !
Besides denunciations of the aid system , what is it you are you actually calling for ?
What choice are you making ?
Nicholas Crawford
Please forgive me if I am not impressed by saving one life in a continent where millions need not die prematurely if ...
There are difficult moral and political issues without easy solutions .
But the argument of " something is better than nothing " after so many years of food aid and other charity have made many of our governments more irresponsible and created false hopes in our peoples that Messiahs will come from Europe to solve our problems .
It is morally repugnant and should be politically unacceptable that Ethiopia and Eritrea can waste so much resources in useless border wars and then outsource the feeding of their peoples to NGOs , WFP , UNHCR and others .
Liberation ?
How many of those lives saved in 1984 by Geldof in Ethiopia are self - sufficient today ?
Many look back on Live 8 critically If food aid works why was Live 8 necessary in 2005 ?
You make carrying food ration ID cards with pictures sound like a badge of honour and some kind liberation for women .
Is it affirming the dignity and equality of the African woman to have the same right to beg like the famished and impoverished African man in a refugee camp ?
I hope to visit some of these empowerment projects of the WFP in Africa that you talk so glowingly about .
I want to know what is so empowering about them ?
How many of them will still be standing the day WFP pulls the plug on them ?
Aid is addictive .
For as long as there are so many aid pushers fuelling the addiction Africans will never be able to stand up on their feet .
Power
Am I opposed to feeding those who are hungry ?
AFRICA HAVE YOUR SAY
With good governance , most African countries could be net exporters of agricultural produce
Darren , Lobatse , Botswana
Send us your comments
Of course not , but we need to look beyond the hunger and ask why they are hungry and what can be done to end the conditions that generate such absolute poverty that makes millions suffer the indignity of depending on others to feed themselves .
It is about power at local , national and international levels .
Remember the famous quote : " When I feed the poor they call me a saint but when I ask why they are poor , they call me a communist " .
Too many saints around without many communists is turning Africa into a permanent emergency for latter day missionaries to shower in conspicuous charity !
Nicholas , I guess we all have to make our choice whether we become self - chosen saints or communists .
Or both , as and when situations demands it .
Nicholas Crawford , World Food Programme Spasms apart - and let 's be honest , Westerners do n't have a monopoly on spasms when it comes to aid and charity - you are right that we all make our choices .
WFP 's choice is to engage , to be there on the ground , to acknowledge ( hopefully ) our major failures and shortcomings .
And to work in the real world trying to try to get things right and trying to move towards solving hunger in a continent that will continue to be wracked with enormous problems , while you and others do whatever it takes to bring about the pan-Africanism you are dreaming of .
Are we really at cross-purposes ?
Do not patronise people dependent on you by calling them partners .
Even on slave plantations there were partnerships !
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem Besides denunciations of the aid system , what is it you are actually calling for ?
What choice are you making ?
If it 's immediately closing shop on the Bob Geldof 's and the WFPs because there is - decades of aid later - so much food insecurity , come out and say it and acknowledge the costs .
And by the way , please do talk to some of the women who have never had an ID card in their life or been entrusted with family resources : they do n't see themselves as beggars .
Thanks for the passion and the stimulating discussion .
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem , Justice Africa
Let me spell it out clearly : Africa does not need aid or armies of bleeding heart liberals to feed its people , clothe them , educate them , if we have responsive and responsible leadership .
A people without a dream to work towards will suffer nightmares
Tajudeen Abdul - Raheem
Our aims differ : you offer charity while justice is what we seek .
You lament poverty and even believe you want to alleviate it but our focus is on the internal and external dimensions of Africa 's impoverishment .
Aid strengthens superiority / inferiority complexes in a relationship mediated by slavery , colonialism and now recolonisation .
Aid agencies have become both willing and unwilling bodyguards of the new imperialism .
The fact that there are many Africans working in them does not change their character .
The colonial bureaucracies were full of Africans !
Do not patronise people dependent on you by calling them partners .
Even on slave plantations there were partnerships !
China is a threat to the West today and India is treated with respect because God cannot make 1.3 and 1.1bn ( respectively ) people stupid .
Destiny A united Africa is essential for us to seize control of our destiny .
A people without a dream to work towards will suffer nightmares .
Has Africa not had enough nightmares ?
You are so consumed by wanting to save us that you cannot see how we can and are saving ourselves .
I end on a specially adapted prayer :
God save me from my liberal friends because the conservative opponent I can deal with , without any pretences on both sides .
All the best .

· Liver shortage means help should be more targeted · Support needed to stop relapses into drinking
The surgeon who performed George Best 's liver transplant says urgent measures are needed to identify patients who are likely to abuse alcohol after their operations , so they can be kicked off hospital waiting lists .
Nigel Heaton , who heads the liver unit at King 's College hospital in London and carried out the former Manchester United footballer 's operation in 2002 , said the shortage of liver donors has increased pressure on surgeons to pick patients who are likely to benefit most from transplant operations .
" Livers are in short supply and the waiting list has grown over the past two to three years .
If you knew someone was going to be recidivist you would n't take them on for a transplant .
The problem is there 's just no way of spotting who those people are , " said Prof Heaton .
Best , who yesterday remained in intensive care at the Cromwell hospital in London after suffering a kidney infection , satisfied surgeons that he was suitable for a liver transplant in 2002 after suffering alcohol - induced cirrhosis .
But since his operation , he has resumed drinking against the advice of his doctor .
" We need to develop means of assessing patients to identify those who are inevitably going to go back to alcohol so we can exclude them , " said Prof Heaton .
" We also need to devise more stringent strategies to prevent them going back to alcohol once the transplant has been performed . "
Liver transplants are a last resort for many alcoholics who have developed alcohol - related diseases such as cirrhosis .
Shortly after his transplant operation , Best was fitted with an implant designed to make it painful to drink alcohol .
The implant , which is typically placed under the fat around the stomach , releases a drug into the blood stream that prevents the body breaking down alcohol properly .
Drinking with the implant in place leads to a rise in toxins in the blood known as aldehydes that can lead to violent convulsions , palpitations and changes in blood pressure .
" The problem with the implants is that they only last up to six months , so unless the patient has a replacement , the effect wears off eventually , " said Kris Zakrzewski , a private consultant at Kent and Sussex clinical services who has fitted the implants in hundreds of patients .
" There 's also the danger that patients fail to get psychological support for their addiction and rely too much on the implant to stop them drinking .
They need support too . "
All patients who have organ transplants have a high chance of getting infections because they need to take immunosuppressant drugs that dampen their whole immune system to stop their bodies rejecting the new organ .
But the danger faced by alcoholics who have received new livers is that alcohol suppresses the immune system even further , making them even more susceptible to infections .
" As a rule , they will face more infections and if they keep on drinking they will die of liver disease because transplants have a lower threshold to damage , " said Prof Heaton .
The toll on our livers
· Between 1996 and 2000 , alcohol - related liver disease necessitated almost 500 liver transplants at an estimated cost of £ 23.5 m .
· Nearly half of all liver disease cases , including that of George Best ( above ) , are alcohol related .
Excess alcohol causes cirrhosis of the liver , where scar tissue replaces healthy tissue .
· With binge drinking on the rise , doctors are warning about younger deaths from cirrhosis .
· The first liver transplant was carried out by Thomas Starzl in 1963 .
The 10,000th operation took place in 2004 .
· The UK performs between 600 and 700 liver transplants a year .

Whiskey 101
Learning To Appreciate the Wonders of Whiskey ( A.K.A .
Whisky )
CAPSULE REPORT : A true gastronome can be described as one fascinated by the roles food and drink play in culture .
While many foodies have familiarized themselves with the world of wine , the same cannot necessarily be said for the other “ W , ” whiskey .
Whiskey is an incredibly nuanced drink , full of flavors that are both subtle and complex at the same time .
Learning to taste it properly can open up a whole new world of enjoyment .
Here , we offer a “ crash course ” on the drink : what it is , where it came from , an explanation of the different types , a guide to tasting it and tips for throwing a whiskey - tasting party .
This is Page 1 of a seven - page article .
Click on the black links below to view the other pages .
Whiskey Overview
For the newcomer , beginning an exploration of whiskey can be daunting .
There is such a wealth of information on the subject , and yet , sadly , the knowledge most folks — even many foodies — have is limited to the “ highball ” and the “ whiskey sour . ”
Perhaps it comes down to reputation : given its potency , whiskey carries the stigma of being a hardcore drinker ’s drink .
While most everyone is vaguely familiar with the names Jameson and Jim Beam , many have no idea what constitutes a true whiskey , or how to distinguish one type from another .
They know little about its origins ( still a heated topic of debate , especially among the Scottish and Irish ) , the process by which it is made , the importance of region in regards to classification , or the character notes that distinguish one variety from the next .
For the most part , people have tended to relate to Eric Asimov ’s statement that whiskey always “ seemed merely a means to an intoxicating end . ”
While there may be some truth to some of the generalizations , the majority of these assumptions are false .
Having withstood the test of time and attracted a loyal following in the process , whiskey deserves to be thought of as more than just a nice mixer .
Jim Beam is a Bourbon , one of two American - born whiskeys .
The other is Tennessee whiskey ( such as Jack Daniel ’s ) , which is almost identical to Bourbon except that Tennessee whiskey is filtered through sugar maple charcoal , which provides a unique flavor and aroma .
Much to the delight of whiskey lovers , the tide finally seems to be turning .
Whiskey has become quite fashionable , with tastings popping up faster than brands of artisanal chocolate .
As with fine wines , more people are coming to see the creativity and innovation involved in detecting the distinct flavors and aromas in whiskey varietals .
Definition
Whiskey is a spirit made from a fermented mash of seed - fruit grains such as barley , rye or corn .
In more elaborate terms , it is an alcoholic distillate with a multitude of variations , distinguished by the types of grain used in the fermentation process as well as the distinct distillation and aging processes .
Regardless of the variety or country of origin , a general rule of thumb is that all straight whiskeys must be aged at least two years in wooden vessels , which are most often constructed of oak .
Having said this , it is important to note that each nation has its own rules and regulations about what constitutes a true whiskey .

THE SUPREME COURT regularly has to choose between issuing narrow rulings and issuing broader ones .
Suppose , for instance , that an alleged enemy combatant , who is also an American citizen , argues that he has a right to a hearing before he can be held as a prisoner by the United States .
A minimalist court would be inclined to rule on the combatant ’s particular claim without saying a word about the president ’s general power to wage war on terror , and it would remain silent about the rights of foreigners .
Or suppose that an elderly cancer patient is challenging a state ban on physician - assisted suicide .
A minimalist court would focus on the specific facts of the case and the law in question and refuse to say anything about whether the Constitution provides a more general right to privacy that might encompass a right to commit suicide .
Or imagine that a rejected white applicant is challenging an affirmative - action program at a particular medical school .
A minimalist court might strike down the specific program for some narrow , perceived flaw in its structure without saying whether affirmative action is generally permissible .

Last week , when Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. delivered his first commencement address , at Georgetown University Law Center , he offered an original , substantive and unambiguous defense of narrow , minimalist rulings .
Roberts began by arguing in favor of unanimous or near - unanimous opinions , which , he said , serve the rule of law by ensuring that the court ’s message is not confused by its own internal divisions .
He went on to suggest that such a consensus on the part of the justices would , almost by necessity , lead to narrow rulings , limited in most situations to the particular issue at hand .
“ The broader the agreement among the justices , the more likely it is that the decision is on the narrowest possible ground , ” he said .
After all , the nine justices have highly diverse views , and if they are able to join a single opinion , that opinion is likely to be narrow .
This , in the chief justice ’s view , is entirely desirable .
“ If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case , in my view it is necessary not to decide more , ” he said .

Roberts made several approving references to Justice Felix Frankfurter , one of American history ’s great minimalist judges who consistently called for narrow rulings , especially on the issues that divide the nation most sharply .
Writing more than 50 years ago , Frankfurter said that the court has an obligation “ to avoid putting fetters upon the future by needless pronouncements today . ”
It was advice Frankfurter followed himself .
In his opinion voting to strike down President Truman ’s 1952 seizure of the nation ’s steel mills , Frankfurter refused to say much about presidential power in general .
He emphasized that “ rigorous adherence to the narrow scope of the judicial function ” is especially important when national security is at risk , notwithstanding the national “ eagerness to settle -- preferably forever -- a specific problem on the basis of the broadest possible constitutional pronouncement . ”
Roberts referred , with unmistakable enthusiasm , to Frankfurter ’s suggestion that courts should focus on the concrete issue and “ not embarrass the future too much . ”
What makes Roberts ’ argument noteworthy is that it takes a side in one of the deepest and most long - standing divisions in American jurisprudence -- a division that cuts across the standard ideological lines .
Advertisement
One strand of that jurisprudence , associated with justices Antonin Scalia and Hugo Black , prizes broad , ambitious rulings on the ground that they give the clearest signals to lower courts , potential litigants and the nation as a whole .
Scalia has long attacked minimalism on the ground that a court that resolves “ one case at a time ” leaves far too much doubt .
If the court focuses on particular facts , people wo n’t know , for example , when affirmative - action programs are permissible , when government can interfere with private choices and what , exactly , the president may or may not do to protect the nation .
The competing strand , associated with Frankfurter and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor , prizes narrow rulings .
O’Connor emphasized the need for humility , which would require the justices to acknowledge what they do not know and to leave many questions undecided .
In a period in which the court must answer many novel questions , there is a lot to be said for minimalism -- not least because it tries to avoid taking a stand on the most controversial questions and thus shows respect for people with reasonable competing views .
Indeed , narrow rulings help to promote a key goal of societies that are both diverse and free : to make agreement possible where agreement is necessary , while also making agreement unnecessary where agreement is not possible .
Advertisement
It remains to be seen whether the court as a whole might be willing and able to move in the direction of broader consensus and hence narrowness -- something Roberts can encourage in his role as chief justice .
If the court does move in that direction , its movement would have major consequences not only for privacy , free speech and the war on terror but for nearly every question that now divides both the court and the country .

Breaking News : GNU / Hurd 1.0 Released !
Fake News written by James Baughn on
from the miracles - do - happen dept .
HURDLAND , MISSOURI --
In what some are calling the most shocking development since the invention of fire , Richard M. Stallman today unveiled the first official release of the GNU Project 's operating system kernel , GNU / Hurd 1.0.0 .
How was GNU able to produce the new operating system so quickly ?
Simple .
They used GNU Emacs as the base .
" We were going to develop our own microkernal - based system from scratch , " RMS explained .
" Based on development trends , however , we calculated that such a project would n't be completed until 2014 , or roughly two years after the projected release date of Windows Vista .
So we decided to switch gears and do something we should have done a long time ago : build our operating system on top of Emacs . "
Emacs provided everything that the GNU operating system needed : a text editor , Lisp programming language , and even a kitchen sink .
" It was such an elegant solution .
We added a few hundred lines of code to Emacs over the weekend and suddenly we had a full - fledged OS kernel , " RMS boasted .
With the GNU / Emacs / Hurd kernel finished , RMS hopes to quickly combine all of the various GNU projects into one OS distribution called -- well , we 're not sure what it 's going to be called , except that RMS promises the name will feature " multilevel acronyms with so many levels of recursion and self - referentialism that nobody will be able to comprehend it . "
The Hurd announcement has caught the entire Internet by surprise .
The so - called editors at Slashdot were so overwhelmed by the story that they posted ten duplicates , a new record .
Meanwhile , the Usenet group alt.gnu.hurd.vapor.vapor.vapor was hit with several thousand posts within the first hour , causing both of the Internet 's remaining Usenet servers to crash hard .
" I never thought I 'd live to see the day , " exclaimed a veteran Unix hacker .
" The Hurd in my lifetime !
RMS has pulled off the impossible ! "
Not everybody is ecstatic about the news .
" Dammit , I just lost a thousand dollars ! " lamented one poor schmuck who placed a bet with a friend that Windows Vista would be released before Hurd .
" First Apple switches to Intel chips , and now this .
I can't win ! "
Inflation is caused by printing more money .
The government 's monetary policies are responsible for this .
Keynesian spending policies and ideology and the abolishment of the gold standard have permitted the government to depreciate our currency .
The answer is to eradicate state control of the money supply .
We need to divest government of its power to arbitrarily increase or decrease the money supply .
In addition , we must build in pressures toward fiscal responsibility by the government with respect to the production of balanced budgets and reduction of debt .
The federal government must learn to live within its means  government deficits must be prevented .
The establishment of the gold standard will stifle the hidden and deceptive tax of inflation .
Inflation could be controlled if government were not able to monetize debt or manipulate reserve requirements .
Defining inflation
Money is a commodity the value of which stems from its usefulness as a medium of exchange .
The best money is the one developed through the market system .
Since barter has obvious limitations , one commodity ( e.g. , gold ) arises as easier to trade and more useful as a medium of exchange .
Exchange rates ( i.e. , prices ) are established between this one commodity and each of the other goods .
Historically and pragmatically , a commodity 's ability to function as money has been transferred to money substitutes ( e.g. , the dollar ) .
Honest money is fully backed by commodities like gold .
Inflation , a monetary phenomenon , is an increase in money and credit .
Its major consequence is rising prices .
Inflation occurs when the economy 's aggregate volume of money expenditures grows at a faster rate than its total real output grows .
Inflation is thus an increase in the supply of money without a corresponding increase in the supply of goods and services .
Inflation consists of expanding a nation 's money supply by adding something other than real money ( e.g. , gold ) .
Such fiat money , backed only by government decree , produces inflation .
If the quantity of money is increased , the purchasing power of the monetary unit declines and the quantity of goods and services that can be purchased for one unit of this money also decreases .
When government expands the quantity of paper money , the purchasing power of the monetary unit drops and prices rise .
After the new money has been added to the economy , the total wealth produced is not any greater than it was previously .
With added money now being spent , but with no additional goods and services to spend it on , prices will rise .
In the U.S. , it is only the federal government and government recognized banks that can print money and / or create new dollar credit .
Why does the government inflate ?
Inflation is a dishonest and deliberate policy and tool of politicians who do not wish to reduce their spending .
The government « creates » new money in order to cover what it spends in excess of its income .
The existence of an unbalanced budget is a frequent reason for the government to print more money .
When more is spent than is raised by taxes , the government makes up the difference with fiat money .
The basic cause of inflation is the government 's unwillingness to cut its spending plans or to raise the funds it desires by increasing taxation or by borrowing from the public .
Politicians want to spend but they do not want to raise taxes .
Because higher taxes are unpopular , inflation commonly becomes the answer to deficit financing .
When the government prints more money , people do n't have to pay additional taxes , but ultimately they realize that dollars are not worth what they were previously .
Monetary debasement is a scheme in which government force is used to take wealth from people and spend it .
When the government makes new money and spends it , the effect on prices and the supply of goods and services is no different than when a private counterfeiter does so .
Exorbitant government expenditures are often the result of government efforts to redistribute income and wealth .
Inflation can be connected to the appearance of the welfare state .
Political leaders , confident in their own abilities , rationality , ability to control nature and society , and to produce continual progress , use government force to redistribute wealth in their compassionate efforts to achieve economic equality .
Additional dollars , created through the printing press and credit expansion , enable the government to spend more and support more « deserving » non-producers than it could otherwise .
Inflation transfers wealth from creditors to debtors of which the federal government is the largest .
Debtors make payment with currency that is worth less than when the debt was assumed .
Inflation repudiates government debt at the same time that it depreciates the purchasing power of the debt .
How the government inflates
The government has several ways of increasing the money supply .
Expansion of the money stock is carried out by monetizing federal debt , by Federal Reserve « ope n market operati ons , » and by credit expansion through commercial bank loans to private borrowers .
In America , the Federal Reserve System currently has control of the issuance of unbacked currency .
The government 's demonetization of gold established government - sanctioned paper as the exclusive medium of exchange .
The government blocked holders of paper money from protecting themselves from the ravages of inflation when it denied American citizens the freedom to select gold in preference to inflatable fractional reserve money .
Essentially , all the government has to do when it wants to spend more money than has been collected in taxes is to borrow non-existent money from the Federal Reserve through the issuance of government securities .
This new money is spent and deposited in banks thereby becoming the fractional reserve for even more unbacked money .
New money creation builds on itself and snowballs .
The only limits to the money supply are arbitrary reserve requirements on banks ( i.e. , the reserves in cash that a commercial bank holds against deposits ) and debt limits established by Congress .
The Treasury seldom sells government bonds directly to the Federal Reserve .
Rather , the Federal Reserve purchases bonds on the open market thus giving the Treasury room to sell its bonds on the market .
The result is the same even though the mechanics make the process a bit less obvious .
When the Federal Reserve buys government securities on the open market it expands the supply of money and credit .
Using a cashier 's check , the Fed pays for the securities with its private holdings .
The seller , in turn , deposits the check in a commercial bank .
This increases the bank 's reserve balance of cash thus enabling it to lend out several times the amount of the deposit .
Production of fractional reserve money merely requires a journal entry crediting a borrower with a sum of money and issuing a deposit receipt in this amount .
Commercial banks thus can increase the quantity of money by lending several times as much as the amounts deposited by their customers in their accounts .
The use of fractional reserves clearly demonstrates the fraudulent nature of lending claims to mythical property .
« Inflation is a dishonest and deliberate policy and tool of politicians who do not wish to reduce their spending .
The government " creates " new money in order to cover what it spends in excess of its inc ome . »
Money should be backed by a 100 percent reserve of what is used to back it .
If the government were unable to monetize its debt or manipulate reserve requirements , then obstacles to inflation would be in place .
Under a 100 percent gold reserve standard or system , there would be little or no inflation since prices would depend on the existing supply of gold .
With the inability to expand the volume of money and credit at will , the political evil of inflation would no longer be able to be perpetrated by agents of the U.S. Treasury and officials of the Federal Reserve System .
Losers and winners
Inflation is a type of tax that falls on each citizen in the form of higher prices for what he purchases .
It is analogous to a sales tax on all goods and services .
Inflation levies a tax on all who have money or have money owed to them .
Like taxes , inflation distorts prices , changes production patterns , transfers wealth from savers to spenders , discourages saving and investment , and stifles individual initiative .
A particularly evil form of taxation , inflation does not affect people in proportion to their income or wealth .
Its incidence depends on the business or industry in which one works , the elasticity of demand for different commodities , the specific forms in which a person holds his assets and debts , etc .
There is no way for the government to create new dollars or bank credit so that each person will benefit equally and simultaneously .
Inflation starts with government expansion of the money supply that immediately creates benefits for some persons while producing losses for others .
Commonly , individuals on fixed incomes and owners of bonds , loans , and savings accounts suffer losses while borrowers and property owners enjoy gains .
Some individuals have the advantage of receiving the newly created currency and bank credit sooner than others .
Such persons are able to buy more than they could previously or to offer higher prices for goods and services they desire .
People who receive the new money and credit first receive a temporary benefit at the expense of others who receive the new money or credit later .
Those receiving the new money or credit first have greater income and thus can purchase many goods and services at prices that existed at the beginning of the inflation .
The first groups spend their money when prices have gone up least ( or not at all ) and the last groups consume and pay when prices have increased the most .
When the first recipients of the new dollar offer higher prices , prices tend to be raised by the suppliers of the goods and services for which higher prices had been offered .
Shifts in income and wealth are generated by the increased number of dollars .
Those who receive unexpectedly high prices for their commodities benefit from the inflation .
They experience « windfall » profits at the expense of holders of monetary assets ( i.e. , dollars and assets fixed in number of dollars ) .
The influx of new fiat money permits people who gain access to it early to buy at yesterday 's prices .
However , there are others to whom the new money arrives much later .
They are forced to pay higher prices than they did previously for some or nearly all of the goods and services they desire to buy .
The last recipients of the new money pay higher prices while their incomes remain constant or do not go up proportionately with prices .
Inflation tends to initially create more employment .
It is likely to at first increase sales and selling prices at a faster rate than it increases expenses .
Nevertheless , this effect is fleeting and occurs only when and if inflation is unanticipated .
When individuals begin to expect inflation , they will make compensating adjustments and demands thus causing costs to catch up with selling prices .
Wages , interest , and raw materials prices increase as fast ( if not faster ) than a product 's retail price , profit margins narrow , and the businessman realizes that his profits have been illusory .
At each stage of the sequence of transactions by which the new money works its way through the economy , the advantage of receiving additional dollars declines .
Those who receive it much later must adapt to a situation in which the items they want are increasingly more expensive .
Inflation produces false market signals
Inflation falsifies economic calculations and accounting profits and leads businessmen to make errors .
Inflation misdirects production so that scarce resources are dedicated to inappropriate projects .
Illusory profits deceive producers , invite malproduction and malinvestments and make planning a nightmare .
The initial aura of prosperity dissipates as prices go up , wages lag , and business decisions brought about by false market signals produce bad results .
Inflation dampens producers ' incentives to save and invest in production facilities .
As a result , less is produced .
Furthermore , since there has been less production , there is less to consume , save , and invest .
What 's more , with less saved and invested currently , there will be less produced in the future for individuals to consume , save , and invest .
The increasing uncertainty of profits discourages new investment to a greater degree than what the overall increase in profits due to inflation does to encourage investments .
Investment , employment , and production are misdirected by inflation , and ultimately they are all discouraged by it .
When the government expands the money supply to finance its debts or to create economic prosperity , the result is higher prices .
People have more dollars but the dollar loses its purchasing power .
Inflation reduces the value of the currency and the amount of that reduction is used by the government to pay its debts .
When monetary authorities inflate and depreciate money , people are forced to accept it at face value and in full payment .
The federal government , as a huge debtor , benefits greatly from monetary depreciation .
When monetary value declines , lenders suffer losses in purchasing power while borrowers ( like the government ) gain a like amount .
Creditors are defrauded when debtors discharge their debts by exchanging inferior money .
When progressive tax rates are unadjusted for inflation , the increase in the nominal value of wages places individuals in progressively higher tax brackets thus permitting the government to collect a larger proportion of income and assets .
By denying inflation adjustments , the state can also exact more taxes from businesses .
Higher taxes are paid when depreciation and other production costs are understated and profits are overstated .
Oftentimes , when the government wants to stimulate the economy , it gets the Federal Reserve System to reduce interest rates .
To do this , it must create more spendable money .
Interest rates are decreased by increasing the supply of loanable funds .
This can be done by getting the central bank to purchase government securities or by directly monetizing debt ( i.e. , by simply printing more money ) .
When monetary authorities expand the quantity of money and credit , they cause interest rates to initially fall .
Businesses are lured into expanding by the lower interest rates .
As a result land , labor , and capital are bid up .
After a while , lenders will catch on and want a real return .
After the new money has flowed through the economy , rates will return to normal and mistakes will be evident .
Inflation deters saving and investment and promotes a search for alternatives to saving during the inflation .
Why work hard , save , and invest if the purchasing power of dollars saved is expected to fall ?
People attempt to identify and acquire a real store of value in the form of non-monetary or hard assets such as precious metals , diamonds , real estate , machinery and equipment , and rare items such as stamps , antique furniture , art works , books , coins , firearms , etc .
People will save and invest little , if any , unless they are confident that their property will be safe and that their savings and money will retain its purchasing power .
Not recognizing the government 's own responsibility for inflation , politicians assign the blame to the private sector and advocate the use of price controls to fight inflation .
They fail to understand that price controls cannot stop or even slow down inflation .
All these controls can do is reduce profit margins , discourage production , and create shortages .
Furthermore , and most importantly , they do not understand that price controls represent the antithesis of economic freedom .
Real monetary reform
Traditionally , the gold standard has been used to tie the value of money to something more constant and stable than the capricious desires of government officials .
Such an impersonal protection is needed to restrain the actions of those who hold a legal monopoly on the creation of money .
Under the gold standard , the quantity of the money supply is independent of the policies of government bureaucrats and politicians .
Gold represents value uncontrolled by government .
The gold standard takes decisions regarding the quantity of money out of the hands of politicians .
Making paper money redeemable in gold keeps the government from arbitrarily increasing the money supply .
Not only does full redeemability of the currency unit restrict government power , it also supports public confidence in money , allows market forces to work , and protects citizens from disguised taxation through monetary inflation .
The gold standard provides a market - based medium of exchange and stable monetary system through which men can exchange and save the results of their labor .
This monetary stability will force the government to abstain from monetary depreciation .
Not only would the government have to stop inflating , it would also be forced to balance its budget and eliminate many welfare programs .
Under a gold standard , politicians cannot spend more unless they raise taxes .
Under the gold standard , all claims to gold ( i.e. , dollars ) are receipts for gold and are fully convertible into a specific amount of gold .
Money and credit expansion is brought to a sudden halt when government and banks have to redeem their notes in gold .
Redemptions would be a chief obstacle to government 's unlimited money creation and spending .
Under the gold standard , banks and individuals would be able to make loans , but they would be limited to the amounts savers had accumulated and were making available for lending purposes .
The gold standard 's requirement of fully convertible money would keep more than one claim to the same money from occurring .
Because of its natural attributes and relative scarcity , gold has long served as a dependable medium of exchange .
The quantity of gold changes very slowly over time .
Consequently , currencies fully backed by gold are susceptible to only a negligible rate of inflation .
There has been a gradual increase in the store of gold with the annual increase in the world stock usually amounting to between 1.5 and 3 percent .
Over time , the total gold stockpile held by central banks and individuals has always increased and has never decreased .
If gold was money , there would be a negligible price level increase when more gold is mined , refined , and processed and an even slighter decrease as some gold is removed from the monetary realm to be used in industry , dentistry , jewelry , etc .
Some are concerned that new annual supplies of gold will be insufficient to carry on the growing amounts and value of world trade .
Gold , a hard currency , may have a new production rate that may not keep pace with economic growth .
This really presents no problem .
The existing quantity of money is always enough to conduct the existing volume of trade .
Some deflation may be inevitable , but this simply means that overall prices will be lower .
Articles précédents d'Edward W. Younkins
Only the desire to recover some imaginary good from the tragedy that was empire can explain the elevation of the neoconservative ideologue Niall Ferguson to chief imperial historian on the BBC and now Channel 4 .
His aggressive rewriting of history , driven by the messianic fantasies of the American right , is being presented as a new revelation .
In fact , Ferguson 's " history " is a fairytale for our times which puts the white man and his burden back at the centre of heroic action .
Colonialism - a tale of slavery , plunder , war , corruption , land - grabbing , famines , exploitation , indentured labour , impoverishment , massacres , genocide and forced resettlement - is rewritten into a benign developmental mission marred by a few unfortunate accidents and excesses .
Soundbite culture thrives on these simplistic grand narratives .
Half - truths and fanciful speculation , shorn of academic protocols such as footnotes , can sound donnishly authoritative .
The racism institutionalised by empire also seems to be back in fashion .
The book accompanying Ferguson 's current Channel 4 series on 20th - century history , The War of the World , tells us that people " seem predisposed " to " trust members of their own race " , " those who are drawn to ' the Other ' may ... be atypical in their sexual predilections " and that " when a Chinese woman marries a European man , the chances are relatively high ... that only the first child they conceive will be viable . "
Not far from the pseudo - scientific nonsense that once made it possible to punish interracial relationships .
Behind such talk and the embrace of the broadcasters is the insistence that we are being offered gutsy truths that the " politically correct " establishment would love to suppress .
This is the neo-conservative as spunky rebel against liberal tyranny .
Yet Ferguson peddles nothing more than the most hackneyed , self - aggrandising myths of empire , canards once championed by old imperialists such as Macaulay and Mill and rehashed now by the Bush administration : western imperialism brings freedom , democracy and prosperity to primitive cultures .
The myth decorates US and British foreign policy spin while trendier versions have also emerged in platforms such as the Euston Manifesto .
By anointing Ferguson and his fellow imperial apologists such as Andrew Roberts as semi-official historians , the British media are colluding in a dangerous denial of the past and lending support to contemporary US imperial propaganda .
The evidence - researched by scholars such as Amartya Sen , Nicholas Dirks , Mike Davis and Mahmood Mamdani , Caroline Elkins and Walter Rodney - shows that European colonialism brought with it not good governance and freedom , but impoverishment , bloodshed , repression and misery .
Joseph Conrad , no radical , described it as " a flabby , pretending , weak - eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly " .
Good governance ?
More famines were recorded in the first century of the British Raj than in the previous 2,000 years , including 17 - 20 million deaths from 1896 to 1900 alone .
While a million Indians a year died from avoidable famines , taxation subsidising colonial wars , and relief often deliberately denied as surplus grain was shipped to England .
Tolerance ?
The British empire reinforced strict ethnic / religious identities and governed through these divisions .
As with the partition of India when 10 million were displaced , arbitrarily drawn boundaries between " tribes " in Africa resulted in massive displacement and bloodshed .
Freedom and fair play ?
In Kenya , a handful of white settlers appropriated 12,000 square miles and pushed 1.25 million native Kikuyus to 2,000 restricted square miles .
Resistance was brutally crushed through internment in detention camps , torture and massacres .
Some 50,000 Kikuyus were massacred and 300,000 interned to put down the Mau Mau rebellion by peasants who wanted to farm their own land .
A thousand peaceful protesters were killed in the Amritsar massacre of 1919 .
A collective failure of the imagination now makes it difficult for us to think about the globe before European and American domination .
Greed and violence are hardly exclusive to one culture .
But colonialism destroyed or strangled possibilities and potential for progress , such as Mughal Emperor Akbar 's " sul - e- kul " or " universal good " which underpinned his governance .
The scale of European imperialism inaugurated a new chapter in the history of greed which still shapes all our lives .
Natural resources - cotton , sugar , teak , rubber , minerals - were plundered in gigantic quantities .
The Indian textile industry was the most advanced in the world when the British arrived ; within half a century it had been destroyed .
The enslaved and indentured ( at least 20 million Africans and 1.5 million Indians ) were shipped across the globe to work on plantations , mines and railroads .
The stupendous profits deriving from this enabled today 's developed world to prosper .
The point is n't for Europeans to feel guilt , but a serious consideration of historical responsibility is n't the same thing as a blame game .
Forgetting history is tempting but undermines a society 's capacity for change .
Among the many facile assumptions encouraged by these imperial apologists is that those who criticise colonialism are absolving tyrants and bigots in Asia and Africa from responsibility for their crimes .
Of course it is possible and absolutely necessary to condemn both .
Indians must acknowledge their culpability for atrocities during the partition , for example .
But that in no way exonerates the British Raj from its pivotal role in the tragedy that led to over a million deaths .
A wilful ignorance of other people 's cultures and histories encourages the notion that freedom , democracy and tolerance are intrinsically western .
As Amartya Sen has argued , the subcontinent has long been home to traditions of free - thinking and debate .
Participatory governance was not Britain 's gift ( recall Gandhi's indigenous village republics ) , even if parliamentary democracy as an institutional form was adopted in some ex-colonies .
Free trade is another mythical western contribution to world history .
Amitav Ghosh has reconstructed the forgotten history of a vibrant trade culture between medieval India and Africa .
When the Portuguese arrived , they demanded that the Hindu ruler of Calicut expel Muslims , " enemies of the Holy - Faith " , from his kingdom .
He refused and was subjected to two days of bombardment .
Indeed , one legacy of European colonialism that we all reckon with is the self - fulfilling prophecy of the " clash of civilisations " .
The claim that east and west are bound to come into conflict is merely an extension of imperial practice which found it useful to seal off porous cultures into fixed categories .
This tragic " lie of the colonial situation " , as Frantz Fanon called it , rebounds on us tragically in the terror unleashed in the name of Islam and Bush 's " war on terror " .
If we are to undo the destructive legacies of empire , it wo n't do to invest celebratory falsifications with credibility .
To make sense of a shared present and look towards a more humane future , we need to start with a little informed honesty about the past .

An interview on his life and career
This guy * who gave a presentation with Patrick Cauldwell yesterday revealed his desktop during the presentation .
Here 's what it looked like :
After the presentation , I ribbed him about his desktop .
You have a few square millimeters of desktop left uncovered , I said .
Clearly you have your work cut out for you .
He said he considers the desktop dead space if it does n't have something on it .
I think his exact words were " make the desktop work for you " .
That 's a unique perspective .
It 's more of a portal philosophy .
Fill the desktop to the brim with tons of stuff that 's relevant to you , so it 's always at your fingertips .
This made me stop and think a bit .
The desktop is usually dead space , that 's true .
And dead speace is never useful .
But it 's not a destination , either .
My goal is to never see the desktop .
I should always have the task I 'm working on front and center , not the desktop .
If I need something , I do n't want to be forced to press Windows - D to context switch and reveal some links or files sitting on my desktop .
That interrupts my task and my flow .
I 'd rather perform some kind of popup ad - hoc search -- or better yet , use a hotkey -- to get directly to what I want .
The last thing I want is for my desktop to look like the Yahoo home page .
That said , I realize there 's no right answer .
Some people strive for blank , zen - like desktops , and some people fill their desktop with as many icons , gadgets , and gewgaws as they can possibly jam in there .
It 's a religious debate , and people get cranky when someone puts peanut butter in their chocolate .
But I still maintain that it 's unhealthy to turn the desktop into an artificial destination .
It 's like the Las Vegas strip ; no matter how many zany attractions they add , eventually visitors have to come to terms with the fact that they 've arbitrarily chosen to build those attractions in the middle of a vast , inhospitable desert .

Net of all accounting gimmicks , the actual federal budget deficit is running at an unsustainable , system - dooming pace of $ 3.5 trillion per year , roughly 11 times the size of the $ 318.5 billion accounting - gimmicked official deficit for 2005 .

The
Including Social Security , Medicare and similar liabilities , the total GAAP - based 2005 deficit was $ 3.5 trillion , down from 2004 's $ 11.1 trillion , which was spiked by a one - time setup charge for recent Medicare enhancements .
Net of the one - time charge , which we have re-estimated based on the 2005 data ( the government has not published an estimate ) , the GAAP - based deficit in 2004 was about $ 3.4 trillion .

From Clarity to Obfuscation in One Year
Administration comments in last year 's financial statements were refreshingly honest about the severity of the United States ' fiscal travails .
Such was not the case in the more heavily politicized 2005 statements .
From the second page of " Management 's Discussion and Analysis " ( page 4 ) of the 2004 statements [ 2 ] :
" In a table on page 11 of this section , the net present value for all of the responsibilities ( for [ Social Security / Medicare ] current participants over a 75 - year period ) is $ 45,892 billion , including Medicare and Social Security payments , pensions and benefits for Federal employees and veterans , and other financial responsibilities .
The reader needs to understand these responsibilities to get a more complete understanding of the government 's finances [ our emphasis ] . "
The referenced table showed a net annual deterioration in the government 's 2004 financial position of $ 11.1 trillion , consistent with the data shown above .
The 2005 statements , however , contained no such advice to the reader nor a table .
The emphasis of 2005 Management 's Discussion and Analysis was an analysis as to why the GAAP deficit really shrank instead of widened .
Accounting double - talk was used citing an actuarial assumption change that increased the Department of Veterans Affairs liabilities , while all other considerations ranging from Katrina to the War on Terror were lumped into a negligible " net " other cost increases category that combined largely offsetting accruals .
With no text or table showing the big picture , as there had been in 2004 , the only indication as to what the numbers were that reflected consistent levels and changes in the net present value of Social Security , Medicare , etc. was the following comment under Other Responsibilities , page 12 of the 2005 statements :
" The 2005 balance sheet shows liabilities of $ 9,915 billion .
In addition , the government 's responsibilities to make future payments for social insurance and certain other programs are not shown as liabilities according to Federal accounting standards ; however , they are measured in other contexts .
These programmatic commitments remain Federal responsibilities and as currently structured will have a significant claim on budgetary resources in the future .
" The net present value for all of the responsibilities ( for current participants over a 75 - year period ) is $ 49,403 billion , including Medicare and Social Security payments , pensions and benefits for Federal employees and veterans , and other financial responsibilities . "
After reworking the underlying data [ 3 ] , the $ 49,403 billion is the GAAP - basis net worth of the U.S. government , which translates into $ 50.9 trillion in liabilities , versus $ 1.6 trillion in assets , and a net annual loss in 2005 of $ 3.5 trillion from the government 's operations .
The GAO Speaks Out
The recently renamed Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) has the job of certifying the government 's GAAP - based statements , but it has refused to do so , given material reporting deficiencies .
With the Treasury touting a reduced 2005 budget deficit and unwilling to repeat 2004's big picture cautions in this year 's " Management 's Discussion and Analysis , " the GAO offered ( page 137 ) :
" While we are unable to express an opinion on the U.S. government 's consolidated financial statements , several key items deserve emphasis in order to put the information contained in the financial statements and the " Management 's Discussion and Analysis " section of the Financial Report of the United States Government into context .
" First , while the reported $ 319 billion fiscal year 2005 unified budget deficit was significantly lower than the $ 412 billion unified budget deficit in fiscal year 2004 , it was still very high given current economic growth rates and the overall composition of federal spending .
Furthermore , the federal government 's reported net operating cost , which included expenses incurred during the year , increased to $ 760 billion in fiscal year 2005 from $ 616 billion in fiscal 2004 .
" Second , the U.S. government 's total reported liabilities total more than $ 46 trillion , representing close to four times current GDP and up from about $ 20 trillion or two times GDP in 2000 .
" Finally , while the nation 's long - term fiscal imbalance continues to grow , the retirement of the " baby boom " generation is closer to becoming a reality with the first wave of boomers eligible for early retirement under Social Security in 2008 .
Given these and other factors , it seems clear that the nation 's current fiscal path is unsustainable and tough choices by the President and the Congress are necessary in order to address the nation 's large and growing - long - term fiscal imbalance . "

No Way Out -- System Doomed to Hyperinflation
The regular , annual $ 3.5 trillion shortfall in government operations cannot be covered by Uncle Sam ; the situation has deteriorated beyond any hope of a solution within the existing system .
Raise taxes ?
Even a 100 % personal income tax would leave a deficit .
Cut spending ?
Spending cuts that would bring government fiscal conditions into some semblance of order would be so draconian as to be beyond any political possibility in today 's environment .
What remains inevitable -- only a matter of time -- is a national bankruptcy .
Such circumstances in the past -- though no nation on earth has ever come close to experiencing the level of fiscal and financial fraud now being perpetrated on the American people -- typically have been " cured " by revving up the printing presses and creating excessive quantities of money .
The end result is a monetary collapse in a hyperinflation , with the currency becoming worthless .

With the Treasury touting a reduced 2005 budget deficit and unwilling to repeat 2004's big picture cautions in this year 's " Management 's Discussion and Analysis , " the GAO offered ( page 137 ) : " While we are unable to express an opinion on the U.S. government 's consolidated financial statements , several key items deserve emphasis in order to put the information contained in the financial statements and the " Management 's Discussion and Analysis " section of theinto context .
" First , while the reported $ 319 billion fiscal year 2005 unified budget deficit was significantly lower than the $ 412 billion unified budget deficit in fiscal year 2004 , it was still very high given current economic growth rates and the overall composition of federal spending .
Furthermore , the federal government 's reported net operating cost , which included expenses incurred during the year , increased to $ 760 billion in fiscal year 2005 from $ 616 billion in fiscal 2004 .
" Second , the U.S. government 's total reported liabilities total more than $ 46 trillion , representing close to four times current GDP and up from about $ 20 trillion or two times GDP in 2000 .
" Finally , while the nation 's long - term fiscal imbalance continues to grow , the retirement of the " baby boom " generation is closer to becoming a reality with the first wave of boomers eligible for early retirement under Social Security in 2008 .
Given these and other factors , it seems clear that the nation 's current fiscal path is unsustainable and tough choices by the President and the Congress are necessary in order to address the nation 's large and growing - long - term fiscal imbalance .
" For anyone interested in the GAO 's thoughts on the material deficiencies in the financial reporting of the Departments of Defense , Homeland Security and Energy , the full text can be downloaded from the earlier noted website .
The regular , annual $ 3.5 trillion shortfall in government operations cannot be covered by Uncle Sam ; the situation has deteriorated beyond any hope of a solution within the existing system .
Raise taxes ?
Even a 100 % personal income tax would leave a deficit .
Cut spending ?
Spending cuts that would bring government fiscal conditions into some semblance of order would be so draconian as to be beyond any political possibility in today 's environment .
What remains inevitable -- only a matter of time -- is a national bankruptcy .
Such circumstances in the past -- though no nation on earth has ever come close to experiencing the level of fiscal and financial fraud now being perpetrated on the American people -- typically have been " cured " by revving up the printing presses and creating excessive quantities of money .
The end result is a monetary collapse in a hyperinflation , with the currency becoming worthless .
For a detailed discussion of a possible U.S. hyperinflation as well as a history on the GAAP accounting reports , see " Federal Deficit Reality : An Update " ( July 7 , 2005 ) . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Electronic versions of the 2005 , 2004 and prior GAAP - based government financial statements are available at 2005 Financial Report of the United States Government [ 3 ]

Athletes riding their luck in Torino by Lincoln Archer for CNN
Hosp has a lucky pig sending her positive vibes .
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT  Quiz : Torino 2006 Quiz Medal Tracker  Special : Winter Olympics 2006 YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Winter Olympics Skiing Nicole Hosp Lindsey Kildow or or Create Your Own TORINO , Italy --
There is a pig living a peaceful existence in the Austrian alpine village of Bichlbach , a little cold perhaps , but otherwise perfectly happy .
For now .
This pig is blissfully unaware , living in its sty surrounded by bucolic splendor , that its days are numbered .
The animal was given to its owner , Austrian skier Nicole Hosp , as a lucky charm by Hosp 's sister Sonja .
Hosp is hoping the swine will bring her mountains of luck as she swoops down the slopes of San Sicario , and for the remainder of the World Cup skiing season .
And after that , she is going to eat it .
" What else would you do with a pig ? " she said during a break from competition .
But Hosp also sees a more mystical reason for eating the Lucky Osterhase , or " luck Easter bunny " , as the pig is known , than merely the prospect of ham , bacon and pork in plentiful supply .
" That way I 'll have its luck inside me for the next year , " she said .
That which gives the pig its power , it seems , also seals its fate .
Hosp is not the only athlete with an animal in her corner .
U.S. skier Lindsey Kildow is said to have a lucky cow , which was being moved from Austria to France to be closer to Kildow as she competes .
Kildow has not yet said what lies in store for the cow after the completion of the Games .
Presumably , however , it could not be allowed to remain in Austria lest it receive word of the future awaiting Hosp 's talisman .
The efficacy of Kildow 's cow is a matter of some conjecture .
The 21 - year - old from Colorado spectacularly crashed out of training for the women 's downhill event , all but crushing her hopes for a medal .
On the other hand , believers in such things could argue that Kildow was extremely lucky to have emerged from such a heavy fall with only minor injuries .
Barely 24 hours after being taken off the course on a stretcher , she was out of hospital and preparing to ski the event after all .
Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva was seen cuddling a white furry toy known as a " Cheburashka " after winning silver in her first ever Olympic race , but her luck turned dramatically for the worse when she was stripped of the medal after failing a drug test .
Russian officials said a doctor who treated Pyleva for an ankle injury in Siberia in January gave her a medication that contained the banned stimulant carphedon but did not list it among its ingredients .
" It 's a shocking situation , " Pyleva told Russian television , " because I 've always been against using banned medications .
" What 's happened now is just monstrous stupidity . "
Unlucky 17
The amulets and trinkets were out in force among the superstitious in Italy on day seven of competition , the 17th of February .
In Italy , the 17th has the negative power wielded by the number 13 in other countries .
By coincidence -- or is it ? -- day seven fell on Friday the 17th .
One Torino taxi driver who spoke to AP ran to touch a metal gate , the Italian version of touching wood , after hearing mention of the alignment of day and date .
" I once had a motorcycle accident at 17:17 on Friday 17 , how can I not believe in it ? " he said , although adding that he did not carry a charm to protect him .
" I just try to be more careful on such a day . "
The mystique surrounding 17 is said to have developed from its depiction in Roman numerals as XVII .
This is an anagram of " vixi " , which in Latin is roughly translated as " I died . "
Out of deference to the superstition , turn 17 at the sledding track at Cesana is the only one without a nickname .
Nevertheless , many competitors have come to grief on the course , crashing out on a track some describe as treacherous but that officials call " challenging . "
Time to call in the pigs .

Britain 's leading scientists have challenged the US oil company ExxonMobil to stop funding groups that attempt to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change .
In an unprecedented step , the Royal Society , Britain 's premier scientific academy , has written to the oil giant to demand that the company withdraws support for dozens of groups that have " misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence " .
The scientists also strongly criticise the company 's public statements on global warming , which they describe as " inaccurate and misleading " .
In a letter earlier this month to Esso , the UK arm of ExxonMobil , the Royal Society cites its own survey which found that ExxonMobil last year distributed $ 2.9 m to 39 groups that the society says misrepresent the science of climate change .
These include the International Policy Network , a thinktank with its HQ in London , and the George C Marshall Institute , which is based in Washington DC .
In 2004 , the institute jointly published a report with the UK group the Scientific Alliance which claimed that global temperature rises were not related to rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere .
" There is not a robust scientific basis for drawing definitive and objective conclusions about the effect of human influence on future climate , " it said .
In the letter , Bob Ward of the Royal Society writes : " At our meeting in July ... you indicated that ExxonMobil would not be providing any further funding to these organisations .
I would be grateful if you could let me know when ExxonMobil plans to carry out this pledge . "
The letter , a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian , adds : " I would be grateful if you could let me know which organisations in the UK and other European countries have been receiving funding so that I can work out which of these have been similarly providing inaccurate and misleading information to the public . "
This is the first time the society has written to a company to challenge its activities .
The move reflects mounting concern about the activities of lobby groups that try to undermine the overwhelming scientific evidence that emissions are linked to climate change .
The groups , such as the US Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) , whose senior figures have described global warming as a myth , are expected to launch a renewed campaign ahead of a major new climate change report .
The CEI responded to the recent release of Al Gore 's climate change film , An Inconvenient Truth , with adverts that welcomed increased carbon dioxide pollution .
The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , due to be published in February , is expected to say that climate change could drive the Earth 's temperatures higher than previously predicted .
Mr Ward said : " It is now more crucial than ever that we have a debate which is properly informed by the science .
For people to be still producing information that misleads people about climate change is unhelpful .
The next IPCC report should give people the final push that they need to take action and we can't have people trying to undermine it . "
The Royal Society letter also takes issue with ExxonMobil 's own presentation of climate science .
It strongly criticises the company 's " corporate citizenship reports " , which claim that " gaps in the scientific basis " make it very difficult to blame climate change on human activity .
The letter says : " These statements are not consistent with the scientific literature .
It is very difficult to reconcile the misrepresentations of climate change science in these documents with ExxonMobil 's claim to be an industry leader . "
Environmentalists regard ExxonMobil as one of the least progressive oil companies because , unlike competitors such as BP and Shell , it has not invested heavily in alternative energy sources .
ExxonMobil said : " We can confirm that recently we received a letter from the Royal Society on the topic of climate change .
Amongst other topics our Tomorrow 's Energy and Corporate Citizenship reports explain our views openly and honestly on climate change .
We would refute any suggestion that our reports are inaccurate or misleading . "
A spokesman added that ExxonMobil stopped funding the Competitive Enterprise Institute this year .
Recent research has made scientists more confident that recent warming is man-made , a finding endorsed by scientific academies across the world , including in the US , China and Brazil .
The Royal Society 's move emerged as Chris Rapley , director of the British Antarctic Survey , warned that the polar ice caps were breaking up at a faster rate than glaciologists thought possible , with profound consequences for global sea levels .
Professor Rapley said the change was almost certainly down to global warming .
" It 's like opening a window and seeing what 's going on and the message is that it 's worse than we thought , " he said .
About
JRX is inspired by the RX tool of ActiveState 's Komodo IDE .
Although RX is more powerful and supports Perl Regular Expressions ( almost ? ) fully , I 've needed an always - accessible and installation - free implementation .
So , here it is : a single , ultra - compact HTML file , without any external file ;)
Save it to your disk if you like , or use online for latest version .
You might also be interested in Ted Mielczarek 's Extension Developer 's Extension , it includes JRX among some other very useful stuff , it 's terrific !
This is not an AJAX application , you can save the page locally and use it off - line .
Compatibility
I 'd tested older versions of JRX with Mozilla 1.3 , IE 6.0 and Opera 7.1 , and JRX worked OK in all of them .
However , IE6 and Opera have had back then some funny bugs with JavaScript and CSS , and I 'm getting tired of IEs inferior CSS / JS - support ( I 'm not sure of IE7 , I do n't have it ) .
Therefore , I was testing the latest versions only with Mozilla Firefox > =v1.5 ; JRX may or may not work in Opera .
I 'd be happy if you can come up with code submissions which fix things with IE / Opera , but most likely I will not do it myself .
I 'm still keeping the latest working version for IE / Opera anyway .
Have fun .
Recent changes
I 've added matched substrings ' starting and ending positions to the results list
Clicking or hovering on the results will highlight matched portion on the target text and double - clicking will jump to the textarea ; unfortunately you cannot scroll the textareas to the selected portion :(
Hovering over the results will show the parenthesized substrings
Target text can be evaluated before the matching is done ( see below for explanation )
RegExp - based replacements ; also if you have parenthesized groups , you can use $ 1 , $ 2 , etc. or $ &
I 've changed the split code , it now does not use String.split ( ) , since String.split ( ) does n't know about matched portions ' positions
Settings are automatically saved via cookies ( yippee ! ) and your last regexp and text will be preserved ; note that cookies will not work if you work locally
work if you work locally
There 's a compact mode now , JRX should easily fit into smallest browser windows ( see the note about this option & re-distribution below )
Number of iterations is hard - limited to 250 , in order to avoid infinite evaluations ( e.g. due to backtracking )
Got rid of " Auto - update " option , " Refresh " & " Clear text " buttons
Changed the accesskeys so that most of them can be accessed with the options ' first letters
Fixed a bug with regexps using * , e.g. /b*/ matched against " Hello world " repeatedly the first empty string ( pos:0 - >0 )
Lots of small changes and some cleanup in code
Unfortunately , I have no time to implement lots lots of workarounds for IE 's bugs , so I will rarely test JRX with IE from now on and write code for IE only if it 's extremely easy !
Unless new bugs are discovered , I 'll add no more features to this beta and release it as final .
To do
I 'm considering to add a few other tools and cosmetic changes , such as :
Regexp examples for common tasks , e.g. matching dates , emails , domain names , etc .
Perl - style extended regular expressions , i.e. with multiple lines , comments , etc , but it 's no top priority at the moment ; contact me if you can help on this
A tabbed interface ( why ?!?)
Real - time JavaScript Evaluator ( why ?!? , there is this awesome JavaScript Shell and another terrific JavaScript Development Environment )
Hexadecimal <-> Decimal converter
Encoder - Decoder using un/escape ( ) , de/encodeURI ( ) , de/encodeURIComponent ( )
( I 'm letting myself go )
The subroutine which will compute the answer to life , the universe and everything
Though these might be useful to do everything on one place , it will also bloat the page , so they might be never implemented .
Mini FAQ
Q . Why are my results shown twice , if I use global and parentheses ?
A. Results always include $ 0 , which means , if you use , e.g. ( ^.*$ ) , $ 0 is implicitly the whole matched string and $ 1 is your backreference !
Now if you pack your whole regexp into parentheses , $ 0 & $ 1 will be naturally the same , therefore shown twice : )
... try the above regexp with multiline ( m ) & global ( g ) , and you 'll see .
Results show only $ 0 now , hover over the results to see the substrings .
Q . What does " Eval target text " do ?
A . It substitutes escaped chars \t \r
\f \v with their respective values , before matching the regexp !
To see this in action enter " foo \t bar " as target text and " ( \S+ ) ( \s + ) ( \S+ ) " as regexp
and try matching with and without this options .
Note that the inline linebreaks in the target are not escaped ; you should use
in that case .
Also note that the highlighting does not function well when this option is active , yet .
Q . Why is text length shown " incorrectly " if use newlines ?
A. ( Firefox ' ) HTML textareas interpret Enter key as ASCII code 0x0A ( aka
) and " a< ENTERKEY > b " returns a length of 3 whereas other editors show a length of 4 using 0x0D+0x0A ( aka \r
) .
So be cautious if text length is extremely important for you and / or if you match / split by
, \s , etc .
Q. How can I backreference inside my regexp ?
A . For example , to match ISO - type dates ( yyyy - mm - dd ) you could use ( \d{4} ) ( [/.-] ) ( \d{2} ) \2( \d{2} ) ( this is a practical example , but not validating ) .
Note the \ 2 it ensures that the same delimiter is used afterwards .
BTW , a complete date - validating regexp is nearly impossible , due to the leap years , but an approximate solution would be : ( \d{4} ) ( [ /.-] ) ( 0\d | 1 [ 0 - 2 ] ) \2( [ 012 ] \d| 3[01 ] ) , though this would match 9876 - 02 - 30 , too , I 'll leave the rest as an exercise .

You can recognize shortcuts on underlined letters .
Firefox used to have ALT as modifier key and later versions use ALT - SHIFT .

SAN FRANCISCO , Aug. 21 - Edward Vazquez Jr. , 6 , has numerous educational tools at his disposal .
He learns math from flashcards and the alphabet from a popular electronic gadget called the LeapPad .
But when it comes to instruction , the family 's personal computer sits dormant .
" He has a lot of toys for learning -- not the computer , " said his father , Edward Vazquez , 28 , a waiter in San Francisco .
One reason , Mr. Vazquez said , is " you do n't see a lot of that software . "
That statement would have been unthinkable a few years ago .
In 2000 , sales of educational software for home computers reached $ 498 million , and it was conventional wisdom among investors and educators that learning programs for PC 's would be a booming growth market .
Yet in less than five years , that entire market has come undone .
By 2004 , sales of educational software -- a category that includes programs teaching math , reading and other subjects as well as reference works like encyclopedias -- had plummeted to $ 152 million , according to the NPD Group , a market research concern .

Fitbit has discontinued their Fitbit One step trackers , which seems like a good opportunity to step back and reflect on wearing one for the last decade or so .
I ’ve enjoyed using Fitbit trackers , but the One devices seemed like they broke down way too often .
I ’m pretty proud that I ended up earning all the activity - related Fitbit badges though :
100,000 steps and 800 floors in one day
In 2013 , I ran a 50 mile race and I took 110,472 steps that day .
I think I did some extra steps late that night just in case Fitbit ever increased their top step badge from 100 K to 105 K or 110 K steps .
The lifetime miles badge took care of itself as long as I wore my Fitbit .
The same applied for the lifetime floor badge : I ’ve climbed 73,383 floors in the last few years , and that badge tops out at 35,000 floors .
But the Rainbow badge was a little harder : 700 floors in one day .
Climbing up Half Dome in Yosemite only got me 500 floors or so .
At some point , I found myself in Washington , DC missing only a couple badges : Mountain ( 600 floors ) and Rainbow ( 700 floors ) .
DC is n’t known for its high buildings .
I researched the Washington Monument ( 897 steps ) and the National Cathedral ( about 333 steps ) , but access was tricky and I ’d need to climb either many times .
Ultimately I decided on the New Executive Office Building , which I have access to because of my job at the US Digital Service .
That ’s how I found myself on a Sunday morning in July 2018 .
I started a podcast as I walked up the steps to the 10th floor of the NEOB ( pronounced like “ knee - ob ” ) .
Then I took the elevator down , and started walking up the steps again .
And again .
Every so often I took a bathroom break or ate a snack , but mostly I walked while listening to podcasts .
I ended up climbing 818 floors , which is basically walking up to the 10th floor about 82 times .
Fitbit claimed I burned 4000 + calories that day .
Wait a second –the badge is only for 700 floors , so why did I climb 800 + floors ?
It took me about four hours and forty - five minutes to climb all those steps that day .
Just in case Fitbit added a badge for 800 floors , I did n’t want the temptation to do re-do several hours of climbing .
Overall , Fitbit ’s badges have probably pushed me to walk more , along with a goal to get 10,000 steps a day .
As my current Fitbit
One gets more and more creaky and unreliable , I might explore a less quantified self though .
I ’m finding myself posting less on social media .
Maybe not every single thing needs to be observed and tallied .
Are we alone in the universe ?
Are there planets like Earth around other “ suns ” that might harbor life ?
Thanks to a recent technology breakthrough on a key NASA planet - finding project , the dream of answering those questions is no longer light - years away .
On a crystal clear , star - filled night at Hawaii ’s Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea , NASA engineers successfully suppressed the blinding light of three stars , including the well - known Vega , by 100 times .
This breakthrough will enable scientists to detect the dim dust disks around stars , where planets might be forming .
Normally the disks are obscured by the glare of the starlight .
Engineers accomplished this challenging feat with the Keck Interferometer , which links the observatory ’s two 10 - meter ( 33 - feet ) telescopes .
By combining light from the telescopes , the Keck Interferometer has a resolving power equivalent to a football - field sized telescope .
The “ technological touchdown ” of blocking starlight was achieved by adding an instrument called a “ nuller . ”
This setup may eventually help scientists select targets for NASA ’s envisioned Terrestrial Planet Finder missions .
The success of those potential future missions , one observing in visible light and one in infrared , depends on being able to find Earth - like planets in the dust rings around stars .
“ We have proven that the Keck Interferometer can block light from nearby stars , which will allow us to survey the amount of dust around them , ” said Dr. James Fanson , project manager for the Keck Interferometer at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
That survey will begin in late 2006 after the team refines the nuller ’s sensitivity level .
Combined information from all of NASA ’s planet - hunting missions will provide a complete picture of possible Earth - like planets : how big they are , whether they are warm enough for life , and if their atmospheres and surfaces show chemical signatures of current life .
“ People have been talking about whether there are other earths out there for 2,500 years .
Only now are we developing the technology to go find out , ” said Michael Devirian , manager of NASA ’s Navigator Program at JPL , which is investigating potential planet - exploring missions .
So far , scientists around the world have found 150 planets orbiting other stars .
Most are giants , like Jupiter ; none is as small as Earth .
Scientists believe the best odds of finding life outside our solar system are on Earth - sized planets , particularly those with the right temperature , density and chemistry .
More information on NASA ’s planet - finding missions , including the Keck Interferometer and Terrestrial Planet Finder is at planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov .

" Ethical " coffee is being produced in Peru , the world 's top exporter of Fairtrade coffee , by labourers paid less than the legal minimum wage .
Industry insiders have also told the FT of non-certified coffee being marked and exported as Fairtrade , and of certified coffee being illegally planted in protected rainforest .
This casts doubt on the certification process used by Fairtrade and similar marks that require producers to pay the minimum wage .
It also raises questions about the assurances certifiers give consumers about how premium - priced fair trade coffee is produced .
There are more cracks appearing within the administration of the fair trade coffee system .
This article , originally published in the Financial Times , unearths cases of fair trade money not going where it should , workers being paid less than they should , and coffee being sold as fair trade when it ’s not .
Here is just a short excerpt from that article :
As I have mentioned before in this blog , these kinds of problems threaten public trust in fair trade and have the potential to bring the entire movement to its knees .
I ’m not saying the administration of the fair trade system is not enormously complicated , especially when dealing with so many small growers in so many parts of the world .
It is clearly a huge challenge to administer and police such a widespread movement .
That said , fair trade is enormously important to the world .
Its impact on coffee farmers , the growth of social consciousness in the west … and its position as an alternative to free trade … make fair trade profoundly important to our future .
With the stakes being so high , I think we would do better to slow the growth of the movement , and make absolutely sure that it is administered and policed effectively .
There is absolutely no benefit to pushing for faster expansion , if the foundations of the movement itself are shaky .
Without public trust in fair trade , we have nothing .
81 . Django Screencasts
I 've made a short screencast to demonstrate Django , a Python framework for rapid web development which we 've been evaluating at Torchbox .
It 's not intended as a tutorial - aspects of Django 's API are likely to change before its forthcoming 1.0 release , and the project website already provides excellent documentation - but as an introduction to some of the basic functionality .
Areas covered include :
Setting up a project Designing the model Installing the administration interface Customising administration screens URL dispatching Generic views Django templates
The screencast is encoded with the extraordinary H.264 codec ; you 'll need QuickTime 7 or VLC to watch it .
There 's a rather breathy soundtrack , but it should make sense without it .
If you 're having problems viewing the screencast or you 're interested in an alternative format , let me know .

Jeder vierte deutsche Surfer nutzt Firefox
Laut einer Erhebung des Unternehmens WebSideStory erfreut sich Firefox in Deutschland der größten Beliebtheit .
Wie das Unternehmen bekannt gab , setzt in Deutschland jeder vierte Surfer auf die freie Alternative Firefox .
In keinem anderen europäischen Land ist laut WebSideStory der Marktanteil von Microsoft so niedrig wie in Deutschland .
Zwar dominiert der US - amerikanische Konzern immer noch den Markt ( 65 Prozent Marktanteil ) , kommt aber zunehmend durch Firefox in Bedrängnis .
Der Anteil des schlanken Browsers liegt bei über 26 Prozent .
Den zweiten Platz der am häufigsten Firefox einsetzenden Länder belegt Frankreich .
Im Land von Voltaire , Rousseau und Sartre kommt Firefox auf einen Marktanteil von knapp 15 Prozent , während Microsoft auch hier den Markt mit über 82 Prozent beherrscht .
Platz drei belegt Italien ( 12,46 Prozent ) , gefolgt von Spanien ( 9,86 Prozent ) und Großbritannien ( 8,82 Prozent ) .
The Simpsons are household names all over the world
Only one in four could name more than one of the five freedoms it upholds but more than half could name at least two members of the cartoon family .
About one in five thought the right to own a pet was one of the freedoms .
A new museum dedicated to the First Amendment said the findings showed there was a pressing need to explain one of America 's basic laws better .
" We have our job cut out for us , " said Joe Madeira , director of exhibitions at the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum .
Another finding from the poll , a telephone survey of 1,000 random adults with an error margin of 3 % , was that 22 % of Americans could name all five Simpson characters .
By comparison , just one in 1,000 people could name all five First Amendment freedoms .
The names of American Idol TV show judges and popular advertising slogans also proved more memorable than the five freedoms - speech , religion , press , assembly and petition for redress of grievances .
A new study uses advanced brain - scanning technology to cast light on a topic that psychologists have puzzled over for more than half a century : social conformity .
The study was based on a famous series of laboratory experiments from the 1950's by a social psychologist , Dr. Solomon Asch .
In those early studies , the subjects were shown two cards .
On the first was a vertical line .
On the second were three lines , one of them the same length as that on the first card .
Then the subjects were asked to say which two lines were alike , something that most 5 - year - olds could answer correctly .

Is it just me , or does anyone else feel the vise grip tightening ?
Thursday 's news read as follows : " Airline passengers around the country stood in line for hours and airport trash bins bulged with everything from mouthwash and shaving cream to maple syrup and fine wine Thursday in a security crackdown prompted by the discovery of a terror plot in Britain . "
Imagine this .
In " the land of the free and the home of the brave " there is a " security crackdown . "
Crackdown on whom , may I ask ?
United Airlines posted updated TSA regulations including a ban on all liquids or gels in carry - on baggage on its web site on August 10 , in response to the discovery of the terror plot .
Hmm .
Perhaps I am na�ve , but I thought that things like this had to be passed by legislators and signed by the president before I could be arrested for violating them .
But no .
We have a War on Terror .
The executive branch has to act and act fast !
It is for your protection .
I mean they have to do something .
We are told that we are fighting a war against terrorists who " hate our freedom " and seek to " undermine our very way of life . "
If America succumbs to full - blown tyranny it will not be because of crazed , diabolical " Islamo - Fascists . "
It will be because the American people willingly relinquished their freedom in the name of security .
America has two constitutions .
One was ordained and established in Philadelphia in 1787 .
The other exists in the hearts and minds of the American people and far more important .
If " we the people " are ignorant , apathetic and downright unwilling to defend their God - given rights , the written Constitution becomes just a piece of paper .
Ever since September 11 , the American people have been all too happy to let the FEDGOV do whatever it pleases .
We applaud the USA PATRIOT Act .
We submit to the TSA grope - and - grab at airports .
We have no objection to warrantless searches .
We could care less if Uncle Sam monitors our e-mails and phone calls .
After all , " if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear " and " your civil liberties do n't matter if you 're dead . "
My response to this is : " Just how do you know you have nothing to hide ? "
Consider the following :
Americans have already accepted all ten policy planks of the Communist Manifesto as the law of the land .
Millions of Americans do n't mind one bit that we have the world 's highest incarceration rate .
The Federal Register Uncle Sam's compendium of laws and regulations with which you and I are required to comply runs 70,000 pages .
Do you know what is in there ?
Do you ?
If you violate it , prepare to don an orange jumpsuit .
The Internal Revenue code runs 11,000,000 words .
Again : do you know what is in there ?
The worst part of the post - 9/11 agenda is Uncle Sam 's assumption of power to imprison terror suspects arbitrarily and indefinitely without formal charges , without the right to face their accuser , without a jury trial or without any semblance of due process whatsoever .
What was that about " threatening our very way of life " ?
This is not the doing of some psychopath in Afghanistan .
It is the doing of our own government .
And it is all in the name of freedom , of course .
As one observer put it : " On September 11 , 2001 a horrible crime was committed .
On September 12 , 2001 the American people became suspects . "
Of far greater danger than terrorists abroad is how unquestioningly so many Americans have accepted their new status .
First it was 9/11 and the growth of the surveillance state .
Then it was Thursday 's unveiling of a terrorist plot in Britain and new restrictions on what we can carry on planes .
What will come after the next terrorist episode , be it an attack or an arrest ?
And how calmly will the American people accept whatever laws or regulations Uncle Sam hands down ?
As an old German proverb says , freedom dies in little pieces .
During the Clinton years , it was popular to say that you loved your country but you feared your government .
Under Bush
II , the same people want you to think that if you do not follow in lockstep with your government , you are all kinds of unspeakable things .
Police state groupies tell us that these are temporary measures necessary to keep us safe from terrorists .
Ben Franklin once remarked that those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither .
The German people in the 1930s were happy to sacrifice their liberties to a leader who would keep them secure .
They did this for 12 years .
For the 8871st time , Bush II is not Adolf Hitler .
However , the American people are in total denial that their own government , left unchecked , can do far more harm than any foreign terrorist .
In the case of Ex Parte Milligan in 1866 , Supreme Court Justice David Davis wrote : " The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people , equally in war and in peace , and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men , at all times , and under all circumstances .
No doctrine , involving more pernicious consequences , was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government .
Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism . "
The anarchy of which Justice Davis wrote was that of unrestrained power .
When you let people do whatever they want , you get Woodstock .
When you let governments do whatever they want , you get Auschwitz .
So what do we do about terror ?
Simple .
Get out of the superpower business .
Stop trying to run the whole world .
When you have troops in 130 countries , is it any wonder that so many people hate you ?
Bring the troops home .
Use your military to defend your shores and borders and be done with it .
It is hard for a lot of Americans , blinded as they are by hubris , to understand , but most of the world does not want our way of life .
And the more bombs we drop , the more they will hate us .
As Pat Buchanan has stated , " To Islamic peoples , whether the Crusaders come in the name of God or in the name of democracy , they are still Crusaders . "
And they want the Crusaders gone .
Buchanan has also stated that , " The price of empire is terror .
The price of occupation is terror .
The price of interventionism is terror . "
Terrorists do not " hate us for our freedom . "
They hate our relentless meddling in the internal affairs of their nations .
The problems of the Arab world are not America 's to fix .
So let us quit trying to fix them .
The people who have no problem with the advancing police state are many of the same people who so harshly criticized France for not joining America in invading Iraq in 2003 .
France had a terrorist problem at one point .
And then they pulled out of Algeria .
The whole business brings to mind the comic strip character Pogo , who once remarked that " We have met the enemy , and he is us . "
Such is the case in the War on Terror .
It is not " the terrorists " who want to take away our freedom .
It is the United States government , aided and abetted by the ignorance and apathy of so many Americans who will gladly trade freedom for security .
The German people did this 70 years ago , with grisly results .
Let us pray that this does not happen in America .
There is no guarantee that it can't .
In 1994 , the smartest guys in the financial trading and academic world got together to start Long Term Capital .
John Meriwether from Liar ’s Poker fame assembled a stellar group from Wall Street and academia including Myron Scholes ( one of the creators of the Black - Scholes option pricing model ) and Robert Merton who together shared the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 .
They raised $ 1.25 b in an instant and that giant sucking sound you heard on Wall Street was LTC hiring the best and brightest minds to its hedge fund .
LTC prided itself on hiring PhDs and other brilliant talent to add to the mystique of the group .
And the hedge fund performed spectacularly .
It used proprietary computer driven models ( think sexy algorithms ) to find miniscule misprincings in markets and would use leverage and derivatives to exploit those mispricings .
At one point in time , $ 5 b of equity was levered up to a $ 130 b of total assets or bets outstanding .
While I wo n’t go into the specifics of the trading model ( think high leverage or vacuuming nickels from a train track , it works for awhile but the train will get you one day ) , they crashed , burned and died in 1998 almost bringing down the global financial markets .
The bigger it got , the more risk it had to take on to deliver higher returns .
In other words , it is harder to drive significant percantage based returns on a huge capital base .
What also set LTC apart was its culture .
It was one of incredible hubris and arrogance .
Their models were designed by Noble Prize winners and it was unbelievable for them to think that mere mortasl could even understand their models .
They did n’t even share their investment trading strategy with their investors .
So what does this have to do with my blog ?
I was having lunch with a friend recently who was telling me about some of his dealings with Google over the last year .
As an ex-Wall Street guy , it struck him that some of the meetings he had with Google were like the ones he had at Long Term Capital years ago .
Even when LTC was about to crater , he remembers going to their offices , being sequestered into an off - campus conference room , and not being able to get any information out of them to even help bail them out .
In addition , people would show up and leave during the meeting , take notes , and not even introduce themselves .
Well , it turns out that his meetings with Google over the last year were pretty similar .
While the Google employees were clearly bright and technical , my friend was not sure who the decision maker was and what they actually wanted to do with the company .
In addition , he felt pretty uncomfortable showing up to Google and having to sign an NDA on the spot , and then going into a meeting where people would walk in and out , sit on their laptop and take notes , and not even introduce themselves .
Hmmm - it really does sound like Long Term Capital .
There are other parallels - Google has an appetite for hiring PhDs. is driven by an incredible proprietary algorithm , and is by far the best web company on the street and performing like a rock star .
Like LTC , the bigger and bigger Google gets , the harder it will be for them to drive significant percentage based growth .
In addition , the culture , since it is one driven by engineers , can also be driven by a NIH or not invented here syndrome .
Ultimately , since history always does repeat itself , I hope that Google understands that self - confidence is imperative but hubris and arrogance can kill .
Look at Long Term Capital and the chronicles of its short lived performance in a book so aptly titled , When Genius Failed .
Hell , Microsoft was the same way in the mid-to - late 90s and as time goes by I hear that they are becoming a bit friendlier to startups and partners .
I guess that is what happens when you get your ass whooped by a newcomer .
Hopefully , Microsoft has n’t learned its lesson too late .
And I hope that Google remembers its mantra of Do No Evil as they are going to need partners to continue to grow their business and build great product .
ISL6259 Chip and Apple MacBook Battery Charging and Power Problems 2018-02-03T15:54:54+05:30 2018-02-03T15:54:54+05:30 admin
Is your Apple Mac Not Charging or Not Turning On ?
The ISL6259 Chip is one of the most complex and challenging logic board components to replace .
Although it is quite cheap to repair , it plays a very important role in your MacBook power system .
So , what exactly does this tiny chip do ?
Before we get to that , I need to take you through a couple of things first .
Every command or communication transmitted through your computer passes through a data line .
Data lines are circuits that carry data within your Apple Mac or any communications channel within computer microchips .
Now , let ’s say you turn on your PC , it works on perfectly on the charger , but when you look at the charger light , there ’s no green light .
This is a very widespread issue among computer users worldwide .
What causes it ?
When your MacBook power system starts acting up , the most likely culprit is usually the one wire circuit problem .
So how does the isL6259 Chip come into play ?
In a computer board , the SMC , charger , VCC , pull up resistor and the ISL6259 Chip are all connected and communicate via a data line commonly referred to as a one wire circuit .
At the very end is a logic gate that lets in voltage to power the isL6259 Chip , which in turn creates a data line for the purposes of communicating with your charger and SMC .
All these multiple components need to work properly for the charging system to work like it should .
However , a failed power or charging system could be brought about by any of a thousand factors .
How on earth are we supposed to troubleshoot over 5000 little components on one system ?
The ISL6259 Chip and Its Use in Troubleshooting MacBook Power Problems
Using the ISL6259 Chip is one of the quickest ways to troubleshoot any power issues with your MacBook .
You ’ll need an oscilloscope to check where the power voltage gets disrupted and eliminate any components that seem to be working .
Typically , you want a complete SMC / BC / ACLK connection all the way to the pull - up resistor to open the logic gate .
By looking at the data lines and power lines around the charging chip and adapter , you are highly likely to find something wrong with the ISL6259 chip itself .
Your oscilloscope should show around 4
Volts through the resistor to the charger AC since their usually not the problem 99 % of the time .
A damaged ISL6259 Chip will not complete the circuit , often leading to migraine - inducing charging problems .
Before you go all nuts and destroy your MacBook motherboard or blame it on a faulty charger , make sure you take it to a certified computer repair centre for diagnostics , repair , and even replacement .
It might end up saving you the trouble as well as some precious coins too !

Error codes or Exceptions ?
Why is Reliable Software so Hard ?
Error codes or exceptions ?
Like static vs. dynamic programming languages or how great David Hasselhoff is ( most people say great , I say super - great ) , it tends to turn into a pointless argument ( " Hasselhoff is super - great ASSHOLE ! " ) .
Very little software really gets error handling right .
Even many critical , backend server systems tend to break under heavy loads .
And the vast majority of end - user applications handle errors gracefully only for the most well understood , commonly encountered conditions ( e.g. HTTP timeout ) , but very poorly for most other conditions ( failed allocations , bad data , I / O errors , missing files , etc ) .
When these sorts of errors occur , bad things happen .
Bad bad things .
Like when my web browser crashes , taking one half - composed email and 8 open web pages with it .
Why did a single flaw cause so much damage ?
I use Firefox and it's pretty reliable compared to most applications .
It 's engineered impressively , with logical program layers well separated and a great deal of the application logic is written in JavaScript , a high - level " safe " programming language .
But occasionally it still just crashes or locks up .
Why is this ?
Because it 's using error codes when it should be using exceptions , and exceptions when it should be using error codes ?
And why should a single flaw in the software cause the world to explode ?
Is the only way we can have reliable software is by having perfect software ?
I argue that it's not the " handling " part that 's hard , few errors are things we can even respond to .
How do we " handle " the inability to allocate memory ?
We can't fix those errors , we just hope they do n't make us crash or lock up .
And yet so often it does , a single error causes us to lose everything .
The problem is deeper than how we communicate errors in our languages , it 's really everything we 've done leading up to the error that 's the problem .
I 'll describe the three styles of error handling , and why one of those styles is usually wrong and the problem is more fundamental than error handling .
" Get the Hell Out of Dodge " Error Handling
This is the most simple case of error handling :
When a step in some action fails , all the subsequent steps in that action are simply NOT executed .
This is where exceptions shine because the application code need not worry about checking for errors after each step ; once the exception is thrown ( either directly or by a called routine ) , the routine exits automatically .
And its caller will have a chance to catch it or do nothing and let the exception bubble up to its caller , etc on up the call stack .
void DoIt ( ) { //
An exception in Foo means // Bar does n't get called Thing thing = Foo( ) ; Bar ( thing ) ; } Thing Foo( ) { if ( JupiterInLineWithPluto ) { throw new PlanetAlignmentException ( ) ; } return new Thing ( ) ; }
A second , slightly more advanced case of this error handling is when , like in the first error case you want to halt execution of the current code , but before you do you need to free any resources previously allocated .
This is different than the " just stop executing the action " case , because we actually need to do some additional work in the presence of the error .
In C , this most often this means freeing up allocated memory .
In garbage collected languages like Java , this it's more typically closing opened files or sockets ( although they will eventually get closed by the garbage collector regardless ) .
In this style of error handling , you are simply returning resources you 've acquired , be it memory , file handles , locks , etc .
Most programming languages offer simple ways to deal with this : Java has " finally " blocks , C# has " using " blocks , C++ has stack based variables and the RAII idiom .
Here 's an example of a " finally " block in Java :
void DoIt ( ) {
Thing thing = Foo( ) ; thing .
CreateTempFiles ( ) ; try { Bar ( thing ) ; Baz ( thing ) ; } finally { //
This gets called regardless // of exceptions in Bar and Baz. thing .
DeleteTempFiles ( ) ; } }
To generalize the description of this type of error handling , you are returning the software back to the default state .
Whatever intermediate state your code was in is now lost forever .
Stack frames are popped , memory freed , resources recovered , etc .
And that 's okay because you want those things to go away and start fresh .
This is easy and simple error handling , as easy as turning around and leaving town .
And you 'll leave town if you know what 's good for you .
Got that partner ?
" Plan B " Error Handling
This type of error handling is for error conditions that are known and understood and there is an action the code should take in the situation .
This differs from other error handling as these errors are n't " exceptional " , they are expected and we have alternate paths to take , we do n't just go home and pretend like it never happened .
One example might be attempting to deliver a SMTP mail message and the connection times out .
The error handling in that case may be to look in the MX record for a backup host , or put aside the mail message for later delivery .
( I 'm sure it 's way more complicated than that , humor me )
With this type of error handling , status codes are easier to deal with syntactically and logically : " if " and " switch " statements are more compact and natural than " try / catch " for most logic flow .
Error codes :
if ( DeliverMessage ( msg , primaryHost ) == FAILED ) { if ( DeliverMessage ( msg , secondaryHost ) == FAILED ) { PutInFailedDeliveryQueue( msg ) ; } }
Exceptions :
try { DeliverMessage ( msg , primaryHost ) ; } catch ( FailedDeliveryException e ) { try { DeliverMessage ( msg , secondaryHost ) ; } catch ( FailedDeliveryException e2 ) { PutInFailedDeliveryQueue( msg ) ; } }
But regardless if you use error codes or exceptions , Plan B error handling is n't particularly difficult .
The error conditions and scenarios are understood and your code has actions to deal with those scenarios .
If you use status codes here , this type of error handling is as natural as regular application code .
And that 's the way it should be , it should be just like adding any other branching logic .
Exceptions are n't as useful here , because in this case they are n't " exceptional " and the code to handle common conditions becomes much more convoluted .
" Reverse the Flow of Time " Error Handling
The third , and truly nastiest case of error handling , is when you must " undo " any state changes your program has made leading up to the error condition .
This is where things can get real complicated real quick , you are n't just freeing resources like before , you are backing up in time to a previous program state .
The analogy of putting the toothpaste back in the tube seems appropriate , but that 's a piece of cake comparatively .
In this case you 're actually trying to un - brush the crud back onto your teeth , and each piece of crud should go right back where it was originally .
And how do you do that ?
How do you put back state you 've changed ?
Do keep a copy of every variable and property change so you can put it back ?
Where do you keep it ?
What if the change is down in some deeply nested composite object ?
What if another thread or some other code already sees the state change and acted on it ?
What happens if another error happens while putting stuff back ?
This is the hard stuff .
This is the stuff where the error handling easily becomes as complex as the application logic , and sometimes to do it right it has to be even more complex .
So what can we do ?
What techniques or secrets can we use to make this error handling easier ?
If only we had something that reversed the actual flow of time , that could do the trick .
Or maybe we should n't be trying to figure out an easier way to do this type of error handling , but rather avoiding the need for it altogether .
Why is this style of error handling necessary ?
Is it our actions leading up to the error ?
And what could we have done differently ?
To understand a little better what 's going on here , I 'll use the analogy of building a deck .
Building a Deck
Let 's say you want to build a deck onto your house .
You foresee a grand deck on a beautiful summer day , you 're sipping lemonade and eating pie and playing Battleship !
with friends .
So you get the permits , you buy the materials , you dig , you saw , you hammer , you drill .
( Anyone tell you how much you look like Bob Vila ? )
Then a few days into it a building inspector shows up and asks to see your permits .
You dutifully retrieve them and give them to the inspector .
Uh - oh , there 's a problem , you did n't apply for a county building permit , you only got the permits from the city .
That 's too bad , the inspector says , because then you might have known the placement of the deck is out of line with Jupiter on the autumn sky , it 's clearly in a violation of the county building code regulation number 109.8723.b17 section 4 paragraph 2 .
So sorry , you can not continue building this deck .
How could you 've have known ?
You thought you planned for everything you could think of , but here , halfway into building your deck , there is a problem you did n't foresee .
You can't believe how bad it 's going to suck to not have that deck , you 're devastated , you already bought Electronic Battleship !
Deluxe and everything .
But that 's not the half of your problems .
Not even close .
The worst part by far is that your home is in a completely wrecked state , you 've dug up the yard , tore off a bunch of siding and trim and there 's a big door - shaped hole in the side of your house into your living room .
Putting all these things back the way they were is going to be just as hard , if not harder , than pushing forward .
In short , you 're fucked .
So you patch up the door - shaped hole , you nail back up the siding and you pick up your tools and building materials .
Later you start out digging up the concrete posts , and it 's hard heavy work .
After while you stop trying so hard ; other matters are more pressing .
And who cares if the new wall is unpainted or all the posts are n't dug up right away ?
Most of the building materials you bought are salvageable , and Home Depot is forgiving with their return policy , so you figure no big deal , you have plenty of resources to go around , you 'll recover those later .
But you forgot to nail back up a board near the sill , and now a family of chipmunks has taken residence in your walls .
You hear the scurrying noises sometimes , but you 're never quite sure what it is or how it got there , but clearly something is , uh , squirrelly .
This is the real world , where things get screwed up in a big way because of the unexpected , the unknown , and going back is just as hard as going forward .
We can't escape this in the real world , building a deck always has the possibility of being a huge disaster .
But what if the real world worked differently ?
What if it could all be completely undone when things go wrong ?
The Miracle Deck
What if Home Depot sold a do - it - yourself deck kit that had an installation " undo " feature ?
At any point during the decks installation , if something went wrong during installation , the whole thing could be undone and it's like no one ever touched your house .
You 'd just press a button , and the whole deck and everything zips itself up and drives back to the store and your charge card is refunded , all automatically .
Even if it's at the very end of the installation , if you did n't like the way it looked ( " it makes my house look fat " ) , just press the button and back to the store it goes .
And the cool thing is , even if you hit a power line while digging the footers , you could just press a button and all damage is undone .
This product , once installed , is no better than conventional decks .
The wood , nails and screws are the same color and quality , the foundation is dug just as deep and cement just as strong .
The only difference is during installation , the miracle deck can be undone at any time .
If such a deck product really existed , there could be no serious problems when trying to install a deck , because if anything goes wrong the house is kept in the exact condition as if nothing ever happened .
This product might not actually install any more successfully than the old product , but when things go wrong you wo n't end up with chipmunks in your wall and a garage filled with unreturned Home Depot supplies .
The real world can't work that way , but the programming world can .
Object Oriented Programming : Works Just Like the Real World .
Dammit !
One of the great things about Object Oriented Programming is it is a very natural , intuitive way to model software .
Things in the real world behave in many ways like the objects we use in programming .
The objects in the real world contain other objects , they have interchangeable interfaces , they hide their internal workings , they change over time and take on new state .
Of course , there are many ways the world is n't like OO programming too , but I wo n't go into that here .
So here we have programming constructs that act and work much like things in the real world act and work .
Great , OO makes it easier to write programs that work like the real world , but does OO make it easier to write programs that are useful and reliable ?
I remember a crummy movie with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore where Demi was the bad guy .
I do n't remember much about it except that for some reason the movie -- with no relevance to the plot other than they worked in a tech company -- included a virtual reality sequence that was suppose to showcase a brilliant advance in data retrieval UI .
The system worked by immersing you into a virtual reality representation of a library .
Then , you could walk around the library to find the information you need .
You 'd navigate by following categorized signs , and then further narrowed categories until you found the virtual bookshelf with the virtual book of information you 're looking for .
That 's supposed to be a huge advance in data retrieval , it made finding information as simple as going to the library .
Here 's the problem :
What 's the very first thing you do when you want to find a book in a real library ?
You walk over to a computer and use the digital card catalog system .
Sometimes you do n't want things that work like the real world , sometimes you want things that work like computers .
Similarly , our object oriented languages are modeling reality too closely .
I 'm sure it 's a slam dunk when actually modeling real world objects , but just how often are we as programmers doing that ?
OOP 's strength also ties us to many of the inherent problems we have with real objects .
Why are we limiting ourselves this way ?
OO is the problem ?
No , OO is NOT the problem , not at its core .
It 's just that all popular OO languages have the same problem .
The problem is more fundamental than what OO brings to the party , it 's a problem that exists in nearly every popular programming language , OO or not .
The problem is variable mutation , the problem of complex state change and how to manage what happens when we can no longer go forward .
It 's the same problem of building a deck .
Another term for variable mutation is " destructive update " , because when you change the state of a variable , you are destroying the previous state .
In every popular language , the updating of a variable means the previous state of that variable is destroyed , vanished , gone and you can't get it back .
And that 's kind of a problem , your code is doing the equivalent of tearing your house apart in order to achieve an action , but if it fails it wo n't have achieved its objective and your house is in ruins .
Ouch Ouch Ouch .
What we need in languages and tools is the ability to easily isolate our changes for when the shit hits the fan , so that incomplete changes are n't seen ( all or nothing ) .
And we can not be in denial that the shit can hit the fan at any time .
We need to make it easy to detect when things do wrong , and make it simple to do the right thing once that happens .
PHP to the Rescue !
PHP ?
Expecting someone else ?
Believe it or not we already have it , in rudimentary form , in PHP .
Yup , good old , stupid - simple PHP .
On a webserver , PHP scripts have no shared state , so each instance of a PHP script runs in its own logical memory space .
The scripts maintain no persisted state , so each script start off fresh as a daisy , blissfully unaware of what happened the previous times it was executed .
The only shared state in PHP exists at the database level ( or file level , but do n't go there ) , and if you commit all changes in a single transaction , you 've basically solved the deck building problem .
Your code might not be better about successfully completing its update , but failure is isolated , all the actions leading up to a failure are forgotten about and it can't cause further problems or inconsistencies in the application .
But PHP as a language has nothing special about it that gives it these properties , rather its how it 's being used .
Any language , Java/C++/VB/Ruby/Python , coupled with a transactional database also has the same ability if it's used in a manner like PHP is used : each invocation is started from scratch with no shared state and no memory of previous invocations .
However , all these languages begin to have issues once they start modifying persisted , in - memory program state .
Once again , it 's the deck building problem .
As some multi-step action is getting carried out , if one step fails , then any modifications in the previous steps must be undone , or like your deck project , the program may be left in a shambles .
Databases have transaction support , but our languages do not .
Pretty much any application that keeps state in memory has to worry about this : everything from highly concurrent application servers down to single user GUI applications .
So , how can we solve this problem more generally ?
Do n't Undo Your Actions , Just Forget
Them
There are strategies to avoid the intermediate destructive updates that cause problems , but unfortunately none of the popular languages provide direct support , so it feels hacky .
And it is .
But just say they 're design patterns and you wo n't feel so bad about it .
The key to these strategies is to minimize destructive updates , so that any actions we take need not be undone , but simply forgotten .
By doing this , we turn the super difficult " Reverse the Flow of Time " error handling into the super easy " Get the Hell out of Dodge " error handling .
Make a Copy of Everything Up Front
The first technique is low - tech and easy to understand , but expensive computationally and resource - wise .
Before the code does anything , make a deep copy all the objects you might modify , then have the action modify the copies .
Once all those modifications are completed , swap out the old objects with the new at the very end .
If an error happens during the action , the copied objects are simply forgotten about and garbaged collected later .
And you need not change the way the object methods work , the bulk of the application code remains unchanged .
Easy as pie ... a very expensive , memory intensive pie .
But simple and easy nonetheless .
Immutable Objects
The second way to avoid destructive updates is to make your objects immutable .
An immutable object is one that , once created , can not be changed .
Lord knows , it can't change .
Java strings work this way .
No methods of the String class ever modifies an existing string object , they instead create a brand new string object that 's the result of the operation , and the caller will at that point have two distinct strings , a pre-action string and a post-action string .
In practice this works very well and easily for strings object .
But strings are simple datatypes , they are n't composite like most of our application objects ( they only contain a char array ) .
Unfortunately , most popular languages do n't directly support this style of development .
C++ has the " const " modifier , which enables static enforcement of immutable objects , but that only tells us when we are doing it wrong ( attempting to modify const objects ) , it does n't make it any easier to actually achieve this style of programming , which is difficult when working with deeply composite objects .
None of the popular languages offer much support this style of programming , there is no syntactic sugar or other features to make it less awkward .
Consider this example of object composition .
We have a house .
That house contains a bathroom , that bathroom contains a toilet , and so on .
When we want to clean the house , we call down through objects , cleaning each sub object .
First take a look at a classic , mutable - object implementation :
void DoIt ( House house ) { ... house .
Clean ( ) ; ... } class House { Bathroom bathroom ; Bathroom bedroom ; ... void Clean ( ) { bathroom .
Clean ( ) ; bedroom .
Clean ( ) ; ... } } class Bathroom { Toilet toilet ; Mirror mirror ; ... void Clean ( ) { toilet .
Flush ( ) ; mirror .
Clean ( ) ; ... } } class Toilet { int poops ; ... void Flush ( ) { poops = 0 ; } }
Here is an " immutable " version of the above code :
void DoIt ( House house ) { ... house = house .
Clean ( ) ; ... } class House { Bathroom bathroom ; Bedroom bedroom ; ... House Clean ( ) { // make a new copy of the house // with the cleaned contents house = new House ; house .
bathroom = bathroom .
Clean ( ) ; house .
bedroom = bedroom .
Clean ( ) ; ... return house ; } } class Bathroom { Toilet toilet ; Mirror mirror ; .. Bathroom Clean ( ) { // make a new copy of the bathroom // with the cleaned contents bathroom = new Bathroom ; bathroom .
toilet = toilet .
Flush ( ) ; bathroom.mirror = mirror .
Clean ( ) ; ... return bathroom ; } } class Toilet { int poops ; Toilet Flush ( ) { // make a new copy of the toilet // with no poop Toilet toilet = new Toilet ; toilet.poops = 0 ; return toilet ; } }
Clearly the immutable version is longer and more complex , and it only gets worse if you also want to have a second return value .
However , the immutable version is a more robust version : if any cleaning operation fails then the house wo n't wind up in a half - cleaned state .
Being in a half - cleaned state might seem harmless enough , but it can cause surprisingly serious problems .
If , for example , part of cleaning the house meant moving all the furniture into the lawn so the floors could be polished , you would have big problems if the cleaners suddenly left .
And they 're calling for rain .
And migrating seagulls .
Keep Object Mutation to a Single Operation
Another strategy that is helpful in certain circumstances is to keep existing object mutation down to one operation .
This strategy is to do as much work in isolation as possible , then apply those changes in a single operation .
This is also known as an atomic update .
Not atomic like an atomic bomb , but atomic like a tiny atom , as in can't get any smaller .

An example might be if you have GUI application , and your code wants to add a dockable tool bar to the UI window .
One approach is to add an empty tool bar to the UI , then add each individual button to the bar .
This is bad because now you are mutating the UI program state for each button added , and if one tool bar button fails to be added , then the user gets a wacked - out , partially constructed bar .
You could put out an eye like that .
Not to mention each time you add a button , you may be kicking off all sorts of ripple mutations as layout managers do work , increasing the chances of something going haywire .
Instead , the better strategy is to build the tool bar in isolation .
Once the bar is completely constructed with all buttons , then add it to the UI in a single operation .
This way you minimize the mutation to the existing objects ( the top level window ) , instead we are only mutating our new object during its multi-step construction .
If we fail to construct it fully , we can just forget about it and let the garbage collection get it .
So you fully construct the bar and then add it to the window in one operation .
Unfortunately , adding the toolbar bar to the window may not truly be an atomic operation down deep , but from your perspective it is , since you can't make the mutation operation any smaller .
You may not have completely eliminated the chance of things going into a bad state , but you 've minimized it as far as you can .
Plus people will be totally impressed you 're using atomic powered code .
Use a Functional Language
Functional languages get immutability and state change right ( they 'd better , it 's a key attribute of functional programming ) .
Unfortunately , I do n't know of any functional language I 'd call popular .
I think it 's because they all have dumb names like LISP and Haskell .
Why pthat 's a lovely monad you 're wearing , Mrsh .
Cleather .
Erlang , which started me thinking about these issues , is a functional programming language that gets reliability right in a simple and elegant way that I think is fairly easy for an experienced OO programmer to pick up .
You do n't even have to learn about monads , but you damn sure need to understand recursion .
Erlang is dynamic and somewhat " scripty " , making the development process more incremental and approachable .
It also has a hideous syntax .
But Erlang is marvelously beautiful in the way it meshes the concepts of immutability , messaging , pattern matching , processes and process hierarchy to create a language and runtime where extreme concurrency and reliability means adhering to a few simple design principles .
The point
No , this article was n't really about error codes vs. exceptions .
Sorry but the truth is , there is no one best way to communicate error conditions .
" It depends " is the only honest answer .
Unfortunately the designers of APIs have to decide ahead of time how the callers will be signaled of errors , while the caller -- who knows best how the errors should be communicated and managed -- is n't given a choice .
The much bigger problem in software reliability is not how we communicate errors , it 's the state we are in when the error happens .
So often the errors are things we can't really do anything about , we can't force the network connection to work , or somehow create more disk space or memory if we run out .
But we can see to it that we do n't do the programmatic equivalent of half - destroying our house in the process of building a deck .
Attempts to " Reverse the Flow of Time " in code are bad .
Avoid mutations ( destructive updates ) and use " Get the Hell out of Dodge " error handling whenever possible .
