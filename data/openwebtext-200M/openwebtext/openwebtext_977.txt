* Militants say attack three Shell sites in Niger Delta
* Shell says investigating
* Military says attacks targeting isolated facilities
( Adds detail from militants on third strike , paragraph 3 )
By Nick Tattersall
LAGOS , June 21 ( Reuters ) - Nigeria 's main militant group said on Sunday it had attacked three oil installations belonging to Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L in the Niger Delta , widening a month - old offensive against Africa 's biggest energy industry .
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) said in an emailed statement it had attacked Shell pipelines at Adamakiri and Kula , both in Rivers state in the eastern Niger Delta , in the early hours of Sunday morning .
It said it had also attacked the Afremo offshore oilfields , which it believed were operated by Shell , and which it said were 14 miles ( 23 km ) from an export terminal through which crude oil from Shell ’s Forcados fields is pumped .
Shell said it was investigating reports of attacks against its installations at three locations and was carrying out fly - overs to try to assess any impact on output or the extent of any environmental damage from potential spillage .
A senior industry source said the third attack was not thought to have been on a deepwater installation , but on a facility located in or close to the mangrove creeks , where pipelines and equipment run across broad stretches of water .
The attacks are the first to strike Rivers state , the easternmost of the three main states in the Niger Delta , since the militants launched their latest campaign of sabotage following a military offensive in the western delta last month .
Persistent attacks by MEND over the past three years have cut oil output in the OPEC member , the world ’s eighth biggest crude oil exporter , to less than two thirds of its installed capacity of 3 million barrels per day ( bpd ) .
ISOLATED LOCATIONS
Industry and security experts say it is virtually impossible to prevent opportunistic attacks on hundreds of kilometres of pipeline and equipment in the remote mangrove creeks of the Niger Delta , one of the world ’s biggest wetlands .
“ The militants are going about attacking pipelines in isolated parts of the creeks where they know they will not encounter resistance , ” said Colonel Rabe Abubakar , spokesman for the joint military taskforce in the Niger Delta .
MEND first burst onto the scene in late 2005 , knocking out more than a quarter of Nigeria ’s oil output -- then around 2.4 million bpd -- in a matter of weeks .
But it has largely failed to carry out such spectacular attacks since then , although the latest campaign has nibbled further at production levels in a country that relies on oil for around 90 percent of its foreign earnings .
Agip ENI .MI said on Friday a pipeline attack in Bayelsa state had halted production of around 33,000 barrels of oil and 2 million cubic metres of gas per day .

Shell said on Thursday some oil production had been halted following an attack on the Trans Ramos pipeline late on Wednesday at Aghoro - 2 community in Bayelsa .

Chevron CVX.N shut down its operations around Delta state after MEND 's first attack in its latest campaign on May 24 , halting around 100,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) . [ ID :nLP693007 ]
MEND has dubbed its offensive “ Hurricane Piper Alpha ” after the North Sea oil platform that blew up in July 1998 and was the worst offshore oil disaster , and warned that it might attack deepwater facilities off the Nigerian coast .
Security sources say some oil firms have been removing non-essential personnel from some offshore sites .
MEND says it is fighting against the militarisation of the Niger Delta and for a fairer share of the wealth for local villagers .
But the leaders of armed gangs it works with have grown rich from a lucrative trade in stolen oil and from ransoms paid for hundreds of oil workers kidnapped in recent years .

So which one do you like the most ?
We would love to hear your favorites .
Maybe you would like to drop a comment if you like .
“ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ” and stuff
I do n’t care about the upcoming “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , ” which comes out one week from today .
I ’m a bit too old to have watched the original cartoons as a kid or played with the toys .
I literally walked out of the 2007 movie , which I had used a hard earned frequent movie - watcher free ticket too see .
Nevertheless , I know a lot of you liked “ Transformers ” and are looking forward to “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen . ”
So , instead of raining on your parade , I ’ll keep my personal critic hat mostly off and simply report that some of the early reviews are out already .
Variety ’s Jordan Mintzer has a fairly positive review up and , the word is , if you dug the first one , you ’ll probably dig this one .
THR ’s Ray Bennett says somewhat the same thing , but on the negative side ( and sounds a lot like what I said after I saw the first one ) .
IGN UK ’s Orlando Parfitt confesses to Michael Bay love , but thinks it may all just be a bit too much of a good thing .
And so it goes at Rotten Tomatoes .
Also , in the spirit of yesterday ’s post on celebrity oddness , via Anne Thompson comes that Parade interview with “ Transformers ” star Shia LaBeouf you might have seen excerpted .
Assuming he actually said everything he ’s supposed to have said , this was n’t a profile but a cry for help , which begs the question :
If Steven Spielberg and company can’t find the right shrinks / clinics to get a talented young actor ’s head on straight , who can ?
I suppose it ’s like the old joke asking about how many psychologists it takes to change a light bulb .
( Only one , but the light bulb really has to want to change . )
It ’s a little weird considering he ’s pretty much the hottest young actor in Hollywood , etc. , but I actually feel sorry for the kid .
That is not like me .
But forget all that , here ’s a “ Transformers ” trailer .
Stuff blows up good — but for some reason , not the Eiffel Tower .
DESPITE changing attitudes and even laws to promote equality between the sexes , it appears that women still have their work cut out .
Men enjoy more leisure time than women in every one of 18 countries examined by the OECD .
Italian men have it easiest in comparison with women , lazing around for nearly 80 minutes more each than women who , apparently , clean the house .
Other staunch Catholic countries also see big gaps between the sexes , and even in egalitarian Norway men manage to sneak an extra four minutes more to themselves .

In a reversal of its earlier stance , Microsoft officials confirmed that customers will be able to downgrade from Windows 7 to Windows XP for a year and a half after the new system ships , or until the first Service Pack drops — whichever comes first .
While some industry observers the modified downgrade policy is a change for the better , at least one analyst says Microsoft still has n’t enough to provide options for enterprises .
This industry observer says Microsoft simply has n’t a clue !
The downgrade option is also not available to all Windows 7 users : Downgrade rights apply to purchasers of Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate , so the option is n’t available to customers who buy Windows 7 Home Premium .
Additionally , customers who have either Software Assurance subscriptions or Enterprise Agreements with Microsoft can continue to get the downgrade as long as they want .
Confused , yet ?
“ Windows 7 Professional and Ultimate customers will have the option to downgrade to Windows XP Professional from PCs that ship within 18 months following the general availability of Windows 7 or until the release of a Windows 7 service pack ( SP ) , whichever is sooner and if an SP is developed , ” a Microsoft spokesperson told InternetNews.com in an e-mail .
Understand that , OK ?
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Maryland auto shop owner Brian England offers health care coverage to his 18 employees , including part - time staff .
He calls it " the right thing to do , " and besides , he knows taking care of his employees makes good business sense .
Brian England , president of British American Auto Care , catches up on paperwork at the office .
But every year his insurance premium costs rise another 10 or 20 percent , and England worries about the day when the fees will overwhelm him .
After payroll and rent , health care is his largest business expense .
" A business down the road could have their labor rate $ 5 cheaper than us because that 's how much it costs for us to provide health care , " England said , referring to the hourly rates his business and competitors might offer customers .
Of the 46 million Americans living without health care , an outsized majority -- about 60 percent -- work for small businesses , according to the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute .
Owners of those businesses say Congress needs to find a solution to an increasingly costly problem -- but they disagree about how to get it right .
For England , shopping for policies and finding a way to afford to offer the benefits has become a yearly headache .
" I'm in the business to do auto repair , " England said .
" I 'm not in the business of trying to find out how to provide health coverage and how to get the right sort of plan ....
And it 's not easy . "
David Guernsey , who employs 170 people at his office supply business in Virginia , has struggled with the same rising costs to cover his employees -- some years , premiums have gone up 25 percent .
His small company can't hope to compete with the benefits much larger companies can afford to offer their employees .
" Their premiums are dramatically lower than ours are , " Guernsey said .
" They have leverage over the health care industry to be able to drive their premiums down , and yet we have to be able to compete with those folks .
So it increasingly becomes a major competitive issue for us . "
Guernsey said that , occasionally , job seekers have complained that they 're looking for a plan with more extensive coverage than Guernsey 's provides , but he called the plan " pretty good , pretty competitive " and said no one has ever turned down a job offer in hopes of getting better benefits elsewhere .
Both Guernsey and England agree the problem of ballooning costs must be fixed , and they expect the government to take some role in addressing health care costs .
Watch business owners discuss the challenges they face
Guernsey is skeptical of too much government involvement , and worries a mandate for employers to offer coverage could push up his premiums .
" If the requirement were such that the kind of coverage we offer were dramatically different , dramatically more comprehensive , and the cost accordingly would go up significantly -- then that would be a problem , " he said .
Instead , he 's hoping small businesses can pool their coverage with larger businesses in order to drive down prices .
England , however , said he would like to see a government health care plan and an emphasis on preventative care .
He said a government plan would force insurance companies to offer competitive rates .
" I think once we get to doing that and everybody has insurance and we start to push it with the preventative care and community care , that 's going to drive down the prices , " England said .
Taking preventative steps is , after all , something he 's learned through his work .
" We 've preached preventative care to customers with cars for 31 years , " England said .
" So if we know it works with cars , we know it works with people , we all know that .
It 's just a matter of everybody getting onto the plan . "

The drug - fueled murders and mayhem in Mexico bring to mind the Prohibition - era killings in Chicago .
Although the Mexican violence dwarfs the bloodshed of the old bootleggers , both share a common motivation : profits .
These are turf wars , fought between rival gangs trying to increase their share of the market for illegal drugs .
Seventy - five years ago , we sensibly quelled the bootleggers ' violence by repealing the prohibition of alcohol .
The only long - term solution to the cartel - related murders in Mexico is to legalize the other illegal drugs we overlooked when we repealed Prohibition in 1933 .
In 2000 , the Mexican government disturbed a hornets ' nest when it began arresting and prosecuting major distributors of marijuana , cocaine , heroin and amphetamines .
Previously , the cartels had relied largely on bribery and corruption to maintain their peaceful co-existence with the Mexican government .
Once this pax Mexicana ended , however , they began to fight not only the government but among themselves .
The ensuing violence has claimed the lives of at least 10,000 in Mexico since 2005 , and the carnage has even spilled north to the United States and south to Central and South America .
Some say that this killing spree -- about 400 murders a month currently -- threatens the survival of the Mexican government .
Whether or not that is the exaggeration that Mexican President Felipe Calderón insists it is , Mexico is in crisis .
The Mexicans have asked the Obama administration for help , and the president has obliged , offering material support and praising the integrity and courage of the Mexican government in taking on the cartels .
The U.S. should enforce its laws against murder and other atrocious crimes and we should cooperate with Mexican authorities in helping them arrest and prosecute drug traffickers hiding out here .
But what more can and should we do ?
Is gun control the answer ?
President Calderón asserts that the cartels get most of their guns from the U.S.
We could virtually disarm the cartels , he implies , if we made it harder to buy guns here and smuggle them into Mexico .
President Obama has bought into this claim and has made noises about reducing the availability of guns .
However , even if the Obama administration were able to circumvent the political and constitutional impediments to restricting Americans ' access to handguns , the effect on Mexican drug violence would be negligible .
The cartels are heavily armed now , and handguns wear out very slowly .
In the future , will wind power tapped by high - flying kites light up New York ?
A new study by scientists at the Carnegie Institution and California State University identifies New York as a prime location for exploiting high - altitude winds , which globally contain enough energy to meet world demand 100 times over .
The researchers found that the regions best suited for harvesting this energy match with population centers in the eastern U.S. and East Asia , but fluctuating wind strength still presents a challenge for exploiting this energy source on a large scale .
Using 28 years of data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the Department of Energy , Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Global Ecology and Cristina Archer of California State University , Chico , compiled the first - ever global survey of wind energy available at high altitudes in the atmosphere .
The researchers assessed potential for wind power in terms of " wind power density , " which takes into account both wind speed and air density at different altitudes .
" There is a huge amount of energy available in high altitude winds , " said coauthor Ken Caldeira .
" These winds blow much more strongly and steadily than near - surface winds , but you need to go get up miles to get a big advantage .
Ideally , you would like to be up near the jet streams , around 30,000 feet . "
Jet streams are meandering belts of fast winds at altitudes between 20 and 50,000 feet that shift seasonally , but otherwise are persistent features in the atmosphere .
Jet stream winds are generally steadier and 10 times faster than winds near the ground , making them a potentially vast and dependable source of energy .
Several technological schemes have been proposed to harvest this energy , including tethered , kite - like wind turbines that would be lofted to the altitude of the jet streams .
Up to 40 megawatts of electricity could be generated by current designs and transmitted to the ground via the tether .
" We found the highest wind power densities over Japan and eastern China , the eastern coast of the United States , southern Australia , and north - eastern Africa , " said lead author Archer .
" The median values in these areas are greater than 10 kilowatts per square meter .
This is unthinkable near the ground , where even the best locations have usually less than one kilowatt per square meter . "
Included in the analysis were assessments of high altitude wind energy for the world 's five largest cities : Tokyo , New York , Sao Paulo , Seoul , and Mexico City .
" For cities that are affected by polar jet streams such as Tokyo , Seoul , and New York , the high - altitude resource is phenomenal , " said Archer .
" New York , which has the highest average high - altitude wind power density of any U.S. city , has an average wind power density of up to 16 kilowatts per square meter . "
Tokyo and Seoul also have high wind power density because they are both affected by the East Asian jet stream .
Mexico City and Sao Paulo are located at tropical latitudes , so they are rarely affected by the polar jet streams and just occasionally by the weaker sub - tropical jets .
As a result they have lower wind power densities than the other three cities .
" While there is enough power in these high altitude winds to power all of modern civilization , at any specific location there are still times when the winds do not blow , " said Caldeira .
Even over the best areas , the wind can be expected to fail about five percent of the time .
" This means that you either need back - up power , massive amounts of energy storage , or a continental or even global scale electricity grid to assure power availability .
So , while high - altitude wind may ultimately prove to be a major energy source , it requires substantial infrastructure . "
Here are my problems with the last episode of “ Harper ’s Island ” …
First things first , if you have n’t watched the most recent episode ( “ Splash ” ) then you might want to skip to the next post , because there are major spoilers ahead .
I ’ll go ahead and insert a jump here so that anyone who proceeds does so willingly .
I have n’t written about this show since I criticized the premiere , but I came back for the second episode , then the third , and the fourth … well , you get the idea .
The first few episodes were a little rough , but as the actors settled into their roles and the plot moved forward — really , it seemed like it took forever for the characters to realize that they were actually in danger — the show started to get addictive .
Since it ’s a one - off that is definitely going to have closure , somewhere around the halfway point , I knew I was sticking around just to see how this sucker ended .
Enter episode 1.11 , a.k.a. “ Splash , ” a.k.a .
“ The One Where Everyone Acts Like an Idiot ” … John Wakefield is our killer , even though he ’s supposed to be dead , and we really do n’t have any idea how he survived .
He ’s running around the island , killing everyone in sight , and it ’s all because of Abby .
Why ?
We do n’t know , and I ’m not too optimistic that we ’ll ever find out .
There was an opportunity to get a few answers at the beginning of the episode ( after John killed her dad ) , but chance to get some insight into the mind of a serial killer was wasted .
So John attacks the bar , and for some unknown reason , the bartender has to go behind the bar to retrieve the shotgun .
Maybe it ’s just me , but if I ’m holed up in a bar because there ’s a killer on the loose , and there ’s a gun nearby , I ’m damn well going to have it somewhere where it ’s a little more handy .
The bartender could have retrieved the gun and backed up a few steps ( taking advantage of the fact that she had a shotgun and he had a long knife ) , but she dumbly swung the barrel around so that John could grab it , stab her , and pull the gun away from her .
Mind you , there are three other adults in the room and at any time they could have called a blitz and probably would have had a good shot at overpowering him .
Instead , the bride , her sister and the kid run into the other room while Shane decides to stay and get into a knife fight with a serial killer .
So as the kid escapes through the bathroom window , the bride has a shotgun trained on the door .
Where did she get the gun ?
I do n’t know .
Maybe it ’s the same one that the bartender pulled from behind the bar , maybe it ’s a spare , but why in the hell is n’t she out in the bar helping Shane ?
John kills Shane ( sort of ) and then goes to the bathroom .
The bride wastes a round on the bathroom door and apparently runs out of ammo .
John stands at the door menacingly .
And then here ’s the kicker —
Shane , who ’s still alive , says “ hey ” to get John ’s attention instead of just coming up from behind and trying to stab him .
John kills
Shane again .
Later on , in the woods , John appears out of nowhere and stands there as a perfect target .
Abby fires a shot .
Miss , of course .
John runs off .
Abby and the groom start after him , but they let him get away when they start arguing about whether or not it ’s okay to take a shot if the other person is in the way .
At the start of the show , Abby could have had a shot at John who had just fled the scene , but the groom stopped her .
I ’m starting to think the groom is in on it .
Either that , or he prefers there to be a serial killer on the loose .
In another part of the woods , Cal has just retrieved Chloe ( whom John kidnapped but elected not to kill , with no explanation , of course ) and when John reveals himself again , Cal fires off a horrible shot into the dirt before leading Chloe across the bridge that he knows is blocked .
It ’s not entirely blocked , mind you .
Someone — actually , two people — could scoot around the side if they did n’t waste time arguing about who gets left behind .
But that ’s exactly what Cal and Chloe do…argue .
Cal , who ’s no bigger than a hobbit , tries to go hand - to - hand with a serial killer and is unsurprisingly killed , and instead of scooting around the side in an attempt to stay alive and live the life that Cal would want her to live , Chloe hurls herself off the bridge so that John ca n’t have her .
Was anyone else incredibly frustrated by this episode ?
I thought the previous five or six were pretty good — reasonably tight , well crafted , logical — but this one went off the rails .
It was intense , but there was seemingly no attention to detail .
What ’s sad is that it was completely avoidable .
Maybe there ’s an ammo ( or a gun ) shortage because the killer snuck in and stole it .
Maybe Chloe takes off across the bridge and ignores Cal ’s calls that it ’s blocked .
Maybe there is n’t enough room to scoot across , and when Chloe realizes that , then she jumps .
Maybe someone actually shoots the killer but he ’s wearing a bulletproof vest .
Two episodes left — I hope the series recovers and finishes strong .
Over the past 5 years , I have appeared on various Financial TV shows over a 100 times .
But I am also a huge consumer of financial news , in print , on the web , radio , and of course , TV .
Being on both sides of the camera gives me a fairly good perspective on what does and does n’t work on TV .
I also have some strong ideas as to what is good and bad TV in terms of providing a social utility , being part of the democratic process , etc .
Indeed , this is a longstanding interest of mine .
Over the weekend , I referenced the current Columbia Journalism Review ( CJR ) issue that focused on the role of the media in the credit crisis , stock market and economic collapse ( CJR on CNBC , WSJ & Business Press ) .
This area has long interested me ( hence , our media panel at TBP conference ) .
But I was surprised this post generated 100 comments from readers .
One emailer challenged me on CJR ’s CNBC piece : “ Its easy to complain , but what would you do to “ fix ” Financial Television ? ”
Challenge accepted .
Here are my general suggestions as to how to “ fix ” what needs repair on not just CNBC , but all FinTV .
>
How to Fix Financial Television
1. Stop Yelling .
Stop interrupting .
Stop Talking Over Each Other :
This is not Jerry Springer , its serious business .
People ’s investments and retirement are at stake .
Please treat it that way .
2. Bring us People We Do n’t Have Access to .
What various FinTV channels do really well is bring us long , thoughtful interviews with the likes of Warren Buffett , WIlliam Ackman , David Einhorn , and others .
People we would n’t ordinarily have access to .
Example : This morning , CNBC had on James Rickard .
More of this please .
3. S – L – O – W D – O – W – N
4. Risk :
All traders must appreciate the potential downside of trades .
So too , must FinTV .
Explain stop losses .
Understand Risk / Reward .
Recognize there are periods when Buy & Hold is a jumbo loser .
5 . Lose the Octobox .
Fire whoever came up with the Decabox .
‘ Nuff said .
6. Separate the Signal from the Noise .
Understand that most of the day - to - day action is simply noise .
If you look at a long term chart , you will barely be able to see 1987 or 9/11 .
If those major events get lost in the long term trend , what does the intraday jags , kinks and reversals mean ?
Very little .
Recognize that not every data release , slice of news , or rumor is at all significant .
Stop treating them as if they were .
7. Fact Check :
An awful lot of things on air get stated with authority and confidence .
Much of what is stated is little more than junk or pop myths .
Why is it that the more dubious a proposition is , the greater the confidence the speaker seems to muster ?
Right or wrong , never in doubt .
Consider fact checking as much of the statements that are made on air as possible , and making frequent corrections .
8. Accountability is important : I am astounded at some of the money losing hacks that are various shows again and again .
These are the “ articulate incompetants ” to use Bennett Goodspeed ’s phrase .
Why not keep track of the records of guests — and let the viewers know how their past few calls have been .
Are they Perma - bulls or bears ?
Are their stock picks good , bad or awful ?
Are they reliable money makers ?
If not , let us know .
( Of course , the better question is :
If they are not moneymakers , why even have them on ? )
9. Bring Back Louis Rukeyser :
Not the man , but rather , his style .
Wall $ treet Week —
Rukeyser hosted it from 1970 to 2005 — was plain - spoken , thoughtful and accessible .
Quiet , contemplative , discussions , with intelligent market participants , revealing helpful information .
The investing public would appreciate something of that sort — again .
10 . Sound FX :
What is with all the bizarre sound effects every time a screen changes ?
Its financial news , not a video game .
Kill ’em .
11 . Embed your video ( on your own website or YouTube ) instead of using WMP .
At long last , thank you .
12 . Investigative Pieces : David Faber seems to have a monopoly on deep , long thoughtful analyses .
Be they on Wal - Mart , the credit crisis , whatever , his long format work is a highlight of CNBC .
More of these , please .
13 . Most stock picks are losers .
That ’s normal , but the audience does not realize this .
A big part of the challenge is informing the viewer that finding big winners is a low probability , high outcome , event .
As in a baseball , a 350 hitter is a star .
Explain this to your audience .
14 . Stop the Bull / Bear Debate :
This is a vast over - simplification of the market , and often does not serve the audience well .
There are nuances and variables that get lost when you reduce everything to black and white .
15 . Partisanship : Leave your personal politics at home .
Viewers do n’t care what most of you think .
16 . Respect the Audience : We are adults .
Treat us that way .

Murdoch ’s WSJ Changes Creates Opening for NYT , FT ( April 24 , 2008 )
http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2008/04/murdochs-wsj-changes-creates-opening-for-nyt-ft/
While visiting an ill relative in Princess Margaret Hospital , Bill Marangos walked by the nurse 's station and took a deep drag on his cigarette , exhaling white curlicues – the cancer hospital equivalent of discharging a gun in a police station .
" A nurse nearly tackled me , " says Marangos , who , before security was summoned , quickly explained it was an electronic cigarette , no tobacco , no smoke .
Still ready to pounce , the nurses watched as he blew what looked like smoke , but was actually vapour , straight into a smoke detector .
" A couple of nurses covered their heads , sure that the sprinklers would spray , " says Marangos .
" Some came up to me asking where they could get these cigarettes . "
From him .
Marangos is president of SmokeStik , one of the many brands of battery - powered cigarettes being made in China and gaining popularity globally through sales online and in corner stores .
And through celebrity boosts : Photos of Leonardo DiCaprio with an electronic cigarette stuck in his lips are plastered on pop culture websites and baseball star Jose Canseco is reported to be a pitchman for a distributor .
Usually a slim white cylinder with a beige mouthpiece to mimic the look of the real thing , these pseudo cigarettes contain liquid nicotine that is heated and vaporized when a user inhales .
It 's a safer way to get a nicotine fix without the tar and carcinogens , say the sellers .
" It 's like smoking with a condom on , " says William Taskas , Canadian distributor for SmokeStik .
An orange light glows at the tip , resembling a burning ember .
But these faux smokes are also sparking controversy as governments grapple with how or whether to regulate them , and anti-smoking activists either dismiss them as untested gimmicks to keep people hooked or see them as a way to reduce harm .
" The problem with cigarettes is not the nicotine , not even the tobacco ; it 's the smoke , the delivery system , " says David Sweanor , former legal counsel of the Non Smokers ' Rights Association of Canada .
" Much of what we 've done has been prohibitionist in approach .
Are we simply trying to reduce consumption or are we also trying to reduce the overall risk ? "
Response to these faux smokes has been literally all over the map .
Australia banned the sale of electronic cigarettes with nicotine , but smokers in Britain can buy them in some pubs and puff with a pint .
Health Canada determined last month that they fall under the Food and Drugs Act , which means a company must submit evidence of safety and effectiveness in order to market them .
Health Canada is taking steps to inform importers of the regulations , according to a government spokesperson .
That 's news to Marangos , who has been selling them since July .
A starter kit with rechargeable batteries , charger and five cartridges sells for about $ 110 .
" We 'd love them to clear the air .
It wo n't be a problem for us . "
But without that government stamp of approval , many researchers say steer clear .
" There 's no scientific data on how they work , if there are interactions with anything else , " says Kelli-an Lawrance , a tobacco control researcher at Brock University .
" I can't imagine companies want people to use them to quit .
They 're capitalizing on the fact that people will keep smoking . "
While the nicotine cartridges for the cigarettes come in different strengths – high , medium , low and no nicotine – tobacco researchers worry consumers can't be sure what strength they get .
For those who want to quit , safe and proven methods , such as the patch , gum and inhaler , are already on the market , says Lawrance .
None of those worked for Marlene Sen .
" I could n't get past day three .
I enjoyed smoking too much , the habit , the ritual , " says Sen , a smoker for 30 years .
She also used nicotine as a way to calm down , cope with stress , especially as the stay - home mother of two young children .
Feeling trapped , she had resigned herself to a possible early death from lung cancer .
Then she saw a friend 's posting on Facebook about electronic cigarettes , and she ordered some from the Internet .
" It 's five weeks today I have n't had a real cigarette , " Sen says , adding she has n't been miserable and angry as with other attempts to quit .
She hopes to taper off until she 's using the nicotine - free cartridges .
" I 'm proud of this .
It 's a positive change in my life . "

Since the electronic cigarettes do n't contain tobacco , they are not prohibited under anti-smoking laws .
Sen has smoked them in malls and movie theatres , and no one has questioned her .
One downside , though , is she is more likely to puff where her kids can see her .
" That 's not good , " says Sen , who plans not to smoke even a fake cigarette in front of her kids .
Researchers worry that the electronic variety could become a gateway to the real type .
" Why do they need to look like and act so much like a cigarette ? " asks Michael Perley , director of the Ontario Campaign for Action on Tobacco .
Some brands come with a variety of flavoured nicotine , such as tobacco , mint , vanilla or fruit .
" That 's to appeal to children , " says Roberta Ferrence , executive director of the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit .
Nicotine , while not as risky as the smoke in cigarettes , is highly addictive .
Despite the fears , some longtime anti-smoking activists see electronic cigarettes as relatively safe .
Independent researcher Murray Laugesen , formerly a medical officer with the New Zealand government who has worked to reduce smoking since 1984 , tested the first electronic cigarette , the Ruyan V8 marketed in China in 2004 .
" So far , no cause of serious concern has been found , " writes Laugesen in an email .
His safety tests were funded by Ruyan .
The exhaled mist contains almost no nicotine , he writes .
It consists of propylene glycol , commonly used as stage fog .
No tests have been conducted to prove that the smokeless cigarettes increase chances of quitting , says Laugesen .
" Safe does n't exist , " says Sweanor .
" But electronic cigarettes are low risk compared to regular cigarettes .
It 's the equivalent of having a four - wheel - drive Volvo compared to a high - powered motorcycle with bald tires in an ice storm . "

The RAC Foundation insists it is not against rail travel
The government is wrongly prioritising investment in rail over roads , despite 92 % of all passenger journeys in the UK being made by car , the RAC has said .
According to the motoring body , " the road network is the true provider of public transport " .
It said focusing on roads , not rail , would bring much higher rates of return for every £ 1 of public money spent .
The Department for Transport ( DfT ) said value for money was " always central to any funding decisions " .
More than £ 5bn of public money was invested in rail in 2006 / 07 compared with £ 4.8 bn on roads .
Some £ 15 bn has been earmarked for rail over the next five years , compared with £ 6bn to improve the strategic road network in England .
' Not against rail '
The DfT 's public service agreement requires it to prioritise spending in order to get the highest rate of return for every £ 1 of public money spent .
The RAC Foundation said it wanted to know " why this clear procedure is being ignored by ministers " .
It quoted figures from the 2006 government - commissioned Eddington Transport Study , which showed the average benefit - cost ratios ( BCR ) for transport schemes .
The foundation is not against rail travel , yet the figures are clear
Prof Stephen Glaister , RAC Highways Agency roads had a much higher BCR of 4.66 , compared with 2.83 for heavy rail schemes and 2.14 for light rail schemes .
The RAC said that of 35 rail expansion schemes suggested last week by the Association of Train Operating Companies , just two had a BCR above 2.0 .
Foundation director Prof Stephen Glaister said : " The foundation is not against rail travel , yet the figures are clear .
" Most people use the roads to get about and road schemes tend to offer the best value for money .
The road network is the true provider of public transport .
" When government funds are in such short supply , surely ministers are duty bound to abide by the Treasury 's own rules and extract the maximum value for money from every £ 1 they collect from hard - pressed taxpayers ? "
A DfT spokesman said : " Value for money for the taxpayer is always central to any road or rail funding decisions the government makes .
" The investment the government has made to date in rail is reflected by increased passenger volumes of 40 % over the last decade .
" But we also recognise the importance of roads and are committed to tackling congestion and providing a safe , reliable and sustainable road network for the 21st Century . "

Roman Ormandy has sent a letter out to customers of trueSpace and Caligari , telling the sad story that they ’ve finally been forced to close the doors .
You may have heard that Microsoft Corporation , reacting to difficult business conditions , has been evaluating many of the products it produces and making the difficult decision to reduce investment in certain areas .
It is with regret that I have to tell you that trueSpace is one of the products affected .
As a consequence , you will see reduction or elimination of services offered for trueSpace .
For example , there will be no phone or email support offered for trueSpace by Microsoft , and our web site may also be affected .
While the dates are not absolutely fixed , some services and contacts may come to an end as early as Friday May 22nd 2009 , while others will continue as long as possible with no firm cutoff date available yet .
The rest of the letter goes on to state that people need to go ahead and download the software while they can , and use the company forums to share information on any other community websites that they might move to .

Three years after it was first proposed , preparations for an African ' wall of trees ' to slow down the southwards spread of the Sahara desert are finally getting underway .
The ' Great Green Wall ' will involve several stretches of trees from Mauritania in the west to Djibouti in the east , to protect the semi-arid savannah region of the Sahel â€ ” and its agricultural land â€ ” from desertification .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
A plan for the proposed US $ 3 million , two - year initial phase of the project â€ ” involving a belt of trees 7,000 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide â€ ” was formally adopted at the Community of Sahelâ € “ Saharan States ( Cen - Sad ) summit on rural development and food security in Cotonou , Benin , last month ( 17â € “ 18 June ) .
North African nations have been promoting the idea of a Green Belt since 2005 ( see African nations agree to boost desert research ) .
The project has been scaled down to reinforce and then expand on existing efforts , and will not be a continent - wide wall of trees , despite the name of the project .
The Green Wall will involve two planting projects on the east and west sides of Africa .
The Inter - State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel region ( CILSS ) is working with scientific consultants and representatives from the arid nations of Burkina Faso , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria and Senegal to launch pilot planting projects planned for September .
Another planting programme , including Chad , Djibouti , Eritrea , Ethiopia and Sudan , should be finalised within two months under the auspices of six states in the Horn of Africa , linked through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) .
Mariam Aladji Boni Diallo , the Benin - based president of the Cen - Sad summit organising committee , says she hopes the Green Wall will consist of more than just trees .
Diallo told SciDev .
Net that " reforestation , restoration of natural resources and the eventual development of fishing and livestock breeding " were priorities for the project .
However , she said that funding for the project was still tentative .
The UNESCO - linked non-profit Observatory of the Sahara and the Sahel has prepared a report on the project , saying the labour - intensive project should be used to create employment but advising that payments be partly withheld for two years until the trees were established , and that payment be based on plant growth .
The project will be monitored from Tripoli by Cen - Sad , and Senegal will provide ' close technical cooperation ' because of its success in fighting desertification .
JosÃ©a Dossou BodjrÃ¨nou , head of the Nature Tropicale environmental education organisation at the Museum of Natural Science in Benin , warned that the project can only be assessed once it stops being words on paper and becomes action .
" The population needs to be sensitised to the importance of planting trees and taking care of them .
Otherwise , they would destroy them without knowing it 's dangerous for the ecosystem .
All this work would lead to nothing , " BodjrÃ¨nou , told SciDev .
Net .
" It 's really important for the work to be done with local experts in each country because they know which species can grow on their soil .
And we have to use local species , not imported ones . "

The Guardian has published a heart - breaking letter by Susan Smith , the pseudonym on an anonymous reader who has spent her entire life with apotemnophilia , more properly known as Body Identity Integrity Disorder .
Susan believes that the only way she can ever be happy in life is to have both of her legs amputated :
To the general public , people like me are sick and strange , and that 's where it ends .
I think it is a question of fearing the unknown .
I have something called body identity integrity disorder ( BIID ) , where sufferers want to remove one or more healthy limbs .
Few people who have n't experienced it themselves can understand what I am going through .
It is not a sexual thing , it is certainly not a fetish , and it is nothing to do with appearances .
I simply cannot relate to myself with two legs : it is n't the " me " I want to be .
I have long known that if I want to get on with my life I need to remove both legs .
I have been trapped in the wrong body all this time and over the years I came to hate my physical self .
After three unsuccessful tries , Susan managed to kill her leg by freezing it until it had to be amputated by a doctor .
The freezing required her to pack it in dry ice for six hours , which Susan had to face alone , in agony .
As soon as the leg was amputated , she felt happier than she ever had in her life , and vowed she 'll do away with the other leg as soon as she can .
Because it is illegal to help someone cut off a healthy leg , she will have to have her remaining leg amputated in a similar .
This eponymously imposes on Bodyhack 's territory but I could n't resist commenting on this .
I find this story extremely moving , not simply due to the strange nature of apotemnophilia , or my familiarity with the subculture of BIID on the Internet , but because Susan 's story is the first account of the disorder I 've read where it all became understandable to me , not as a mere psychosis or a fetish , but as a very human desire to be a better person .
I think many of us understand the dream of somehow managing to become our ideal selves : much of my youth was spent attempting to become the ineffable person I was within – someone not perfect , but focused , with the rough edges of my own very real insecurities and grosser faults hewn away and polished .
In my life , I spent a great deal of my youth trying to become this ideal inner person , who represented my potential for kindness , intelligence , wit , and love .
But something has always been lost in translation between what I felt and how I acted .
My point is simple : I think many people understand the idea that the ideal person they can be is stuck in the amber of the person they are .
What Susan 's letter allowed me to see was that the person I have wanted to be in my life is in many ways as inscrutable as the amputee that she wants to be .
Ultimately , the difference between someone like Susan and any other seemingly ' normal ' person is physical .
Hacking away at ourselves is the defining quality of the introspective : what makes the apotemnophile is simply in how and what they hack .

It is exceedingly difficult to convey exactly how much we are spending on all these bailouts .
Whenever I start talking trillions ( versus mere billions ) , I get puzzled looks from people .
Humans have a hard time conceptualizing any number that large .
I wanted a graphic way to clearly show how astonishingly ginormous the amounts involved were .
So I once again went to Jess Bachman at Wallstats .
I gave him my list of expenditures ( inflation adjusted of course ! ) and he went to work .
This early Bailout Nation graphic shows the the total costs to the taxpayer of all the monies spent , lent , consumed , borrowed , printed , guaranteed , assumed or otherwise committed .
It is nothing short of astonishing .
It includes the total outlay for all the bailouts to date .
In just about one short year ( March 2008 – March 2009 ) , the bailouts managed to spend far in excess of nearly every major one time expenditure of the USA , including WW1&2 ( omitted from graphic ) , the moon shot , the New Deal , total NASA budgets ( omitted from graphic ) , Iraq , Viet Nam and Korean wars — COMBINED .
206 years versus 12 months .
Total cost : ~$ 15 trillion and counting . . .

Note :
This was finished too late to make it into the hard cover edition of Bailout Nation , but it will be in next year ’s paperback , and whenever the Kindle version finally shows up .

Why Did Chinese Officials Paint a Mountain Green ?
Officials in Fumin County , which is located in southwest China ’s Yunnan Province , have decided to paint an entire barren countryside green .
While it seems likely that everyone involved in the decision had at least “ one too many ” cocktails , villagers are scratching their heads and wondering why anyone would spend money to do this .
For villagers in southwestern China the new green painted mountain , which cost the government some 400,000 yuan ( $ 51,000 ) , is a weird conundrum , but it does have an explanation .
Laoshou Mountain was quarried for more than two decades but has been recently shut down following complaints about dust and noise from villagers .
Last summer when government workers began spraying the mountain , which is an entirely barren countryside , green .
Villagers were perplexed as no one was told why the local forestry bureau was trying to simulate planted trees .
indeed , would n’t it make more sense to use the money to plant real trees instead ?
A few villagers suggested that those village officials whose offices faced the mountain were doing this in an attempt to alter the region ’s feng shui , the ancient Chinese belief of harmonizing one ’s physical environment for maximum health and financial benefit .
The only problem with this is that feng shui needs to be a genuine arrangement , and fake green trees wo n’t cut it because Mother Nature knows the truth .
It appears no explanation is being given , so all we can do is guess at what their true intentions were .

It 's hard to imagine a better Father 's Day gift for dad than preserving family memories with a cool new gadget .
A new high definition video camera is the perfect complement to the HDTV and Blu-ray player that mysteriously showed up in the living room last year .
This year 's digital camcorders offer ultimate portability , full high definition recording ( 1080 p ) , face tracking , and automatic smile detection .
Choosing the best camcorder can be difficult , and June 21st is just around the corner , so to simplify your decision here are 5 of the best camcorders for dads .

The Flip uses AA batteries and has built - in memory , which can record two hours of 720 p high definition video .
According to TheCamcorderReview.com , " the Flip Ultra HD is the easiest and simplest camcorder that you can lay your hands up on " .
It is so easy to use that young kids can help dad make videos .
To share videos , the Flip can be plugged directly into the computer via the spring - loaded USB adapter .
With a few clicks videos can be uploaded to YouTube and shared with the extended family .
While the quality of the video and recording capacity is not as good as the bigger camcorders ; the price , size and convenience of this camcorder make the Flip Video Ultra HD a great gift for dad .
Sanyo Xacti VPC-FH1 HD 1080 p Flash Memory Camcorder ( $ 449 - $ 499 )
The Sanyo VPC - FH1 is a great way to get dad a ton of features and a good quality high definition camcorder without spending a ton of cash .

It comes with a 16 - GB SDHC memory card which should be enough recording time to get started .
This is a great entry level HD camcorder which dad will love .
Canon VIXIA HF 200 ( $ 599 - $ 799 )
The Canon VIXIA HF200 HD Flash Memory Camcorder is a light weight and compact Flash Memory camcorder with a 15 x Optical Zoom that can easily zoom across a soccer field .
Canon 's advanced optical image stabilization eliminates most of the camera shake , so it does n't look like dad was filming during an earthquake .
The HF200 uses the highest AVCHD recording quality possible at 24 Mbs .
An on camera HDMI port allows dad to showcase his video on the family HDTV by just connecting an HDMI cable and using the on camera playback controls .
Recording directly onto SDHC memory cards allows dad to keep recording by inserting another memory card once the first memory card is full , which is an advantage of flash camcorders compared to hard disk camcorders .
The face detection feature automatically makes sure that the whole family is in focus , so dad can more time recording than fiddling with the settings .
The Canon VIXIA HF200 is for the dad who wants high quality video and advanced features in an easy to use and affordable package .

In addition to the basic face tracking features of other camcorders , the Sony HDR - CX12 adds a smile detection feature that actually snaps photographs when the subject smiles , even while recording video .
Instead of an inaccurate battery meter found in most camcorders , the HDR - CX12 tells dad exactly how many minutes of battery time he has left to record , saving him the frustration of running out of juice at the wrong time .
Sony does use a proprietary memory card , so if dad does n't already own other Sony products , he might have to buy some extra memory cards or a portable video storage device .
Overall , this is a camcorder packed with advanced features , has good build quality , and should be the first choice for dads who already have other Sony products .
Canon VIXIA HV40 HD HDV Camcorder ( $ 999 - $ 1099 )
The HV40 is Canon 's latest HDV ( high definition tape ) camcorder in a series of well regarded DV camcorders .

When this is used with the CINE setting dad can achieve a film - like color tonal qualities , making a dance recital look like it was shot by a cinematographer .
Canon decided to use a CMOS sensor in this camcorder which provides better low light recording than CCD camcorders .
Dads with an existing investment in video editing software will appreciate that HDV & MiniDV camcorders , like the HV40 , are more likely to be compatible with his existing software .
Video from the HV40 also requires a less powerful computer to edit than the AVCHD camcorders , which might save dad from having to upgrade his computer to edit HD video .
HDV camcorders are larger compared to flash camcorders and the HV40 is no exception .
The Canon VIXIA HV40 was released just in time for Father 's day , and could be hard to find because it 's so new .

Gordon Brown is facing an escalating ­crisis of confidence inside the parliamentary Labour party as record numbers of his MPs apply to sit in the House of Lords after the next general election .
In the clearest indication to date that increasing numbers of Labour figures believe the party is heading for a heavy defeat at the hands of David Cameron , the Guardian has learned that at least 52 MPs have formally approached Downing Street to be given places in the upper house .
The MPs include current chairs of select committees as well as past and serving middle and junior ranking ­ministers , according to Labour sources .
They account for a seventh of those elected at the last election .
The move by the Labour MPs comes as Brown faces the most perilous week of his premiership .
Ed Balls , the schools secretary , said yesterday Labour would perform badly in the European and local elections next Thursday .
" In European and local elections , [ held ] before a general election the governing parties tend not to do so well , " Balls said at an election briefing .
" That is going to happen to us .
Of course it is .
That is what happened in 2004 . "
Others were more blunt .
" We are doomed , " one senior Labour figure told the Guardian .
" We 're all doing our bit in the elections but it is over for Labour . "
Another Labour figure said the keen interest in the Lords shown by the party 's MPs highlighted how disconnected senior figures are from the prime minister .
" They should look at how many peers Gordon has created – he is no fan of the upper house , " one former minister said .
Brown is expected to try to assert his authority soon after the elections with a cabinet reshuffle .
It was the reshuffle last October , in which Peter Mandelson returned to the cabinet , which shored up Brown 's ­position after ministers had been in semi-open revolt over the summer .
But there is already speculation in Labour circles about whether Brown will face a leadership challenge if Labour ­performs badly next week .
Alan Johnson , the health secretary , has attracted ­attention after he devoted the last bank holiday weekend to publishing an article calling for electoral reform .
But some of the prime minister 's strongest opponents at senior levels of the party are sceptical of a cabinet - led challenge .
There is a feeling that the cabinet had a chance last summer to move against Brown but David Miliband , the foreign secretary , blew his chances with a few poorly chosen interventions .
Hazel Blears , the communities ­secretary , seen as the most likely cabinet minister to resign in exasperation at the prime minister 's performance , has been damaged after she failed to pay capital gains tax on the sale of a London flat .
She has since paid back the amount .
One senior figure said there was a ­feeling of resignation that Brown would lead the party into the next election .
" This is the third time we have seen the movie , " said a figure who agitated for a challenge last year .
" The expenses row may actually help the prime minister .
He will be able to say these are exceptional circumstances and that every party has been hit . "
Polls indicate that the UK ­Independence party , which was thought to have reached the high water mark of its success in 2004 , will be the main beneficiary of protest votes next Thursday .
This would hit the Tories and the Liberal Democrats .
Balls gave an indication of the line that Brown is expected to use in the aftermath of the elections .
" The polling we are seeing [ shows ] that in these elections [ the expenses row ] is going to impact on mainstream parties because it is probably going to persuade [ voters ] to stay at home , " he said .
" That will be a judgment on the whole political system rather than simply the government . "
Balls , who will be one of Labour 's main strategists for the general election , ­underlined one of the main frustrations felt by the prime minister : that Labour still occupies the right central ground territory to win the election – he believes Brown would preserve vital public services while Cameron would impose swingeing cuts – but it is difficult to frame a debate on ­substance in the current climate .
" If you have a serious discussion with a voter about the choices between the two parties , which takes more than five or 10 minutes , then actually people are very concerned about what the Conservatives say on the economy and on public ­services , " Balls said .
" I do n't think we are losing the debate on policy .
Our challenge is to have the debate on policy .
I was out on the doorstep in my ­constituency .
There is a great deal of ­concern about the expenses .
But people want to know about some of the wider issues around public spending , the economy and Europe . "
Balls underlined the worries over the impact of the expenses row by saying it could take 10 years to restore public trust in politics .
" It will take us not just months , it will be a very big task for this parliament and through the whole of the next one , " he said .
The disclosure that 52 Labour MPs are looking to life in the Lords shows many figures believe Labour will struggle to fashion the debate in the way described by Balls .

A bylaw aimed at cleaning up the community in Sylvan Lake passed third reading Monday night and is now in effect .
The public drunkenness , vandalism and other kinds of obnoxious behaviour is what is fueling the new bylaw , with a strong emphasis targeting swearing , spitting and fighting .
A town councillor told CTV News that in one night , Sylvan Lake can go from a population of 11,000 to 50,000 and that 's when the party starts and things get loud and rowdy .
The RCMP said a lack of hotel rooms in town is part of the problem .
With some people not having a place to stay after a long night of partying , a holding cell is sometimes a probable option .
" We believe it 's their plan to get checked into our jail cells , " said Sgt Duncan Babchuk with the RCMP .
Councillor Richard Backs said a holding cell is designed to hold 15 people but is often overcapacity during busy weekends .
The fines for fighting is $ 500 , and a $ 150 ticket will be handed out for swearing .
The fines will increase for repeat offenders .
Update : An AT&T spokesperson has clarified this situation for Macworld .
Only the very small number of original iPhone users signed up for Pick Your Plan without an unlimited data plan are affected here , and they 're simply being asked to add that unlimited data plan to their current account .
i Phone 3G ( and 3G S ) owners are not and have never been eligible for Pick Your Plan ; Pay As You Go accounts were never available for any iPhone customers .
Chalk up another win for AT&T ’s in the competition to become the world ’s Most Unpopular Provider .
The wireless company announced yesterday , by text message to subscribers and by statement that most of its prepaid customers would no longer be eligible for iPhone service come June 17 ’s iPhone 3.0 update .
Pay As You
Go rate plans are not approved for AT&T iPhone customers .
Customers currently using an iPhone with a Pay As You Go rate plan should call 800- 901-9878 so they can move to an approved rate plan with the required unlimited Data Plan for iPhone .
AT&T currently offers two types of prepaid plans : GoPhone , its “ pay as you go ” plan , and Pick Your Plan , its “ prepay once a month ” plan .
AT&T ’s statement says that GoPhone will not be available for either original iPhones or iPhone 3Gs ; Pick Your Plan will only continue to work for existing subscribers using the original iPhone , as long as they have an unlimited data plan .
Current Pick Your Plan users who do n’t have an unlimited data plan will be asked to add one .
i Phone 3G users are not eligible for Pick Your Plan .
According to Erica Sadun at TUAW , who ’s been investigating this issue , all pay - as - you - go users are being strongly encouraged to sign up for a postpaid plan , which includes making a new two - year commitment .
This comes across as kind of money - grubbing on the part of AT&T : since original iPhone users paid an unsubsidized price for their handset , it seems as though they should be able to use whichever plan they want — they ’re still forking over money , after all , just perhaps not as much as AT&T would like .
For 3G ( and , presumably , 3G S ) owners , the situation is trickier , given the subsidy that AT&T absorbed .
I ’d imagine that AT&T is banking on the fact that its iPhone customers are sufficiently addicted to their device by now that they ’ll switch over to the contract plans just to be able to keep using it and , for better or worse , it 's probably true .
It is common to view the philosopher as a kind of scientist , a view I call “ the philosopher as scientist ” .
Philosopher as mathematician also has some traction , but then again mathematician as scientist is extremely popular itself , and so , by the transitivity of analogies , this is not really an alternative .
In any case , through “ the philosopher as scientist ” we are encouraged to understand the task of the philosopher as basically the same as that of the scientist , but with a different subject matter , and with mental experiments ( a.k.a. intuitions ) in place of physical ones .
Just as science is expected to strive towards some final and perfectly correct theory , so philosophy expected to tread on a similar path .
Little good comes of thinking in this way , since philosophy bears little resemblance to science , and less to math .
A better model – although deficient in its own ways – is see the philosopher as a kind of artist , and thus philosophy as art .
End Products
Let ’s explore this analogy by considering how art is different than science , and then by thinking about which of the two is more like philosophy .
Perhaps the most significant difference between the two is that science is an act of discovery , while art is an act of creation .
Science is out to capture the facts about the world , and the closer it comes to reflecting those facts the better we judge it to be .
Art , on the other hand , does not necessarily have to reflect anything .
Some art is non-representational .
Other works picture scenes that have never occurred outside of the artist ’s imagination .
In any case , every work of art adds something new to the world – even artistic photographs – while science succeeds only when it perfectly copies what is already there .
Although some sculptors speak figuratively of their work already being present in the raw stone we know that this is not literally true .
What art is adding is not something physical ; science produces something new in this sense as well : new printed pages full of figures and theorems .
What a work of art creates is some new perspective , some new idea , some new thought crystallized into physical form and inserted into the public sphere .
This is how even a photograph can be creative – an act of creation – in the artistic sense ; through the photograph some beautiful image is made physical and public that previously existed only privately in the mind of the photographer .
Philosophical activity , I claim , is better understood as an act of creation rather than an act of discovery .
But what is philosophy creating ?
Art has largely emotional import and gives us new emotional perspectives on the world ; it provides mainly emotional insights .
Philosophy seems to do basically the same thing , but on an intellectual level rather than an emotional one ; it provides intellectual or conceptual insights .
The best philosophy provides us with new concepts , new intellectual tools , that let us understand the world in a novel way .
Consider Sartre ’s invention of “ bad faith ” , for example .
Through the idea of “ bad faith ” Sartre describes self - deception as it never had been before ; specifically as embracing a self - conception that runs contrary to our true natures – often our radical freedom .
It is not the case that bad faith is the only valid way of understanding self - deception , and that every other theory is somehow a mis-characterization of it .
No , bad faith is a new way of looking at self - deception , a new way of understanding its significance , and a new way of connecting it to other aspects of life .
Self - deception existed before Sartre , but bad faith did not , just as beautiful women existed before Leonardo da Vinci , but the Mona Lisa did not .
Evaluation
Another substantial difference between art and science is that in science it is possible to order every theory from better to worse , and to speak about one theory improving upon or replacing another .
But when it comes to art no such ranking is possible .
There is good and bad art , but it is hard to draw such absolute comparisons between good art .
And certainly one piece of good art does not replace or supersede another .
A work by Monet does not supersede one by Rembrandt ; after Monet Rembrandt ’s work does not become a mere historical footnote in the development of art .
But of course in science this happens all the time .
General relativity theory replaces Newtonian mechanics , making the latter good only as an engineer ’s approximation and for teaching students .
But Rembrandt is not considered only an approximation to the “ true ” beauty captured by Monet , or vice versa .
In art there is room for many different works of art , each of which can be a success in its own way .
But in science where two theories deal with the same subject matter there is room only for one ; eventually one of the two must be shelved as less correct .
Again , I think it is obvious that in this respect philosophy is more like art than science .
Of course philosophers argue amongst each other as if philosophy was like science , and spend large amounts of time trying to “ prove ” that their position is “ correct ” and that those of their opponents are at best approximations to the philosophical “ truth ” .
But if they really feel that this is how philosophy should be then they must also think that philosophy is an abject failure .
We still teach and read Plato and Aristotle , and not as mere approximations ; they still have interesting things to say to us .
If philosophy is really like science where better theories are supposed to supersede worse ones then we have n’t made any progress in the last few thousand years , at least when it comes to the subjects Plato and Aristotle talk about .
Obviously it would be absurd to say this .
It is absurd even to think it .
Philosophy makes much more sense when we understand it in basically the same way we understand art .
Yes , there is good and bad philosophy , and some philosophy is better than others , just as there is good and bad art , and some art is better than others .
But there is room for as much philosophy as we like on any subject , so long as each is adding some new interesting perspective none has to invalidate the others , even if they make contrary claims .
Philosophers making contrary claims is like two artists paining the same scene in a different style ; the fact that they differ does not mean that we have to throw out one of them .
The Creative Process
Art and science also have substantial methodological differences .
In science new theories are motivated by experiments .
Experiments yield data , and when that data conflicts with , or simply is n’t explained by , existing theories there is room for new science .
The process of producing new scientific theories is a slow and incremental one because of this .
First you have to find data that needs explaining .
In light of that data you form a hypothesis .
You then test the hypothesis with further experiments , which usually prompt revisions and thus the need to collect even more data .
And eventually you end up with something that is worth being called a new theory .
Art is nothing like this .
Producing good art is not an incremental process .
Sometimes the artist is simply inspired , and the very first thing he or she sets out to create is great art .
Of course most artists are n’t so lucky , they spend many years developing technical skills , copying the work of other artists , starting projects that do n’t turn out exactly as they would like , and in general waiting for inspiration .
But , while all that effort may be necessary preparation , the great art that follows on its heels is not a continuation of it .
Newton said that he stood on the shoulders of giants , and he was right in the sense that his work built upon what came before .
But an artist cannot say the same thing .
While art does not exist independently of its history , it does not build upon it , but rather exists in reaction to it .
Once more there are stronger parallels between philosophy and art than there are between philosophy and science .
Philosophy does not appear to be an incremental process .
There are no revised or improved versions of the Republic .
Now I am not denying that philosophy changes over time .
Often new philosophy will be developed in light of criticisms leveled against existing positions .
But I think it would be a mistake to understand this process as analogous to the revision of a hypothesis in the light of new data .
In general philosophers do n’t revise their theories , they move on to new ones .
Sometimes a criticism is met with change , but it is just as likely to be met with a criticism of the criticism .
On the other hand , the process that produces philosophy looks a lot like the process that produces art .
Like the artist , most philosophers spend the early part of their careers developing technical skills and imitating the work of other , more famous , philosophers .
They do n’t produce brilliant new ideas , they make small revisions and small objections to existing positions .
This is a lot like the young artist who does his or her best to imitate a famous style , adding only a few flourishes of their own .
This phase may never come to an end ; there are both philosophers and artists who do technically proficient work but are never truly inspired .
Some , however , are inspired .
These lucky individuals make a sudden leap past their previous work and produce something new and original .
It ’s not an incremental improvement over their past work or the work of some other philosopher , it is something never before seen .
History of the Discipline
Finally let ’s take a brief look at the historical “ progress ” of the arts and sciences .
Of course “ progress ” is a bit of a misnomer when it comes to art , since art does n’t improve as much as it finds new things to explore .
This simply highlights the fact that art does not have a linear history ; there is not a single narrative strand that ties everything together .
Rather the history of art is characterized by a number of movements , many of which overlap .
And within each movement there are usually a number of different schools and styles .
Overall the history of art is one of diversity .
Science has no room for this sort of diversity .
The history of science can be understood as a monolithic enterprise .
Although there have always been disagreements within the scientific community , it has always been the case that scientists everywhere have been doing the same thing .
In other words , the history of science is not littered with movements that are largely incompatible with each other as the art world has been .
It ’s hard to deny that the history of philosophy bears a striking resemblance to the history of art .
The history of philosophy is littered with different schools or movements , such as Rationalism , Empiricism , Existentialism , and so on .
Each of these movements is largely incompatible with the others , and each philosopher , or at least the major historical figures , tends to work primarily within a single one of them .
The history of Chinese philosophy is an even better illustration of this similarity ; in translation one of the early periods of Chinese philosophy is described as the time of the hundred schools .
And the six major schools of this period existed largely contemporaneously with each other .
It is hard to make sense of this within the scientific paradigm .
Science just does n’t have schools or styles .
Or maybe it has exactly one style that all scientists share .
If we were to really press the analogy between science and philosophy we would be forced to construe these schools as something like failed theories .
But this hardly does them justice , both because some of them still have traction and because they were hardly monolithic , there are substantial disagreements within a single school of philosophy that makes understanding them as a single theory difficult .
So What ?
All I ’ve done so far is point out that there are more similarities between art and philosophy than there are between science and philosophy .
By themselves these similarities show nothing , and we could choose to see philosophy as a kind of science in spite of them .
But that choice would be a problematic one .
Because if we continue to view the philosopher as a scientist in light of these dissimilarities with science we will be led to conclude that philosophy is defective .
We would see the substantial number of ways in which philosophy is unlike science as ways in which philosophy has historically been a failure .
You would feel the need to essentially start over in some radical fashion , to do philosophy in some new way that eliminates these “ problems ” .
But then you are hardly doing philosophy anymore .
What you would essentially be saying is that the vast majority of what has been called philosophy was a mistake , and that you would rather do something new , something different , but keep the old name .
Is n’t that somewhat disingenuous ?
If you want to do something radically different it would be more honest to distinguish it from the long tradition you are reacting against .
I think that this is an attitude that you would n’t get far with .
It is not clear what changes you could enact that would make philosophy fit into a scientific mold .
And it is hard to have a positive attitude about philosophy if you see almost all existing philosophy as wrongheaded .
This is why I think it is better to understand the philosopher as an artist .
By doing so we are able to make sense of philosophy as we know it .
The features of philosophy that have been described here are expected for art , and thus they do n’t stand in need of correction .
There is no need to radically revise philosophy , even if you would like to start a new movement within it .
Of course if you adopt this attitude towards philosophy you will be dissatisfied with those who adopt the opposite , and who try to eliminate the artistic aspects of philosophy .
But , from this perspective , seeing the philosopher as a scientist is just one movement among many , and no movement lasts forever .
The Manhattan district attorney , Robert M. Morgenthau , said his office was investigating the shooting and that the case would be presented to a grand jury .
But he cautioned that it was standard procedure to bring all police shootings before a grand jury , except in very few cases in which it is clear that the shooting was justified .
Image Omar J. Edwards
“ Whenever there ’s any question about justification , it goes to the grand jury , ” Mr. Morgenthau said .
The shooting has once again raised questions about departmental procedures involving communications among plainclothes officers  particularly those in different units  as well as issues of race .
Officer Edwards was black , and Officer Dunton is white .
The Rev. Al Sharpton said on Friday that he was “ concerned of a growing pattern of black officers being killed with the assumption that they are the criminals . ”
“ This calls for federal investigation and intervention to sort out the facts and bring about a just resolve , ” Mr. Sharpton said .
“ Can police investigate themselves fairly and impartially ?
It would seem very difficult at best and unlikely in fact . ”
Mayor Bloomberg said on his morning radio show that investigators were reviewing security tapes of the shooting , which he maintained was not deliberate , and interviewing witnesses .
Investigators were also questioning the man Officer Edwards had been chasing .
" The only thing that can come out of this is to improve procedures so perhaps it does n’t happen again , " the mayor said .
" We all know policing is a dangerous job and accidents happen when people have guns in their hands , even legal guns in this case which they are authorized and trained to use . "

[ Haskell - cafe ] 6.12.1 planning
Hi Folks ,
As usual , we 're planning a major release of GHC around September .
Here 's our list of the main items currently scheduled for 6.12.1 , and their status .
If you have the time and inclination to help with any of these , please get involved !
* Parallel performance .
6.12.1 will ship with the improvements to parallel performance described in our ICFP 2009 paper .
Still to do : overhaul the +RTS GC settings , tune for good performance by default .
* Parallel profiling : the new RTS tracing features will be included , and we hope to have a release of ThreadScope to coincide with GHC 6.12.1 .
ThreadScope is written using gtk2hs , and could benefit from someone with expertise in producing polished gtk2hs apps - if you can lend a hand , contact Satnam Singh < satnams at microsoft.com >.
* Unicode I/O : the new Unicode I/O library is in , and will ship with 6.12.1 .
Still to do : decide on the public API for changing encodings and newline conversion .
* Shared libraries : we intend to ship with shared library support on at least x86 / Linux and x86 - 64 / Linux .
There are various tasks remaining to do here - Duncan , can we have a summary ?
* Data Parallel Haskell .
Manuel , can you comment on the state of play ?
What can we expect in time for 6.12.1 ? * Plugin support in GHC .
The patches are not yet in GHC , and as far as I know are awaiting review - Simon , can you say more ? *
The new backend code generator .
At the moment , it seems unlikely that GHC 6.12.1 will ship with the new code generator enabled by default , although it may well be available for testing .
Meanwhile , work on it continues .
The smaller items are all embodied in tickets , here are the tickets currently in the 6.12.1 milestone ( 135 ) : http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&milestone=6.12.1 and on the 6.12 branch ( 251 ) : http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&milestone=6.12+branch
I estimate there are 2 man years of work here - needless to say , we are n't going to fix all these tickets :)
As usual , if you want to vote for something , add your email to the CC field of the ticket .
Several of these tickets would make good tasks for a fledgling GHC hacker .
e.g .
http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/2362
( allow full import syntax in GHCi ) has a lot of support , and is a nice self - contained task ( but not a small one ) .
Even if you 're not a GHC hacker you can still help , e.g. by helping to narrow down the cause of a bug , or verifying a bug on your platform .
Let me remind people that GHC HEAD has the new build system , and it 's actually rather pleasant to work with .
Even if you have no idea what you 're doing , you can always say ' make ' at the top level and the build system will figure out what needs doing ( ok , so that 's what build systems are supposed to do , but GHC 's has never quite managed it until now ! ) .
Cheers , Simon
We are in the liquor store because the Red Stripe is running low in the fridge and we have no rolling paper .
Since it ’s my neighborhood liquor store I say hello to the man behind the counter even though I ’ve never seen him before .
He stares at me but does n’t respond in kind .
I think nothing of it .
In the innards of the store sit four mammoth coolers .
I ignore the first three and slide open the fourth .
Little thought is involved : I grab two Baltika 9s and a Tucher .
It ’s Sunday , I think , the day of rest .
I love the word rest .
Such a subjective word , open to interpretation .
My idea of rest may be very different from your idea of rest , but both are equally valid .
I set the big beers on the counter .
A simple transaction , I think , say hello and ask him if he has any .
- Hello , how ’s it going ?
- Good , sir .
Debit or credit ?
- Credit .
Do you have any rolling paper ?
- No , sir .
- No !?
Are you sure ?
Last time I was here , you had .
I lurch over the counter , get all in his face in search of the rolling paper that I know is on the shelf behind him .
I squint , a victim of myopia , one of the Sub - Adequate that will run into Darwinian extinction .
Blindness .
That ’s what I suffer from .
Myopia is just an embellished term , a beautiful sound rounding out your mouth that stands for blindness .
Get this : there are people who from twenty feet can see what I see at fourteen .
I ’m doomed if you think about it in stark terms , especially as I lurch over the counter , get all in the man ’s face , and squint for the familiar Job 1.0 rolling paper .
I think I see it , so I give my eyes more of a squeeze .
Nope .
Some kind of box comes into a blurriness sharp enough for me to determine that it is n’t rolling paper , but a box of cigars .
- We do n’t carry that item here , sir .
- But Bose carried it .
- Bose ?
Who ’s Bose , sir ?
A speaker for music ?
I want to right the man ’s blasphemy , calling Bose a speaker , branding his name , mocking the great man who curated his job before him :
- No !
What do you mean Bose the speaker !
My speech has become theatrical .
I sound like Toshiro Mifune .
My voice booms again :
- Bose , the man who used to work here .
He used to carry rolling paper .
I bought some from his hand .
- Bose does n’t work here anymore , sir .
And we do n’t deal in that stuff anymore .
- Say what ?
- We cannot have a hand in that kind of stuff , sir .
It is too much liability .
- Rolling paper ?
People roll tobacco cigarettes with rolling paper .
I shrug and bunch my face into cracked glass .
I realize the absurdity of his character :
- Liability ?!
What about all those liquor bottles behind you ?
What do you call all that ?
You supply dens of iniquity everywhere , and here you stand with the audacity to talk to me about liability .
- But , sir , we do not deal in that here .
It would be like us carrying Dutch Masters .
- Dutch Masters , are you kidding me ?
That ’s a little shitty cigar .
I ’m talking about rolling paper here .
You sell every conceivable form of liquor and yet have morality issues about selling rolling paper ?
I want Bose back .
He has nothing to say to this .
I suddenly feel like I hurt his feelings .
- But I like your prices .
You keep prices low , and you have Baltika 9 , that ’s why I keep coming back , a repeat customer .
Hey , I ’m buying from you right now , are n’t I ?
- Yes , sir .
He returns my credit card .
Outside , the parking lot is full of parked and moving cars , people carrying bags , trash , babies in strollers , and a drop of rain that strikes my head and splinters into quintuplets .
I walk to the nearest gas station .

Note to self : remember to draw Steve beefier from this point on .
Here 's anew video involving the violent events in Iran and the politics they are now forcing within the United States .
The video is from C - SPAN of Arizona Republican Sen.
John McCain , who over the weekend said he'd like to see the president speak out stronger .
Then , on the Senate floor today speaking in stronger terms than Democrat President Barack Obama about the Tehran government 's violent reaction to protests of the recent election that allegedly reinstated the existing regime .
The obviously angry McCain , Obama 's GOP opponent in last year 's presidential election , cites the tragic death of an Iran female protester called Neda whose name has suddenly become known globally as she was shot in Tehran and died in the street , bleeding profusely , on a now viral and very graphic video with friends screaming around her .
McCain 's outspoken criticism of Iran 's government for its violence mirrors his strong denunciations last summer when Russia invaded the democratic country of Georgia .
Obama , who was vacationing in Hawaii at the time , was more measured initially , calling on both sides to stop fighting .
He later changed tone more in favor of the invaded democracy .
On the weekend , before taking his daughters out for ice cream , Obama issued a statement , published here on The Ticket , warning the theocratic regime that the world is watching and it should permit peaceful democratic demonstrations .
The new president is trying to walk a thin line between satisfying homegrown outcries to support democratic outbursts around the world and his promise in a recent Cairo speech not to interfere in other countries and to attempt talking with such regimes .
In recent interviews Obama has pointed to some success with that line , as Iran has instead accused Britain of interference ; the UK began evacuating its embassy personnel 's families from Iran today .
Our fellow bloggers have continuous Iran coverage over here at Babylon & Beyond .
And there 's an Iran photo gallery here .

Australia is the new craze with Indian people considering migration nowadays .
2006 -07 year marked almost 16,000 Indians seeking permanent residence under the skilled migrant programme to Australia .
This makes them second largest group seeking Australian immigration , after Britons .
Partha Mukherjee , a passout from IIT , Kharagpur and IIM , Ahmedabad relocated to Australia three years back , accompanies by his wife under the same programme .
He had everything , wealth , position and power while in Mumbai .
But he chooses to immigrate to Sydney because of the enhanced quality life that the country offers .
This allows him to strike the right balance between his family life and work .
Mukherjee , at present is a lecturer for international business at a university and is also an engineering consultant .
This Indian craze for Australia immigration is followed by China , South Africa and Malaysia .
Despite constant economic growth from the past one decade , Australia ’s demand for skilled workers is still on the rise , as a lot of ageing workforce is on the verge of retirement now .
Professional Engineers and Engineering managers , Tradespersons , IT and Computing professionals , registered nurses and accounting professionals are in great demand in Australia under the skilled migrant category .
The in - demand list of Australian occupations is given in the MODL or Migration Occupations in the Demand List .
This list is amended frequently on the basis of shortage of skilled workers in the Australian economy .
Total of 38 occupations are mentioned in this list , on the basis of which immigrants are awarded certain extra points in their points system .
Priority processing is another benefit enjoyed by immigrants , if their nominated occupation appears in this list .
Besides Australia , Canada , New Zealand , Denmark are some destinations for which people are seeking immigration nowadays .

What : Confederations Cup final
Who : USA vs. Brazil
When : Sunday 28th June , 2009 , at 18:30 GMT
Where : Coca -Cola Park , Johannesburg , South Africa
USA All the Way
This is n’t the US basketball “ dream team ” , nor is it one of the Yankees ’ most renowned baseball clubs .
It ’s the USA “ soccer ” team , and , believe it or not , they have made it all the way to the final of the Confederations Cup in South Africa , a year before the real deal gets under way .
Bob Bradley ’s team have made it plain and simple for all to see that “ soccer ” is no longer a marginalised sport in the USA .
After brutally putting an end to Spain ’s undefeated 35 - game streak , they ’ll tackle the next big thing in Brazil , and go down as serious players in the 2010 World Cup .
Bye - Bye Bafana
It took Selecao coach Dunga a while to make way for Daniel Alves in the final minutes of the bout against South Africa .
From the edge of the box , the Barcelona wide man blasted a screamer of a free kick to send the South American champions into ecstasy , and the hosts out .
Now , they have the chance to fly past France and stand in pole position as the team with the most Confederations Cups to their name .
With such an impressive side , everything is possible .
Recent form
United States :
USA 1 – 3 Italy ( Group )
USA 0 – 3 Brazil ( Group )
Egypt 0 – 3 USA ( Group )
Spain 0 – 2 USA ( Semi- final )
Brazil :
Brazil 4 – 3 Egypt ( Group )
USA 0 – 3 Brazil ( Group )
Italy 0 – 3 Brazil ( Group )
Brazil 1 – 0 South Africa ( Semi- final )
Players to watch
United States – Tim Howard :
The former Manchester United keeper had an excellent game against La Seleccion , and silenced his doubters on this particular occasion .
Should he prove to be as glittering as he was against Casillas and co , He may prove to be a tough nut to crack for Robinho and the rest of the boys .
Brazil – Kaka :
Like his role at Milan , the new Real Madrid playmaker has been at the heart of the national team in this tournament .
He did n’t beat a lot of defenders this time around , but keep an eye on him as he will make sure to slide that magical pass to either Luis Fabiano or Robinho .
Team weakness
United States – Charlie Davies :
The Hammarby striker lost his glow in the event of Altidore ’s brilliance against La Furia Roja , and had to be taken off by Bradley .
It will be anyone ’s guess if he makes the starting XI against Brazil , but if he does , he better have his shooting boots on this time around .
Brazil – Luisao : Nobody looks good standing next to Lucio , but the Benfica stopper will have to give his all in order to prevent any US attack .
Billed as the weakest link of the back - four , Landon Donovan ’s team will build on this point .
Match Prediction
It ’s not Spain against Brazil , but still should be the thriller everybody expects .
The Americans shocked the world by sinking the Spanish fleet , while Brazil needed a last minute individual effort to re-visit the Coca - Cola stadium .
Yet , the men from the south may prove to be too much for the current CONCACAF winners and a 3 - 1 scoreline for the five - times World champions does not seem an unlikely outcome .

In Time For Star Trek , Physicists Say They Can Make A Warp Drive
With the new movie ‘ Star Trek ’ opening in theaters across the nation , one thing movie goers will undoubtedly see is the Starship Enterprise racing across the galaxy at the speed of light but two Baylor University physicists believe they have an idea that can turn traveling at the speed of light from science fiction to science , and that their idea does not break any laws of physics .
Dr. Gerald Cleaver , associate professor of physics at Baylor , and Dr. Richard Obousy , a Baylor post - doctoral student , theorize that by manipulating the space - time dimensions around the spaceship with a massive amount of energy , it would create a “ bubble ” that could push the ship faster than the speed of light .
To create this bubble , the Baylor physicists believe manipulating dark energy would create dark energy .
Cleaver said positive dark energy is responsible for speeding up the universe as time moves on , just like it did after the Big Bang , when the universe expanded faster than the speed of light .
“ Think of it like a surfer riding a wave , ” said Cleaver , who co-authored the paper with Obousy about the new method .
“ The ship would be pushed by the bubble and the bubble would be traveling faster than the speed of light . ”
The method is based on the Alcubierre drive , which proposes expanding the fabric of space behind a ship into a bubble and shrinking space - time in front of the ship .
The ship would not actually move , rather the ship would sit in between the expanding and shrinking space - time dimensions .
Since space would move around the ship , the theory does not violate Einstein ’s Theory of Relativity , which states that it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object faster than the speed of light .
String theory suggests the universe is made up of multiple dimensions .
Height , width and length are three dimensions , and time is the fourth dimension .
Scientists believe that there are a total of 10 dimensions , with six other dimensions that we can not yet identify .
A new theory , called M - theory , takes string theory one step farther and states that the “ strings ” actually vibrate in an 11 - dimensional space .
It is this 11th dimension that the Baylor researchers believe could help propel a ship faster than the speed of light .
The Baylor physicists estimate that the amount of energy needed to influence the extra dimensions is equivalent to the entire mass of Jupiter being converted into energy .
“ That is an enormous amount of energy , ” Cleaver said .
“ We are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy . ”

Sex in Crisis : The New Sexual Revolution and the Future of American Politics
By Dagmar Herzog
( Basic Books , 2008 )
What inspired you to write Sex in Crisis ?
What sparked your interest ?
Sex in Crisis has a great deal to do with my prior book , Sex after Fascism : Memory and Morality in Twentieth - Century Germany ( 2005 ) , which offered a major revision of our assumptions about the Third Reich ’s sexual politics and its aftermath , including close attention to the complicity of the Christian churches under Nazism .
In his book American Fascists , Chris Hedges had drawn direct parallels between the religious right in the United States and the Nazis , but I thought that was not the point .
As a Holocaust scholar , I ’m deeply uncomfortable with direct parallels , but what I did learn from studying the Nazis was that they were quite pro-sex for their own followers , while denigrating “ Jewish ” sex as dirty and immoral .
They had it both ways , and that was a significant key to their appeal .
Intuitively , I thought there was a comparable dynamic going on with the religious right .
While I was researching and writing Sex in Crisis , I was continually struck by the extent to which there was a massive misperception of what the religious right stood for .
So many saw only the puritanical and homophobic side of the religious right coin ; they did n’t see the Christian vibrator Web sites or the detailed evangelical sex advice manuals .
At the same time , the religious right was indeed doing tremendous damage , gutting sex education in US schools and eroding HIV prevention in Africa–all in the name of morality .
As someone who was raised in the Bible Belt South , in a deeply religious family , I was horrified by the religious right ’s new distortion of Christianity and its deleterious impact on national and international health policy .
I wanted to make sense of how the religious right had succeeded in redirecting the national terms of conversation about sex : spouting ugly homophobia , reshaming women ’s sexuality in particular , increasingly going after contraception and not just abortion , insisting that sex before marriage would have horrible consequences ( even though 95 percent of Americans have had premarital sex ) , and mocking the moral values of self - determination and consent .
What ’s the most important take - home message for readers ?
The religious right has been enormously sophisticated in reshaping the national conversation on sex not least by creatively adapting aspects of the old sexual revolution of the 1960s - 70 s –and also the women ’s movement ’s push for “ orgasm equity ” – for its own sexually repressive ends .
Three points are especially important :
1 . Far from being uptight , the religious right is lasciviously explicit .
And far from being anti-sex , it is very pro-sex ; within heterosexual marriage , that is .
The religious right promises , to those who will follow its rules , decades of spectacularly blissful marital orgasms .
( “ It ’s like having a million tiny pleasure balloons exploding inside of me all at once , ” as one evangelical women ’s advice book puts it ; another says : “ Orgasm is an integral part of God ’s design for sex . ” )
Repression alone , in short , is not sufficiently appealing .
Sex sells–also for conservatives .
Without the promise of pleasure , the religious right would not have found nearly as many adherents as it has .
2 . The religious right succeeded above all by secularizing its message .
It sounds paradoxical , but it ’s vital .
Part of the move had to do with physical health : exaggerating the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases and lumping treatable and untreatable , bearable and unbearable , diseases together for maximum scare value ( all the while mendaciously denigrating the effectiveness of condoms ) .
But the biggest move was capturing the terrain of therapy - speak about psychological health .
It ’s not about hellfire anymore .
Repression has now been repackaged as promotion of mental well - being .
Suddenly everything is about low self - esteem : homosexuality , abortions , pornography , premarital sex .
The Bush administration mandated in 2006 that high school curricula dependent on federal funding ( and at that point 46 of the 50 states took federal funding for abstinence ed ) must inform students that sex before marriage could lead to depression and suicide .
3 . The religious right plays on the most elemental fears about the relationships ( or lack thereof ) between bodies and emotions , performance and intimacy , lust and love .
A big reason for the success of conservative arguments in the Bush years had to do with the extraordinary panic that was unleashed in the media around the prospect of the death of postmarital desire .
The panic was that not just women but also men were too tired after a long day of work ; were n’t attracted to their boring , naggy , imperfectly - bodied spouses ; would rather masturbate to porn on the computer , etc .
Conservatives rushed in with feminist - seeming arguments about how even when two people were in bed with each other , their heads and hearts were really elsewhere ; they spoke to widespread feelings of emotional alienation and anomie , also specifically within marriage , and about how too many wives feel like sperm depots for emotionally insensitive husbands .
The manufactured anxiety about the death of postmarital sex explains a great deal about the sudden incapacity of Americans to defend premarital sex .
Is there anything you had to leave out ?
In retrospect , I wish I ’d included more on people ’s perceptions that American culture is hardly conservative but rather loose and free : full of alcohol - fueled hookups and Craigslist - facilitated trysts , and that nobody adheres to the conservative rules and rhetoric anyway , including the conservatives themselves ( see Ted Haggard or Sarah Palin ) .
So why be alarmed by the religious right , and / or ( and this is in some ways the opposite argument ) the perception that sex quite apparently is not so happy - making for many people , and thus that the conservatives have a good point when they try to be more restrictive and protective and didactic .
Also , many people think the religious right is by now just a paper tiger , and they love lecturing me ( as though I had n’t spelled this out myself in the early pages of the book ) on how evangelicals are increasingly turning toward what had been traditionally ‘ left ’ concerns , like the environment , economic justice , war , or global health .
So I wish I ’d make it clearer that I think American sexual culture is schizophrenic , that sexual opportunity is indeed everywhere , but simultaneously sexual rights have been quite concretely eroded .
That we have the highest rates of STDs and unwanted pregnancies in the industrialized world , and the lowest contraceptive use , and sex ed in this country is in tatters .
That someday we will wonder how the country went crazy for eight years and allowed itself to be bullied over these most intimate aspects of human life .
What are some of the biggest misconceptions about your topic ?
That the religious right is a Make War Not Love crowd , rather than a Make War And Love crowd .
That you ca n’t understand the rise of the religious right if you focus only on virginity rings ; you have to look at the astonishingly graphic advice on how to make your partner come , or the recommendations for spanking and light bondage , etc. , in online Christian advice sites like The Marriage Bed .
Another big misconception is that the best way to resist conservatism is to expose conservative hypocrisy .
One of the most important things I learned in researching evangelical sex advice and therapy culture ( which is a multibillion dollar industry ) is how crucial exhibitionist , preemptive confessionalism has become .
Evangelical advice - givers like to brag about the wild promiscuity of their youth , and their many adulterous misdeeds , or to confess in anguish the abortions they forced on girlfriends or the porn they once so frequently indulged in , before moving on to advise others how to get onto the straight and narrow .
It ’s titillating .
But it also preempts in advance any traditional liberal strategy of muckraking exposé of conservative incoherence .
There ’s nothing to expose ; the sins have all been luxuriously confessed .
Did you have a specific audience in mind ?
There had been many books on the religious right , but none had analyzed its sexual - political strategies in detail .
So in that sense I was writing for general readers who cared and worried about the rightward drift of American culture .
But I ’m pleased that also evangelical conservatives read the book and took its findings seriously ; I was privileged to be on radio talk shows discussing the issues with evangelical theologians and ministers .
Above all , though , I had my own incredible undergraduate students at Michigan State , where I taught for many years , in mind .
They were so morally searching and perceptive , and the book is primarily a tribute to them .
I ’m thrilled that the book is being read and debated now in university classrooms .
Are you hoping to just inform readers ?
Give them pleasure ?
Piss them off ?
I hate pissing people off ; it ’s my least favorite thing .
I ’m actually quite conflict - averse .
My biggest goals were to communicate just how malicious ( and by no means moral ) the religious right ’s effects have been , to show how people ’s deepest longings and fears around sex and love can be so easily manipulated , to remind Americans how rapid the onslaught has been and how recently we actually had a great deal more self - confidence in defending our sexual privacy and rights , and to help people imagine alternative ways of organizing sexual cultures that are more generous and curious rather than punitive , and far more respectful of individual diversity and self - determination .
Obama winning the last election was a very good thing .
But the damages done in the past years are lingering on , and the religious right is still having a big impact on global health policy as well as policy and education at the state level .
What alternative title would you give the book ?
How the Religious Right did the Sex Work for the Republican Party
How do you feel about the cover ?
It ’s great .
The red , white , and blue makes clear this is about national politics–but also the style has a whiff of ’60s pop art .
Is there a book out there you wish you had written ?
Which one ?
Why ?
I have huge admiration for Stephanie Coontz ’s Marriage , A History .
I think it ’s brilliant–ethically thoughtful and empirically rigorous at once .
What ’s your next book ?
I just finished an edited collection , Brutality and Desire : War and Sexuality in Europe ’s Twentieth Century –which ranges from the Armenian genocide in the 1910s via Auschwitz and Algeria to Bosnia in the 1990s .
The horrific sexual violence in the former Yugoslavia , and the international recognition that the rapes were war crimes , has prompted more research into sexual violence in prior wars .
But wars have often also provided opportunities for joyful consensual romances and topsy - turvy crossing of boundaries .
Both sides of sexuality need to be better understood .
Dell has secured download reselling rights for Microsoft Office , the first time Microsoft has allowed a third party to do this .
That 's what Dell says , at any rate .
The deal looks like a toe - dipping exercise on both sides .
For starters ,
Dell is a download minnow , only opening its download store in January , with lines from McAfee , Intuit , CA and Webroot .
Some 10,000 people visit the download store each week , which probably translates into unit sales in the very low hundreds a week .
Also the agreement is for the US only - but expect the companies to roll out elsewhere if customers show appetite for this service .
With PC and server markets stalled , Dell is looking into every nook and cranny for revenue growth .
But retail downloads are small potatoes compared with the company 's ambitious push into Cloud - based software , back - up and security services for big businesses .
Dell recently set up the Modular Services division to enable enterprises to mix and match their software - as - a - service offerings - and it talks about this today and fields questions from viewers in an exclusive Register webcast ( details here ) .
The company may be the world 's second biggest PC maker behind HP , but has lots of experience in infrastructure - based services , often obtained through small bolt - ons .
It is on the look - out for acquisitions in the tech services and data storage sectors , CFO Brian Gladden told the WSJ last week .
The paper notes that Dell has $ 9bn in cash . ®
Marijuana remains illegal even though public attitudes are clearly changing on this topic .
It is illegal even though 100 million Americans have smoked it and suffered little if any negative side effects .
It is illegal even though 40 % or more of Americans currently support legalization .
It is illegal even though it is not physically addictive ; you cannot overdose on marijuana ; and the dependency rate of marijuana is lower than alcohol .
Marijuana remains illegal even though prohibition is incredibly expensive .
The federal government spends at least $ 10 billion per year specifically on marijuana prohibition .
Approximately 60,000 people are in prisons in America on marijuana violations only .
If all 15 - 25 million Americans who smoke marijuana monthly were imprisoned , the country would spend $ 365 billion per year to incarcerate these people .
Considering the country could reap approximately $ 6.2 billion per year if marijuana were taxed and regulated like alcohol , the war on marijuana easily costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 20 billion per year .
Marijuana remains illegal even though prohibition has miserably failed .
After 35 years of a war on drugs largely targeting marijuana , the same number of high school students now say marijuana is easy to get and they had used it as answered those question in the affirmative in 1975 .
It remains illegal even though the Obama administration has declared an end to the “ war on drugs , ” while at the same time laughing off marijuana legalization .
Marijuana prohibition continues even though it empowers Mexican drug cartels .
Approximately 60 - 70 % of the profit of Mexican drug cartels comes from marijuana sales .
If marijuana were taxed and regulated , this black market would virtually disappear , Mexican drug cartels would be much weaker , and our border would be much more secure .
Despite these facts , most politicians continue support marijuana prohibition .
Commission after commission and newspaper editorial board after board may endorse marijuana legalization , but it continues to be ignored in state capitals .
Grassroots activism does a great job keeping this issue in the press , but politicians continue to ignore it .
Few politicians see it in their narrow interests of reelection to come out in favor of legalization of marijuana .
What follows is a brief analysis of some of the factors that continue to propagate the inertia of marijuana prohibition :
Facts do n’t matter
When it comes to marijuana , statistics do n’t seem to matter .
Costs do n’t matter .
As noted above , no matter how many billions per year it costs to enforce marijuana prohibition , there seems to be no cost too high to prohibit it .
Prohibitionist seem to be saying that there is no cost to high to attempt to limit marijuana use .
Overall use and teen use is lower in countries that have legalized ( Amsterdam ) or fully decriminalized marijuana ( Portugal , Spain , Britian ) than in the United States .
There is no real evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug ( in fact research shows that marijuana is largely a terminus drug – meaning people use nothing more than marijuana throughout their lives ) .
In Colorado alone , 13,000 people are arrested every year on marijuana charges .
Another few hundred are in prison on marijuana charges .
In total , Colorado spends around $ 85 million dollars per year on marijuana prohibition .
If Colorado taxed and regulated marijuana , the net gain for the state coffers would be $ 150 million per year .
None of this seems to matter to those in favor of prohibition .
Instead , the debate turns on value judgments and justifications not tried to any empirical data .
While those favoring legalization should continue to insist that we deal with empirical data , facts alone will not legalize marijuana .
Prohibition is a hangover of the 60s culture war
By far the greatest impediments to living in a world where marijuana is not criminalized are the left over stereotypes and culture wars from the 1960s and 70s .
Those where the decades when the counterculture made widespread marijuana use synonymous with alternative lifestyles and an implicit rejection of mainstream traditional American values .
The classic narrative of drug use in America is that while it may have started out as an innocent and idealized behavior in the 60s , the 70s and early 80s saw the “ drug culture ” deteriorate into a narcissistic world of selfishness and excess .
The irresponsibility of some early users saddled the next several generations with the general notion that marijuana users were not good citizens and their lifestyles did not produce healthy communities and families .
Simply put , prohibitionist have succeeded in branding marijuana users as irresponsible and not serious .
That perception must change , even if it means more people “ coming out of the closet ” and showing that marijuana use can occur in conjunction with healthy , intelligent lifestyles .
Marijuana Prohibition Criminalizes Youth and Leads to Skewed Electoral Results
The classic pattern of marijuana use is that people begin experiment with marijuana near the end of high school .
Experimentation steadily tappers off through their late 20s and for most people by their mid-30s , marijuana use is a rare or nonexistent experience .
As people acquire more responsibility ( marriage , children , mortgage ) , they find less room in their lives for marijuana .
This trend also explains why political change is so hard .
As marijuana withers from adults ’ habits , they are less likely to pursue or advocate for reform .
By a person ’s mid-30s , he or she has already quit using marijuana so they have no incentive to seek its legalization .
This leads to the general atmosphere of marijuana reform , which is that too few people remain directly affected throughout their lifetimes so as to care about changing marijuana laws .
Those that continue to “ care , ” perhaps care too much and are seen as radicals by the establishment .
The reform movement needs to engage past users to help change marijuana laws .
Free rider problem and Selective Enforcement
For those that will continue to use marijuana throughout their lifetime ( perhaps 6 % - 10 % of users ) , there also is little incentive to advocate for legalization .
As few as 2 in 100 people ever suffer criminal justice sanctions as a consequence of their marijuana use .
Because so few stakeholders feel the effects of prohibition , those with the most at stake in legalization are not in the streets demanding change .
The difference between the gay rights movement and marijuana proponents is that by advocating for marijuana rights people immediately subject themselves to criminal prosecution – something no longer possible for gay activists .
Related to the free rider problem is the low stakes involved in most marijuana arrests .
With the exception of a few states in the deep south and Utah , in most places marijuana arrests result in a small fine and perhaps community service and / or drug counseling .
The popular stereotype that our prisons are filled with people who only smoked marijuana cigarettes is not accurate .
Small time users generally do not go to jail , but cultivators and distributors do .
Therefore , the lack of serious sanctions has also deflated the potential movement against injustice because the stakes are so small .
Why would a doctor or lawyer risk his or her reputation seeking to legalize marijuana when the sanctions are already so slight ?
Again , these free riders need to be convinced that advocating for marijuana legalization is a “ gateway issue ” to reforming the larger failed drug war and that they may not avoid prosecution forever .
Inability to have an honest discussion about drugs – lack of acknowledgement of responsible use
Another barrier to societal acceptance of marijuana is the inability to have an honest dialogue about the potential positive benefits of marijuana use .
Universally , when drugs and marijuana are discussed in public , the frame of debate is that marijuana use is a self - destructive and unhealthy activity .
There is little public acknowledgement that for millions of people occasional and responsible marijuana use has greatly enhanced their lives , such as by making a walk in nature powerfully introspective , by resulting in riotous laughter , or by making their sex lives more fulfilling .
Instead , those who are usually the most outspoken about marijuana ’s positive aspects tend to preach in a manner that makes marijuana use out to be an unmitigated good , refusing to acknowledge any negative consequences of abuse .
The message of legalization must be that while legalization may marginally increase some irresponsible behavior , the savings from ending the war on marijuana will far outstrip any harms .
Just say no is an easy message for parents
Parents have always had a hard time discussing drug use with their children .
Many parents are conflicted on this issue because a large percentage of parents once experimented with marijuana .
Keeping marijuana illegal gives parents an unassailable reason why their kids should not use it : because it is illegal .
The simplicity and utility of prohibition is a major reason that many parents passively support it , even if they privately do n’t believe marijuana is harmful .
Parents need to be shown alternative methods for keeping their children away from marijuana , such as science based drug education .
A long term minority without a constitutional right protecting them
The main Constitutional defense to marijuana prosecution is that it violates rights to privacy under the 5th and 14th Amendment .
Unfortunately , other than Alaska , most experts believe that state privacy rights are not strong enough to protect marijuana use in your own home .
There are no other significant constitutional guarantees that can be expected to protect marijuana users .
Unlike racial minorities or gays and lesbians , it is unlikely that marijuana users can seek refuge in Constitutional clauses for their activities .
With only 15 - 25 million regular users , about 10 % - 15 % of all adults in America , it is unlikely that a majority of American adults will ever use marijuana on a regular basis as long as it is illegal .
Without a constitutional right to protect them , it is unlikely they will be able to muster electoral majorities in the next 10 - 15 years to end their persecution .
Discomfort with Freedom
Despite America being the “ land of the free and home of the brave , ” in practice there appears to be a significant resistance and discomfort with giving people the freedom to make potentially bad choices .
Regardless of how many can use marijuana safely or responsibly , if some abuse it , many will oppose legalizing it .
This inherent discomfort with the actual practice of freedom is a major cultural hurdle to legalization .
The many have always paid for the poor choices of the few .
Marijuana prohibition is by definition a preemptive war which seeks to criminalize all who use marijuana because a few may abuse it .
While America seems to recognizing the futility of preemptive wars , there is still a strong undercurrent of support for this type of reaction .
Discomfort with Marijuana Intoxication Compared with Alcohol
There is no principled distinction between alcohol and marijuana intoxication .
The Attorney General of Colorado says that people can drink alcohol in “ sub - intoxicating doses , ” which seems only possible for those chronic users of alcohol who are not affected by small amounts .
Of course , the mild psychedelic or psychological aspects of the marijuana are different than alcohol .
The paranoia resulting from marijuana use in a small number of users is among its most common psychological negative effect .
While most people experience great insight and pleasure from the use of marijuana , others experience this paranoia .
The general discomfort with psychedelic or spiritual experiences related to marijuana use lead many to a conclusion that it should not be widely used .
Again , this is the many paying for the negative consequences of the few .
Conclusion
Marijuana legalization is gaining steam .
I believe firmly that in my lifetime it will be legal for both medical and recreational purposes .
What seems necessary at this point is to build a movement of tolerance for responsible marijuana users ’ rights to be left alone .
This tolerance will also need to acknowledge that a small minority of people may abuse their freedom if marijuana is legalized and that society will need to deal with those negative effects .
Surely all the money saved on incarceration and prohibition would cover the costs of any negative effects of legalization .
Rather than spending another generation toiling under a failed system , I hope we can end this failed preemptive war on marijuana soon .
However , it will not end until the reform movement addresses the above concerns and transforms the debate back into a human - centered fact - based dialogue which focuses on reasonable solutions rather than ideology .
Last week Breckenridge Colorado joined the growing chorus of municipalities across America seeking to create a sensible cannabis policy ( one , that in principle , is similar to that of alcohol in the recognition between acceptable , responsible adult use and abuse ) .
Even though Colorado is already one of the 13 states that have decriminalized possession amounts of cannabis , following Denver ’s lead , Breckenridge voters will soon be asked to make cannabis both a lowest law enforcement priority and the ‘ penalty ’ for possessing it– nothing .
Nada .
No fine , no criminal record .
A bright and enthusiastic lawyer with a young and growing family in Breckenridge is one of the chief advocates for this initiative , and in an ongoing ‘ The Law and Marijuana ‘ series of essays submitted by attorneys from the NORML Legal Committee to be exclusively published by the organization , Sean McAllister opines about why he thinks cannabis prohibition has lasted over 70 years .

Inappropriate Humor Alert …
Tea Party protesters won a victory today as the mainstream media could not ignore their protests like they have in the past .
As expected some of the media described the protesters as radicals ( ever-classy and most - trusted Anderson Cooper of CNN used an obscene joke to describe the attendees ) despite the pictures showing peaceful gatherings of people of all ages in attendance .
Yet media logic dictates if you do n’t love Obama , you must be crazy .
Yet it ’s not just the media searching for crazy .
A report was leaked by DHS on “ Rightwing Extremism . ”
To quote the report ,
Rightwing extremist chatter on the Internet continues to focus on the economy , the perceived loss of U.S. jobs in the manufacturing and construction sectors , and home foreclosures .
Dang it , I ’m a radical .
There were signs , once in high school I got a detention for a overdue library book ; even back then I was bad .
My internet chatter about obscene government spending has all been a clever ploy to manipulate my readers to take radical action like , ‘ vote the bums out , ’ or ‘ tell your representatives what you think . ’
I tell you I ’m bad , and if I did n’t have a job or a cold I would have been one of those crazy tea party animals too .
You need further proof that I ’m a radical ?
How about this …
Rightwing extremist views bemoan the decline of U.S. stature and have recently focused on themes such as the loss of U.S. manufacturing capability to China and India , Russia ’s control of energy resources and use of these to pressure other countries , and China ’s investment in U.S. real estate and corporations as a part of subversion strategy .
Well there you have it .
I ’m concerned that China owns us , and all our debt , I must be a radical .
Granted , I ’m a centrist on guns and immigration , and lean a bit left on the social issues discussed in the report , but imagine my surprise to find out that I ’ve been cavorting with other radicals over the past 2 years by volunteering for the McCain campaign .
Pro-life , pro-second amendment , high concentration of veterans , do n’t let the good humor , sarcastic wit , family values , and helpful manner fool you - we were all a big bunch of radicals , just ask MSNBC .
Now I know there is a serious side to this report .
Every group in every country has its nutballs , and its the governments main job to protect its citizens from radicals of all sorts .
Yet this seems like a veiled attempt to blur the line between staunch conservatives and radical Klan - like groups , when in reality that is a very clear and distict line .
Veterans in particular are owed an apology for their less than flattering portrayal in this report .
As for me , I ’m going to keep chattering about the economy , and take pride in the fact that someone out there thinks I ’m radical .
From the ' BSD people with a great sense of humor ' files :
There are a lot of things that can be said about OpenBSD releases .
For one , they 're always entertaining .
Today , OpenBSD 4.5 is officially being released along with a new song to promote the open source operating system release .
Yes this BSD has its own song , for the 4.4 release it was the ' Trial of the BDS Knights ' ( a Star Wars spoof ) .
From a technical point of view , the new release includeS updated hardware and driver support ( including support of SDHC flash media now ) and a whole lot of packages .
The release notes claim , over 5500 ports and minor robustness improvements in package tools . "
On the new hardware side the interesting thing to me is an initial port to the ARM based OpenMoko
platform , which could mean we might see OpenBSD on handheld devices at some point soon .
Then of course there is OpenSSH , which is the flagship feature of OpenBSD in many ways ( even though OpenSSH is now widely deployed on nearly all * nix systems ) .
OpenSSH 5.2 is included in OpenBSD 4.5 , providing new command line features and a number of key bug fixes .
All right enough of the details , back to the song .
OpenBSD has no love of Microsoft and they are frequent targets of OpenBSD 's songs .
With the Tron theme of this release ( good timing since TR2N is coming soon ) , they 've woven in that distate with the ' user ' and ' motherboard ' ideas .
Here 's one of my favorite sections :
Yes I 'm a user
And I 'm not the only one
I 'm not a loser
With help from Puffy Tron
It 's a busy time in the BSD community for sure .
Just yesterday , NetBSD 5.0 and a DragonFly BSD release came out and FreeBSD 7.2 is in the works too .
In my mind , there are few higher callings in the baking world than cookies , and simply no higher cookie callings than shortbread , so I can not think of a better place to start my Week - O - Cookies .
They are firm enough to pack in a tin but manage to taste soft .
Bites seem to dissipate in your mouth , but not so quickly that you feel you were shorted .
They get better with age–and really , who does n’t want that ?
And while I will never , ever ( ever ) complain about a plain one made with some of that Danish butter with sea salt flecks , I ’m continually impressed by the myriad of ways shortbread can be adapted and still be as delicious as the original .
Dorie Greenspan ’s Espresso- Chocolate Shortbread are an awesome example of this , and were the first time I have had a coffee - flavored cookie that really , truly tasted first and foremost like coffee .
The tiny chocolate bits are reminiscent of Everyone ’s Favorite Dorie Cookie , the World Peace variety , but even cooler in this because they ’re more contrasted to the cookie flavor .
But here is where I tell you the secret that I hope will blow your mind , even though I have n’t tried it myself–yet .
Toffee - Coffee .
I mean , how amazing would that be ?
Specifically I ’m thinking of one of my favorite readily - available toffee chocolate bar , Ghiradelli ’s Toffee Interlude .
And look at that –exactly the four ounces the recipe requires !
I consider it a sign , kismet .
Do tell me if you try the coffee - toffee combination .
Though it ’s hard for me to imagine these cookies getting any better , this might be their only chance .
And every cookie deserves a chance , right ?
Smitten Kitchen Went to Aruba and All I Got Were These Lousy Cookies !
Deb and Alex have flown the snowy , slushy and biting cold coop this week for warm , sandy island shores and countless tubes of SPF 50 , so comment responses are going to be slow until they return .
In our absence , we leave you with a Week of Cookies –this is recipe one of four .
One year ago : Zucchini Latkes
Espresso-Chocolate Shortbread Cookies
Adapted from Baking : From My Home to Yours
I have to admit that one of the coolest things about this is the rolling - in - a - bag technique .
Why have I never thought of this before ?
This is a common refrain whenever I make Dorie recipes .
Makes 42 cookies
1 tablespoon ( about 4 grams ) instant espresso powder
1 tablespoon ( 15 ml ) boiling water
2 sticks ( 8 ounces or 225 grams ) unsalted butter , at room temperature
2/3 cup ( 80 grams ) confectioners ’ sugar
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon coarse , sea or kosher salt
2 cups ( 250 grams ) all - purpose flour
4 ounces ( 115 grams ) bittersweet chocolate ( plain , or a toffee variety ) , finely chopped , or 3/ 4 cup store - bought mini chocolate chips
Confectioners ’ sugar , for dusting ( optional )
1. Dissolve the espresso in the boiling water , and set aside to cool to tepid .
2. Working with a stand mixer , preferably fitted with a paddle attachment , or with a hand mixer in a large bowl , beat the butter and confectioners ’ sugar together on medium speed for about 3 minutes , until the mixture is very smooth .
Beat in the vanilla , espresso and salt , then reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour , mixing only until it disappears into the dough .
Do n’t work the dough much once the flour is incorporated .
Fold in the chopped chocolate with a sturdy rubber spatula .
3 . Using the spatula , transfer the soft , sticky dough to a gallon - size zipper - lock plastic bag .
Put the bag on a flat surface , leaving the top open , and roll the dough into a 9 x 10 1 / 2 inch rectangle that ’s 1/4 inch thick .
As you roll , turn the bag occasionally and lift the plastic from the dough so it does n’t cause creases .
When you get the right size and thickness , seal the bag , pressing out as much air as possible , and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours , or for up to 2 days .
4. Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats .
5 . Put the plastic bag on a cutting board and slit it open .
Turn the firm dough out onto the board ( discard the bag ) and , using a ruler as a guide and a sharp knife , cut the dough into 1 1/2 - inch squares .
Transfer the squares to the baking sheets and carefully prick each one twice with a fork , gently pushing the tines through the cookies until they hit the sheet .
6 . Bake for 18 to 20 minutes , rotating the sheets from top to bottom and front to back at the midway point .
The shortbreads will be very pale–they should n’t take on much color .
Transfer the cookies to a rack .
7 . If you ’d like , dust the cookies with confectioners ’ sugar while they are still hot .
Cool the cookies to room temperature before serving .

Dylan Thuras is a guest blogger on Boing Boing .
Dylan is a travel blogger and the co-founder of the Atlas Obscura : A Compendium of the World 's Wonders , Curiosities , and Esoterica , with Joshua Foer .
As one who answers the Call of Cthulhu , I have a special interest in locations that have to do with Lovecraft or the Cthulhu mythos .
Risking my grasp on reality and sanity I have assembled three places that display the distinct geometry of evil that occurs when Lovecraft and the Atlas Obscura meet :
The Witch House , Salem
The home of Jonathan Corwin , one of the judges involved in the Salem Witch Trials , which sentenced nineteen " witches " to hang and crushed one man to death in an attempt to make him confess to witchery .
It is the only structure left with direct ties to the Salem witchcraft trials of 1692 and referenced in Lovecraft 's " Dreams in the Witch House . "
Danvers State Hospital for the Criminally Insane
The insane asylum was the basis for Arkham Sanatarium in H.P. Lovcraft 's Horror stories and Batman 's Arkham asylum but is now a horrifying condo .
However a nearby cemetery where the residents of Danvers were buried went unmolested by the condo developers and is worth a visit .
The hospital is referenced in " The Shadow Over Innsmouth " and " Pickman 's Model . "
Atlantic Ave. Tunnel
The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel was built in 1844 , and is possibly the worlds oldest subway tunnel .
The tunnel lay sealed and hidden under the busy Brooklyn street for almost 140 years until it was rediscovered by a twenty year old in 1980 .
One can take a tour of the site , which the discoverer of the tunnel still gives .
Be prepared to enter via manhole in the middle of Atlantic Ave .
Referenced ( not by name , but Lovecraft was likely referring to it ) as the location of devil worshippers in " The Horror at Redhook . "

Add Port Knocking to SSH for Extra Security
Written by Mark Sanborn : Apr 2 , 2008
SSH by default is very strong .
It has protection against various hacks and known vulnerabilities .
For instance SSH has a password retry wait time of five seconds .
This makes the time for brute force attacking an SSH server very long and probably not effective .
However , sometimes script kiddies will fork their hacking program making multiple processes of the brute force attack .
Sometimes they are able to fork it off upwards of 1000 attempts every 5 seconds .
This drastically minimizes the time to crack short passwords .
If you think your users may have weak short passwords you may consider using public key authentication instead of passwords .
Fortuantely SSH comes with a limit on how many connections you allow at once .
I believe the default configuration only allows for 40 connections .
This along with public key authentication should be enough security to ward of any intrusion attempts .
But , what if there was a better way ?
What if there was a way for the SSH server to appear to not exist ?
Well you can make SSH appear to not exist by simply changing the default port to a random port , maybe port 1027 .
Since port 1027 is not a known SSH port people at first glance will not associate it with an SSH server .
However , modern day port scanners can tell not only what ports are open but they can also tell the intruder what service is running on that port .
Some port scanners can even list all known vulnerabilities for that service .
In fact this is how almost all worms spread themselves .
They scan for known open ports and then run a plethora of scripts to attempt to exploit the running service .
With knowledge of the specific port and service that is open , hackers have what they need to start looking for exploits , vulnerabilites or ways to brute force attack your service or in this case SSH server .
This is where the beauty of port knocking comes in .
With port knocking you block all incomming traffic to all ports , or in this case SSH .
Now when someone tries to do a port scan on port 22 or any other port for that matter they will see absolutely nothing .
It will be like the computer does n’t exist .
Even YOU cannot connect to the SSH server on port 22 .
All requests will be denied .
How do I gain access then ?
You will use a knockd server on the remote server running SSH that will monitor all ports at the link layer .
It will be waiting for a special “ knock ” .
It will be waiting for you to attempt to gain access to X amount of ports within X seconds .
The definition of a valid knock is arbitrary , and up to the implementer .
A knock might be , a syn packet sent to these closed ports :
Port 3000 , 3001 , 8000 , 7555 within 4 seconds .
If anyone does the specified knock within the designated time they will be allowed temporary access to port 22 for their IP address .
Once the port is opened it does n’t mean you have access to that computer .
You will still have to then connect via SSH and login with your password or private key .
Port knocking is just an added layer of protection .
It is not intended to be a replacement for authentication .
Although port knocking is awesome technology it is not for services that are intended for public use .
Its more for remote administrators that want to access the server without exposing ports generally for private use .
Setting it up on FreeBSD 7.0
`# cd /usr / ports / security / knock
make install clean`
Create edit /usr / local/etc/knockd.conf
[ options ] logfile = /var/log/knockd.log interface = xl0 [ openSSH ] sequence = 7000,8000,9000 seq_timeout = 5 command = / sbin / ipfw -q add 00101 pass proto tcp src-ip %IP % dst- port 22 tcpflags = syn [ closeSSH ] sequence = 9000,8000,7000 seq_timeout = 5 command = / sbin / ipfw -q delete 00101 pass proto tcp src-ip %IP % dst- port 22 tcpflags = syn
Now edit your / etc/rc.conf and add these three lines to turn the firewall on
# Enable Firewal firewall_enable = " YES " firewall_type= " open "
Available values for firewall_type :
open – pass all traffic .
client – will protect only this machine .
simple – protect the whole network .
closed – entirely disables IP traffic except for the loopback interface .
UNKNOWN – disables the loading of firewall rules .
filename – absolute path of file containing firewall rules .
_ Note :
If you do n’t specify the firewall type it will default to deny all .
This is basically like turning of your internet .
We do n’t usually want this so set it to open for now .
Later you will want to make a file with your specific settings ._
Now do a reboot .
When it is rebooting you should now see something like this :
ipfw2 initialized , divert disabled , rule - based forwarding disabled , open , logging disabled
Type this in as root to add a firewall rule on the fly :
ipfw -q add 00102 deny tcp from any to any 22
This will block all incoming traffic to port 22 .
You can now test to make sure .
Try to open up an SSH connection from another machine .
If you get a network error or connection refused the firewall is working .
Now you need to make sure you can open that port by knocking .
Make sure knockd is started by typing as root :
knockd
Now according to our /usr / local/etc/knockd.conf it will run the following command when we do a successful port knock :
/ sbin/ipfw -q add 00101 pass proto tcp src-ip %IP % dst-port 22
Notice how the number is 00101 .
This comes before our previous rule we put in that had the number , 00102 .
You see , ipfw checks rule number one if it passes it goes to the next rule and so on until it reaches the end of the config file .
You can look at your current firewall rules by typing :
# ipfw list
Setting it up on Linux
Since installation of knock will determined by your distribution ’s package management software and configuring knockd is pretty much the same in Linux I wo n’t go into detail .
For Debian based systems it should be something like this :
apt - get install knockd
The configuration file for knockd will most likely be in /etc /
The other difference between Linux and FreeBSD is that linux by default usually uses iptables as their firewall instead of ipfw .
So you will need to modify your knock config file to have iptables commands instead of ipfw commands .
[ options ] logfile = /var/log/knockd.log [ SSH ] sequence = 7000,8000,9000 seq_timeout = 5 command = / sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s %IP % -p tcp -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT tcpflags = syn cmd_timeout = 10 stop_command = /sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP % -p tcp -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT
Doing the Knocking from Windows
To do the knocking for Windows I usually use KnockKnock .
Run KnockKnock.exe you should get something like this :
You should now be able to connect with PuTTY .
If do a ipfw list you should see something similar to this :
00100 allow ip from any to any via lo0 00101 allow ip from any to any proto tcp src-ip 192.168.1.103 dst-port 22 00102 deny tcp from any to any dst- port 22 00200 deny ip from any to 127.0.0.0/8 00300 deny ip from 127.0.0.0/ 8 to any 65000 allow ip from any to any 65535 deny ip from any to any
Notice how it only opened port 22 to my ip only , not to the entire world .

The Somali pirates attacking shipping in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean are directed to their targets by a " consultant " team in London , according to a European military intelligence document obtained by a Spanish radio station .
The document , obtained by Cadena SER radio , says the team and the pirates remain in contact by satellite telephone .
It says that pirate groups have " well - placed informers " in London who are in regular contact with control centres in Somalia where decisions on which vessels to attack are made .
These London - based " consultants " help the pirates select targets , providing information on the ships ' cargoes and courses .
In at least one case the pirates have remained in contact with their London informants from the hijacked ship , according to one targeted shipping company .
The pirates ' information network extends to Yemen , Dubai and the Suez canal .
The intelligence report is understood to have been issued to European navies .
" The information that merchant ships sailing through the area volunteer to various international organisations is ending up in the pirates ' hands , " Cadena SER reported the report as saying .
This enables the more organised pirate groups to study their targets in advance , even spending several days training teams for specific hijacks .
Senior pirates then join the vessel once it has been sailed close to Somalia .
Captains of attacked ships have found that pirates know everything from the layout of the vessel to its ports of call .
Vessels targeted as a result of this kind of intelligence included the Greek cargo ship Titan , the Turkish merchant ship Karagol and the Spanish trawler Felipe Ruano .
In each case , says the document , the pirates had full knowledge of the cargo , nationality and course of the vessel .
The national flag of a ship is also taken into account when choosing a target , with British vessels being increasingly avoided , according to the report .
It was not clear whether this was because pirates did not want to draw the attention of British police to their information sources in London .
European countries have set up Operation Atalanta to co-ordinate their military efforts in the area .

Reader , [ Matthias_H ] , sent in a video about his USB adapter for SNES game carts .
All you have to do is plug in the SNES game cartridge and USB cable , then a ROM file of the game shows up as an external storage device on your computer .
After that , you can play the ROM with your choice of emulator .
We emailed [ Matthias ] asking for more information , and he quickly replied with a very nice writeup about the hack that is pasted below .
Update : [ Matthias ] launched a site for the “ snega2usb ” with updates on the development of the board and a FAQ .
[ Matthias ] writes :
Part list :
Atmel AT90USBKey Evaluation Board ( Digikey – $ 30 )
FCI 10046971-003LF 70 - pos. 2 - row connector ( Digikey – $ 4.76 )
a little piece of prototyping board to solder the connector onto
thousands of little wires
I used the following reference documents :
http://www.emulatronia.com/doctec/consolas/snes/sneskart.html
( SNES cart pinout and ROM memory map )
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/firmware/fatgen.mspx
( FAT16 /32 specs )
The somewhat ugly cable solution is due to the USBKey ’s weird choice for .05 ″ pitch port connectors , for which I was not able to find suitable pin headers and ribbon cable connectors .
The exact pinout is a bit weird and not worth publishing yet , since many of the I/ O pins are in fact shared by the onboard peripherals , so I have to spread the address and data bits among the available pins .
A cleaner version with all parts on a custom PCB is on its way , as well as support for the Sega Genesis ( working hard towards the all - in - one solution :-) )
Code is based on the Atmel USB Mass Storage example app , to which I added a module for ROM access and a read - only FAT16 ( the latter was hard - coded in a hex editor – FUN ! ) .
Again , development is still at a very early stage ( I tested this on exactly one game cart ) , and as of now , redistribution of the source is in fact prohibited by Atmel ’s proprietary license .
I ’m not quite satisfied with the data rate yet .
As of now , newer - generation console carts ( N64 etc ) , while absolutely possible to read out , would take forever to load .
The device is running at USB 2.0 full - speed ( 12 Mbps ) , and I am not aware of any cheap solution that offers high - speed USB ( 480 Mbps ) .
Open issues :
– testing with as many different games as possible ( feel free to donate your least favorite game carts ! :-) )
– issuing a refresh when the cartridge is removed / replaced !
The USB Mass Storage protocol uses the SCSI command set , so the device cannot send requests ( “ refresh directory , file may have changed ” ) to the host .
– optimization for speed
– add compatibility for HiROM games
By the way , I ’ve never done anything like this before .
The fact that it was so easy kind of scares the hell out of me ;-)
I think this is as exhaustive a description as I can give for now .
Hope you ’re fine with it .

CAIRO - Osama bin Laden threatened Americans in a new audio recording aired Wednesday , saying President Barack Obama inflamed hatred toward the United States by ordering Pakistan to crack down on militants in Swat Valley and block Islamic law there .
The al Qaeda leader claimed U.S. pressure led to a campaign of " killing , fighting , bombing and destruction " that prompted the exodus of a million people from Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan .
The message was broadcast on Al - Jazeera Television around the same time Obama touched down in Saudi Arabia at the start of a Middle East visit .
He is trying repair relations with the Muslim world frayed under the previous Bush administration .
" Elderly people , children and women fled their homes and lived in tents as refugees after they have lived in dignity in their homes , " bin Laden said .
" Let the American people be ready to reap what the White House leaders have sown , " he added .
" Obama and his administration have sown new seeds to increase hatred and revenge on America , " bin Laden said .
" The number of these seeds is equal to the number of displaced people from Swat Valley . "
Pakistan 's military offensive to expel the Taliban from Swat Valley was launched in late April after the militants abandoned a peace deal with the government that gave them control of the region .
The offensive , strongly backed by Washington , is seen as a test of Pakistan 's resolve against militants in the northwestern border region near Afghanistan .
Pakistanis tired of militant attacks in the country that have killed hundreds of civilians have also supported the campaign .
But the fighting has uprooted some three million people .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , in Saudi Arabia with Obama , said al Qaeda obviously is seeking to shift attention away from what he called the president 's historic efforts to have an open dialogue with the Muslim world .
He said the White House was not surprised bin Laden released the message just as Obama was preparing to deliver a major speech on U.S. relations with the Muslim world .
Obama advisers have not yet been able to completely review the tape , but found it consistent with past bin Laden messages , he said .
Richard Holbrooke , U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , promptly dismissed suggestions that anyone but al Qaeda and the Taliban are responsible for the refugee crisis in Pakistan .
He spoke during a visit to Islamabad .
" This entire problem began with al Qaeda and its associates and everybody in the world knows that .
It 's silly indeed to respond to such a ludicrous charge , " Holbrooke said at a joint news conference with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari .
Bin Laden focused entirely on Pakistan , claiming Zardari was paid by the White House to start the crackdown .
Al - Jazeera aired excerpts of the tape and did not say how it was obtained .
The authenticity of the tape could not be immediately verified .
Bin Laden , whose last message was released in mid-March , has been sparing in his criticism of Obama in the past .
In January , he said only that the U.S. president had received a " heavy inheritance " from his predecessor .
However , his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri has repeatedly condemned Obama , even using racial slurs .
Bin Laden 's message followed just hours after al - Zawahri criticized Obama 's scheduled speech Thursday to the Islamic world from Cairo , saying it will not change the " bloody messages " the U.S. military is sending Muslims in American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Tapping a long , successful track record and a growing urgency to increase renewables generation worldwide , geothermal project activity is escalating significantly after relatively slow growth over the past two decades .
Attractive for its unique combination of baseload power , cost - competitiveness and zero-emissions , geothermal power is gaining increased attention from governments and the private sector as a renewable generation technology with scaling potential .
With a 40 - year commercial track record and plants installed in over 20 countries , geothermal has established itself as a proven , bankable and cost - competitive renewable power generation technology for utility - scale applications .
Even following the significant downturn in global energy prices during the second half of 2008 and early 2009 , there remains great expectations for geothermal ’s long - term cost - competitiveness as global demand for energy escalates .
In addition , the proliferation of carbon and renewable polices throughout key markets , technological advances , and developer forays into new markets indicate the next decade will be a far more sustained and substantial period of growth .
The global geothermal pipeline now exceeds 9 GW of projects under development .
This is equivalent to approximately 80 % of total global installed capacity built up over the past three decades .
According to EER ’s market forecasts , the global geothermal industry will more than triple from its current installed base from 10.5 GW to over 31 GW by 2020 .
In addition , according to EER , geothermal power plant investment could reach between US $ 13 billion and US $ 19.9 billion annually by 2020 .
Exhibit 1 - 1 : Global Geothermal Industry Evolution by Market , 1970 –2015

Geothermal Market Development Trends
There are over 215 commercial geothermal projects operating in 24 countries with a cumulative installed capacity of approximately 10.5 GW worldwide .
The vast majority of generation capacity is concentrated in a handful of countries : the U.S. , the Philippines , Indonesia , Mexico , Iceland and New Zealand .
While these established markets will continue to account for the overwhelming majority of geothermal growth in the short term , several earlier - stage markets , including Chile , Argentina , Turkey , Russia , Central America and East Africa , are looking to exploit robust geothermal resource potential as power generation demand and global fuel price volatility escalates .

U.S. to Lead Global Geothermal Development Activity
The U.S. is currently the world ’s top geothermal market , with approximately 3 GW of installed capacity .
With a pipeline of more than 4.4 GW of confirmed projects , the U.S. is poised to more than double existing capacity over the next five years .
The backbone of the U.S. geothermal build - out resurgence is the confluence of multiple factors pointing toward increased renewables penetration in the US power generation market .
State Renewable Portfolio Standards ( RPS ) demand , increased natural gas price fluctuation and a rapid acceleration of pushback against the permitting of new coal - fired power plants have all opened a clear market opportunity for geothermal growth .
Challenges lie ahead , as transmission build - out necessary to access increased geothermal resources remains uncertain , and the looming economic crisis limits capital expenditures and depresses natural fuel prices .
Nevertheless , the long - term outlook for U.S. geothermal market growth is extremely positive , with the U.S. geothermal market poised to triple over the next decade .
U.S. geothermal activity is concentrated in a few western U.S. states , which are home to vast reserves of U.S. hydrothermal resource .
Developers are focused on large , robust pockets of geothermal resources concentrated in two states : California and Nevada .
Geothermal Activity in the Rest of the World
Outside of the U.S. , project development momentum is building in regions with substantial geothermal resources .
Southeast Asian leaders Indonesia and the Philippines are poised to ramp - up their geothermal capacity in the near term .
A decade after the Asian currency crisis brought geothermal development to a halt , the region has emerged with a growing thirst for power , and has prioritized geothermal as a key source of new build capacity .
Outside of the U.S. and Southeast Asia , the markets of Japan , Iceland , Italy , and Mexico account for over 65 % of remaining global installed geothermal capacity .
Although these markets have seen relatively limited growth over the past few years , greater urgency to advance low - carbon baseload power generation is helping re-ignite new capacity growth in these markets .
Moreover , attention is turning to new markets , with Chile , Turkey , Russia , Nicaragua , Germany , Australia , and East Africa all poised for growth , as greater attention is paid to renewables to diversify the energy mix and hedge against volatile natural gas .

A Lebanese prosecutor has charged a former general and three other people with spying for Israel .
Former Brig Gen Adeeb Al - Alam is accused of sending classified information to the Israeli secret service , Mossad .
The information came from Lebanon 's Internal Security Forces headquarters .
He has been arrested with his wife and nephew , who are also charged .
The authorities are still seeking a fourth person charged with involvement .
The case has been transferred to a military court , and Gen Alam and his co-accused could face the death penalty if they are found guilty .
An Israeli government spokesman said it was their policy not to comment on such cases .
The BBC's Natalia Antelava in Beirut says the retired general is thought to be the most senior member of the group .
He ran an agency which brought Asian domestic workers to Lebanon .
But he also kept an office at the headquarters of Lebanon 's Internal Security Forces .
Prosecutors allege the general used the office to send classified information on to the Mossad .
Lebanese media say Gen Alam is believed to have been spying for Israel since 1984 .
While most of the media are hailing the arrest as a major achievement , our correspondent says there are people who question why it took Lebanese intelligence so long to track down the suspects .

One big difference between the current - generation consoles ?
The quality of the texture work in the game .
LensofTruth did a very eye - opening comparison of the different versions of the game and they came to a single conclusion : avoid the PS3 version if you have a 360 .
" The big issue was in the texture quality , and let me tell you it was a huge difference !
The texture quality for the PlayStation 3 left us shaking our heads in disbelief , " the site explained .
" This went beyond the traditional consoles rendering textures differently , as we 've seen in other Head2 Heads , the PlayStation 3 seemed to have ?
the texture quality of the Xbox 360 and in other areas , even less .
This was present on all the PlayStation 3 textures , normal maps , spec maps , light maps , etc. even the dynamic shadow maps looked blocky and half the quality of the Xbox 360 . "
Even worse , the compression added to the PS3 textures resulting in bad banding and blockiness that " could n't be ignored . "
The site has a number of rollovers to show the difference in the graphical quality , and it 's rather striking .
The PS3 also suffers from a mandatory install that does n't seem to decrease the loading times from the 360 version .
In other words , you 'll be eating hard drive space without a marked decrease in loading time .
Not good .
It also appears as if the game is running at a lower resolution on the PS3 .
What 's even more surprising ?
Sony is publishing the game in Europe as a timed exclusive .
It looks like if gamers in Europe want the best version of the game , they 're going to have to wait .
Update : A few things .
First , people are saying these tests are being performed on pre-release software that is n't yet finished .
To prove that is n't the case , I 'll include a picture of both copies of the game , and my card .
As you can see , this is retail product .
Someone else said that I had n't played the PS3 version , or I would have seen this myself .
That 's a good point .
I played the 360 version for the review , and basically installed the PS3 version and ran around the firehouse for a few minutes just to check the game out .
It looks okay by itself , but when you get used to the 360 version and go back , you can definitely see the difference in quality show in the above story .
I also have an HDMI switcher that allows me to switch the systems back and forth , and yes , those comparisons are legit .
Even more damning ?
This began to happen when I played the game .

Ouch .
Furk is not your regular torrent site .
Not only does it function as a meta - search engine , but you can also download ' torrents ' via Furk 's servers using HTTP .
And it does n't stop there .
Furk holds these downloads in a searchable database that anyone can use , turning the site into a kind of mashup between BitTorrent and Rapidshare .
In the regular BitTorrent downloading scenario we would go to a torrent site such as The Pirate Bay or Mininova , select a torrent and download it .
Once that torrent starts running in our client , connections are made to other people using the same technique and the content is downloaded and shared with and via those ‘ peers ’ .
This type of file - sharing is very effective – indeed , it ’s what BitTorrent is all about .
However , there are those who would prefer to stop or hinder such P2P traffic – certain ISPs take measures to identify BitTorrent protocol traffic and slow it down with a process known as ‘ throttling ’ .
While Furk.net can simply be used as a torrent meta - search engine to trawl other sites for . torrent files , to combat throttling ( and privacy concerns )
Furk bills part of its service as a ‘ BitTorrent Proxy ’ .
This means that instead of searching for a torrent file and downloading in the usual manner via the BitTorrent protocol , instead Furk itself joins the swarm in question and downloads the material directly to their own servers .
Once completed , users can simply download that material directly from Furk ’s super - fast network using the HTTP protocol in their regular web browser .
Identical to standard web traffic , HTTP generally is n’t throttled by ISPs , allowing the user to download more quickly than with throttled BitTorrent .
In the less likely event that an ISP tries to slow down HTTP , downloads can be made from Furk using HTTPs .
“ By default all links are HTTPs , ” Furk admin told TorrentFreak .
“ It helps to avoid content filtering systems and increase the level of anonymity .
Also for every link the user can choose an alternative link with a non-standard port . ”
This element of the service is only available to premium users at a few euros per month but free users can still have fun with Furk .
It ’s also possible to upload your own files and videos to the service , but Furk has another much more interesting trick up its sleeve – and it ’s available to non-premium users .
Instead of just keeping the content on their servers for material requested by you , Furk keeps the content requested by everyone .
This means that Furk has a growing database of material culled from torrent sites , but offered via direct and immediate HTTP download .
A search for ‘ aXXo ’ shows hundreds of releases , mostly available for direct download .
Think of it like Rapidshare , but with a BitTorrent backend .
“ Speed for premium users is unlimited .
All of the servers are on a 1 Gps network and we have plenty of unused bandwidth , ” Furk admin told Torrent Freak .
“ Free downloads are currently limited only by restricting the number of download sessions , so download managers can be used only with premium accounts . ”
However , even with no premium account , some impressive speeds can be achieved .
We managed decent transfers from The Netherlands , Russia and the US , before finally maxing out a 20 mbit Hungarian connection .
It remains to be seen if these speeds can be maintained once the masses start hitting the service – probably not , since there needs to be something to draw users to the premium service , but time will tell .
A while back , manga editor at , contacted us about the ongoing case of Christopher Handley .
As you may know , Handley currently faces up to 20 years in prison for the possession of allegedly obscene manga .
Carl was concerned about the ramifications of Handley 's case , not just on Handley himself , but on all of us .
I think his concern is a very legitimate one , the case against Handley could set a precedent that will affect a lot of collectors and consumers of illustrated and animated material .
After a bit of discussion , Carl was invited to write an editorial on the subject that would be posted on ANN .
Shortly thereafter , author of the Manga : The Complete Guide , expressed his interest in also addressing the subject .
I do n't think very many people would disagree when I say that Carl and Jason are two of the most respected individuals in the North American manga industry .
If I could choose any two people in the world to write an editorial foron this subject , it would be Carl and Jason .
And that 's just what I present to you today , Carl and Jason 's thoughts on this case , and how you can make a difference .
The e-cigarette from Thanko plugs into your computer 's USB port and offers puffers a genuine smoking experience ... without all the nicotine , tar , ashes , smell and , er , smoke .
The busy bees over at TokyoMango are in the habit of finding new and interesting Japanese stuff so it's no surprise they 're featuring the amusing and addictive USB Cigarette .
Made by Japan's
Thanko , the so - called " e- cigarette " comes about as close to approximating the experience of smoking as one can get without actually lighting up .
Actually , the e-cig DOES light up - via a tiny red LED embedded in its tip .
The USB cigarette is not a toy though it 's not a real cigarette either .
It might even have a practical purpose : many ex-smokers miss more than the buzz of the nicotine ; the physical mechanics of smoking itself are said to be habit forming .
With the e-cigarette you get the look , the feel , even the sight of " smoke " being exhaled with every puff !
Here 's how it works ... the " cigarette " comes in 3 parts : a filter , a sprayer and a body with a rechargeable battery inside and an LED on its end .
Use the included cable to plug the cigarette into your computer 's USB port - it takes 2 - 3 hours for a full charge .
Unplug , inhale and enjoy !
The sprayer / filter combo provides enough " mist " for about 150 draws and you get 11 filters ( a pack of 10 plus 1 additional ) with each order .
You can also buy replacement packs of 10 filters in regular or mint flavor .
The complete package costs 2,980 yen ( about $ 31 ) and the extra filter packs are 980 yen ( about $ 10 ) each , available direct from Thanko 's product page .
Wacky tabbacky was never so much fun !
Well , almost .
EDITOR'S NOTE : These Fake Cigarettes are not nearly as realistic as the LED Cigarette but easily obtainable in the U.S .
PulpTunes is a free software program for Microsoft Windows that offers music serving capabilities to stream music over the Internet .
Apple iTunes is one of the most popular music managers and players .
While it can be used to play music locally , it does not offer any means to play music over the Internet which might be interesting for users who work on different computer systems , e.g. a home computer and one at the office .
Pulptunes is a iTunes music server that can stream mp3 and m4a files over the Internet .
The music can then be accessed in any modern web browser including Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , Mozilla Firefox or Opera .
Basically , what it enables you to do is access your iTunes music library over the Internet , provided that the computer that iTunes is installed on is connected to the Internet and pulpTunes is running on it .
Pulptunes
PulpTunes is available for Windows operating systems and also Linux and Macintosh .
The software program tries to find the location of the iTunes XML file automatically on first start .
This worked fine on our test system , but if that does not work for whatever reason , there is an option to add the path to the file manually .
Songs can be played directly in the web browser or downloaded with a right - click .
All iTunes playlists and genres are available in the interface which makes it easier to locate albums or songs .
A search is also provided to search the music collection .
Advanced options are available that include a basic user management so that only authorized users have access to the web service .

The accusations made news , but with another dismissal of an ethics charge last week against Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the former Republican vice - presidential nominee has quietly been cleared of every ethics complaint filed since the torrent of allegations began in 2008 .
Mrs. Palin , who became a target of such complaints after being named Sen .
John McCain ’s running mate , is 14 - for - 14 in fighting off the complaints .
She ’s been cleared of 13 charges by the independent State Personnel Board and of another complaint by the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) .
After the latest complaint in Alaska was dismissed last week , Mrs. Palin ’s team said that having to fend off the pile of accusations was wasting state money .
“ This complaint cost the governor personally , and the state of Alaska , thousands of dollars to address , ” said Thomas Van Flein , the governor ’s attorney .
“ It is regrettable that the ethics process has been diverted for partisan purposes by some , but it is also commendable that the board remains focused on the law . ”
The floodgates opened after Mrs. Palin was tapped by Mr. McCain of Arizona and she was accused of abusing power by firing state Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan .
Four complaints related to this matter were filed to the personnel board .
One of them was filed by the governor as a means of self - disclosure .
In the end , no violation was found .
Even after the election was over , the stream of complaints continued .
Alaska residents challenged Mrs. Palin ’s trips out of state to attend a campaign event for Sen.
Saxby Chambliss , Georgia Republican , and to speak at a pro-life breakfast in Indiana , as well as for conducting television interviews in her state office .
The latest complaint to be decided was filed by Anchorage resident Linda Kellen Biegel , who took issue with Mrs. Palin for wearing to a public function a jacket made by a company that sponsored the governor ’s husband , Todd , a snow machine racer .
Ms. Biegel asked the personnel board to determine whether Mrs. Palin was abusing her position to serve her personal and financial interests .
Mrs. Palin called the complaint “ asinine political grandstanding , ” and the board ’s independent investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing .
“ My investigation has uncovered no evidence that the governor or her husband received anything of value in exchange for the governor wearing the Team Arctic jacket when she acted as the official starter of the 2009 Iron Dog , ” said Thomas Daniel , the investigator .
“ I also note that most jackets worn by Alaskans have a company name or logo on them . ”
( Corrected paragraph : )
The personnel board is a three - member panel of non-state workers who are appointed by the governor .
Mrs. Palin ’s predecessor appointed each of the three current members , Chairwoman Debra English , Laura Plenert and Alfred Tamagni Sr. , although Mrs. Palin reappointed Ms. English for another term in January 2008 .
Rules dictate that no more than two of the members can belong to the same political party .
Ms. English is a registered Republican ; Ms. Plenert and Mr. Tamagni have no declared party affiliation .
The personnel board normally would be expected to meet only two or three times a year , but their workload has increased because of the number of complaints filed .
Mrs. Palin said defending herself against the complaints has cost more than $ 500,000 , and she set up a legal defense fund to cover the costs .
Eagle River resident Kim Chatman challenged that move .
“ Governor Palin is perched to improperly receive an enormous amount of money for herself and her family and position a pool of pre-paid defense lawyers organized to deflect consequences of wrongdoings , ” Ms. Chatman said in the filing .
That complaint is still pending , though it ’s unclear whether other complaints are .
The personnel board is n’t supposed to talk about complaints until the matter has been resolved .
In the wake of the complaints , the personnel board sought to make the public aware of the cost of investigating the complaints .
Mr. Tamagni estimated that the board has spent “ close to a third of a million dollars . ”
One complaint did have some effect .
Like previous Alaska governors , Mrs. Palin took her children on plane trips to events to which her children were not specifically invited .
Though the personnel board did not find any violation of ethics rules , the governor volunteered to reimburse those expenses to the state .
The bill totaled $ 20,012 .
Ms. Biegel , who blogs about politics from a Democratic perspective under the name Celtic Diva and was selected by the Democratic National Committee to represent Alaska bloggers at the 2008 convention , said the state offers no other options to challenge the actions of elected officials .
“ It ’s the only way we can ask the question basically , ” Ms. Biegel said .
Ms. Biegel publicized her complaint on her blog with a press release , although parties involved in the filings are not supposed to discuss them with the public .
“ I wanted to have a record so people would know there was one out there and it could n’t just disappear , ” she said .
Kay Brown , communications director for the Alaska Democratic Party , said Ms. Biegel had no formal connection to the party and Alaska Democrats did not have a role in any of the complaints filed against the governor .
She did , however , think there was reason for the complaints and raised the issue of the governor ’s forthcoming autobiography and travel to out - of - state political events .
“ How is this benefiting the people of Alaska in her duties as governor ?
It seems like there is a disconnect there , ” Ms. Brown said .
“ Since Palin has put herself in the national spotlight more questions have been raised about her use of office for personal advancement that were n’t there before . ”
In the federal complaint , the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked the FEC to rule on whether Mrs. Palin violated campaign spending laws after the Republican Party bought clothes for her during the presidential campaign .
The FEC ruled in May that a prohibition on candidates using campaign money for personal expenses does n’t apply to parties .

Imagine saving enough money to buy the love of your life a beautiful diamond ring only to drop it off the Brooklyn Bridge just as she agrees to marry you .
A local groom - to - be experienced the horror for himself .
Don Walling planned the day with the precision of a classroom lesson .
He would propose to his girlfriend , Gina Pellicani , on the Brooklyn Bridge ’s pedestrian walkway .
His family would be looking on and his sister - in - law would videotape the whole thing .
But at the moment of truth – with ring in hand – disaster struck , and it was n’t because Gina refused to say , “ I do . ”
Walling dropped the ring through a crack in the pedestrian bridge and into traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge roadway below .
“ I got on one knee , proposed and it just flew out , ” Walling said .
“ I watched it fall through the crack on the bridge , right between the wood planks . ”
But he did n’t let his shock sway him for long .
Walling swung into action .
“ I kissed her , said I was sorry and told her I am going to get that ring back , ” Walling said .
The groom - to - be jumped onto the bridge 's roadway and began looking for the ring .
Miraculously , he found it , with the help of his family and fiancée looking on from above .
Pellicani could n’t wear the ring because the band bent in the fall , but the diamonds were intact -- not bad for falling onto traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge .
The ring is being repaired and will be restored to its former luster , but Walling said the next time he gives it to his fiancée , it will be in the safety of his home .

Fenland potato farmers could be badly affected by water shortages
We are standing under endless Fenland skies .
It 's not yet Eight O Clock , but already the sun is warm and high .
We are surveying three fields on Duncan Worth 's farm .
Before us , glossy green potato plants with their scented white flowers ; to the left of us , maize to be used in power generation ; to the right of us , wheat .
" It 's been ideal growing weather recently , " Duncan says , " sunshine and the right amount of rain . "
But for how much longer ?
The hotter , drier summers predicted by climate change scientists could have a dramatic effect on this agricultural powerhouse of a region , and the thousands of jobs that it supports .
Where will the water come from to slake the thirst of these crops ?
Some crops , like potatoes , may have to be grown in other parts of the UK in future
Jerry Knox , Cranfield University
UK ' must plan ' for warmer future
We 're walking Duncan 's fields with Dr Jerry Knox from Cranfield University , an adviser to , among others , the British Potato Council , and with Andy Brown from Anglian Water .
So will there be enough water to sustain the plants of the future in this rich , light soil ?
" It 's not so much a resource issue as a policy issue , " says Dr Knox .
" In other words , whether we want food with a low environmental footprint .
" We already import strawberries and lettuce from Southern Europe , where businesses are at risk from water shortages .
We 're exporting much of the problem .
" But farmers here do realise that some crops , like potatoes , may have to be grown in other parts of the UK in future . "
" We 're worried about water ; we 're not confident , " says Mr Worth .
He and other farmers in the region are so concerned about the issue that they have started the Holbeach Marsh Water Transfer Project , looking at the feasibility of getting water from the River Welland to the marsh - making it accessible to agriculture .
But if projects like this proliferate in the future as water becomes more scarce , are we not robbing Peter to pay Paul ?
" There 's a fascinating triangle in the east of England between domestic use , agriculture and the environment , " says Mr Brown .
" There are 750 sites of special scientific interest in our region , a large number of which are wetlands - based .
We think we can get the balance right . "
But as we finish our walk and head off for a cup of tea , all agree that it will take planning and perhaps some sacrifice to meet the many demands on the increasingly precious resource of water .

America 's biggest carmaker , General Motors , declared itself bankrupt today in a legal filing at a federal courthouse in downtown Manhattan , kicking off the biggest industrial insolvency in US history .
GM filed for Chapter 11 protection against its creditors ' demands at 8 am local time after racking up losses of $ 81bn ( £ 50 bn ) over four years , putting a veteran bankruptcy judge , Robert Gerber , in charge of the future of 235,000 employees worldwide .
Speaking in Washington a few hours after the filing , Barack Obama said the GM restructuring plan was " tough but fair " .
He acknowledged that General Motors stakeholders – its parts suppliers , dealers , debt - holders , shareholders , workers and retirees – were making tough sacrifices to keep the company afloat .
" I want to be honest with you : building a leaner GM will come at a cost , " he said .
" You will have to make a sacrifice for the next generation so that our children can grow up in an America that still makes things . "
Based in Detroit , the 101 - year - old company is a stalwart of the US manufacturing base , producing vehicles with brands such as Chevrolet , Cadillac , Hummer , Opel and Vauxhall .
Its filing comes a month after its smaller rival Chrysler declared bankruptcy , leaving two of the top three American motor manufacturers under court protection .
GM will continue to manufacture and sell cars under bankruptcy and the US government is hoping for a swift , " surgical " process under which the company will emerge in smaller , streamlined form within 60 to 90 days .
Obama said the massive reorganisation of GM would leave the US government holding 60 % of the company 's equity .
But it was necessary to preserve an iconic symbol of American business and maintain a viable US auto industry .
At the White House , flanked by his economic advisers and cabinet secretaries , Obama reiterated that the government was a " reluctant " shareholder in General Motors , but said the alternative – extending more loans – would burden the new company with debt and would hinder its re-emergence as a viable company .
" I recognise that this may give some Americans pause , " he said .
" We 're making these investments not because I want to spend the American people 's tax dollars but because I want to protect them . "
GM is the largest industrial corporation ever to go bankrupt in the US and the third - largest bankruptcy of any sort , behind the investment bank Lehman Brothers and the telecommunications firm WorldCom .
GM 's chairman , Kent Kresa , said the board had authorised bankruptcy ‚ " with regret that this path proved necessary despite the best efforts of so many " .
He did his best to put a positive spin on the move , describing it as a " new beginning " for the company : " A court - ­supervised process and transfer of assets will enable a new GM to emerge as a stronger , healthier , more focused and nimbler company with a determination not to just survive but to excel . "
Judge Gerber , who will rule on the competing claims of GM 's creditors , is an old hand at high - profile insolvencies , having handled the bankruptcy of firms such as Adelphia and Global Crossing .
The carmaker has received $ 19bn of emergency aid from the treasury to keep it afloat and a further $ 30bn of government funding is likely to be forthcoming to see it through bankruptcy .
In return for its support , the Obama administration is likely to get a 60 % ownership stake in the company .
Canada 's government , which is contributing billions of dollars in further help , will get 12.5 % with unions and bondholders holding the rest .
Until it was overtaken by Toyota last year , GM was the largest carmaker in the world .
But the company has been hobbled by a collapse in demand for new vehicles from the US market , where industry - wide sales of cars have dropped from 17 m a year to fewer than 10m .
David Cole , chairman of the Michigan - based Center for Automotive Research , said last year 's soaring fuel prices proved to be the final straw , pushing customers towards smaller , more fuel - efficient vehicles from Asian manufacturers .
" The financial meltdown in the economy has driven the auto industry into depression , " he said .
" We have an auto depression , not a recession . "
To restore profitability , GM 's chief executive , Fritz Henderson , has made it clear that cuts will need to be deep and permanent .
He is selling chunks of the company dubbed " old GM " , including its European operation , which employs 5,500 people making Vauxhall cars in Britain .
Brands such as Saturn , Saab and Hummer are on the block and Pontiac , a sporty " muscle car " marque , is to close .
GM 's US manufacturing workforce is to shrink from 113,000 three years ago to just 38,000 by 2011 .
Scores of factories across the US are shutting for an extended summer break and GM is slashing its network of dealership showrooms by 40 % .
The extent of the government 's intervention in the motor industry has alarmed business organisations .
Thomas Donohue , president of the US Chamber of Commerce , warned today that GM would not prosper if it was run by the Obama administration and the United Auto Workers union .
" If members of Congress , along with government officials from the United States to Germany to Canada , are allowed undue influence over management 's decisions , then you can write this down : these companies will not return to profitability and their survival will be seriously challenged , " said Donohue .
Obama 's auto industry taskforce had initially hoped that GM could be kept afloat without going through bankruptcy .
But bondholders , who are owed $ 27bn by the carmaker , have been reluctant to swap their debt for a small equity stake .
Over the weekend , 54 % of these bondholders indicated that they were willing to accept an improved deal under which they could eventually get up to 25 % of GM , stoking optimism that the bankruptcy could proceed swiftly , without a long , drawn - out fight over assets that risked pushing the company into liquidation .
The 24 - page bankruptcy filing , which gives GM 's address as 300 Renaissance Centre , Detroit was lodged under the name of a Manhattan vehicle dealer , Chevrolet - Saturn of Harlem , which is owed money by the carmaker .
A list of GM 's largest debtors is topped by the Wilmington Trust Company of Delaware , which represents bondholders owed $ 22.7bn , followed by the United Auto Workers union on behalf of employees owed $ 20.5 bn .
Other claims include demands for money from the car rental firms Avis and Enterprise , the French advertising agency Publicis , the computer maker Hewlett - Packard , the oil firm Exxon Mobil and Lakshmi Mittal 's steel corporation , Arcelor Mittal .

In his latest instructional video , TRIADS : Painting with Three Colors , painter James Gurney explores three color palettes and gives a good introduction to the basic concepts of painting with limited palettes .
Though not specifically about triadic color schemes in the classic sense ( in which the colors are evenly spaced around the color wheel ) , his exploration of palettes with three colors points out one of the strengths of this approach : a palette of three colors can mix a broad range of additional colors , and yet remain manageable when you ’re trying to wrap your head around how to mix them .
( Like many painters , Gurney chooses to regard white as not a color , and I think wisely so . )
TRIADS is a follow up to Gurney ’s previous video , Color in Practice , Part 1 , Black , White , and Complements ( link is to my review ) , and serves as second in a planned series .
Here , he is painting with gouache , transparent watercolor and casein , but the principles are applicable to other mediums .
Initially painting with a palette of three colors similar to the cyan , magenta and yellow colors used in printing inks to produce a wide range of colors , he starts with a demo painting of brightly colored still life subjects in sunlight .
The initially chosen palette creates a broad gamut ( range of colors ) , but like any limited palette , has areas of weakness .
Gurney supplements the demo painting with the creation of a “ triad test ” , a simple diamond shaped set of test patches of the colors in the palette , and mixtures of the colors as well as tints ( the color plus white ) and mixtures of the tints .
He then moves on to a different set of “ primaries ” , richer in the colors that are weak in the previous palette , creates another “ triad test ” and goes back into the same demo painting , pointing out how the two palettes differ in areas of strength .
He goes on with other demos and studio exercises to explore various three color combinations — some unusual , using secondaries in place of primaries — as well as the creation of grays and low chroma colors from high chroma palettes , making swatches of test colors as he goes .
He goes through about ten demo paintings in the course of the video , some quite briefly , others in more depth .
As is often the case with Gurney ’s videos , I find myself learning from aspects of the visuals that are n’t specifically part of the video ’s primary subject .
At one point in the creation of grays from triads of colors , he makes a couple of grays in transparent watercolor by layering three transparent layers of pure color , one over another , letting them mix optically rather than mixing on the palette .
I found the resulting grayed tones particularly rich with subtle variations of color , and came away eager to experiment with that aspect of applying paint .
You ’ll find other off - topic but valuable painting techniques in the creation of the demos , such as the way he uses large brushes in areas where a less experienced painter might be reaching for smaller ones , the creation of texture with split hair dry brush , using a mahl stick to steady the brush for drawing the lines like those of siding on a house , and his process of using interesting color variations as colored grounds before blocking in .
TRIADS : Painting with Three Colors takes the seemingly simple concept of painting with three color palettes and through it opens a window into a range of concepts of value to students of painting .
The 90 minute video is available as a digital download through Gumroad or Sellfy for $ 17.98 and comes with a PDF study guide .
You can find previews of the video , along with supplementary information , on Gurney ’s blog , Gurney Journey .
In addition , Gurney is promoting a just - for - fun Sunny Still Life “ challenge ” for those interested to paint a sunny still life with a triad palette and post their paintings online .
The challenge deadline is October 20 , 2020 .
Give a man Ubuntu , and he 'll learn Ubuntu .
Give a man SUSE , and he 'll learn SUSE .
But give a man Slackware , and he 'll learn Linux .
Well , so the old internet maxim goes , but while it 's normally used with a touch of humour , there 's a great deal of truth in it too .
Slackware is a curious animal , minding its own business while other distros roam the popularity plain and strive for dominance among their peers .
It 's not trying to win enormous desktop market share , nor is it loaded with blinking lights , hold - your - hand graphical wizards and package managers that change with every release .
Slackware is about as pure a GNU / Linux system as you can get – at least , without all the arduous leg work of Linux From Scratch .
There are many reasons why Slackware has a devoted base of hardcore fans , usually Linux old - timers but occasionally newcomers too .
The top four :
It 's almost entirely developed by one man .
The packages are not patched to the hilt .
It 's comfortable in its own distrosphere .
It 's very , very , very stable .
Let 's look at these in more detail .
For most of its history , since the first release in 1993 , Slackware has been largely the work of one developer : California - based 42 - year - old Patrick Volkerding .
Pat had some assistance from other paid developers in the distro's earlier days , but now he 's a one - man band – albeit with the help of bug reports and patches from the community – and uses sales of Slackware boxed sets to fund his work on the distro .
An affable chap with a quirky sense of humour , Pat 's down - to - earth geekness puts many long - time Linuxers at ease .
Got a question ?
Try Pat .
Got a suggestion ?
Try Pat .
Want to file a bug report ?
Try Pat .
Do n't worry about mailing lists , project leaders and Bugzilla accounts – Pat 's your man .
Indeed , he 's known as The Man in Slackware circles .
Unbefuddled software
With Pat 's central role in Slackware firmly established , we come on to patches .
Most distros take the original , upstream source code of a program and weld on patches – one , two , 10 , often more – to fit it in with the rest of the software and distro .
That 's fine for many users , but if you want to be sure you 're getting what the developer originally intended , you 're better off with Slackware .
Now that 's not to say that Pat is a patchophobe – some programs are tweaked in places – but by and large the software is left untouched and you do n't feel like you 're getting a distorted version of the original .
There 's another side of package purity to consider as well .
Contrary to what a lot of armchair distro-pundits may have you believe , Slackware does have a package management system .
It 's just based around very simple tarballs ( .tgz files ) rather than the dependency tangled , database - backed systems of RPMs and Debs .
The upshot of this is that Slackware packages are extremely easy to pop open , fiddle around in and put back together .
INSTALL : Slackware 's installer is n't graphical , but you can Tab , Space and Enter your way to a working system easily
Slackware 's stringent focus on simplicity has led to a few software casualties in its history , most notably Gnome .
In 2005 , Pat decided that the work of building and integrating the vast mixture of Gnome packages and their dependencies was just too much .
He said : " Please do not incorrectly interpret any of this as a slight against Gnome itself , which ( although it does usually need to be fixed and polished beyond the way it ships from upstream more so than , say , KDE or Xfce ) is a decent desktop choice . "
This kicked other developers into action , with the Dropline Gnome add - on desktop project starting shortly after the announcement .
It 's a great implementation of Gnome , but the message was clear : if you want your software to be included with Slackware , make sure that it 's neatly contained and not a nightmare to build and distribute .
Know your goals
This brings us to our third point : Slackware has steadfastly remained a non -newbie distro .
It 's not hard to use – far from it – but it does n't have a graphical installer or step - by - step wizards to automate every aspect of usage and installation .
Slackware users are expected to have a fair grounding in the command line and editing configuration files , which returns us to the maxim at the start : if you decide to use Slackware , you are n't shielded from the workings of Linux under the GUI .
You get to learn the underpinnings of Linux , and because the distro does n't have a huge number of customisations and patches to its software , you do n't end up with countless distro-specific config files in guessing - game locations .
If you learn the ins and outs of , say , Fedora , you 'll be a Fedora guru ( which is great ) .
If you learn the workings of Slackware , you 'll pick up knowledge that 's transferable across many distros .
So Slackware does n't try to be the best pond for Linux toe - dipping ; it strives to be a great all - round distro for those who know exactly what they want and do n't want the distro getting in their way .
( An example : SUSE 's Yast , while undoubtedly a highly powerful tool , can give experienced users a headache by stomping over config file changes . )
Regular reliability
Finally , let 's look at Slackware 's stability .
Without the colossal developer base of Debian , you 'd think Slackware would be more prone to problems , but that 's not the case .
Pat is generally conservative when it comes to integrating new software : the Slackware 12.2 release , for instance , arrived in October 2008 with KDE 3.5 , even though KDE 4.1 had been released three months earlier .
Having one man at the helm provides a stability boost too .
Multiple teams and developers can lead to a discrepancy between the quality of patches , whereas Pat builds the whole lot before a release and therefore maintains a wide but hands - on view of the distro .
Sure , big distros such as Debian need large teams and in that context the approach works well , but for Slackware the ' one man doing it all ' approach has done an equally good job .
So there we go .
That 's Slackware .
It 's not the newbie 's best friend , but it 's still a much - loved distro after 15 years and no intermediate - or - above Linux user should go without trying it at least once .
Just be aware of one other snippet of wisdom from Slackware circles : " Once you go Slack , you 'll never go back . "
General Motors is washing its hands of the joint venture it operates with Toyota in California -- the NUMMI plant in Fremont , Calif. , where the companies teamed to build the Pontiac Vibe , and where Toyota builds the Tacoma pickup and Corolla sedan .
We 've been telling you for months that GM probably has more money to make selling off its NUMMI factory in the San Francisco area , than it does in going ahead with another joint - venture with Toyota .
That sentiment probably lingers at GM today , as the company confirmed it will put the NUMMI plant into the " old GM " and ostensibly , will sell it off as it sells other pieces of its empire .
That 's once the plant stops building the 2009 Pontiac Vibe and once Toyota can find another place to build the Tacoma pickup and Corolla sedan , which are built in the plant .
GM had owned the plant before it signed its joint venture with Toyota , but the ownership structure today , and the ownership of the real estate itself , is n't clear ( we 're awaiting word from GM PR ) .
A sale of the plant could mean a long wind - out as Toyota shuffles production around the U.S.
A likely scenario could see the Tacoma and Corolla moving to Toyota 's unoccupied plant in northeastern Mississippi , which had been built for the Highlander SUV , then was to build the 2010 Toyota Prius , but now sits mothballed , with the building enclosed but no tooling installed .
In a statement , GM said it 's not ruling out future cooperation .
" We have enjoyed a very positive and beneficial partnership with Toyota for the past 25 years , and we remain open to future opportunities of mutual interest , ” the company said in a release .
Government will be watching over you …

The Obama administration plans to kill a controversial Bush administration spy satellite program at the Department of Homeland Security , according to officials familiar with the decision .
The program came under fire from its inception two years ago .
Democratic lawmakers said it would lead to domestic spying .
The program would have provided federal , state and local officials with extensive access to spy- satellite imagery — but no eavesdropping capabilities — to assist with emergency response and other domestic - security needs , such as identifying where ports or border areas are vulnerable to terrorism .
It would have expanded an Interior Department satellite program , which will continue to be used to assist in natural disasters and for other limited security purposes such as photographing sporting events .
The Wall Street Journal first revealed the plans to establish the program , known as the National Applications Office , in 2007 …
The plans to shutter the office signal Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano ’s decision to refocus the department ’s intelligence on ensuring that state and local officials get the threat information they need , the official said .
She also wants to make the department the central point in the government for receiving and analyzing terrorism tips from around the country , the official added .
Lawmakers alerted Ms. Napolitano of their concerns about the program - that the program would violate the Fourth amendment right to be protected from unreasonable searches - before her confirmation hearing …
The lawmakers were most concerned about plans to provide satellite imagery to state and local law enforcement , so department officials asked state and local officials how useful that information would be to them .
The answer : not very useful .
Cheney ’s little army of Republican clones will spend the rest of the week in front of the White House – in the shade , of course , with beverage in hand – chanting , “ Soft on communism ! ”
Something like that , anyway .
Whatever is leftover in their chickenhawk pea-brains from the McCarthy days of the Cold War .
Focus on the Family has a new look — or at least its employees do .
Beginning today , men who work at Focus no longer have to wear mandatory business attire , including a tie , and female employees do n’t have to stick with just dresses or skirts and hosiery .
Men can now come to work donning an open - collar shirt — but no spandex — and women can be decked out in dress pants and pantsuits .
After the announcement about the dress - code change at a Tuesday staff meeting , Focus employees erupted in applause , and some women gave president and chief executive Jim Daly a standing ovation , Focus spokeswoman Lisa Anderson said .
“ We can get rid of the hosiery , ” Anderson joked .
“ Some women wanted to stage a bonfire right on the spot . ”
Read Jim Daly ’s comments on the new policy at Gazette.com .
The Australian website also features images of a semi- naked young woman it says is " Liz , an American Apparel Melbourne retail employee " .
In one shot , the former Melbourne retail assistant is pictured topless , in a short skirt , her long hair covering just one breast .
In another , she is lying provocatively in a leotard , on an unmade bed .
The company , which opened its first Australian store in Melbourne in March last year , and has since opened stores in Sydney and Adelaide , is renowned for using staff in its advertising campaigns that are often shot by its controversial LA - based founder , Dov Charney .
It also asks prospective sales staff to submit up to three photos of themselves as part of the job application process .
Katrina George , a spokeswoman for Women 's Forum Australia , condemned the company 's use of " dangerous " and " pornographic " images .
" It goes without saying that most of the images of women on that website are overtly sexualised and some of them you would have to call pornographic .
It 's another example of the normalisation of pornography in popular culture . "
Ms George said it was also concerning that the men on the site were not sexualised in the same way women were .
Clive Hamilton , the professor of public ethics at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics , and former chief of the Australia Institute , which issued the 2006 report , Corporate Pedophilia , on the use of images of children in advertising , is also concerned about the impact the images could have on children .
" Clearly they are using pornographic - style images , pornographic - style poses in order to promote the product , and what it does is it normalises the pornographic genre , " he said .
" On this website there is also a section for children 's clothes , which means kids who go to have a look at the website for clothes for themselves are just one click away from adult women posing in ways that are unquestionably sexually provocative . "
The Advertising Standards Bureau 's chief executive officer , Fiona Jolly , was unavailable for comment but The Sun-Herald understands that it has not received any complaints about the imagery .
Ms George also raised concerns that young American Apparel staff might feel " pressured " to appear in the company 's provocative advertising campaigns .
However , a spokeswoman for American Apparel said it only used staff who " applied " to take part .
" We very often photograph employees to appear in ads and catalogues , on our website and in - store art , " said the spokeswoman .
" Employees and fans of the company apply to model for us on a daily basis , we also sometimes scout them on our own .
Photo shoots are often done with members of our creative team or other employees , like in Liz 's case . "
Since launching the label in 1997 , Mr Charney has been the subject of four sexual harassment lawsuits brought by former employees .
None have been proven in court .
In 2004 , an article in the now - defunct US women 's magazine , Jane , accused Mr Charney of masturbating in front of the reporter .
He has never denied the allegation but said it was consensual .
Those upstanding nativists and xenophobes employed by the John Tanton Network -- and particularly the Federation for American Immigration Reform , which was designated a hate group by the SPLC awhile back -- have been complaining vigorously about how unfairly they are being treated .
Why , they have nothing to do with the manifest racism swirling around the immigration debate -- so they claim .
But the recent arrest of Minuteman offshoot leader Shawna Forde for the murder of an Arizona man and his 9 - year - old daughter -- part of a broader plan to rob drug dealers and use the money to finance their Minuteman operations -- has ripped the veneer off the fake walls these nativists use to pretend that they have nothing to do with the racists who seem to swell their ranks as though they belonged there naturally .
( Funny thing , that . )
Back in 2006 , you see , Forde appeared at a public " town hall " forum on immigration in Yakima , Wash . , a central - Washington city whose main economy is agricultural , particularly apple orchards .
As Jackie Mahendra at America 's Voice notes , she was presented as a " spokesperson for FAIR " as well as the Minutemen .
As you can see from the video above , Forde was outrageously incendiary , accusing immigrants of bringing crime and disease to the state and costing taxpayers in health - care costs , particularly for their " anchor babies . "
At one point , host Enrique Cerna asked Forde :
Cerna : Shawna , let me ask you about the issue of economics .
You 've heard constraints from growers , you know , that the apple harvest is very important in this state , particularly in this region .
What do you say to the growers ?
Forde :
We 've got a prison system .
Let 's utilize it .
She later wrapped up with this :
Forde : I 'd like to see two things on there .
Not just about the people who came here legally , and are here legally , but how about the Americans who have been affected and died because of the illegal invasion in our country ?
How about our sovereignty ?
And securing our borders and protecting our nation is extremely important .
And I know the Minutemen and many organizations will not stop -- we will start at the local level and work our way up -- we will not stop until we get the results that we need to have .
However , it was unclear to me if Forde really was a FAIR representative or whether she had just lied about that , as seems to be her pattern in many instances .
But in untangling the puzzle , what emerged was a clear portrait of FAIR officials commingling freely with Minutemen and the many seedy characters who occupy their ranks -- so much so that what they become is a " respectable " front organization for a ragtag bunch of thuggish nativists .
I first contacted FAIR 's national spokesman , Ira Mehlman , who happens to live in Seattle also .
He absolutely denied that Forde had anything to do with his organization .
When I told him that Shawna was represented as having been a spokesperson for FAIR , he said : " No , she was n't . "
Mehlman : I do n't know who she is , I never heard of her , and she certainly was n't speaking for FAIR .
... I have never heard of her name , never met her , never spoken to her .
So I then contacted Enrique Cerna , and asked if he could remember how it was that Forde came to be on the program , and how she was identified as a " spokesperson " for FAIR .
Cerna :
She actually was n't going to be on that show .
They put her in there at the last minute .
The fellow who originally was supposed to be on [ Bob Baker , the state 's FAIR representative ] .
What happened was that he was n't able to make it ... and then they had to scramble on that day to find somebody , and then , I do n't know how they picked her but they ended up picking her .
And so , the day that we did it , it was kind of a last - minute thing .
There were a lot of phone calls .
So they put her in there , and we did n't really know a lot about her .
And it was very quickly apparent that she was very , um , right - wing .
So I contacted Baker , who in 2006 was heading up an ( ultimately unsuccessful ) effort to pass a statewide anti-immigrant initiative .
He similarly could n't remember how Forde got picked for that show , but he said he was dismayed by her performance :
Baker :
She did not represent FAIR .
I am the state representative for FAIR .
If that 's how she represented herself , then she misrepresented who she was .
I called them -- at the time I was a reserve pilot .
I was going to be on the panel , and I got called , so I could n't be on it .
I certainly did n't recommend her , I do n't know how she got put on the panel .
Baker described his own experience with Forde , which included her being booted from the Minutemen .
I asked Baker why Forde was removed , and he answered vaguely that she had tried to claim being spokesman for the Washington state Minutemen too , as well as other unspecified interpersonal issues the Minuteman leadership had with her .
But he also spoke warmly about her :
Baker :
She 's very zealous towards the rule of law .
You know , illegal immigration is systematically destroying our country .
And she was just , like many of us -- you know , maybe she was a little too zealous , perhaps .
I then described to him the details of the crime she 's charged with : Ordering a home - invasion robbery in which the victims , including two children , were to be gunned down so that there would be not witnesses .
The result : a 9 - year - old girl and her father dead , their mother wounded -- and a wounded member of the gang , shot when the mother fired back .
He said : " Ah , that 's not her .
She would n't do something like that .
That 's what a common criminal would do , right ? "
Yes , well , it is .
As I remarked to Baker : that 's one helluva way for someone to show her zealousness for " the rule of law . "
But then , that 's something I 've noticed about the anti-immigrant nativist Right in general .
Seems the only " rule of law " they care about enforcing is the law that keeps out brown people .
The ADL has good backgrounder on Forde .
Meanwhile , it appears her gunman , Jason Eugene " Gunny " Bush , is being charged with an old murder in eastern Washington .
And it appears he may have been involved in the old Aryan Nations organization in northern Idaho , too .
Swell :
Bush spent time in prison after the homicide for a variety of crimes , including auto theft , assault and weapons violations .
After release he moved to Northern Idaho , and the Hayden Lake , where he lived until 2007 , the affidavit said .
Wenatchee police " learned Bush has had long standing ties to Aryan Nations groups that commonly believe in white superiority over other races and have been known to be violent towards non-white races .
He espoused these beliefs to associates in Wenatchee in 1997 , " the affidavit said .
You see , it is n't just an accident that the Minutemen have to constantly try to chase out their neo -Nazis .
They draw them like flies for a reason .
And we can all smell what it is .

Last month , the Department of Homeland Security released its controversial report that warned against " right - wing extremists . "
Dated April 7th , the report entitled " Right - wing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment " offered the following definition ( or description ) of extremists who were dangerous and potential terrorist threats " Right - wing extremism in the United States can be broadly divided into those groups , movements and adherents that are primarily hate - oriented ( based on hatred of particular religious , racial or ethnic groups ) , and those that are mainly anti-government , rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority , or rejecting government authority entirely .
It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue , such as opposition to abortion or immigration .
"
As Michelle Malkin noted in the Washington Times , it is difficult to believe the report 's timing was a coincidence .
It was disseminated about a week before the grass - root tax - revolts known as Tea Parties erupted across America .
Although Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano eventually backed away from the report 's targeting of military veterans , she has not similarly withdrawn from viewing anti-government sorts -- like libertarians -- as threats to security .
( Of veterans , the report stated , " Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right - wing extremists , ... DHS / I&A is concerned that right - wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities . "
) Compared to the April 7th report , an 11 - page memo entitled " Domestic Extremism Lexicon " has received less attention -- perhaps because it did not mention veterans .
Dated March 27th , its public lifespan was a flicker ; the document was yanked back almost as soon as it saw the light of day .
The memo defined dozens of groups as potential threats to security .
It included those that advocated violence ( skinheads ) with those that are pacifist ( green anarchism ) .
It lumped animal rights activists together with black separatists and tax protesters .
It targeted general categories like " alternative media " and specific beliefs like " Nordic mysticism . "
The memo included anti-technology zealots along with hackers and those who used denial - of - service attacks .
Indeed , it seemed to target anyone who disagreed with specific government policies .
For example , it described anti-immigrant extremists as people who " are highly critical of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s response to illegal immigration and oppose government programs that are designed to extend ' rights ' to illegal aliens , such as issuing driverâ€™s licenses or national identification cards and providing in - state tuition , medical benefits , or public education .
" Taken together , the two documents could chill the blood of anyone who believes in a free or civil society -- not just libertarians but anyone who values freedom of speech , religion , the press , etc .
They are also chilling in that documents that establish definitions and guidelines are preliminary in nature ; they are context setting documents .
The context for what ?
Who knows ... perhaps for legislative measures like H.R. 2159 -- the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2009 .
H.R. 2159 allows the government to deny transfer / sale of a firearm to any " known or suspected dangerous terrorist . "
In short , the government can deny 2nd Amendment Rights to anyone suspected of being " dangerous . "
No prior conviction , no hearing , no legal proof seems to be necessary .
H.R. 2159 has co-sponsors from both parties , and is currently with the House Committee on the Judiciary .
I have no idea if it will pass .
I have a very good idea that such legislation will draw upon the preliminary definitions and framework being provided by DHS on what constitutes a potential terrorist : namely , you and me .

Advertisement The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has declared a global flu pandemic after holding an emergency meeting .
It means the swine flu virus is spreading in at least two regions of the world with rising cases being seen in the UK , Australia , Japan and Chile .
WHO chief Dr Margaret Chan said the move did not mean the virus was causing more severe illness or more deaths .
The swine flu ( H1N1 ) virus first emerged in Mexico in April and has since spread to 74 countries .
We have evidence to suggest we are seeing the first pandemic of the 21st Century
Dr Margaret Chan , WHO director general
Send us your comments Calm urged in UK Official reports say there have been nearly 30,000 cases globally and 141 deaths , with figures rising daily .
Hong Kong said it was closing all its nurseries and primary schools for two weeks following 12 school cases .
It is the first flu pandemic in 40 years - the last in 1968 killed about one million people .
However , the current pandemic seems to be moderate and causing mild illness in most people .
Most cases are occurring in young working age adults and a third to a half of complications are presenting in otherwise healthy people .
Dr Chan said : " We have evidence to suggest we are seeing the first pandemic of the 21st Century .
" Moving to pandemic phase six does not imply we will see increased in deaths or serious cases . "
She added it was important to get the right balance between complacency and vigilance and that pandemic strategies would vary between countries depending on their specific situation .
It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic
Professor John Oxford , flu expert
And the WHO does not recommend closure of borders or any restrictions on the movement of people , goods or services .
But the picture could change very quickly .
" No other pandemic has been detected so early or watched so closely , " Dr Chan said .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for calm .
" Let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease .
It is not in itself a cause for alarm , " he said .
He warned that in the developing world the consequences of the virus could be more serious , and that the southern hemisphere was now entering the flu season .
One factor which has prompted the move to a level six pandemic was that in the southern hemisphere , the virus seems to be crowding out normal seasonal influenza .

The move was not prompted by the situation in any one country but the reports that it had spread in several parts of the world , officials said .
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable , the WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate .
Experts have warned that poorer nations , especially those in the southern hemisphere now heading into their winter season , face the greatest risk from the flu pandemic .
Pandemic planning
There have been more than 800 cases in the UK with some areas of Scotland being particularly hard hit .
The government has been stockpiling antivirals such as Tamiflu and has ordered vaccine , some doses of which could be available by October .
SWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu
It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Current treatments do work , but as yet there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised
What comes next in flu fight England 's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said the WHO declaration of a pandemic would not significantly change the way the UK was dealing with swine flu at the moment .
But he added there could be some minor changes to who received antivirals .
" The declaration of a pandemic per se does n't make a big difference to the way we are handling the outbreaks we have .
" We are going to continue to investigate every case that occurs and treat their contacts with antivirals even though they may not be ill .
" The difference is that the Health Protection Agency has learnt a lot about approaching this question of antiviral prophylaxis and they are going to be treating the closer contacts of the cases , rather than the more far - flung contacts , because they feel that that is supported by what they know so far about how the disease is transmitting .
He added : " These flu viruses can change their pattern of attack , so when we come into the flu season in the autumn and winter in this country , when we expect a big surge of cases , we need to watch very carefully to see if the character of the virus is changing . "
There is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet
Fergus Walsh
BBC 's medical correspondent
Read Fergus 's thoughts in full Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said a move to level six means that countries need to be ready to implement pandemic plans immediately but the UK was already operating at a " heightened state of readiness " .
But it could affect the speed at which the UK gets pandemic vaccine supplies but that had been factored into pandemic planning .
Flu expert Professor John Oxford said people should not panic as the outbreak was milder than others seen in the past century .
" It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic but I do n't think anyone should worry because nothing drastic has happened between yesterday and today . "

I do n’t know who writes to Billy Graham seeking advice , or why they take him seriously , or what newspapers would run his responses … but his latest column does n’t make a strong case for reading him .
The letter writer asks why atheism appears to be on the rise and why it ’s getting more attention these days .
Graham first explains that it ’s really just a handful of successful authors :
They are n’t large in number , but they do tend to be aggressive in promoting their ideas .
You want to talk about aggressive ?
Who ’s more aggressive : Richard Dawkins , who gives lectures about science ?
Or Sam Harris , who started a non-profit called “ The Reason Project “ ?
Or Christopher Hitchens , who appears on television and writes magazine articles ?
Or Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern , who passes a legal proclamation that says our Constitution was made only for moral and religious people , implying that atheists are not true citizens of America ?
Graham later answers why the atheists are getting so much attention :
One reason , I believe , is because they know how to use the media very effectively .
Really ?
The highlight of the year for us has been seeing our ads on buses .
Christians get their own TV stations … as well as their own shows on regular channels on Sunday mornings and later at night the rest of the week .
Christians win the media battle hands down .
They also appeal to people who want to be free from God or any moral restraints .
Free from God ?
Yes , because we do n’t believe in one .
Free from moral restraints ?
I do n’t recall any of the New Atheists telling atheists to run off and fornicate with the next person they meet … or to steal their books from the bookstore .
If anything , they explain how atheists can indeed be moral without a god .
Like the philosophers of Paul ’s day who were constantly looking for new ideas to debate , many people today eagerly latch on to the latest fad ( see Acts 17:21 ) .
Atheism is a fad ?
Not even close .
Slap bracelets were a fad .
Pet rocks were a fad .
Atheism ’s been around for a long time and it ’ll be around for a long time .
That ’s not a fad ; that ’s a tradition .
The difference now is that we ’re tired of being silent about it and we ’re finally speaking up and voicing our ( non - ) belief .
To hell with what others think .
Graham manages to get it right in one sentence , though :
In reality , however , modern atheists have very little new to say .
True .
There are no new arguments against religion .
The same ones still hold true as they always have .
But again , in the past , you could ’ve been killed for making those arguments .
Not anymore .
Since conservative Christians have attempted to take over politics in America and fundamentalist Muslims have killed around the world because of their beliefs , people are finally listening to what atheists have to say .
They ’re tired of faith being a destructive force , and if religion is n’t going to offer something more positive and less divisive , atheists can fill that niche for more reasonable people .
Graham ends the response with some Christian platitudes , probably copied and pasted from the column he wrote the day before .
We need a syndicated atheist advice columnist .
I nominate Richard Wade .
Any reader who checks out his comments on this site knows what I ’m talking about .
( CNN ) --
As protests continue over the disputed presidential elections in Iran , we asked two analysts to explain the background to the controversy .
Supporters of President Ahmadinejad wave flags at a massive rally in Tehran Sunday to celebrate his victory .

Q ) What degree of election monitoring is there in Iran ?
A ) The problem with this election , according to London - based Mideast analyst Amir Taheri , is that there is no independent monitoring at all in Iran with the interior ministry arguing that the Council of the Guardians of the Constitution , a " star chamber " of 12 mullahs , would have that role .
" Candidates are not allowed to be present at polling stations during voting or counting .
Many voters are illiterate and officials help them fill in their ballot papers , so the possibilities for rigging are immense .
And there are no booths in the polling stations so voting is done in public , not in private -- a major obstacle for transparency , " Taheri said .
So the problem for opposition candidates in this election , said Taheri , the author of " The Persian Night , " is that there are no concrete examples of fraud because there was no monitoring .
" You could say all of Iran 's 10 presidential elections have been fraudulent or that all were fair -- we just do n't know .
All have been held in the same way .
The whole electoral process from the vetting of candidates to voting and ballot counting is conducted by the state . "
Q ) So is it possible that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did win the election ?
A ) The president does indeed have great public support in Iran , Taheri said , adding that " I 'm sure he did win the election but it 's impossible he won 63 percent of the vote .
The results probably exaggerated the scale of his support . "
According to official results , Ahmadinejad won in all regions and among all classes and ages -- again , something that Taheri said was unlikely , " but I ca n't prove it . "
Had he not exaggerated the scale of his victory , Taheri said , unlike in previous presidential elections , it is possible there would n't be the outcry there is now .
" Many Iranians feel insulted by the results because they feel their vote did n't count .
Everybody knows , for instance that Ahmadinejad is unpopular in cities but he still won the vote there .
That is why people are so angry . "
Another Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour agreed , saying he believed this was " a stolen election . "
Watch Sadjadpour explain why election was " stolen " »
" There are a lot of signs there were major improprieties .
First of all there were 40 million votes cast and just two hours after the polls had closed they announced Ahmadinejad 's victory : and these votes are hand counted in Iran ...
Sadjadpour , an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , added : " Another example I give is that ( opposition leader Mir Hossein ) Moussavi , who is an ethnic Azeri Turk , lost the province of Iranian Azerbaijan .
This is the equivalent of Barack Obama losing the African American vote to John McCain in 2008 . "
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the record voter turnout in Friday 's election showed Iranians value " resistance against oppressors , " the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
" Pointing to enemies ' massive propaganda campaign to discourage people from taking part in the elections , Ayatollah Khamenei also said there was really a divine miracle behind this elections , given its results that was 10 million higher than any of the previous ones in the 30 - year history of elections in Iran , " IRNA reported .
Q ) Will the anger and protests on the streets subside or grow into something much greater ?
A ) Much depends on what the opposition candidates do in coming days , according to Sadjadpour .
" We 've never in the 30 - year history of the Islamic republic seen the revolutionary elite so divided , " he said .
Former centrist president Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a founding father of the Islamic republic , and Moussavi are now both opposition candidates .
" They feel the election was stolen from them and that the majority of public support is on their side .
They 're planning more public protests so this tumult may not subside any time soon . "
Gallery : Emotions run high after election »
Q ) How will the regime deal with these protests ?
A ) Iran 's leaders " have repression down to a science , " said Sadjadpour .
" Before the election they ease political and social restrictions because they want to project a democratic face to the world .
But at times like these when rallies are getting out of hand they use overwhelming force to nip them in the bud .
So I anticipate more use of force to ensure they do n't get out of hand . "
Watch report on latest violence in Iran »
Q ) What will the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei do ?
A ) This is the big question and there were reports on Monday he would agree to an investigation into allegations of vote rigging .
Speaking earlier , Sadjadpour said he felt the supreme leader would not intervene unless he felt his sustainability as leader was at stake .
" The reason why is that I believe he was behind this power grab .
Ahmadinejad was his candidate so he 's not exactly an objective actor .
Opposition candidates are trying to appeal to Khamenei before they take to the streets but I 'm not sure how he walks back from this . "
Q ) What does four more years of Ahmadinejad mean for Iran and the rest of the world ?
A ) The big problem the United States and Europe is to stop Iran from going nuclear and Ahmadinejad 's reelection means Iran 's aggressive policy towards the West is not going to change .
" I feel the results are quite disastrous , " said Sadjadpour .
" In terms of the U.S. - Iran relationship , Ahmadinejad 's mere presence could well serve as an insurmountable obstacle to confidence building .
He presses the worst buttons in the context of domestic U.S. politics with his denial of the Holocaust and belligerence towards Israel .
Domestically in Iran he has profoundly mismanaged the economy with one of the highest inflation rates in the world and high unemployment . "
However according to TIME magazine , behind closed doors the White House may be relieved by the result .
Despite the attention paid to the office of the Iranian presidency , nuclear policy is set by the country 's religious leaders and appear determined to amass enriched uranium whether or not a hard - liner or a moderate is president , the magazine said Monday .
" Ahmadinejad 's win may increase Washington 's chances of getting tougher sanctions on Iran if they refuse to negotiate , " TIME reported senior Administration officials as saying .

The University will draw from the cultural , intellectual and economic resources of the San Francisco Bay Area and its location on the Pacific Rim to enrich and strengthen its educational programs .
The release of the photos was won by ACLU lawyers who have fought to bring to light the full extent of the brutality and torture that U.S. Army and intelligence services have perpetrated against human beings in Iraq , Afghanistan , Guantanamo Bay and at CIA " black sites " around the world .
Torture that was sanctioned and effectively legalized under the former administration , and that , if we are to be honest , most Americans knew -- or should have known -- was being carried out in our names .
Only now is the knowledge starting to give rise to the widespread outrage and calls for accountability that such crimes against humanity deserve .
Growing numbers of citizens are demanding the independent investigation and prosecution of the members of the Bush administration responsible for the vitiation of fundamental legal principles like habeas corpus and the flagrant violation of both international and domestic laws against torture .
The pundits , hacks and shills who dismiss these calls for investigation and prosecution -- integral to any serious definition of accountability -- disgrace themselves and their country .
The situation in which we now find ourselves is so bizarre , it 's hard to fathom .
New revelations continue to surface -- we learn that Vice President Cheney 's office ordered and specified how a man was to be tortured , and mounting evidence suggests the United States tortured to extract false confessions that would justify preemptive war on Iraq .
Yet a Democratic president leads a Democratic congress to whitewash institutionalized torture and in effect trash any conceivable notion of the rule of law , all in the name of " looking forward . "
Your class has come of age at a moment of great consequence for our nation and the world – a rare inflection point in history where the size and scope of the challenges before us require that we remake our world to renew its promise ; that we align our deepest values and commitments to the demands of a new age .
It is a privilege and a responsibility afforded to few generations – and a task that you are now called to fulfill .
This is the generation that must find a path back to prosperity and decide how we respond to a global economy that left millions behind even before this crisis hit – an economy where greed and short - term thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness , and diligence , and an honest day ’s work .
We must decide how to save God ’s creation from a changing climate that threatens to destroy it .
We must seek peace at a time when there are those who will stop at nothing to do us harm , and when weapons in the hands of a few can destroy the many .
And we must find a way to reconcile our ever - shrinking world with its ever - growing diversity – diversity of thought , of culture , and of belief .
In short , we must find a way to live together as one human family .
It is this last challenge that I ’d like to talk about today .
For the major threats we face in the 21st century – whether it ’s global recession or violent extremism ; the spread of nuclear weapons or pandemic disease – do not discriminate .
They do not recognize borders .
They do not see color .
They do not target specific ethnic groups .
Moreover , no one person , or religion , or nation can meet these challenges alone .
Our very survival has never required greater cooperation and understanding among all people from all places than at this moment in history .
Unfortunately , finding that common ground – recognizing that our fates are tied up , as Dr. King said , in a “ single garment of destiny ” – is not easy .
Part of the problem , of course , lies in the imperfections of man – our selfishness , our pride , our stubbornness , our acquisitiveness , our insecurities , our egos ; all the cruelties large and small that those of us in the Christian tradition understand to be rooted in original sin .
We too often seek advantage over others .
We cling to outworn prejudice and fear those who are unfamiliar .
Too many of us view life only through the lens of immediate self - interest and crass materialism ; in which the world is necessarily a zero - sum game .
The strong too often dominate the weak , and too many of those with wealth and with power find all manner of justification for their own privilege in the face of poverty and injustice .
And so , for all our technology and scientific advances , we see around the globe violence and want and strife that would seem sadly familiar to those in ancient times .
We know these things ; and hopefully one of the benefits of the wonderful education you have received is that you have had time to consider these wrongs in the world , and grown determined , each in your own way , to right them .
And yet , one of the vexing things for those of us interested in promoting greater understanding and cooperation among people is the discovery that even bringing together persons of good will , men and women of principle and purpose , can be difficult .
The soldier and the lawyer may both love this country with equal passion , and yet reach very different conclusions on the specific steps needed to protect us from harm .
The gay activist and the evangelical pastor may both deplore the ravages of HIV / AIDS , but find themselves unable to bridge the cultural divide that might unite their efforts .
Those who speak out against stem cell research may be rooted in admirable conviction about the sacredness of life , but so are the parents of a child with juvenile diabetes who are convinced that their son ’s or daughter ’s hardships can be relieved .
The question , then , is how do we work through these conflicts ?
Is it possible for us to join hands in common effort ?
As citizens of a vibrant and varied democracy , how do we engage in vigorous debate ?
How does each of us remain firm in our principles , and fight for what we consider right , without demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side ?
Nowhere do these questions come up more powerfully than on the issue of abortion .
As I considered the controversy surrounding my visit here , I was reminded of an encounter I had during my Senate campaign , one that I describe in a book I wrote called The Audacity of Hope .
A few days after I won the Democratic nomination , I received an email from a doctor who told me that while he voted for me in the primary , he had a serious concern that might prevent him from voting for me in the general election .
He described himself as a Christian who was strongly pro-life , but that ’s not what was preventing him from voting for me .
What bothered the doctor was an entry that my campaign staff had posted on my website – an entry that said I would fight “ right - wing ideologues who want to take away a woman ’s right to choose . ”
The doctor said that he had assumed I was a reasonable person , but that if I truly believed that every pro-life individual was simply an ideologue who wanted to inflict suffering on women , then I was not very reasonable .
He wrote , “ I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion , only that you speak about this issue in fair - minded words . ”
Fair - minded words .
After I read the doctor ’s letter , I wrote back to him and thanked him .
I did n’t change my position , but I did tell my staff to change the words on my website .
And I said a prayer that night that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me .
Because when we do that – when we open our hearts and our minds to those who may not think like we do or believe what we do – that ’s when we discover at least the possibility of common ground .
That ’s when we begin to say , “ Maybe we wo n’t agree on abortion , but we can still agree that this is a heart - wrenching decision for any woman to make , with both moral and spiritual dimensions .
So let ’s work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions by reducing unintended pregnancies , and making adoption more available , and providing care and support for women who do carry their child to term .
Let ’s honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion , and draft a sensible conscience clause , and make sure that all of our health care policies are grounded in clear ethics and sound science , as well as respect for the equality of women . ”
Understand – I do not suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go away .
No matter how much we may want to fudge it – indeed , while we know that the views of most Americans on the subject are complex and even contradictory – the fact is that at some level , the views of the two camps are irreconcilable .
Each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction .
But surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature .
Open hearts .
Open minds .
Fair - minded words .
I do n't know who gave the commencement address at " my " graduation .
One step ahead of the law , I had already left the country in the spring and was in the Atlas Mountains south of Marrakech on graduation day .
I called a couple of college friends and none of them could remember who spoke ; Taroundant , where I spent that week , was amazing .
I still have a small white stone statue I watched someone carving and then got from him by exchanging some detritus from my old life .
A decade later I was back in America , living in San Francisco and playing punk rock on KUSF , the radio station owned by the University of San Francisco , not just a Catholic university -- a Jesuit one .
The school 's mission statement : I never took any classes there .
I was the radio station 's " professional advisor , " or something like that .
I did n't get paid .
I just had a chance to play music I loved on the radio .
Earlier I had been fired by KSJO for having the Sex Pistols live on the air -- the show is part of a bootleggish release , -- and then from KSAN for ... gee , I do n't remember .
There were so many firing offenses every week that I can't even recall which one they finally got me on , months and months after every other free - form dj on the station had been cashiered by the new ( corporate ) regime .
That was because I was on after midnight and none of the new bosses had ever heard my show so when they first told me I was fired I asked why and they did n't know so they actually let me stay until something outraging their sensibilities reached them .
But KUSF , the Jesuit station never bothered me .
Well ... almost never .
I just could n't resist playing a tape I had gotten in the mail from a band in Tampa called the Impotent Sea Snakes .
A more accommodating dj would have just stuck to something less offensive , like " I Wanna Fuck Your Dad , " but I only wanted to blast " Pope John Paul Can Suck My Dick , " over the Catholic airwaves .
Every time I played it I would get a note asking me to please not play it again , which , of course , encouraged me to play it again and again and again .
Have you watched any of the prissy little assholes being interviewed on CNN about how they do n't want President Obama coming to their campus -- another Catholic school -- to give a commencement address because they disagree with his policies ?
My blood boils as I look at the ugly , distorted faces of future torturers , banksters , Klan sympathizers and Evan Bayh supporters .
If they do n't want a gay marriage they should n't have one .
If they do n't want an abortion , no one is forcing them .
If they do n't like stem cell research I hope they have the courage of their convictions to die a miserable and painful death from a combination of Huntington 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , diabetes , a spinal chord injury and cancer .
And why not ?
They 're so sure they 're going to be playing harps in the heavenly clouds while the rest of us burn in hell , they should just leave us alone on earth and keep their ignorant , primitive superstitions , religionist quackery and Know Nothing prejudices to themselves .
If you want to protest something about Obama , how about something real ?
John Cusack wrote about A Hollow and Horrible Equivocation , the subject of which would have certainly caused protests at my college in the mid-60s .
Personally I have very mixed feelings about the release of the pornographic torture photos because of my concern for the young men and women fighting overseas .
I have a tendency to want the photos to be seen only by a jury debating whether Bush , Cheney and their co-conspirators should get life imprisonment or ... something that better suits their crimes against humanity .
On the other hand , I agree with everything Cusack says .
One more thing about " Catholic teaching , " while supporting every travesty in the history of what horrors man could visit on his fellow men-- from torture and slavery to global imperialism and subjegation of women and the poor -- Catholic teaching should now be about learning , as Pope John Paul suggested , from its own mistakes so it stops committing them some day .
These arrogant and over - wrought assholes should start over in kindergarten : Obama did n't play the Impotent Sea Snakes for them .
Instead , he made a gracious , memorable and challenging address that I 'm sure the ones willing to listen will remember for their whole lives .
Here 's just a very few paragraphs :

Hugh Jackman may not be a foolproof box - office bankable ( witness the financial flounderer ) but fit him up with a pair of adamantium claws and just sit back and watch the money roll in .
The quality ofwas a bust with critics but audiences could care less when mutant special effects laden action are involved .
The movie was an easy number one with $ 87 million , the second best X=Men opening afterwhich banked $ 102 million .
It 's also a good sign that despite international financial woes , big budget movies can still turn a hefty profit .
We may be in for a solid summer box office indeed .
The success may mark the beginning for another origins flick .
Producers have indicated that the Magneto storyline would fly off the desk and into production if Wolverine proved his mettle .
International numbers are n't available yet , but there 's a good chance that he earned back his entire $ 150 million budget in the first weekend 's sales worldwide .
If that 's not a green light , I do n't know what is .
This weekend 's distant second was the other newcomer , .
Matthew McConaughey 's bizarre stroll down bedfellow lane marks a low point for the actor 's box office performance .
He usually draws openings of $ 20 + million for these sorts of romantic comedies , but against the likes of Wolverine and perhaps the fact that Matthew 's face is starting to show those forty years , this one fell short of the mark .
Buckle your seatbelt , you may be going nowhere -- and it could be a very bumpy ride .
Oil futures have just passed $ 71 for a barrel of " light , sweet crude oil " ( sweet for energy stocks , anyway ) on its way to ... well , we do n't know exactly where , but it wo n't feel good , not at the pump and not in the economy either .
In the Midwest and scattered other locations , gas prices are already at the edge of $ 3.00 a gallon and the height of summer is n't even upon us .
Much of this sudden rise has been fueled by OPEC production cuts , investor dreams of a global economic recovery ( and so a heightened desire for energy ) , and the enthusiasm of market speculators .
Explain it as you will , the price of crude , which hit a low of about $ 32 a barrel in December , as the planet seemed to meltdown economically , has doubled in recent months .
Oil is like the undead .
Just when you think it 's gone down for the count , it rises from the grave ravenous .
As Clifford Krauss of the New York Times reported recently , gas prices have risen 41 days in a row , and yet the price at the pump is still " lagging behind the increase in the price of oil . "
According to Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service , consumers are now shelling out one billion dollars a day to keep their tanks full .
( It was $ 1.5 billion last summer when the price of a barrel of oil hit an astronomical $ 147 . )
Whether this is the energy version of irrational exuberance and a mini-bubble to be burst as further economic bad times hit or the reality of our near future , sooner or later , far worse is in store on the energy front , as Michael Klare , author of Rising Powers , Shrinking World : The New Geopolitics of Energy , makes clear .
But do n't listen to him .
Instead , check out his latest energy scoop -- the real news he found buried in the most recent report from the U.S. Department of Energy , whose seers have put irrational exuberance in mothballs and brought out the sackcloth and ashes .
Tom
As it happens , the recent release of the 2009 IEO has provided energy watchers with a feast of significant revelations .
By far the most significant disclosure : the IEO predicts a sharp drop in projected future world oil output ( compared to previous expectations ) and a corresponding increase in reliance on what are called " unconventional fuels " -- oil sands , ultra - deep oil , shale oil , and biofuels .
Every summer , the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) of the U.S. Department of Energy issues its International Energy Outlook ( IEO ) -- a jam - packed compendium of data and analysis on the evolving world energy equation .
For those with the background to interpret its key statistical findings , the release of the IEO can provide a unique opportunity to gauge important shifts in global energy trends , much as reports of routine Communist Party functions in the party journal Pravda once provided America 's Kremlin watchers with insights into changes in the Soviet Union 's top leadership circle .
So here 's the headline for you :
For the first time , the well - respected Energy Information Administration appears to be joining with those experts who have long argued that the era of cheap and plentiful oil is drawing to a close .
Almost as notable , when it comes to news , the 2009 report highlights Asia 's insatiable demand for energy and suggests that China is moving ever closer to the point at which it will overtake the United States as the world 's number one energy consumer .
Clearly , a new era of cutthroat energy competition is upon us .
Peak Oil Becomes the New Norm
As recently as 2007 , the IEO projected that the global production of conventional oil ( the stuff that comes gushing out of the ground in liquid form ) would reach 107.2 million barrels per day in 2030 , a substantial increase from the 81.5 million barrels produced in 2006 .
Now , in 2009 , the latest edition of the report has grimly dropped that projected 2030 figure to just 93.1 million barrels per day -- in future - output terms , an eye - popping decline of 14.1 million expected barrels per day .
Even when you add in the 2009 report 's projection of a larger increase than once expected in the output of unconventional fuels , you still end up with a net projected decline of 11.1 million barrels per day in the global supply of liquid fuels ( when compared to the IEO 's soaring 2007 projected figures ) .
What does this decline signify -- other than growing pessimism by energy experts when it comes to the international supply of petroleum liquids ?
Very simply , it indicates that the usually optimistic analysts at the Department of Energy now believe global fuel supplies will simply not be able to keep pace with rising world energy demands .
For years now , assorted petroleum geologists and other energy types have been warning that world oil output is approaching a maximum sustainable daily level -- a peak -- and will subsequently go into decline , possibly producing global economic chaos .
Whatever the timing of the arrival of peak oil 's actual peak , there is growing agreement that we have , at last , made it into peak - oil territory , if not yet to the moment of irreversible decline .
Until recently , Energy Information Administration officials scoffed at the notion that a peak in global oil output was imminent or that we should anticipate a contraction in the future availability of petroleum any time soon .
" [ We ] expect conventional oil to peak closer to the middle than to the beginning of the 21st century , " the 2004 IEO report stated emphatically .
Consistent with this view , the EIA reported one year later that global production would reach a staggering 122.2 million barrels per day in 2025 , more than 50 % above the 2002 level of 80.0 million barrels per day .
This was about as close to an explicit rejection of peak oil that you could get from the EIA 's experts .
Where Did All the Oil Go ?
Now , let 's turn back to the 2009 edition .
In 2025 , according to this new report , world liquids output , conventional and unconventional , will reach only a relatively dismal 101.1 million barrels per day .
Worse yet , conventional oil output will be just 89.6 million barrels per day .
In EIA terms , this is pure gloom and doom , about as deeply pessimistic when it comes to the world 's future oil output capacity as you 're likely to get .
The agency 's experts claim , however , that this will not prove quite the challenge it might seem , because they have also revised downward their projections of future energy demand .
Back in 2005 , they were projecting world oil consumption in 2025 at 119.2 million barrels per day , just below anticipated output at that time .
This year -- and we should all theoretically breathe a deep sigh of relief -- the report projects that 2025 figure at only 101.1 million barrels per day , conveniently just what the world is expected to produce at that time .
If this actually proves the case , then oil prices will presumably remain within a manageable range .
In fact , however , the consumption part of this equation seems like the less reliable calculation , especially if economic growth continues at anything like its recent pace in China and India .
Indeed , all evidence suggests that growth in these countries will resume its pre-crisis pace by the end of 2009 or early 2010 .
Under those circumstances , global oil demand will eventually outpace supply , driving up prices again and threatening recurring and potentially disastrous economic disorders -- possibly on the scale of the present global economic meltdown .
To have the slightest chance of averting such disasters means seeing a sharp rise in unconventional fuel output .
Such fuels include Canadian oil sands , Venezuelan extra - heavy oil , deep - offshore oil , Arctic oil , shale oil , liquids derived from coal ( coal - to - liquids or CTL ) , and biofuels .
At present , these cumulatively constitute only about 4 % of the world 's liquid fuel supply but are expected to reach nearly 13 % by 2030 .
All told , according to estimates in the new IEO report , unconventional liquid production will reach an estimated 13.4 million barrels per day in 2030 , up from a projected 9.7 million barrels in the 2008 edition .
But for an expansion on this scale to occur , whole new industries will have to be created to manufacture such fuels at a cost of several trillion dollars .
This undertaking , in turn , is provoking a wide - ranging debate over the environmental consequences of producing such fuels .
For example , any significant increase in biofuels use -- assuming such fuels were produced by chemical means rather than , as now , by cooking -- could substantially reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , actually slowing the tempo of future climate change .
On the other hand , any increase in the production of Canadian oil sands , Venezuelan extra- heavy oil , and Rocky Mountain shale oil will entail energy - intensive activities at staggering levels , sure to emit vast amounts of CO2 , which might more than cancel out any gains from the biofuels .
In addition , increased biofuels production risks the diversion of vast tracts of arable land from the crucial cultivation of basic food staples to the manufacture of transportation fuel .
If , as is likely , oil prices continue to rise , expect it to be ever more attractive for farmers to grow more corn and other crops for eventual conversion to transportation fuels , which means rises in food costs that could price basics out of the range of the very poor , while stretching working families to the limit .
As in May and June of 2008 , when food riots spread across the planet in response to high food prices -- caused , in part , by the diversion of vast amounts of corn acreage to biofuel production -- this could well lead to mass unrest and mass starvation .
A Heavy Energy Footprint on the Planet
The geopolitical implications of this transformation could well be striking .
Among other developments , the global clout of Canada , Venezuela , and Brazil -- all key producers of unconventional fuels -- is bound to be strengthened .
Canada is becoming increasingly important as the world 's leading producer of oil sands , or bitumen -- a thick , gooey , viscous material that must be dug out of the ground and treated in various energy - intensive ways before it can be converted into synthetic petroleum fuel ( synfuel ) .
According to the IEO report , oil sands production , now at 1.3 million barrels a day and barely profitable , could hit the 4.4 million barrel mark ( or even , according to the most optimistic scenarios , 6.5 million barrels ) by 2030 .
Given the IEA 's new projections , this would represent an extraordinary addition to global energy supplies just when key sources of conventional oil in places like Mexico and the North Sea are expected to suffer severe declines .
The extraction of oil sands , however , could prove a pollution disaster of the first order .
For one thing , remarkable infusions of old - style energy are needed to extract this new energy , huge forest tracts would have to be cleared , and vast quantities of water used for the steam necessary to dislodge the buried goo ( just as the equivalent of " peak water " may be arriving ) .
What this means is that the accelerated production of oil sands is sure to be linked to environmental despoliation , pollution , and global warming .
There is considerable doubt that Canadian officials and the general public will , in the end , be willing to pay the economic and environmental price involved .
In other words , whatever the IEA may project now , no one can know whether synfuels will really be available in the necessary quantities 15 or 20 years down the road .
Venezuela has long been an important source of crude oil for the United States , generating much of the revenue used by President Hugo Chávez to sustain his social experiments at home and an ambitious anti-American political agenda abroad .
In the coming years , however , its production of conventional petroleum is expected to fall , leaving the country increasingly reliant on the exploitation of large deposits of bitumen in the eastern Orinoco River basin .
Just to develop these " extra - heavy oil " deposits will require significant financial and energy investments and , as with Canadian oil sands , the environmental impact could be devastating .
Nevertheless , successful development of these deposits could prove an economic bonanza for Venezuela .
The big winner in these grim energy sweepstakes , however , is likely to be Brazil .
Already a major producer of ethanol , it is expected to see a huge increase in unconventional oil output once its new ultra - deep fields in the " subsalt " Campos and Santos basins come on - line .
These are massive offshore oil deposits buried beneath thick layers of salt some 100 miles off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and several miles beneath the ocean 's surface .
When the substantial technical challenges to exploiting these undersea fields are overcome , Brazil 's output could soar by as much as three million barrels per day .
By 2030 , Brazil should be a major player in the world energy equation , having succeeded Venezuela as South America 's leading petroleum producer .
New Powers , New Problems
The IEO report hints at other geopolitical changes occurring in the global energy landscape , especially an expected stunning increase in the share of the global energy supply consumed in Asia and a corresponding decline by the United States , Japan , and other " First World " powers .
In 1990 , the developing nations of Asia and the Middle East accounted for only 17 % of world energy consumption ; by 2030 , that number , the report suggests , should reach 41 % , matching that of the major First World powers .
All recent editions of the report have predicted that China would eventually overtake the United States as number one energy consumer .
What 's notable is how quickly the 2009 edition expects that to happen .
The 2006 report had China assuming the leadership position in a 2026 - 2030 timeframe ; in 2007 , it was 2021 - 2024 ; in 2008 , it was 2016 - 2020 .
This year , the EIA is projecting that China will overtake the United States between 2010 and 2014 .
It 's easy enough to overlook these shifting estimates , since the reports do n't emphasize how they have changed from year to year .
What they suggest , however , is that the United States will face ever fiercer competition from China in the global struggle to secure adequate supplies of energy to meet national needs .
Given what we have learned about the dwindling prospects for adequate future oil supplies , we are sure to face increased geopolitical competition and strife between the two countries in those few areas that are capable of producing additional quantities of oil ( and undoubtedly genuine desperation among many other countries with far less resources and power ) .
And much else follows :
As the world 's leading energy consumer , Beijing will undoubtedly play a far more critical role in setting international energy policies and prices , undercutting the pivotal role long played by Washington .
It is not hard to imagine , then , that major oil producers in the Middle East and Africa will see it as in their interest to deepen political and economic ties with China at the expense of the United States .
China can also be expected to maintain close ties with oil providers like Iran and Sudan , no matter how this clashes with American foreign policy objectives .
At first glance , the International Energy Outlook for 2009 hardly looks different from previous editions : a tedious compendium of tables and text on global energy trends .
Looked at another way , however , it trumpets the headlines of the future -- and their news is not comforting .
The global energy equation is changing rapidly , and with it is likely to come great power competition , economic peril , rising starvation , growing unrest , environmental disaster , and shrinking energy supplies , no matter what steps are taken .
No doubt the 2010 edition of the report and those that follow will reveal far more , but the new trends in energy on the planet are already increasingly evident -- and unsettling .

Peace
Now says many settlers move from Israel or abroad A meeting between Israel 's prime minister and a senior US envoy has been cancelled amid growing differences over settlement building in the West Bank .
Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said the US put off the meeting in response to Benjamin Netanyahu 's refusal to heed US demands to halt settlement activity .
But Mr Netanyahu 's aides say it was the prime minister who cancelled Thursday 's meeting with George Mitchell in Paris .
They said " more professional work " was needed , without adding further details .
Instead , Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak is now scheduled to travel to Washington on Monday to meet Mr Mitchell .
Mr Netanyahu has arrived in Paris from Rome , on his first trip to Europe since he took office .
He is promoting his hawkish line on Iran , seeking harsher sanctions over its nuclear programme .
US State Department officials confirmed that the bilateral talks in Paris had been postponed , but they did not explain why it was necessary for their envoy to see Mr Barak on Monday instead .
' Unnatural growth ' US President Barack Obama has called for a freeze on construction of settlements , which are widely viewed as illegal under international law .
Mr Netanyahu has said he will not build additional enclaves in occupied Palestinian territory - but he wants to continue building within existing settlements to foster what Israel views as their " natural growth " .
Mr Netanyahu is on his first visit to Europe since taking office as Israeli PM However , Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said on Wednesday that the rise in settler numbers is considerably greater than the birth - rate .
They cite figures from Israel 's Central Bureau of Statistics which show that 36 % of all new settlers in 2007 had moved from Israel or abroad .
About 300,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank and and another 180,000 in East Jerusalem .
These were among the Arab territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war .
The number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank was 116,300 in 1993 - when Israel and the Palestinians signed the landmark Oslo accords in which both sides undertook not to take any action that would undermine negotiations towards a permanent resolution .
The Palestinian Authority wants to establish a future Palestinian state in the whole of the West Bank , East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip - currently ruled by the rival militant Hamas movement .
Mr Netanyahu finally bowed to US pressure to endorse the principle of Palestinian statehood in a speech 10 days ago , but he put a raft of conditions on its creation which Palestinian leaders called unacceptable .

" We Make Good Team . "
" I am Credit to Team . "
[ In this Gamasutra opinion piece , writer and designer Gregory Weir ( ) examines the complex appeal of Team Fortress ' character classes and how they support gameplay . ]
The concept of character roles in video games is a common one .
It 's most common in traditional RPGs , where the player chooses a certain character class with unique skills and abilities .
In the mid -to - late - nineties , the concept of class or character role spread to other kinds of games , with one of the first examples being the originalmod forTheseries features first - person , multiplayer , team - based gameplay where each player selects a class and the classes compliment each other .
Each class has an important role , and the strength of the team as a whole depends on each player properly fulfilling their role .
The series came into its own with the release of , an official mod forrefined the classes and reinforced team - based goals like capturing the flag or protecting territory .
Multiplayer class - based games likecan be quite entertaining .
The separate character roles make it necessary to work together , which promotes socialization among teammates and increases the feeling of accomplishment when the team succeeds .
The multiple classes also broaden the appeal of the game ; a player who does n't feel comfortable dodging and weaving can choose a slow - but - strong class like 's Heavy Weapon Guy , and there are even roles for players who like to avoid combat , like the Medic class .
However , these roles also mean that there is a bigger barrier to entry for the game , as new players do n't necessarily understand their role or how to carry it out .
Additionally , everyone 's experience in the game can be hurt by a player who does n't serve their purpose .
Anyone who 's played with a medic who does n't heal people knows the frustration that can cause .
In the interest of fun and accessibility , it 's important for players to comprehend their character role as quickly as possible , and to be interested in fulfilling that role .
The latest game in the series excels at this .
Valve ' swas a bit of a surprise for eager fans .
Many were expecting a World - War - II - themed , realistic war simulation , as described in previews years before the release .
However , in the intervening time , Valve completely changed their design , and the final product was a silly , colorful game with cartoon characters inspired by early 20th - century commercial illustration .
One of the most memorable parts of the new game is the cast of colorful characters .
Each character class inis represented by a quirky , distinctive personality with an easily - recognized voice and appearance .
There is discussion in the game 's commentary of how the distinctive class silhouettes enable players to easily identify opponents , but there 's little mention of how these characters enable the team - based gameplay by allowing class roles to be easily understood and internalized .
In most games with character roles -- including the previousgames -- there 's little individuality to the classes .
Yes , characters look different , and have different effects , but they lack identity .
Sometimes , this is a good thing .
In , for example , race and gender give a distinct appearance , but not a strong personality .
This allows players to roleplay a character of their choice .
However , it does mean that character personality has little affect on gameplay .
In , things are different .
Comparing the old Heavy Weapon Guy to the new Heavy , or the old Spy to the new one , shows that there has been a drastic change in character design .
Previous games in the series let you play a scout , but in , you play The Scout .
The Scout has a distinctive accent , appearance , and personality .
He is conceited , sarcastic , and sadistic .
Through Valve's " Meet the Team " promotional videos and through the in - game voice taunts and reaction sound bytes , each class is provided with a unique and easily - identified identity .
This is amusing and easy to identify with , but it also serves as a simple introduction to the class .
By looking at and listening to the Scout , new players immediately know several things about him .
The Scout is thin , but wiry , implying his speed and lack of fortitude .
His rapid - fire taunts match the class 's preferred fighting style of circle - strafing around enemies .
Because of this , players can easily tell what role the Scout is meant to fulfill , and are encouraged to roleplay the character and therefore be a useful member of the team .
As a contrast , we can look at the Spy .
He is dressed in a suit and balaclava , implying that he is perhaps not the most physical of classes .
His voice is haughty and sly , which matches his sneak - and - stab play style .
A player who sees the Spy in action understands that he is a tricky character who is meant to attack from the shadows .
The same inferences can be made about the other classes .
The Heavy is slow but sturdy , while the Medic is a weak technician .
The Soldier is , well , a soldier .
The Demoman makes clever use of explosives , the Sniper calmly waits , and the Engineer makes intelligent constructions .
As for the Pyro ?
He ( or she ? ) clearly just likes fire .
These are not complex , deep human beings ; they are stereotypes .
That 's fine in , a game with little emotional depth which demands quick thinking and trained instincts .
Not only do the personalities educate new players , but they also help players pick a favorite class .
Someone who sympathizes with the slow - but - forceful Heavy is likely to also enjoy the class 's methodical approach .
Likewise , a player who identifies with the Demoman will find herself satisfied by bouncing grenades off of walls and laying explosive traps .
The technique of giving character classes distinct personalities can be applied to any game which separates players into distinct roles that should be understood quickly .
A similar thing was done in Blizzard 's , which gives the Warrior , Rogue , and Sorcerer unique appearances that helped to indicate their roles .
In , however , there is little personality assigned to each class , and teamwork is much less important than in The primary lessons to take from 's personalities are to create unique identities for each class , to make the identities reflect the class 's role , and to make the identities easy to identify and identify with .
Making the class identities distinct allows players to easily differentiate the classes by sight , sound , and behavior .
Matching the class identities to the class roles allows the player to easily understand and remember a class 's strengths , weaknesses , and responsibilities .
Lastly , when the identities are memorable and likable , players are more likely to feel connected to their character and to pick a class based on personality .
Few people would claim that 's world is especially deep , or that it has a particularly complex storyline .
What the game does have is a distinctive , appealing cast of characters , and it portrays its characters in a way that supports the gameplay .is so easy to learn and fun to play in part because of the excellent character design , including appearance , voice talent , and personality .

Former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele assumed the Republican National Committee 's chair a month ago with great fanfare .
The first African American elected to the position , Steele triumphed over a candidate who once belonged to a whites - only country club , and another who had distributed a CD that included the song , " Barack , the Magic Negro . "
Days after taking over the party 's moribund infrastructure , Steele promised an " off the hook " PR campaign to apply conservative principles to " urban - suburban hip - hop settings " -- offering the GOP a much - needed image makeover for the dawning of the age of Obama .
Hip - hop legend Russell Simmons hailed Steele 's election in an open letter , assuring his friend , " The hip - hop community remains eager to hear the views of national leaders like you " But Simmons added a warning : " Do n't let those who are angry in your base guide your choices or let the people to the left of President Obama push your buttons . "
Of course , many of those to " the left of President Obama , " including members of " the hip - hop community , " greeted Steele 's election with a collective yawn .
Meanwhile , the RNC chairman made little noise at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference , with one exception that occurred only after he finished addressing a dinner banquet .
He turned the mic over to Representative Michele Bachman of Minnesota .
" You be da man !
You be da man ! "
Bachmann repeatedly shouted to him .
The awkward incident was among the evening 's top stories on cable news shows , while Steele 's jeremiad against Obama 's stimulus package went almost unnoticed .
When Rush Limbaugh basked in the CPAC spotlight for more than an hour and a half on February 28 , drawing boisterous , sustained applause from conference attendees with a stemwinding speech reiterating his desire to see Obama " fail , " Steele took action .
The following evening , on CNN's D.L. Hughley show , Steele attempted to reassert control over the party .
When Hughley referred to Limbaugh as " the de facto leader of the Republican Party , " Steele shot back , " No , I 'm the de facto leader of the Republican Party ! "
And he mocked Limbaugh as an " entertainer " whose behavior was " incendiary " and " ugly . "
Almost as soon as the broadcast ended , a firestorm of criticism erupted on the right - wing blogosphere .
" It 's not easy watching a black guy stumble around in the dark , but really , I 'm trying , " wrote Dan Riehl , a marketing manager who hosts the popular conservative blog , RiehlWorldView.com , in posting widely circulated on the right .
While conservative bloggers and radio talkers piled on , Limbaugh lashed out at Steele with a condescending on - air rant , barking at the chairman " to go behind the scenes and start doing the work that you were elected to do . "
Finding himself under fire from Rush 's army of self - proclaimed " Dittoheads , " Steele immediately sued for peace .
" I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said were n't what I was thinking , " Steele whimpered .
" It was one of those things where I thinking I was saying one thing , and it came out differently .
What I was trying to say was a lot of peoplewant to make Rush the scapegoat , the bogeyman -- and he 's not . "
Steele 's apology recalled a similar incident from late January , when Republican Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia attacked Limbaugh for " throwing bricks " without paying the consequences .
As I reported for the Daily Beast , Gingrey invited himself on Limbaugh 's radio show the following day to grovel before the host .
" I clearly ended up putting my foot in my mouth on some of those comments , " the penitent congressman said .
But given Limbaugh 's well - documented history of racial controversy , and Steele 's position as the Republican Party 's first African American chairman , his apology is more significant than Gingrey's .
Limbaugh has , for example , mocked Obama as a " Halfrican - American " who should " become white ; " he has called for a " posthumous Medal of Honor " for the assassin of Martin Luther King , Jr. , James Earl Ray , and told an African American caller , " Take that bone out of your nose and call me back . "
Steele 's " off the hook " PR campaign is now off the rails .
Within days , he has gone from being " da man " to just another " Dittohead . "

Eighty - five years ago , on 2 June 1924 , during a blistering early summer in Chicago , a ravaged courtroom bruiser stepped into the future .
Clarence Darrow , with his seamed face and stooped shoulders making him look every one of his 67 years , was America 's greatest and most controversial defender of the lost and the damned .
But , as he hunched over his desk to write to the secret love of his life , Mary Field Parton , the old lawyer felt breathless .
Earlier that day , Darrow had agreed to represent Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb , two teenage lovers and the sons of Chicago millionaires , after they confessed to the world 's first " thrill - killing " of a 14 - year - old boy with whom Loeb had sometimes played tennis .
Darrow , the Ohio - born son of an abolitionist father and suffrage - supporting mother , was himself a leading civil libertarian and vehement opponent of the death penalty .
In this case , however , he confronted seemingly insurmountable odds ; his disturbing and disturbed young clients faced certain execution in what newspapers would soon call the trial of the century .
In agreeing to defend Leopold and Loeb , this brilliant orator who had spent his career battling many personal demons ( including a highly damaging accusation of bribing jurors ) caught a glimpse of the media - driven world with which we are now so familiar .
" I saw a dark vision of the future this morning , " Darrow wrote to Parton , a married journalist .
" This is all so shocking but , at once , I sense a strange new era .
Life will become cheap and tawdry , driven by a lust for sensation and mass stupidity .
Man has never been a noble beast but , now , our understanding and mercy will be tested to their limits . "
In fact , Darrow was about to plunge into an extraordinary trilogy of cases that would seal his legacy as the most influential trial lawyer in history .
Michael Mansfield , the British barrister who defended the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six , and more recently the families of Stephen Lawrence and Jean Charles de Menezes , agrees that , " These three trials were so vast in scope , and so significant in their impact , that Darrow 's work remains inspirational .
Starting with Leopold and Loeb and going on to the Scopes ' monkey ' trial , with its backdrop of evolution , and then defending a black doctor , Ossian Sweet , charged with murder , Darrow swept through a triangle of defining cases in quick succession .
In each one he showed a fascinating mix as a man of reason who used such emotion in court .
Judges have called my performances histrionic - but it 's nothing compared to Darrow . "
Far more significant than the glut of Hollywood movies they inspired - from Alfred Hitchcock 's Rope to Orson Welles in Compulsion to Spencer Tracey in Inherit the Wind - Darrow 's last trio of major cases pushed back courtroom boundaries as he tussled with issues that remain strikingly pertinent .
In two dizzying years , he pioneered campaigns against capital punishment , religious fundamentalism ( in the form of creationism ) and racism , while setting precedents in using psychiatric profiles , expert witnesses and a new form of oratorical showmanship to save his contrasting clients .
The trial of Leopold and Loeb centred on his most passionate cause - overcoming the death penalty - yet the Chicago Sun - Times insisted that he had sold out for " a cool million bucks " .
( In fact , Darrow 's modest fee was decided by the Bar Association ) .
The newspaper branded him a hypocrite who , having always fought for the poor and unfortunate , was now rushing to defend the impossibly rich for a reprehensible murder .
As part of a surreal sexual pact , Leopold and Loeb had randomly chosen the young Bobby Franks as their victim .
They lured him into a rental car and , " for the thrill of it " , killed him on a suburban side - street .
After their arrest , the 19 - year - old Leopold stunned reporters by suggesting that " the killing was an experiment .
It is just as easy to justify such a death as it is to justify an entomologist killing a beetle with a pin . "
Leopold claimed he and Loeb were intellectual supermen galvanised by Friedrich Nietzsche 's Beyond Good and Evil .
Loeb , 18 and better looking but not as well read , smirked that , " This thing will be the making of me . "
He was partially right .
The US was fixated by the case - and the public thirst for execution was so intense that individual citizens stated their credentials as hangmen .
A pensioner from Michigan offered $ 100 for the privilege of hanging Leopold and Loeb .
" I am 66 years old , but I am game .
I have no use for such fiends . "
Darrow was undeterred by the personal vitriol .
The case perplexed and intrigued him .
Unusually , especially for an old man in this more conservative era , he only needed to see how " Babe " Leopold looked yearningly at " Dickie " Loeb to recognise humanity , rather than just fiendish evil , amid their mental disease .
The ensuing trial was dominated by Darrow .
First he succeeded in having the evidence heard by a single judge rather than a less easily controlled jury ; then he had to make judicial history by persuading the court that mental illness should be regarded as sufficient grounds to commute the death penalty .
Psychiatry was then not considered a medical science in legal circles , and Darrow waged battle for two days over the issue , eventually convincing the judge to set a precedent and allow expert witnesses .
Mansfield acknowledges Darrow 's groundbreaking work : " With the Tottenham Three [ the trio of black men wrongly convicted of murdering PC Keith Blakelock in 1985 ] , we struggled to persuade the court of appeal that judging mental vulnerabilities , as opposed to insanity , should include expert evidence .
So it 's startling that , in 1924 , Darrow opened the door to expert psychiatric evidence .
It was a seminal moment . "
Darrow , in a closing address spanning an extraordinary three days , produced one of history 's most compelling courtroom speeches against capital punishment .
On the third day , despite the blue brilliance of the sky outside , he thundered : " Through history you can trace the burnings , the boiling , the drawing and quartering , the hanging of people in England at the crossroads ...
I am begging this court not to turn backward to the barbarous past .
I am pleading for the future ... when hatred and cruelty will not control our hearts , when we can learn that all life is worth saving ; that mercy is the highest attribute of man . "
Darrow 's eyes moistened when he saw that Judge John Caverly was crying .
Newspaper reports the following day refer to them as " silent tears " , but they were powerful enough to alter the shape of the judge 's twitching mouth .
Darrow 's strategy , and oratory , had worked .
Leopold and Loeb were duly spared the death penalty - and sentenced instead , at Darrow 's request , to life imprisonment .
" I 've never cried in court and I hope I 've never made my juries cry either , " says the British barrister John Cooper , who is renowned for his work on the Leah Betts case , and in representing the families of those who died at Deepcut barracks and of those killed in the Hercules and Nimrod disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Darrow , like all great advocates , was a creature of his time .
He tapped into the public mind with brilliant oratory .
That oratorical art has died because people today are not used to hearing long and florid speeches .
The idea that Darrow could speak for six straight hours and hold his audience is staggering .
But in photographs you see hundreds massed outside court to watch him .
That would n't happen today . "
Darrow was hailed by Variety as " America 's greatest one - man stage draw " after his next case , the following summer , saw him face down religious fundamentalism in a trial that became just as famous as Leopold and Loeb .
Described as " a duel to the death " between Darrow and the prosecuting attorney ( and former Democratic party leader ) William Jennings Bryan , the Scopes " monkey " trial began as a publicity stunt .
The American Civil Liberties Union hoped to challenge a new law that prohibited the teaching of evolutionary theory in Tennessee , and a local high - school teacher , 24 - year - old John Scopes , agreed to be " arrested " .
The ACLU was less impressed when national hysteria , sparked by the bitter enmity between Bryan and Darrow , swamped the trial .
Bryan warned , " If evolution wins , Christianity goes . "
Darrow responded forcefully : " John Scopes is n't on trial , civilisation is on trial .
The prosecution is opening the doors for a reign of bigotry equal to anything in the middle ages . "
A furious showdown could only be resolved by a crushing cross-examination from Darrow , who surprised everyone by calling Bryan to the witness stand .
He then systematically dismantled the pompous politician , ridiculing his denunciation of scientific fact in favour of biblical allegory with such force that HL Mencken , the celebrated columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun , could barely contain himself : " This three - time candidate for the presidency came in a hero and he sat down as one of the most tragic asses in American history . "
At the end of that same week , after the trial fizzled out , Bryan suffered a massive stroke and died .
" There 's a rumour about town , " Scopes wrote , " that ' the old devil Darrow ' killed Bryan with his inquisition . "
By now , it seemed the whole of the US was captivated by Darrow 's courtroom performances .
But this was also a nation riven by racial tension and , barely three months later , in October 1925 , Darrow again put himself at the centre of controversy by attempting to prevent the apparently inevitable conviction and execution of an eminent black doctor , Ossian Sweet , and 10 other " negroes " accused of murder .
Their crime had been to defend themselves against a Ku Klux Klan - led lynch mob that surrounded the Sweet family 's house as soon as they had moved into a white neighbourhood in Detroit .
Sweet asked his two brothers and some friends to help protect them and , on the second night , when the mob closed in and a rock smashed a window , Sweet 's youngest brother , 21 - year - old Henry , fired into the dark .
He hit two men , killing one and injuring the other .
All 11 in the house were charged with murder .
" The Sweet case , " Mansfield says , " carries most resonance for me .
It reminds me of the Stephen Lawrence inquest because two decent black families faced similar difficulties .
There was extraordinary racism in the Lawrence case - even if it was not as naked as that in Detroit .
But I love the way Darrow mixes serious political points with edgy humour .
Pure pugilism does n't work in court because it makes people switch off - he taught us that truth . "
Darrow exposed the violent racism of the Sweets ' neighbours and a mistrial had to be declared in November 1925 , when the all - white jury could not reach a verdict .
In the second trial , when Henry Sweet was placed alone in the dock , Darrow produced his greatest performance .
He was magisterial when exposing the racism that scarred America , prompting Ossian Sweet to say , " I faced the same mob that had hounded my people through its entire history .
I was filled with a peculiar fear , the fear of one who knows the history of my race . "
Inspired by such lucidity , Darrow asked the white jurors questions that made them gasp .
" If you had a choice , " he murmured , " would you lose your eyesight or become coloured ?
Would you have your leg cut off , or have a black skin ? "
In May 1926 , during his closing address , Darrow 's words rang out as they had done for so many decades in defence of the accused .
After seven hours on his feet , he bore down on the jury one last time : " I ask you in the name of progress and the human race to return a verdict of ' not guilty ' . "
But when the foreman , George Small , led the jurors back into court , the swiftness of their deliberations indicated that Darrow had lost .
The old attorney 's huge head jutted towards the jury box as he waited .
Small paused when asked if they had reached a verdict .
" Yes , " he said , before crying out the two words that mattered : " Not guilty ! "
Ossian Sweet buried his face in his hands while Darrow almost collapsed in exhaustion .
The prosecution lawyer Robert Toms rushed to catch him but Darrow , eyes glinting darkly , laughed : " Oh , I 'm all right .
I 've heard that verdict before . "
Darrow 's Shakespearean battles continue today .
Racism may be more subtle than that endured by the Sweets or Stephen Lawrence , but the scars remain raw .
And Darrow would have snorted in recognition at the continuing struggle over evolutionary theory .
In Tennessee he had asked , " Is it possible this trial is taking place in the 20th century ? "
And yet , even in our current century , school - board members in Tennessee have campaigned for stickers to be placed across textbooks with the warning that " evolution remains unproven " .
Mansfield regards Darrow 's work as " a reminder that each generation wages the same war against ignorance and prejudice in a different way .
His greatness is that he countered prejudice in every form . "
Even more evocatively , Darrow 's ghostly figure still conjures up an enduring hope that , even in a dark and reeling world , compassion and reason will finally prevail .
" Darrow gave us that belief , " Cooper agrees .
" You know , if the old devil was around today , I 'd love to give him a call for a bit of advice " .

Courtroom dramas
Film adaptations of great Darrow cases
Rope ( 1948 )
Directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring James Stewart , this oblique take on Leopold and Loeb was based on Patrick Hamilton 's play of the same name .
It now appears rather stilted and dated , but it 's still intriguing for the way in which Hitchcock explores Leopold 's idea that committing murder would elevate a pair of killers to the realm of Nietzschean supermen .
Compulsion ( 1959 )
Richard Fleischer 's film was based on Meyer Levin's " faction " novel .
From his prison cell , Leopold attempted to sue Levin and the film 's producers , claiming that Levin 's version of his story made him feel " physically sick " - because his character agrees to carry out murder so that he might obliterate unwanted homosexual longings inside himself .
Orson Welles played Darrow , while Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman were Leopold and Loeb .
Inherit the Wind ( 1960 )
A hugely popular but wildly melodramatic version of the Scopes " monkey " trial , Stanley Kramer 's Hollywood epic starred Spencer Tracey as Darrow , Fredric March as William Jennings Bryan and Gene Kelly as the acerbic columnist HL Mencken .
Nominated for four Oscars , the film now appears terribly overblown .
There have since been three TV film versions - with Darrow being played by Melvyn Douglas in 1965 , Jason Robards in 1988 and Jack Lemmon in 1999 .
Swoon ( 1992 )
Tom Kalin 's stylish film stresses the sexual relationship between Leopold and Loeb , and offers a contemporary and largely successful reworking of the story of the strange and stricken young lovers .
Also ...
Michael Haneke 's distressing Funny Games ( released in Europe in 1997 and again , in a diluted shot - by - shot US remake by the same director , in 2008 ) and Barbet Schroeder 's Murder By Numbers ( 2002 ) carry clear allusions to Leopold and Loeb .
Meanwhile , in September 2009 , in Trevor Nunn 's recreation of Inherit the Wind at the Old Vic , Kevin Spacey will play Darrow in the latest theatrical version of the Scopes monkey trial .
President Obama has indicated he wants a healthcare bill on his desk sometime around October , before we worry about timetables , however , we as a nation have to answer two very fundamental questions .
First , should all Americans be entitled to healthcare in the same way we respond to other basic needs such as education , police , and fire protection ?
Second , if we are to provide quality healthcare to all , how do we accomplish that in the most cost - effective way ?
The answer to the first question is pretty clear , and one of the reasons that Barack Obama was elected president .
Most Americans believe that all of us should have healthcare coverage , and that nobody should be left out of the system .
The real debate is how we accomplish that goal in an affordable and sustainable way .
To me , the evidence is overwhelming that we must end the private insurance company domination of healthcare in our country and move toward a publicly funded , single - payer , Medicare - for - all approach .
Our current private health insurance system is the most costly , wasteful , complicated , and bureaucratic in the world .
But in America , the people who have to navigate that maze are the lucky ones .
Today , 46 million people have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments .
At a time when 60 million people , including many with insurance , do not have access to a medical home base , more than 18,000 Americans die every year from preventable illnesses .
That is six times the number who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Despite the fact that we spend almost twice as much per person on healthcare as any other country , our healthcare outcomes lag behind many other nations .
According to the World Health Organization , the United States ranks 37th in terms of health system performance and we are far behind many other countries in terms of such important indices as infant mortality , life expectancy , and preventable deaths .
The main reason we get such bad results is that the function of private health insurance companies is not to provide quality healthcare for all , but to make huge profits for those who own the companies .
With thousands of different health benefit programs designed to maximize profits , private health insurance companies spend an incredible 30 percent of each healthcare dollar on administration and billing , exorbitant CEO compensation packages , advertising , lobbying , and campaign contributions .
Public programs like Medicare , Medicaid , and the department of Veterans Affairs are administered for far less .
In recent years , while we have experienced an acute shortage of primary healthcare doctors as well as nurses and dentists , we are paying for a huge increase in healthcare bureaucrats and bill collectors .
Over the past three decades , the number of administrative personnel has grown by 25 times the number of physicians .
While healthcare costs are soaring , it should surprise no one that profits of private health insurance companies are more than keeping pace .
From 2003 to 2007 , the combined profits of the nation 's major health insurance companies increased by 170 percent .
And , while more and more Americans are losing their jobs and health insurance , the top executives in the industry are receiving lavish compensation packages .
It 's not just William McGuire , the former head of United Health , who several years ago accumulated stock options worth an estimated $ 1.6 billion , or Cigna CEO Edward Hanway who made more than $ 120 million in the past five years .
The reality is that CEO compensation for the top health insurance companies now averages $ 14.2 million .
The president has been supportive of a public option – a plan that people could opt into if they are uninsured or do n't like their private coverage .
But the situation is extremely fluid .
How do you get to the root of a problem when you fail to take on the private health industry ?
The time is now for our nation to address the most profound moral and economic issue we face .
The time is now for our country to join the rest of the industrialized world and provide cost - effective , comprehensive , quality healthcare to every man , woman , and child in our country .
The time is now to take on the powerful special interests in the insurance and pharmaceutical industries and pass a single - payer national healthcare program .

An ultra - broadband , low - power radio chip , modeled on the human inner ear could enable wireless devices capable of receiving cell phone , Internet , radio and television signals .
Rahul Sarpeshkar , associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science , and graduate student Soumyajit Mandal designed the chip to mimic the inner ear , or cochlea .
The chip is faster than any human - designed radio - frequency spectrum analyzer and also operates at much lower power .
Sarpeshkar and his students describe their new chip , which they have dubbed the " radio frequency ( RF ) cochlea , " in a paper in the June issue of the IEEE Journal of Solid - State Circuits .
They have also filed for a patent to incorporate the RF cochlea in a universal or software radio architecture that is designed to efficiently process a broad spectrum of signals including cellular phone , wireless Internet , FM , and other signals .
The RF cochlea mimics the structure and function of the biological cochlea , which uses fluid mechanics , piezoelectrics and neural signal processing to convert sound waves into electrical signals that are sent to the brain .
As sound waves enter the cochlea , they create mechanical waves in the cochlear membrane and the fluid of the inner ear , activating hair cells ( cells that cause electrical signals to be sent to the brain ) .
The cochlea can perceive a 100 - fold range of frequencies — in humans , from 100 to 10,000 Hz.
Sarpeshkar used the same design principles in the RF cochlea to create a device that can perceive signals at million - fold higher frequencies , which includes radio signals for most commercial wireless applications .
" The cochlea quickly gets the big picture of what 's going on in the sound spectrum , " said Sarpeshkar .
" The more I started to look at the ear , the more I realized it 's like a super radio with 3,500 parallel channels . "
The device demonstrates what can happen when researchers take inspiration from fields outside their own , says Sarpeshkar .
" Somebody who works in radio would never think of this , and somebody who works in hearing would never think of it , but when you put the two together , each one provides insight into the other , " he says .
For example , in addition to its use for radio applications , the work provides an analysis of why cochlear spectrum analysis is faster than any known spectrum - analysis algorithm .
Thus , it sheds light on the mechanism of hearing as well .
The RF cochlea , embedded on a silicon chip measuring 1.5 mm by 3 mm , works as an analog spectrum analyzer , detecting the composition of any electromagnetic waves within its perception range .
Electromagnetic waves travel through electronic inductors and capacitors ( analogous to the biological cochlea 's fluid and membrane ) .
Electronic transistors play the role of the cochlea 's hair cells .
The analog RF cochlea chip is faster than any other RF spectrum analyzer and consumes about 100 times less power than what would be required for direct digitization of the entire bandwidth .
That makes it desirable as a component of a universal or " cognitive " radio , which could receive a broad range of frequencies and select which ones to attend to .
Biological inspiration
This is not the first time Sarpeshkar has drawn on biology for inspiration in designing electronic devices .
Trained as an engineer but also a student of biology , he has found many similar patterns in the natural and man-made worlds ( http://www.rle.mit.edu/avbs).
For example , Sarpeshkar 's group , in MIT 's Research Laboratory of Electronics , has also developed an analog speech - synthesis chip inspired by the human vocal tract and a novel analysis - by - synthesis technique based on the vocal tract .
The chip 's potential for robust speech recognition in noise and its potential for voice identification have several applications in portable devices and security applications .
The researchers have built circuits that can analyze heart rhythms for wireless heart monitoring , and are also working on projects inspired by signal processing in cells .
In the past , his group has worked on hybrid analog - digital signal processors inspired by neurons in the brain .
Sarpeshkar says that engineers can learn a great deal from studying biological systems that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years to perform sensory and motor tasks very efficiently in noisy environments while using very little power .
" Humans have a long way to go before their architectures will successfully compete with those in nature , especially in situations where ultra-energy - efficient or ultra - low - power operation are paramount , " he said .
Nevertheless , " We can mine the intellectual resources of nature to create devices useful to humans , just as we have mined her physical resources in the past .
The summer spike in killings is just one of several findings unearthed in an analysis by The New York Times of multiyear homicide trends .
The information  detailing homicides during the years 2003 to 2008  was compiled mainly from open - records requests with the New York Police Department , and a searchable database of details on homicides in the city during those years is available online for readers to explore at nytimes.com / nyregion .
Of course , the dominant and most important trend involving murder in New York has been the enormous decline in killings over the last 15 years , to levels not seen since the early 1960s .
Still , hundreds of people are killed every year in the city , and The Times ’s findings provide insights about who is killed in New York , as well as who does the killing , where murders occur and why .
Women , for instance , are less likely to be either victims or killers .
Those who were killed  at least 73 women were in 2008  were almost always murdered by someone they knew  boyfriends , husbands or relatives .
From 2003 to 2008 , the number of women killed each year by strangers was in the single digits  excluding cases in which the police do not know if the killer knew the victim .
Last year , as few as eight women died at the hands of strangers .
Brooklyn  as it has since at least 2003  led all boroughs in the number of homicides last year , with 213 .
Last year , the 73rd Precinct , which includes the neighborhoods of Ocean Hill and Brownsville , had the largest death toll , 31 .
The bloodiest block in Brooklyn was in the 77th Precinct , in Crown Heights , bounded by Schenectady Avenue , Sterling Place , Troy Avenue and St. Johns Place .
But the borough with the most homicides per capita was the Bronx .
Yes , God forbid our president distance himself from a brief that argues that gay and lesbian marriages are akin to incest and pedophilia .
I ask again , who is advising these people ?
From ABC :
TAPPER : Does the president stand by the legal brief that the Justice Department filed last week that argued in favor the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act ?
GIBBS : Well , as you know , that the Justice Department is charged with upholding the law of the land , even though the president believes that that law should be repealed .
TAPPER : I understand that , but a lot of legal experts say that the brief did n’t have to be as comprehensive and make all the arguments that it made , such as comparing same - sex unions to incestuous ones , in one controversial paragraph …
GIBBS : Well …
TAPPER : … that ’s upset a lot of the president ’s supporters .
Does the president stand by the content , the arguments made in that brief ?
GIBBS : Well , again , it ’s the president ’s Justice Department .
And , again , we have the role of upholding the law of the land while the president has stated and will work with Congress to change that law .
Located in the Kara - Kum desert of Turkmenistan is the village of Darvaza ( Derweze ) near to where , in 1971 , a team of Soviet prospectors allegedly drilled into a large chamber filled with natural gas .
The roof of the cavern collapsed leaving a crater - like sinkhole some 25 metres deep with a diameter of approximately 60 - 70 metres .
It soon became evident that natural gas was still rising into the crater from even deeper sources and the story goes that the decision was made to ignite the emissions rather than risk either a concentrated build - up of gas or local poisoning .
According to various sources it has burned continuously since then and has apparently been named “ The Gate to Hell ” by the local people .
However , another source that spoke with the guides from the region claims that it is a wholly natural phenomenon .
This “ it ” is nearby the village of Darwaza ( also spelled Derweze ) in the middle of Turkmenistan ’s Kara - Kum Desert .
In 1971 , when Turkmenistan was a republic of the Soviet Union , the state energy company was drilling near Darwaza when they accidentally bored into an underground cavern filled with natural gas .
The drilling , combined with the sudden release of the pressure the natural gas was exerting on the cavern walls , caused the ground beneath the cavern to collapse .
Those working at the drill site were surprised ( to say the least ) to have suddenly collapsed the ground beneath them .
Spot Cool Stuff , having no geologists on staff , is not in a position to judge whether the geologists at Darwaza in 1971 should have known the cavern was there .
But what they did after the collapse seems to us to be . . . what ’s the phrase ? . . . incredibly stupid .
The geologists decided to clear the cavern of the natural gas by setting it on fire .
It has been burning since .
The spectacle of this large burning gap in the ground is a rather incredible to witness .
Obviously , it is most incredible at night when the red glow of the flames from Hell ’s Gate are visible from up to 40 km ( 25 miles ) away .
The cater itself is about 75 meters ( 250 feet ) at its widest point .
The intense heat of the fire makes it difficult to stand near the carter ’s edge for more than two or three minutes at a time .
This is probably for the best :
The funes coming from the crater are toxic .
Darwaza is a bumpy four hour car ride from the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat .
There ’s no hotel in Darwaza .
A travel specialists can arrange both a stay in a local yurt along with a night time Hell ’s Gate visit .
Police say they have recovered a long - arm rifle and a pistol following an eight - hour siege at a McDonald 's restaurant on the New South Wales mid-north coast .
A Sydney man in his late 40s has been arrested after surrendering to police at around 4:30 pm ( AEST ) .
He had walked into the restaurant in Port Macquarie about 8:00 am and fired two shots from a gun , forcing the evacuation of more than 20 staff and customers .
Police Commander Paul Fehon says no -one was injured during the standoff .
" Negotiators and the Tactical Response Unit have secured the surrender of the person and he exited the restaurant , " he said .
" The person was spoken to for approximately eight hours .
Two weapons have been located and they 've been secured . "
At one point during the siege the man went outside the building but walked back in shortly afterwards .
The media and public had been kept well back behind police cordons , while the Oxley Highway was also closed .
A McDonald 's spokeswoman says it is not known what sparked the incident .
A leading abortion opponent , however , said Obama 's rhetoric does not match his voting record and his previously stated views on abortion rights .
David N. O'Steen , the executive director of National Right to Life , said Obama 's remarks to the magazine " are either quite disingenuous or they reflect that Obama does not know what he is talking about . "
" You cannot believe that abortion should not be allowed for mental health reasons and support Roe v Wade , " O'Steen said .
But that 's nothing compared to Obama 's most recent comments about the most controversial social issue of them all : abortion .
In a recent interview , Obama appears to back away from his long - stated positions on abortion ( and a proposed federal abortion rights law he had co-sponsored ) , repudiate 35 years of accepted Supreme Court rulings on the issue and embrace a view on abortion restrictions that has been expressed on the Court only by Justices Thomas and Scalia .
Obama 's remarks are printed verbatim in the interview , published yesterday in Relevant Magazine .
Read them — there 's no mistaking that Obama says he no longer will support what 's long been a cornerstone of the abortion rights debate :
The Court 's insistence that laws banning abortions after the fetus is viable ( now about 22 weeks ) contain an exception to allow doctors to perform them if necessary to protect a pregnant woman 's mental health .
' I have repeatedly said that I think it 's entirely appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late - term abortions as long as there is a strict , well - defined exception for the health of the mother .
Now , I do n't think that ' mental distress ' qualifies as the health of the mother , " Obama said .
" I think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy , where there are real , significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term .
Otherwise , as long as there is such a medical exception in place , I think we can prohibit late - term abortions . "
Wow .
This has been a central battleground issue in the Supreme Court going back 35 years , to Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton , when the Court ruled a woman had a constitutional right to abortion .
The decisions said state 's can ban all abortions after the fetus is viable -- but that any restrictions must include exceptions to protect a woman 's physical and emotional health .
In the years since , anti-abortion groups have fought hard against mental health exceptions , arguing that they create giant loopholes that make abortion bans meaningless .
Doctors , they argue , can always find a " mental health " exception .
But abortion rights groups just as strongly argue the mental health exception is critical to preserving a woman 's right to an abortion — and that the woman and her doctor must be allowed to make those decisions about her health without government interference .
In 1973 , when the Court issued Roe and Doe — on the same day — it sided with the abortion rights groups and said states could not interfere with a doctor 's medical judgment on whether an abortion was necessary .
" [ M]edical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors -- physical , emotional , psychological , familial , and the woman 's age -- relevant to the well - being of the patient , " said the Supreme Court in Doe , which was a companion case to Roe .
" All these factors may relate to health .
This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment . "
Obama 's comments that he does not support mental health exceptions in so - called post-viability abortions ( after 22 weeks ) is squarely at odds with that holding , which remains the law of the land today .
Indeed , only Thomas and Scalia have expressly supported the position that a mental health exception is not necessary .
They penned a dissent to that effect in 1998 , when the Court refused to take up the Ohio case that struck down a state law because it did not include an exception to protect a woman 's mental health .
Obama : " My only point is this -- historically I have been a strong believer in a women 's right to choose with her doctor , her pastor and her family .
2. Section 3209 's husband notification provision constitutes an undue burden and is therefore invalid .
A significant number of women will likely be prevented from obtaining an abortion just as surely as if Pennsylvania had outlawed the procedure entirely .
The fact that § 3209 may affect fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions does not save it from facial invalidity , since the proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction , not the group for whom it is irrelevant .
Furthermore , it cannot be claimed that the father 's interest in the fetus ' welfare is equal to the mother 's protected liberty , since it is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the fetus will have a far greater impact on the pregnant woman 's bodily integrity than it will on the husband .
Section 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common law status of married women but repugnant to this Court 's present understanding of marriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution .
See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth , 428 U.S. 52 , 69 . Pp. 46 -58 .
While NARAL relased an execrable statement in which it shot its credibility in the foot it had n't already shot when it endorsed him before the end of the primary and admitted that it was after his donor list , others were n't so inclined to cut him any slack : I never thought I 'd be saying this , but O'Steen is right .
There 's no way to reconcile Obama 's comments to Relevant with support of Roe v. Wade ( and Doe v. Bolton , which was decided the same day ) .
So either he 's making a disingenuous pitch to evangelical voters , or he has n't taken the trouble to study the issue and the actual cases ( kind of a big failing in a Constitutional Law prof , no ? ) .
This is clearly explained by Jan Crawford Greenburg , ABC 's legal correspondent , in this article passed on by Shakers sassysenora and lola in comments ( emphasis mine ) :
Let that sink in a bit .
Barack Obama , professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Chicago Law School -- which , to borrow a phrase from Clarice Starling , is not a charm school -- is running around telling Christian magazines that he does n't think mental health should be considered important when considering exceptions to bans on third - term abortions , which is wholly , squarely at odds with the very holding of the decisions legalizing abortion , while at the same time maintaining that he supports Roe .
Either he 's slicing things very fine -- the inclusion of mental health as part of the package is part of Doe , not Roe , and he 's only said he supports Roe -- or he just has n't bothered to read the cases and educate himself about things .
Because that phrase , " squarely at odds with the holding " that Greenburg used ?
That 's legalese for , " Did n't you even read the fucking case , you dipshit ?
" Or , and this is what 's really scary to think about , he really believes all this .
Which , when you combine it with the continuation of the faith - based initiatives , his plans for a religious council to help set the national agenda , and his specifically religious ( and specifically evangelical - Christian ) outreach , makes me wonder how much closer to a theocracy he 'll get than Bush managed .
Why is it scary ?
Because of the company he keeps in that position :
Then there 's his backpedaling / " clarification " of his remarks
This is n't the first time he 's dropped the " pastor and family " bit into this .
And again , he 's simply wrong on the law .
From a summary of the holdings in Planned Parenthood v. Casey
But you know who was in favor of that husband notification provision , and argued it was n't an undue burden ?
Sam Alito , who was on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals when it heard Planned Parenthood v. Casey , and who wrote a dissent from the rest of the panel 's decision to invalidate the husband notification provision .
Now , there is one possibility that might charitably explain Obama 's terrible record when he speaks about choice : he started off his political career in a black community in Chicago , and many people of color are extremely leery of abortion because abortion and sterilization and removal of their children was used to control them in the past ( and , sadly , in the present , now using drug abuse disability , or other perceived unfitness as a proxy ; see also Killing the Black Body by Dorothy Roberts ) .
It could be that he had to vote the party line on matters of choice in order to maintain party backing , but that he never learned to speak about these issues because they were not big issues in the community he represented .
And then , when he ran for Senate , his opposition was a joke after Jack Ryan dropped out , so the issue rarely came up .
When he did speak publicly , he often couched his answers in social - conservative rhetoric , which might have worked well in Illinois .
But running for President is a whole different ball game , and abortion is going to come up .
If he has any prayer of convincing those already leery of him that he 's strongly for choice , he 's got to stop sounding like Scalia , Thomas and Alito .
Naturally fallen trees will become a dramatic artwork
A ' ghost rainforest ' of huge tree stumps from the jungles of Africa is to form a dramatic artwork in London 's Trafalgar Square .
The display aims to highlight the threat of deforestation .
It will surround Nelson 's Column - which at 169 feet is about the same height as the trees while alive .
By night green laser beams will shine upwards to mark where the trees would have reached if they were still standing in their rainforest in Ghana .
The project is the brainchild of artist Angela Palmer who ventured to a remote logging camp in the west of the country to locate naturally fallen trees for the exhibit .
They 'll evoke the stark landscapes of the First World War where only the splintered tree stumps remained
Angela Palmer , Artist
Her hope is to raise awareness of the rate at which tropical forests are being cleared and the resulting impact on global warming .
The destruction of tropical rainforests currently releases nearly one - fifth of all man -made greenhouse gases .
" Just as it is shocking to see a rhino with its horn hacked off , so it will be shocking to see these stumps - evidence of man's hand in an act that could devastate our world .
" For some people , the stumps may appear to be beautiful sculptures .
" But for others they 'll evoke the stark landscapes of the First World War where only the splintered tree stumps remained . "
The artwork has the support of the authorities in Ghana which after years of heavy logging became the first African country to sign an agreement with the EU outlawing trade in illegally - felled timber .
The stumps will be cleaned for shipping by one of Ghana 's largest timber producers , John Bitar .
A British firm , Timbmet , is helping with logistics .
One of Britain 's leading rainforest specialists , Professor Yadvinder Malhi of Oxford University , is providing advice and plans to study the trees ' roots .
In an operation starting at midnight on November 15 , the ' ghost forest ' will be hauled into position ready to be unveiled the following morning .
The office of the Mayor of London has given permission for the stumps to remain in Trafalgar Square for a week .
Oxford - based Angela Palmer hopes the artwork will then be moved to Copenhagen for the crucial United Nations conference on climate change in December .
The fate of the rainforests will be high on the agenda .
" My intention is that on the last five days of the Copenhagen Conference , a lumberjack will chop the stumps into thousands of pieces - an unforgettable reminder to press into the hands of each delegate there . "

The Limusaurus fossil sits among small crocodile fossils
A new dinosaur unearthed in western China has shed light on the evolution from dinosaur hands to the wing bones in today 's birds .
The fossil , from about 160 million years ago , has been named Limusaurus inextricabilis .
The find contributes to a debate over how an ancestral hand with five digits evolved to one with three in birds .
The work , published in Nature , suggests that the middle three digits , rather than the " thumb " and first two , remain .
Theropods - the group of dinosaurs ancestral to modern birds and which include the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex - are known for having hands and feet with just three digits .
It 's a really weird animal - it 's got no teeth , had a beak and a very long neck , and very wimpy forelimbs
James Clark , GWU
It has been a matter of debate how the three - fingered hand developed from its five - fingered ancestor .
Each digit among the five was composed of a specific number of bones , or phalanges .
Palaeontologists have long argued that it is the first ( corresponding to the thumb ) , second , and third fingers from that ancestral hand that survived through to modern birds , on grounds that the three fingers in later animals exhibit the correct number of phalanges .
However , developmental biologists have shown that bird embryos show growth of all five digits , but it is the first and fifth that later stop growing and are reabsorbed .
The remaining three bones fuse and form a vestigial " hand " hidden in the middle of a bird 's wing .
' Weird animal ' James Clark of George Washington University in Washington DC and Xing Xu from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing hit an palaeontologist 's gold mine in the Junggar Basin of northwestern China .
Previous digs have unearthed the oldest known fossil belonging to the tyrannosaur group and the oldest horned dinosaur among several others .
The dinosaurs had beaks and may have had feathers
This time , the ancient mire has yielded a primitive ceratosaur , a theropod that often had horns or crests , many of whom had knobbly fingers without claws .
" It 's a really weird animal - it 's got no teeth , had a beak and a very long neck , and very wimpy forelimbs , " Professor Clark told BBC News .
" Then when we looked closely at the hand , we noticed it was relevant to a very big question in palaeontology . "
The fossil has a first finger which is barely present , made up of just one small bone near the wrist .
The fifth finger is gone altogether .
It is a fossil that appears to offer a snapshot of evolution , proving that the more modern three - fingered hand is made up of the middle digits of the ancestral hand , with the outer two being shed .
The third finger is made up of the four phalange bones that the second should have , and it is presumed that the second would lose one bone to become like the first finger that was missing in the fossil .
This process of shifting patterns of gene expression from one limb or digit to another is known as an " identity shift " , and was again caught in the act - making the conflicting theories of bird hand origin suddenly align .
" This is amazing - it 's the first time we 've seen this thing actually starting to disappear , " Jack Conrad , a palaeontologist at the American Museum of Natural History , told BBC News .
" There 's been this fundamental rift - there was no way to make peace between the good data we were seeing from the developmental biologists and the palaeontological evidence that showed with every fossil we found we were seeing [ fingers ] one , two and three . "

NBA Rumors : Nash ’s extension , Grizzlies like Thabeet and more
– Steve Nash plans to wait and see what happens to the Suns ’ roster before getting serious about an extension .
– Ron Artest would like to return to Houston , but if he gets an offer he can’t refuse from someone else , he ’s not going to refuse it .
– The Nets have been rumored to be shopping Yi Jianlian , but Rod Thorn does n’t see it that way .
– Before the lottery , the Grizzlies were supposedly one of the few teams to have more interest in Hasheem Thabeet than Blake Griffin , so expect Memphis to take the UConn shotblocker with the second pick in the draft .
– ESPN Insider says that the Knicks ’ interest in Stephen Curry might have more to do with LeBron ’s friendship with and admiration for the young man than his being the right pick for the Knicks .
So they may draft Curry to have a better shot at LeBron next summer .
– It looks like Rockets owner Leslie Alexander is willing to spend .
There ’s never been a better time to wrestle good players from other teams looking to cut salary .
The Rockets have T - Mac ’s monster contract ( $ 22.5 million ) that expires next summer , which means the Rockets may be able to pull off a deal similar to the Iverson / Billups swap that the Nuggets made last year .
– The Jazz are willing to pay luxury tax to keep Paul Millsap on the roster .
This could just be a smokescreen meant to dissuade other teams from making the restricted free agent an offer , but the Jazz do seem determined to re-sign the talented forward .
And now for the weather .
The 2020s are looking warm and dry , with occasional heavy winter showers .
The 2050s should be sunny and warm , with scattered deaths due to heatwaves across London and the south - east .
And looking ahead to the 2080s , temperatures could reach 41C , so be sure to pack the suncream for your picnic .
And watch out for those great white sharks !
Scientists today issued the most detailed assessment yet of how global warming will unfold across Britain .
In a range of possible scenarios published by the government , the experts painted a picture of a very different UK , with soaring summertime temperatures and dwindling rainfall .
Announcing the results , Hilary Benn , environment secretary , said global warming will affect " every aspect of our daily lives " .
The scientists say summer rainfall in south - east England could decrease by a fifth by the 2050s .
Average mean temperatures are likely to rise by more than 2C across the UK by 2040s .
If carbon emissions continue to rise , there is a 10 % chance that temperatures in the southeast could rise by 8C or more by the 2080s .
The results are aimed at industries and organisations that need to make long - term investment decisions that could be influenced by a changing climate .
They come as scientists urge politicians to focus on adapting to inevitable climate change as well as on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Benn said : " There is no doubt about it , climate change is the biggest challenge facing the world today .
It is already happening , the hottest ten years on record globally have all been since 1990 .
This landmark scientific evidence shows not only that we need to tackle the causes of climate change , but also that we must deal with the consequences . "
The new predictions follow a similar exercise in 2002 , that produced maps of likely changes across Britain for the 2020s , 2050s and 2080s .
They showed the UK faced drier , warmer summers and wetter , milder winters .
Experts say the new results are more powerful , because they present the relative probabilities of a range of possible outcomes .
They also cover three different possible futures , in which carbon emissions are low , medium or high .
Benn said the world was currently heading along the medium scenario , but that there was a risk that emissions could increase towards the high pathway .
Under the high emissions scenario , the results suggest the hottest summer days could be 12C warmer than today , with peak summer temperatures in London regularly topping 40C .
To produce the new predictions , the scientists at the Met Office Hadley Centre ran 300 versions of their sophisticated climate computer model , and pooled the results to see which outcomes were most likely .
The results cannot be used to predict specific weather on future dates , but they indicate broad trends .
Andy Brown , climate change and environmental performance manager with Anglian Water , said the results would help the company plan key infrastructure such as reservoirs .
" The increased resolution and probabilities will help to give us more focus . "
The breakdown into small regions , just 25 km across , will help too .
" Rainfall can be very localised so it will help us make plans to deal with events . "
Paul Bettison , chair of the environment board at the Local Government Association : " We need to start encouraging people to plan for the future .
Schools in other countries more used to blistering hot summers are built with large amounts of shade .
Our teachers chase people out of shady classrooms to enjoy the sunshine . "
Better projections of climate in the 2050s and even the 2080s can help local authorities to force developers to adapt their designs , he says .
And existing regulations only insist on a minimum temperature inside buildings such as schools , that is likely to change to include maximum temperature too .
" When the original act was written in the 1960s nobody had heard of climate change , " he said .
" Simply building in dirty great air conditioning units is not the answer . "
Paul Williams , a climate scientist at the University of Reading , said : " Sceptics will no doubt question how scientists can confidently predict the climate of 2080 , when we cannot even forecast next week 's weather with any skill .
But climate prediction and weather forecasting are completely different problems .
We can say with confidence that July is always warmer than January , because more sunlight is received .
Similarly , we can say with confidence that the 2080s will be warmer than the 2000s , because of the extra heat trapped by greenhouse gases . "
The Department of Energy and Climate Change said the publication of the new climate predictions marked the first step towards a " five point plan " to tackle climate change .
Later this month , Ed Miliband , energy and climate secretary , will publish the government 's blueprint for a new global climate deal , which it hopes will be agreed at key UN talks in Copenhagen in December .
Next month , ministers will publish a new national strategy for climate and energy , to set out policies to meet the government 's domestic carbon reduction targets .
The climate predictions were welcomed by the University of Oxford 's Sir David King , the former chief scientific advisor .
" Now the question is whether or not the British public and their councillors , planners , civil servants and politicians have the appetite to provide sufficient funding to implement long - range schemes of adaptation across the regions covered by the report . "
Green campaigners called for stronger action on emissions to avoid the damaging impacts the UK will face .
Andy Atkins , Friends of the Earth executive director , said : " This valuable new research highlights the damaging impact that climate change will have around the UK .
The UK government must show real leadership by example ahead of crucial climate negotiations in Copenhagen . "
Chris Smith , chairman of the Environment Agency said : " These new projections remind us starkly of the choices we face in ensuring a sustainable future for our fragile planet .
A failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a battle for survival for mankind and many other species across the globe by the end of this century . "
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - India faces a greater threat from China than Pakistan because New Delhi knows little about Beijing ’s combat capabilities , India ’s air force chief told a newspaper in an interview published on Sunday .
Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major inspects a guard of honour during the Indian Air Force Day celebrations at the Hindon air force station on the outskirts of New Delhi in this October 8 , 2008 file photo .

The world ’s two most populous nations fought a brief but brutal war over their 3,500 km ( 2,200 mile ) Himalayan border in 1962 , and both sides claim the other is occupying big but largely uninhabited chunks of their territory .
India has also been pursuing closer relations with the United States , something that worries China .
China has a standing army almost three times the size of Pakistan ’s , according to official figures and defence industry estimates , but it is the lack of knowledge about China ’s military that concerned Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major .
“ We know very little about the actual capabilities of China , their combat edge or how professional their military is , ” Major told the Hindustan Times newspaper .
“ They are certainly a greater threat . ”
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947 and tensions between the nuclear - armed neighbours rose sharply after last November ’s Mumbai attack , which killed 166 people .
A slow - moving peace process was paused after the attack .
Islamabad has acknowledged that the attack was launched from and partly planned in Pakistan , but rejected New Delhi ’s accusations that the gunmen had support from official Pakistani agencies .
Although India and China have signed a treaty to maintain “ peace and tranquility ” along their disputed frontier and agreed to find a political solution to the row , talks have hardly made progress even as their business ties boom .
India blames the lack of progress on China ’s claim over Arunachal Pradesh , in particular over its Buddhist enclave of Tawang .
New Delhi says it cannot part with populated areas to settle the border dispute .
Major said the Indian air force was upgrading about five airbases , of which two would operate Russian Su -30 MKI fighters .
Go Ahead and Jump
An old saw among opponents of ever more powerful government is the tale of the boiling frog .
As the story goes , a frog can be placed in a pot of cool water and , if the heat is turned up slowly enough , find itself boiled alive without ever thinking to jump out .
Having never myself attempted the experiment , I ca n’t say with any confidence whether or not the tale is literally true .
As metaphor , however , it goes right to the heart of the nature of the state .
We , the frogs of 2009 , permit ourselves to be subjected to horrors at the hands of government which our forebears of 1976 would have rejected out of hand , which our ancestors of 1876 would have treated as revolutionary casus belli , and which the generation of 1776 would have simply found itself unable to envision .
Thirty years ago , we ’d have laughed at the suggestion that government - issued ID and entry in a government database might one day be required to purchase “ over - the - counter medicines ” like pseudoephedrine .
Only a little more than a hundred years ago , morphine was an “ over - the - counter ” medicine .
Two hundred years ago , the idea of requiring doctors to be licensed by the state was unheard of and would have been rejected as alien to basic American principles of government .
It ’s not the nature of the state which has changed over the centuries .
Rather , what has changed are the technologies available to the state ’s factotums for the purpose of turning up the heat beneath us frogs — and , apparently , our willingness to tolerate the slow but steady increase in temperature .
If you do n’t believe me , ask Pierre - Joseph Prodhoun :
To be governed is to be kept in sight , inspected , spied upon , directed , law - driven , numbered , enrolled , indoctrinated , preached at , controlled , estimated , valued , censured , commanded , by creatures who have neither the right , nor the wisdom , nor the virtue to do so … .
To be governed is to be at every operation , at every transaction , noted , registered , enrolled , taxed , stamped , measured , numbered , assessed , licensed , authorized , admonished , forbidden , reformed , corrected , punished .
It is , under the pretext of public utility , and in the name of the general interest , to be placed under contribution , trained , ransomed , exploited , monopolized , extorted , squeezed , mystified , robbed ; then , at the slightest resistance , the first word of complaint , to be repressed , fined , despised , harassed , tracked , abused , clubbed , disarmed , choked , imprisoned , judged , condemned , shot , deported , sacrificed , sold , betrayed ; and , to crown all , mocked , ridiculed , outraged , dishonored .
That is government ; that is its justice ; that is its morality .
Proudhon wrote that in 1851 , only a year after Allan Pinkerton formed the detective agency which would pioneer the science of state surveillance , at a time when the computer power the state uses for “ data - mining ” today was little more than a fanciful idea — the “ analytical engine ” — in the mind of Charles Babbage , and at a time when new forces , labor and capital , were at the beginning of their organized struggles to seize control of the state in their own interests as the old feudal interests drew their last crackling breaths .
Even so early in the arc of Leviathan ’s rise , Proudhon understood that those who rely on the state to secure and protect their interests wo n’t — ca n’t — tolerate any true limits on their power , either theoretically or in practice .
As the bodies pile up — millions , nay , hundreds of millions or even billions of frogs cooked on the state ’s battlefields , boiled in the state ’s prisons , fried by the state ’s regulations , poached by the state ’s taxes — most of our fellow frogs wallow insensate in an ever hotter hot tub , while some few vie incessantly through politics for access to the knob which controls the burner .
If past history is any indication of future trends , it seems likely that that knob turns in only one direction — “ up . ”
And if that ’s the case , politics can never save us .
Sooner or later , we ’re going to have to screw up the courage to jump .
BA asks staff to work for nothing
BA boss Willie Walsh wants all staff to take part in the cost - cutting scheme British Airways is asking thousands of staff to work for nothing , for up to one month , to help the airline survive .
The appeal , sent by e-mail to more than 30,000 workers in the UK , asks them to volunteer for between one week and one month 's unpaid leave , or unpaid work .
BA 's chief executive Willie Walsh has already agreed to work unpaid in July , forgoing his month 's salary of £ 61,000 .
Last month , BA posted a record annual loss of £ 401 m , partly due to higher fuel bills and other costs .
' Fight for survival ' BA has said that hundreds of staff have responded positively to the request .
But some employees and unions have condemned the plan , saying improvements in the management of the airline were a bigger priority .
Indeed cabin crew and baggage handlers contacted by the BBC rejected the plan out of hand .
" It 's a big no .
A very big no .
Everyone is up in arms .
We 're not taking it .
I 'd love to take a month 's unpaid leave but I can't afford to do that , " said one baggage handler at Heathrow .
But Mr Walsh said BA 's drive to save cash was part of a " fight for survival " .
" I am looking for every single part of the company to take part in some way in this cash - effective way of helping the company 's survival plan , " he said .
" It really counts , " he added .
BA has been in urgent talks during the past few weeks with trade unions at the company over other ways to save money .
Details of a large pay and productivity deal are expected to be announced on Wednesday .
Flexible scheme BA wo n't say how much it hopes to save by its latest initiative A company spokesman said it did not have an exact target for the expected savings from its appeal .
" As much as possible , but we do n't have a figure , " he said .
The idea was first launched last month when the airline asked staff to volunteer for a month 's unpaid leave , or to work for free for that time .
That attracted more than 1,000 applicants .
But the company 's more recent version of its scheme , launched last week by e-mail and in an article in the internal staff newspaper BA News , is more flexible .
It asks staff to volunteer by the end of this month for between one week and one month of unpaid leave or unpaid work .
The lost salary will be spread over between three and six months .
Unusual BA said other airlines , such as Cathay Pacific , had launched similar schemes and a majority of their workforces had signed up for them .
Many employers have imposed pay cuts or short - time working since the recession struck the UK last year .
" In certain cases such as Honda , they shut down for several weeks , " said Alistair Hatchett of the research organisation Incomes Data Services .
" Where it is obvious the economic circumstances are tough , people are willing to talk .
" Where employers try it on opportunistically , then there is a challenge , " he added .
" While some options may seem unattractive , particularly where they involve reduced income , many employees will conclude that the alternative of losing their job looks bleaker , " said Mike Emmott of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) .

Sara Jane Moore has finally said she 's sorry , said Shelby Grad in the Los Angeles Times .
After serving 32 years in prison for attempting to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975 , Moore appeared on the Today show Thursday and told Matt Lauer , “ I think that I was misled , that I was mistaken .
I think I made a serious error . ” ( watch Sara Jane Moore on the Today show )
But it was n’t until she spent “ time in solitary confinement , ” said Gerald DeMarco in the TodayShow.com , “ that the only woman ever to fire a shot at a president ” realized that she had been used by the San Francisco counterculture groups that she was involved with .
“ Now aged 80 , the matronly looking Moore hopes to write a book about her life . ”
Moore may have been in prison for three decades , said Katharine Q. Seelye in The New York Times , but she clearly understands that television “ has become the new confessional , the place to express your regret for the past and try to redeem yourself for the future . ”
And judging from her Today show appearance , “ the radical era she left behind seems to have dissipated in her mind . ”
Learn How to Juggle 3 Balls in Under 20 Minutes–
It ’s Easy
Learning to juggle is kind of like learning how to solve a rubik ’s cube , it looks difficult and complicated until you have someone who
already knows how to do it tell you how it ’s done ( rubik ’s cubes are generally solved by just executing the same memorized set of moves , an algorithm if you will , that ’s it–it does n’t really require much critical thinking , just memorized recall ) .
All you ’re
doing when you juggle is throwing ONE ball up in the air … 3 times … at once .
I know that sounds like a bad joke and I ’m messing with you , but it ’s really not that much harder than throwing just one ball up in the air and catching it using the same motion you ’d use with 3 balls , except with 3 balls you ’re going a bit faster–but it ’s the same motion !
What you ’ve really got to remember , and he emphasizes it in the instructional video I ’ve got below , is that you must keep your eye on the ball : keep looking up !
Do not look down , do not look at your hands , that ’s the number one mistake that amateurs make .
Do a nice smooth “ flat 8 ” with the balls up in the air , keep it tight , do n’t throw them too high , and you ’ll find you can do this in 20 minutes or so .

Sensitive information for shooting down intercontinental missiles as well as bank details and NHS records was found on old computers , researchers say .
Of 300 hard disks bought randomly at computer fairs and an online auction site , 34 % still held personal data .
Researchers from BT and the University of Glamorgan bought disks from the UK , America , Germany , France and Australia .
The information was enough to expose individuals and firms to fraud and identity theft , said the researchers .
Professor Andrew Blyth said : " It 's not rocket science - we used standard tools to analyse the data " .
The research involving the Welsh campus was led by BT 's Security Research Centre and included researchers at Edith Cowan University in Australia and Longwood University in the US .
In addition to finding bank account details and medical records , the work unearthed job descriptions and personal identity numbers as well as data about a proposed $ 50 bn currency exchange through Spain .
A majority of organisations and private individuals still have no idea about the potential volume and type of information that is stored on computer hard disks
Dr Andy Jones , BT Details of test launch procedures for the THAAD ( Terminal High Altitude Area Defence ) ground - to - air missile defence system were found on a disk bought on eBay .
The missile system , tested as recently as March 2009 following a controversial missile test by North Korea , is designed to destroy long - range intercontinental missiles launched by terrorists or countries the US considers to be " rogue states " .
The missile system was designed and built by US defence group Lockheed Martin and the same computer hard disk also revealed security policies and blueprints of facilities at the group , and personal information on employees .
The researchers said a disk from France included security logs from an embassy in Paris , while two disks from the UK appear to have originated from a Scottish health board .
Drives were bought in America , the UK , Germany , France and Australia
The disks had information from the Monklands and Hairmyres hospitals , part of Lanarkshire health board , and revealed patient medical records , images of x-rays , medical staff shifts and sensitive and confidential staff letters .
Another disk , from a US - based consultant , formerly with a US - based weapons manufacturer , revealed account numbers and details of proposals for the $ 50bn currency exchange as well as details of business dealings between organisations in the US , Venezuela , Tunisia and Nigeria .
Personal correspondence was also found from a member of a major European bank .
' Illegal ' Prof Blyth , an expert in computer forensics and principal lecturer at the University of Glamorgan 's faculty of advanced technology , said the results were in line with previous studies which showed 40 % - 50 % of second - hand disks that can be powered up contained sensitive data .
He said : " While it 's not getting worse , its not getting any better either .
" It 's not rocket science .
I could probably take somebody who is 14 or 15 years old and in a day have them doing this . "
Dr Andy Jones , head of information security research at BT , said : " It is clear that a majority of organisations and private individuals still have no idea about the potential volume and type of information that is stored on computer hard disks .
" Businesses also need to be aware that they could also be acting illegally by not disposing of this kind of data properly . "
In a statement , Lanarkshire health board said : " This study refers to hard disks which were disposed of in 2006 .
At that time NHS Lanarkshire had a contractual agreement with an external company for the disposal of computer equipment .
" In this instance the hard drives had been subjected to a basic level of data removal by the company and had then been disposed of inappropriately .
This was clearly in breach of contract and was wholly unacceptable . "
The board has carried out a review of its policies and now no longer uses external companies to dispose of IT equipment , the statement added .
A spokesman for Lockheed Martin said the company was not aware of any " compromise of data " related to the THAAD programme , and no government or law enforcement agency had notified it of any such loss .
The results of the study , the fourth in a five - year project , will be made available in a paper appearing in the next issue of the Journal of International Commercial Law and Technology ( JICLT ) 2009 .

TEHRAN —
They ’re calling it the “ green tsunami , ” a transformative wave unfurling down the broad avenues of the Iranian capital .
Call it what you will , but the city is agog at the campaign of Mir Hussein Moussavi , the reformist candidate seeking to unseat President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 10th post - revolution election .
Iran , its internal fissures exposed as never before , is teetering again on the brink of change .
For months now , I ’ve been urging another look at Iran , beyond dangerous demonization of it as a totalitarian state .
Seldom has the country looked less like one than in these giddy June days .
I wandered in a sea of green ribbons , hats , banners and bandannas to a rally at which Ahmadinejad was mocked as “ a midget ” and Moussavi ’s wife , Zahra Rahnavard , sporting a floral hijab that taunted grey - black officialdom , warned the president that : “ If there is vote rigging , Iran will rise up . ”
A Moussavi kite hovered ; a shout went up that “ It ’s even written in the sky . ” I do n’t know about that , but something is stirring again in the Islamic Republic , a nation attached to both words in its self - description .

As BA reports massive losses , is n’t it time to scrap the airport expansion programme ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian ’s website 22nd May 2009
So will Heathrow ’s third runway still be built ?
Like most airline operators , British Airways seems to be going down in flames , yet the government is still intending to double the UK ’s airport capacity between now and 2030 “ in response to rising demand ” .
Of course this could be just a temporary crisis .
But it has two interesting features .
The first is that the airlines have been hit much harder by the recession than most of the rest of the economy , even though the price of fuel has fallen dramatically over the past year .
The second is that the sector which has contracted most sharply is business travel .
Even before the recession began , almost all the business - only airline companies collapsed as a result of high fuel prices .
This is interesting because we were told by both the airline companies and the Confederation of British Industry that business flights were necessary and non-negotiable : civilisation would collapse if executives were n’t able to fly whenever and wherever they wished .
The government repeated this creed , insisting that the UK economy was dependent on the expansion of Heathrow .
Now we learn that these are the first expenses to be cut when a contraction begins .
Businesses are discovering that there are other means of engaging with people overseas , such as email , video - conferencing and an outlandish new device called the telephone .
In other words , the non-negotiables are suddenly negotiable .
Not because they were compromising human survival but because they were compromising corporate profits .
Business in the UK is not dependent on airport expansion .
With a little creativity and imagination ( think of the LongPen system , which allows you to sign documents on the other side of the world ) , it could probably get by just as well with a fraction of current runway space .
Is this just a temporary crisis for the airlines ?
Perhaps not .
The pressure to include their greenhouse gas emissions in national inventories is growing inexorably .
This issue has suddenly become more urgent , with the publication of a new study in the journal Atmospheric Environment .
It suggests that the greenhouse impact from aviation is about 4.9 % of all “ anthropogenic forcing ” – which means humankind ’s contribution to climate change .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s 2007 report proposed only 3 % .
You might be tempted to imagine that this is still small beer ; but it is massive by comparison to the size of the sector .
In the UK , the turnover of all air transport ( including freight ) in 2007 was £ 20 billion .
This is smaller than the machinery rental sector .
Aviation accounts for 0.78 % of total business turnover in the UK .
Yet it is responsible for 13 % of the country ’s total greenhouse gas emissions .
Any fair pricing of greenhouse gases would make flying prohibitively expensive .
So it looks like madness to be planning a third runway when the aviation sector could be entering a period of permanent contraction .
Even if you ignore the moral and humanitarian case for scrapping it , the economic case looks pretty brutal .

This is a video of the Dehavilland beaver plane crash at Lake Hood in Anchorage AK , on June 7 , 2009 .
Quote from the videographer ; My father and I were videotaping planes at Lake Hood taking off and landing when the wind kicked up and sent the Beaver taking off right at us .
The wing was less than 5 feet over our heads , and the radial engine was less than 8 feet to my left .
No exaggeration !!
The Slow motion at the end gives a little better look at how close it was .

Ed Freeman Ed Freeman
You ’re a 19 year old kid .
You ’re critically wounded , and dying in the jungle in the Ia Drang Valley , 11-14-1965 , LZ X-ray , Vietnam .
Your infantry unit is outnumbered 8 – 1 , and the enemy fire is so intense , from 100 or 200 yards away , that your own Infantry Commander has ordered the MediVac helicopters to stop coming in .
You ’re lying there , listening to the enemy machine guns , and you know you ’re not getting out .
Your family is half - way around the world , 12,000 miles away , and you ’ll never see them again .
As the world starts to fade in and out , you know this is the day .
Then , over the machine gun noise , you faintly hear that sound of a helicopter , and you look up to see an un-armed Huey , but it does n’t seem real , because no Medi - Vac markings are on it .
Ed Freeman is coming for you .
He ’s not Medi -Vac , so it ’s not his job , but he ’s flying his Huey down into the machine gun fire , after the Medi -Vacs were ordered not to come .
He ’s coming anyway .
And he drops it in , and sits there in the machine gun fire , as they load 2 or 3 of you on board .
Then he flies you up and out through the gunfire , to the Doctors and Nurses .
And , he kept coming back …. 13 more times …..
And took about 30 of you and your buddies out , who would never have gotten out .
Medal of Honor Recipient , Ed Freeman , died last Wednesday at the age of 80 , in Boise , ID … … May God rest his soul …..
I bet you did n’t hear about this hero ’s passing , but we sure were told a whole bunch about some Hip - Hop Coward beating the crap out of his “ girlfriend . ” Medal of Honor Winner Ed Freeman !
Shame on the American Media .
Origins : In March 2009 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution designating the U.S. Postal Service facility located at 103 West Main Street in McLain , Mississippi , as the ‘ Major Ed W. Freeman Post Office ’ .
McLain was the hometown of Ed Freeman , a veteran of World War II , the Korean War , and the Vietnam War who passed away in August 2008 :
“ It is extremely fitting that we should name a federal building after Major Ed Freeman , ” Congressman Mike Simpson said .
“ It is an honor to have known him , and all Americans should be honored that he served our country and defend her in the manner in which he did . ”
“ It is extremely fitting that we should name a federal building after Major Ed Freeman , ” Congressman Mike Simpson said .
“ It is an honor to have known him , and all Americans should be honored that he served our country and defend her in the manner in which he did . ”
The bill to designate the post office in Freeman ’s honor passed the U.S. House unanimously with a final vote of 384- 0 .
Freeman was a Mississippi native , and the Post Office that was renamed is located in his hometown .
At that time , the original version of the e-mail quoted above began circulating , a version that lamented the media attention given to “ some Hip - Hop coward beating the crap out of his ‘ girlfriend ' ” ( a reference to rapper Chris Brown ’s having been arrested in February 2009 on charges of battery against his girlfriend , Rihanna ) while Ed Freeman ’s death received much less coverage .
( These events were not simultaneous , as Ed Freeman had passed away in August 2008 , several months before Chris Brown ’s arrest . )
In July 2009 , shortly after the death of singer Michael Jackson , the piece was altered to reference him rather than Chris Brown , and to change the date of Ed Freeman ’s death to 25 June 2009 in order to create the mistaken impression that Freeman had passed away on the same day as Jackson and that his death was therefore ignored by
the media in the crush of Michael Jackson coverage .
( As noted in the previous paragraph , Ed Freeman actually passed away in August 2008 , nearly a year before the death of Michael Jackson . )
By March 2012 , this item bore the tag line : “ I bet you did n’t hear about this hero ’s passing , but we ’ve sure heard a whole bunch about Whitney Houston , Lindsay Lohan , Dr. Murray , that sicko Sandusky , and a 72 - day sham marriage . ”
( These were references to the death of singer Whitney Houston in February 2012 , actress ’ Lindsay Lohan ’s ongoing legal problems throughout 2008 - 2012 , the November 2011 conviction of Dr. Conrad Murray for involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson , the 2011 sex scandal involving former Pennsylvania State University football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky , and the ending of the marriage of reality TV star Kim Kardashian and basketball player Kris Humphries after just 72 days in October 2011 . )
By 2015 , this item was altered again to include the tag line : “ I bet you did n’t hear about this hero ’s passing , but we ’ve sure seen a whole bunch about the thugs Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin . ”
( These were references to the controversial fatal shootings , in separate incidents , of two unarmed black teenagers . )
In general , all of those sentiments have some merit to them ( if one ignores the fact that news of Ed Freeman ’s death could n’t have been obscured by events that took place several years after he passed away ) :
While the negative exploits of celebrities receive a good deal of attention in the popular news media , coverage of Ed Freeman ’s death was largely restricted to news outlets in Idaho ( where he resided at the time of his death ) .
Unfortunately , the passing of military heroes often does n’t prompt nationwide coverage unless some other factor had previously brought them to national public attention ( e.g. , they had prominent post - military careers , or they were featured in a popular book , film , or television series ) .
None of this should obscure the accomplishments of the very real Ed Freeman , who at a White House ceremony in July 2001 was presented with the Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush .
President Bush said of Freeman on that occasion :
By all rights , another president from Texas should have had the honor of conferring this medal .
It was in the second year of Lyndon Johnson ’s presidency that Army Captain Ed Freeman did something that the men of the 7th Cavalry have never forgotten .
Years passed , even decades , but the memory of what happened on November 14 , 1965 has always stayed with them .
By all rights , another president from Texas should have had the honor of conferring this medal .
It was in the second year of Lyndon Johnson ’s presidency that Army Captain Ed Freeman did something that the men of thehave never forgotten .
Years passed , even decades , but the memory of what happened on1965 has always stayed with them .
For his actions that day , Captain Freeman was awarded the distinguished Flying Cross , but the men who were there , including the commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Crandall , felt a still higher honor was called for .
Through the unremitting efforts of Lieutenant Colonel Crandall and many others and the persuasive weight from Senator John McCain , the story now comes to its rightful conclusion .
That story began with a battalion surrounded by the enemy in one of Vietnam ’s fiercest battles .
The survivors remember the desperate fear of almost certain death .
They remember gunfire that one witness described as the most intense he had ever seen , and they remember the sight of an unarmed helicopter coming to their aid .
The man with the controls flew through the gunfire not once , not 10 times , but at least 21 times .
That single helicopter brought the water , ammunition and supplies that saved many lives on the ground , and the same pilot flew more than 70 wounded soldiers to safety .
General Eisenhower once observed that when you hear a Medal of Honor citation , you practically assume that the man in question did n’t make it out alive .
In fact , about 1 in 6 never did , and the other five , men just like you all here , probably did n’t expect to .
Citations are also written in the most simple of language , needing no embellishment or techniques of rhetoric .
They record places and names and events that describe themselves .
The medal itself bears only one word and needs only one , valor .
As a boy of 13 , Ed Freeman saw thousands of men on maneuvers pass by his home in Mississippi .
He decided then and there that he would be a soldier .
A lifetime later the Congress has now decided that he ’s even more than a soldier because he did more than his duty .
He served his country and his comrades to the fullest , rising above and beyond anything the Army or the nation could have ever asked .
It ’s been some years now , since he left the service and was last saluted .
But from this day , wherever he goes , by military tradition , Ed Freeman will merit a salute from any enlisted personnel or officer of rank .
Commander Seevers , I ’ll now ask you to read this citation of the newest member of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society , and it ’ll be my honor to give him his first salute .
Ed Freeman ’s Medal of Honor citation reads as follows :
Captain Ed W. Freeman , United States Army , distinguished himself by numerous acts of conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary intrepidity on 14 November 1965 while serving with Company A , 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion , 1st Cavalry Division ( Airmobile ) .
As a flight leader and second in command of a 16 - helicopter lift unit , he supported a heavily engaged American infantry battalion at Landing Zone X - Ray in the Ia Drang Valley , Republic of Vietnam .
The unit was almost out of Captain Ed W. Freeman , United States Army , distinguished himself by numerous acts of conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary intrepidity on1965 while serving withHelicopter Battalion , 1st Cavalry Division ( Airmobile ) .
As a flight leader and second in command of alift unit , he supported a heavily engaged American infantry battalion at Landing Zonein the Valley , Republic of Vietnam .
The unit was almost out of ammunition after taking some of the heaviest casualties of the war , fighting off a relentless attack from a highly motivated , heavily armed enemy force .
When the infantry commander closed the helicopter landing zone due to intense direct enemy fire , Captain Freeman risked his own life by flying his unarmed helicopter through a gauntlet of enemy fire time after time , delivering critically needed ammunition , water and medical supplies to the besieged battalion .
His flights had a direct impact on the battle ’s outcome by providing the engaged units with timely supplies of ammunition critical to their survival , without which they would almost surely have gone down , with much greater loss of life .
After medical evacuation helicopters refused to fly into the area due to intense enemy fire , Captain Freeman flew 14 separate rescue missions , providing life - saving evacuation of an estimated 30 seriously wounded soldiers — some of whom would not have survived had he not acted .
All flights were made into a small emergency landing zone within 100 to 200 meters of the defensive perimeter where heavily committed units were perilously holding off the attacking elements .
Captain Freeman ’s selfless acts of great valor , extraordinary perseverance and intrepidity were far above and beyond the call of duty or mission and set a superb example of leadership and courage for all of his peers .
Captain Freeman ’s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself , his unit and the United States Army .

Biodiesel Blues : Car Manufacturers Say No to B100 in New Diesel Vehicles
A few years ago when we bought a new truck , we specifically purchased a diesel so we could use biodiesel in it .
We had no intention of making our own fuel , but we were able to buy B99 at a local gas station .
If you are new to biodiesel , the number refers to the percentage of biofuel in the mix .
B100 is pure biodiesel .
B20 is more common , as the percentage of biofuel is so low it does not congeal in cold weather .
A recent announcement from VW , Mercedes , Nissan , Renault , Jeep , Ford Power Stroke , Ford E-series vans , Dodge Rams , Cummins 6.7 and Chevy Duramax states B100 is no longer compatible with their engines .
I ’m not sure if this news is prompted by the companies not wishing to honor manufacturer ’s warranties on vehicles that run biodiesel or if they just realized the engines were not compatible .
According to Popular Mechanics :
Until two years ago , all diesel engines were B100 - compatible ( biodiesel cannot run in gasoline engines because it needs an engine that ignites by compression ) .
Then standards set by both the Environment Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board , phased in for 2007 , required all passenger vehicles to meet the same , stricter emissions .
That meant diesel manufacturers had to reduce emissions of NOX and particulate matter to meet those of gas - powered cars .
These standards were created with good intentions — to look out for our health by improving the air that we breath .
( After all , particulate matter is a known carcinogen . )
But the way most manufacturers did this created a setback for those of us trying to use biofuels .
Of particular concern is the design of diesel particulate filters ( DPF ) that were created to reduce emissions on diesel vehicles .
Popular Mechanics explains :
To get rid of particulate matter , the diesel manufacturers came up with what ’s called a DPF ( diesel particulate filter ) …
It captures particulate matter in its inner core .
Periodically , the DPF has to be taken up to high temperatures to burn off the matter it has collected …
Most of the manufactures decided to inject fuel into the cylinders just after the cylinder fires and the exhaust valve opens .
At this point , the fuel vaporizes and the vapors move down the exhaust to the DPF and clean it .
Because biodiesel is denser than conventional diesel fuel ( it has a longer hydrocarbon chain ) and has a higher distillation temperature and boiling point , it does not vaporize as easily .
Some of the fuel ends up adhering to the cylinder wall and runs past the rings , diluting engine oil .
Our truck is older than two years , so hopefully we are still able to run higher percentages of biodiesel .
For now , we will probably stick to B20 , as I am not sure it is worth the risk and I doubt the car dealer would recommend we continue running B99 .
Actually , the point is rather moot , as Texaco bought our local gas station that provided us with biodiesel and stopped selling B99 .

Dependent type systems
allow programmers to specify
and enforce rich data invariants .
Consequently , they
are important tools in global computing environments where
users must certify and check deep properties of
untrusted mobile programs .
Unfortunately , programmers who use these languages are
required to annotate their programs with
many typing specifications to help guide the type checker .
This paper shows how to make the
process of programming with dependent types more palatable
by defining a language in which programmers have
fine - grained control over the trade - off between the
number of dependent typing annotations they must place on programs
and the degree of compile - time safety .
More specifically ,
certain program fragments are marked dependent , in which case
the programmer annotates them in detail and a
dependent type checker verifies
them at compile time .
Other fragments are marked simple ,
where programmers can just put simply - typed code
without any dependent annotations .
To ensure safety , the compiler automatically
inserts coercions when control passes in between
dependent and simple fragments .
These coercions are dynamic checks that make
sure dependent constraints are not violated by
the simply - typed fragment at run time .
The language semantics are defined
via a type - directed translation from a surface
language that mixes dependently and simply typed
code into an internal language that is completely dependently - typed .
In the internal language all dynamic checks on dependent constraints
are explicit .
The translation always produces type - safe
internal language code and the internal language type system is sound .
The Sony rumor that just wo n't die has reared its potentially beautiful head again : a PSP phone may be in the works .
The latest back room rumblings come courtesy of Japan 's Nikkei Business Daily , which says Sony is about to open up a new department that will explore a " cell phone - game gear hybrid , " according to Reuters .
Sony 's secret department could begin work as early as July , and so far the PlayStation maker is declining to comment on the rumors .
The obvious target of Sony 's rumored plan is Apple 's iPhone .
Since the introduction of the iPhone 3G , gaming has been front and center in Apple 's iPhone - iTunes App Store ecosystem .
Seven of Apple 's top ten iPhone applications are games , and mainstream game publishers have for some time been incorporating the iPhone into their plans .
Even the iPhone jailbreaking community is getting into gaming by using the iPhone to emulate original PlayStation games .
Sony , meanwhile , is struggling to maintain relevance with its mobile gaming platform , the PlayStation Portable .
The company recently revamped the PSP and came up with a smaller , more compact device called the PSP GO .
The new device swaps out the UMD drive for a 16GB HDD , and also has a 3.8 - inch screen , Bluetooth as well as Wi-Fi connectivity , and a slide - out screen to reveal gaming controllers underneath .
The PSP Go hits store shelves October 1 .
Despite the improvements to the PSP , the new gaming machine is still limited when compared to the multifunctional iPhone .
For whatever reason , Sony is reluctant to place the PlayStation name on a mobile device made by its cell phone partner Sony Ericsson .
Tentative flirtations have begun with the Aino -- a device that can pull any content except games from the PlayStation 3 using Sony 's Remote Play feature -- but what Sony does n't seem to realize is that the PS3 is all about gaming .
So without gaming integration , the Aino is really just another mobile device with Wi -Fi .
Other Sony brands like Walkman and CyberShot have already crossed over to Sony Ericsson devices , but for some reason the PlayStation moniker has not .
What 's strange is that a PSP phone is a no- brainer , especially since the iPhone continues to take bigger chunks out of the mobile gaming market .
But then again , Sony is n't known for its capability to detect changes in consumer behavior .
Sony 's Walkman lost out to Apple 's iPod before the company ever knew what a click wheel was , Microsoft 's Xbox 360 is outshining the PlayStation 3 , and Nintendo is already beating out the PSP with its Nintendo DS lineup .
A PSP phone gives
Sony a shot to regain some lost ground ; however , anything short of a fully functioning PSP combined with an intuitive smartphone just wo n't do .
As Ray Kurzweil would say , " the singularity is near . "
Sony needs one device that can do it all , just like the iPhone can .
The stakes are high , but if Sony does get it right and comes out with a true PSP phone , well , that 's what you could legitimately call an iPhone killer .

Craving for sugar seems to be a much more serious problem than you thought .
If you believe that craving for cocaine in the case of addiction to this drug is terribly difficult to bear , you 'd better find out the result of a research team at the University of Bordeaux in France .
" [ W ] hen rats were allowed to choose mutually - exclusively between water sweetened with saccharin - an intense calorie - free sweetener - and intravenous cocaine - a highly addictive and harmful substance - the large majority of animals ( 94 % ) preferred the sweet taste of saccharin .
The preference for saccharin was not attributable to its unnatural ability to induce sweetness without calories because the same preference was also observed with sucrose , a natural sugar .
Finally , the preference for saccharin was not surmountable by increasing doses of cocaine and was observed despite either cocaine intoxication , sensitization or intake escalation - the latter being a hallmark of drug addiction . " , wrote the researchers .
" Our findings clearly demonstrate that intense sweetness can surpass cocaine reward , even in drug - sensitized and - addicted individuals . " they concluded .
Still , some researchers point out that these conclusions could not be applied directly to humans .
Humans are generally aware that something they 're ingesting could get them " hooked " and that the effects could harm them .
Rats , on the other hand , lack this awareness and are driven only by the sensations produced by a chemical .
Another issue : sugar , with all its potential cavity - inducing and obesity havoc , is still a nutrient , whereas cocaine 's benefits for the body are non existent .
Still , refined sugars ( like , sucrose , fructose ) did not enter in the human diet until very recently in our history .
The overconsumption of diets rich in refined sugars , combined with other factors , is the main cause that determines the current obesity epidemic .
Overconsumption of refined sugar rich foods or beverages is initially determined by the pleasure of feeling that sweet taste , and which acts like a drug addiction .
Some benches were placed on the edge of the square of the park .
When I came to the place , I found a mother and her little son were sitting on one of them together .
The mother wore a hat and the boy wore a cap .
And they were watching the people walking calmly .
They were silhouetted in the soft sunlight .
The time flew slowly .
Although I could n't see their faces , they could wear the gentle expression .
While at E3 , the PlayStation LifeStyle staff ran across a booth that took us by surprise .
The intricately detailed booth was full of skins , shells , etc. for all iterations of consoles and handhelds out on the market right now .
Usually I despise skins , but the quality of these really is unmatched .
They use a thick , sturdy material that you can actually feel ; it ’s not just some random stickers to place on your entertainment equipment .
The name of the company is GameTech , and they are based out of Japan .
In fact , this is the first time they have even tried bringing their product to overseas markets .
Also , the company creates skins for PS2 , Xbox 360 , Wii , and even the iPhone .

Geithner then mentioned reading an old newspaper interview with Michel Camdessus , the head of the International Monetary Fund in the 1990s .
Camdessus ’s tenure included the Asian financial crisis and Mexican peso crisis , and some European leaders were unhappy about the extent to which the I.M.F. followed the advice of American policy makers , Geithner among them , in managing these crises .
Geithner recalled that when the interviewer asked about this , Camdessus replied that America had influence disproportionate to its weight in the institution only when it had an idea others were willing to follow .
The Camdessus strategy — make sure you have an idea worth following — will be the Treasury Department ’s approach to China .
The strategy actually dates to the Bush administration and a series of meetings with Chinese leaders that Henry Paulson , Geithner ’s predecessor , helped set up .
If Obama ’s advisers admire one aspect of President Bush ’s economic policy — and coming up with another is n’t easy — it ’s the effort to nurture a relationship with China .
The meetings , which began in 2006 , were called the Strategic Economic Dialogue .
For the first sessions , Bernanke accompanied Paulson as a demonstration of respect to the Chinese and a sign of how seriously United States viewed the agenda .
American and Chinese officials are now negotiating the logistical details of the next round of the dialogue , which will be jointly led by Geithner and Clinton .
Internally , officials from State , Treasury and elsewhere in the administration have been jockeying for influence over China policy .
But they all seem to agree that one of the main goals of the dialogue is to bring a wide variety of important Chinese officials — including those who represent industries and regions that have benefited from the imbalances — into the same room for the talks .
During the initial 2006 meetings , in a speech at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing , Bernanke laid out the essential parts of the argument that the Americans are likely to make this year .
He began by ticking off what he called China ’s “ remarkable accomplishments ” : the quintupling of per capita economic output , the lifting of 200 million people out of poverty and the like .
But then , in the polite , technical manner of a central banker , he turned to its imbalances .
He argued that by overinvesting in heavy industry , China had failed to grow as quickly as it could have ( and to create more jobs for its people ) .
It was devoting significantly more of its output to such investments than Japan or South Korea had during their respective rises in the 20th century , yet China was growing no faster than they had .
That ran counter to economic theory and suggested , though Bernanke did n’t say so in these terms , that China was wasting resources .
Rather than spreading the bounty of its boom and allowing households and businesses to find productive uses for it , China was spending so much on heavy industry and its export sector that it was necessarily propping up weak businesses .
In 2006 , this argument might have sounded like nit-picking .
It does n’t today .
There have recently been some signs that China has become more serious about dealing with its imbalances .
For the first time since 2000 , its trade surplus shrank , relative to G.D.P. , last year .
Late last year , China also cut taxes on fuel - efficient vehicles , which led to a surge in sales that helped Chinese consumers surpass American consumers , at least for now , as the world ’s largest purchasers of vehicles .
China ’s economic planners also seem to have focused more in the last few years on highways and other infrastructure that would help households and sectors other than industrial ones .
David Loevinger , the Treasury Department ’s representative in Beijing , told me that when he visited the Great Wall recently , he drove on a highway that did n’t exist a year ago .
And China has announced a plan to provide health insurance to hundreds of millions more people over the next three years .
Jim O’Neill , the chief economist of Goldman Sachs , recently wrote that the health care expansion could prove to be “ the most important development in the world economy . ”
***
Geithner , along with other administration officials , insists that he is cautiously optimistic about the path China is on .
And that ’s understandable .
It ’s not especially pleasant to think about what the global economy will look like if China and the United States fail to fix their dysfunctional relationship .
The frequent flares of social unrest in China could spread , and the government could decide that its short - term problems take precedence over its long - term ones .
It might then try to stimulate its economy at the expense of everyone else — the beggar - thy - neighbor approach — by reversing the recent rise of the renminbi , lavishing new subsidies on exporters and restricting imports .
In an otherwise optimistic article in a recent issue of The Atlantic Monthly , James Fallows , an American writer living in China , pointed out that the United States followed a similar protectionist strategy during the Great Depression .
As a big exporter , it felt the need to help its struggling manufacturers .
Other countries soon retaliated , and the depression deepened .
For China , such a strategy would resemble a doubling down .
It would benefit the same parts of the economy — the industrial sectors , the coastal south , the wealthy — that have already done the best .
Living standards for the rest of China would continue to grow more slowly than the pace of economic growth suggests they should .
A Senate committee delivered a rebuff to Barack Obama 's clean energy agenda yesterday by voting to overturn a ban on oil and gas drilling off the Florida coast .
The 13 - 10 vote in the Senate 's energy and natural resources committee to lift the drilling ban off Florida 's coast runs counter to the push by the White House and Democrats in Congress to steer clean energy laws through Congress .
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives are pushing for a vote on the first US bill to cut carbon emissions by the end of this month .
Meanwhile , a Senate committee is close to approving a bill to encourage the use of renewable energy .
Tuesday 's drilling measure was brought as an amendment to that bill — already criticised by environmentalists by setting low targets for renewable energy development .
The vote would put oil and gas rigs within 10 miles of the Florida panhandle , and within 45 miles of Tampa .
Congress allowed a 25 - year ban on offshore drilling along much of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to lapse last year .
But the ban remained in force in Florida , restricting exploration to within 125 miles of the Florida coast , and 235 miles from Tampa .
Senators voted down a proposal to allow oil companies to tap into Alaska 's wildlife refuge .
Florida 's Democratic Senator , Bill Nelson , said he would block the measure .
" We are simply not going to let this happen , " he told reporters .
The measure is likely to remain in the final version of the bill .
The entire energy package will clear the committee as early as Thursday .
But although the amendment gained the support of eight Democrats on the committee – including the chairman Jeff Bingaman – it faces serious opposition elsewhere in the Senate and in the House that could stop it becoming law .

The sheer number of queries concerned Google
The internet suffered a number of slowdowns as people the world over rushed to verify accounts of Michael Jackson 's death .
Search giant Google confirmed to the BBC that when the news first broke it feared it was under attack .
Millions of people who searched for the star 's name on Google News were greeted with an error page .
It warned users " your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application " .
" It 's true that between approximately 2.40 PM Pacific and 3.15 PM Pacific , some Google News users experienced difficulty accessing search results for queries related to Michael Jackson and saw the error page , " said Google spokesman Gabriel Stricker .
It was around this time that the singer was officially pronounced dead .
Google 's trends page showed that searches for Michael Jackson had reached such a volume that in its so called " hotness " gauge the topic was rated " volcanic " .
The BBC news website reported that traffic to the site at the time of Jackson 's death was 72 % higher than normal .
Fail Google was not the only company overwhelmed by the public 's clamour for information .
The microblogging service Twitter crashed with the sheer volume of people using the service .
Searches for topics related to Michael Jackson peaked at 3 PM Pacific Queries about the star soon rocketed to the top of its updates and searches .
But the amount of traffic meant it suffered one of its well - known outages .
Before the company 's servers crashed , TweetVolume noted that " Michael Jackson " appeared in more than 66,500 Twitter updates .
According to initial data from Trendrr , a Web service that tracks activity on social media sites , the number of Twitter posts Thursday afternoon containing " Michael Jackson " totaled more than 100,000 per hour .
That put news of Jackson 's death at least on par with the Iran protests , as Twitter posts about Iran topped 100,000 per hour on June 16 and eventually climbed to 220,000 per hour .
Early reports of Mr Jackson 's death and the confusion surrounding it caused a rash of changes and corrections to be made on his Wikipedia page as editors tried to keep up with events and the number of people trying to update the page .
TMZ , the popular celebrity gossip site that broke the story following a tip - off that a paramedic had visited the singers home also crashed .
There was a domino effect as users then fled to other sites .
Hollywood gossip writer Perez Hilton 's site was among those to flame out .
Keynote Systems reported that its monitoring showed performance problems for the web sites of AOL , CBS , CNN , MSNBC and Yahoo .
Beginning at 2.30 PM
Pacific " the average speed for downloading news sites doubled from less than four seconds to almost nine seconds , " said Shawn White , Keynote 's director of external operations .
He told Data Center Knowledge that " during the same period , the average availability of sites on the index dropped from almost 100 % to 86 % " .

Sanford Sex Scandal Grows : Did Governor Use Tax Money to Finance Affair ?
Governor 's office says Sanford paid for last week 's trip himself .
June 25 , 2009  --
Facing questions over whether he used taxpayer funds to pay for trips to Argentina to see the woman with whom he admitted having an extramarital affair , South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Thursday that he would repay the state for a 2008 business trip to Buenos Aires .
The dates of that taxpayer - funded trip matched dates on steamy e-mails released Wednesday between the governor and the woman , named Maria , with whom he had an affair .
It appears that the two were sexually intimate during the visit .
Sanford said at a press conference Wednesday that it was around that time his friendship with the woman " sparked into something more " than a friendship .
" While the purpose of this trip was an entirely professional and appropriate business development trip , I made a mistake while I was there in meeting with the woman who I was unfaithful to my wife with , " Sanford said in a statement released this afternoon .
" That has raised some very legitimate concerns and questions , and as such I am going to reimburse the state for the full cost of the Argentina leg of this trip . "
According to the South Carolina Department of Commerce , Sanford 's airline tickets cost $ 8,687 , and included flights to different cities in Brazil and Argentina .
The only taxpayer funds used for any of the Argentina portion of the trip were for Sanford and Commerce Project Manager Ford Graham , the department said .
The governor 's office said he paid for last week 's trip -- his most recent visit to Argentina -- from his own pocket , and that " he plans to stay on as governor , and is going to focus on building back the trust of South Carolinians , " adding that the governor " is spending time with his family " today .
Republican Response
The Republicans ' response toward their colleague has been mixed .
In a letter expressing his support , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , said , " I hope Mark will reconcile with his family and can continue serving as our state 's governor . "
But former presidential hopeful and ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said Sanford should spare himself and his family public scrutiny by stepping down , " not because of his personal behavior , but for putting his personal behavior above the responsibility for being available to govern and lead in the event of a crisis . "
Sen. Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , the Palmetto State 's second representative in the U.S. Senate , would only say through his office that he was " disappointed . "
After a meeting of Republican leaders back at Sanford 's state capital , state Sen .
Jake Knotts called for the governor 's resignation , and a criminal investigation into his travels .
" He should strongly consider resigning for the good of the taxpayers of South Carolina , and the good of this state , " said Knotts .
Former South Carolina GOP Chairman Katon Dawson said state Republican officials will want to make sure everything is out in the open .
" I would say that our elected Republican officials are going to want as much disinfectant on this process as they can get , " said Dawson .
J. Todd Rutherford , a Democrat in the South Carolina House of Representatives , said the governor should resign .
" He lied , he continued to lie .
He neglected his duty , and that 's why I am asking for his resignation , " Rutherford told ABCNews.com .
Sanford told his staff he was on a hiking trip in the Appalachian Mountains and did not make anyone -- including the lieutenant governor , who would be in charge during his absence -- aware that he had left the country .
Taxpayer Money ?
During a press conference Wednesday , Sanford said that his eight - year friendship with the mystery woman transformed into a romance about a year ago and that he had seen her three times since the " whole sparking thing . "
Though Sanford 's multiple trips to Buenos Aires have some crying foul , South Carolina Democrats do n't foresee an investigation .
" He is surrounded by ... a total Republican administration , " Rutherford said .
" Republicans seem , at this point , to be coalescing behind him . "
The South Carolina state Legislature does not convene until January .
It can be called into a special session before then , but Rutherford said that is unlikely to happen .
A Senate staffer told ABCNews.com there has been no discussion of an investigation or impeachment in the state Senate .
In the legislature 's absence , the attorney general can call for an investigation .
The attorney general 's office did not return calls to ABC News seeking comment .
ABC News ' chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos noted today on " Good Morning America " that Republican politicians have generally fared better than their Democratic counterparts after sex scandals .
While Sanford and Sen. John Ensign , R - Nev. , who admitted an affair earlier this month , show no signs of resigning their posts , former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer left his job after winning a landslide election when he got caught in a prostitution scandal .
And former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey also resigned after he admitted to an affair with a male staff member .
Rutherford said that if a Democrat were involved in such a scandal in Republican - heavy South Carolina , the situation would be very different .
" These are the same people who jumped on Bill Clinton , and now they 're saying , ' let 's talk about forgiveness , let 's talk about family , ' " he said .
Stephanopoulos said Sanford 's admission was unprecedented , in part , because of how candid he was about his infidelity .
" We 've never seen anything like this ... the raw emotion , the amount of information the governor gave out was simply incredible , " Stephanopoulos said .
Friends Shocked by Sanford 's Confessions
Sanford 's former chief of staff said he was just as blindsided by his friend 's announcement as the public .
" What I saw yesterday ... is a man who realized he sinned , " Tom Davis told " GMA " today , but he added that Sanford " should not resign . "
Sanford invoked Davis ' name several times while admitting to the affair during Wednesday 's press conference , emphasizing how he " let down the Tom Davises of the world . "
Davis , a close family friend who lived in the family 's basement for six months during Sanford 's first race for governor in 2002 , said that Sanford did let him down .
" I think I represent to him people that have believed in him , people that have believed in the powers of his ideas , " Davis said .
Davis said he spoke with Sanford for about an hour - and - a - half before the press conference .
Up until that point , Davis said he had no idea that the governor 's trip would blow up into such a wide - reaching scandal .
Davis said that while he has not spoken to the governor 's wife , Jenny Sanford , he believes his friend understands " the very real hurt he knows he caused people . "
Mark Sanford 's Trip to Buenos Aires
Sanford coyly sang the praises of his mistress 's body and agonized over their " hopelessly impossible situation of love " in e-mails to the woman that emerged Wednesday , hours after he held a press conference to announce the affair .
The State , which broke the news about Sanford 's trip to Buenos Aires after speaking to him at the Atlanta airport upon his arrival this morning , obtained private e-mail exchanges between the governor and Maria .
When contacted by ABC News , Sanford 's office did not dispute the authenticity of the e-mails .
In an e-mail dated July 10 , 2008 , Sanford writes that the two are in a " hopelessly impossible situation of love , " and that he feels " a little vulnerable because this is ground I have never certainly never covered before . "
" You have a particular grace and calm that I adore .
You have a level of sophistication that so fitting with your beauty .
I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent gentle kisses , or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curve of your hips , the erotic beauty of you holding yourself ( or two magnificent parts of yourself ) in the faded glow of the night 's light -- but hey , that would be going into sexual details , " Sanford writes .
" In the meantime please sleep soundly knowing that despite the best efforts of my head my heart cries out for you , your voice , your body , the touch of your lips , the touch of your finger tips and an even deeper connection to your soul , " the e-mail reads .
Maria , described as the mother of two sons , wrote in an e-mail June 9 , 2008 , " You are my love .
...
Something hard to believe even for myself as it's also a kind of impossible love , not only because of distance but situation .
Sometimes you do n't choose things , they just happen .
... I can't redirect my feelings and I am very happy with mine towards you . "
The affair , Sanford said , began " casually , " but over the " last year developed into something much more . "
" We developed a remarkable friendship over those eight years and then ... about a year ago it sparked into something more than that , " Sanford said .
" I have seen her three times since then , during that whole sparking thing .
...
And it was discovered ... five months ago .
And at that point , we went into serious overdrive in trying to say , ' Where do you go from here ? ' "
Jenny Sanford Asked Governor to Move Out
Sanford said in the press conference that his wife of nearly 20 years was aware of his affair before he left for Argentina , and that the family had been trying to work through the situation for " about the last five months . "
He also resigned from his position as chairman of the Republican Governors Association , saying he would need time to seek forgiveness from friends and family and to focus on what he called a " very long process . "
In a written statement , his wife , Jenny Sanford , said , " I deeply regret the recent actions of my husband Mark , and their potential damage to our children . "
She said she asked her husband to leave two weeks ago and to not contact her or their four sons , which explains why the family was unaware of the governor 's whereabouts during his unexpected disappearance .
" When I found out about my husband 's infidelity , I worked immediately to first seek reconciliation through forgiveness , and then to work diligently to repair our marriage , " she said in a release .
" We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity , self - respect , and my basic sense of right and wrong . "
But South Carolina 's first lady hinted that she was willing to forgive her husband and that " this trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage . "
Invoking the Bible , she said , " I remain willing to forgive Mark completely for his indiscretions and to welcome him back , in time , if he continues to work toward reconciliation with a true spirit of humility and repentance . "
The couple started their careers on Wall Street , where Jenny Sanford was a vice president in mergers and acquisitions at the investment bank Lazard Freres , the Associated Press reports .
The couple met in the Hamptons , Long Island , married and headed to South Carolina .
This is the second such scandal to rock the GOP this month .
Earlier this month , Sen. John Ensign , R - Nev. , admitted to an affair with a campaign staffer and resigned as leader of the Republican Policy Committee .
Almost immediately after Sanford 's resignation as chairman of RGA , the organization announced that Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour will take over as chairman .
South Carolina residents expressed mixed views .
" Here you are cheating .
That does n't stand right with me at all as a woman , " Zippora Gregory told ABC News .
" It 's happened in politics before and I 'm sure it 's never going to end , " said Camillo Miller .
Sanford Leading Opponent of Obama 's Stimulus Plan
Sanford recently emerged as an outspoken opponent to President Obama 's $ 787 billion stimulus plan , becoming the only governor to reject the federal stimulus money .
Instead of using the stimulus money to fund projects , Sanford argued that the money instead be used to pay down South Carolina 's deficit , an argument rejected by the federal government .
He also lost in court when South Carolina 's Supreme Court ruled that the governor had to accept the money .
Additionally , the Republican - dominated South Carolina Legislature last week overturned all 10 of Sanford 's vetoes on the stimulus .
Sanford was widely seen as eyeing the White House in 2012 .
In an interview with ABC News two weeks ago , the governor said , " It 's not my focus , it 's not my aim , it 's not my intent , " but added " you never say never . "
Those ambitions , some say , may be dashed for now .
Issue # 96 • November / December , 2005
When almond butter replaced peanut butter in my diet ( on doctor ’s orders ) , I discovered I really liked the almond better .
And it opened my eyes to the world of “ other ” nut butters .
I also discovered they were quite expensive .
I was lucky if I found a 10 ounce jar of almond butter for less than $ 4.00 , a luxury compared to even the 100 % natural peanut butter .
So I did some experimenting and came up with my own recipe for almond butter that satisfied me .
The same process can be used for other nuts .
To make almond butter , I use a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan to dry roast the nuts since I prefer them roasted .
I also use my food processor .
I have used a blender , but it took longer , required more scraping the nuts off the sides , and I had to add more oil to get a decent butter .
A rubber spatula and a jar to store the butter in complete the required equipment .
Ingredients are simply a couple cups of the desired nuts and a little bit of olive oil .
I buy larger bags of raw almonds , throw them in the freezer , and take them out as I need them .
I prefer to start with raw nuts and do my own roasting .
That way , I get freshly roasted nuts with nothing added .
If I need to add oil , I prefer to use extra virgin olive oil .
Almonds ready for roasting
The actual process of making the butter is not difficult .
I put two cups of nuts on the baking sheet and pop them into a preheated oven to roast at 350 degrees , leave them there for several minutes , then remove the pan and stir .
I return the pan to the oven and roast for a few minutes more , watching the color of the nuts , striving for a toasted , but not burnt , look .
How long before the nuts burn ?
That depends upon the oven and the pan .
My Air - bake pan requires a longer time than a thin baking sheet .
The thin sheet can take 8 minutes or less .
Just watch the nuts the first time to get an idea how long they need to bake in your oven with your pan .
Once you make a batch of burnt almond butter , you will be motivated to watch the time .
After toasting the nuts , I allow them to cool before dumping them into the processor .
Since my food processor has just one speed , I flip the switch and watch the nuts bang wildly and loudly against the sides of the container .
Gradually they get chopped up finer and finer .
If particles build up on the sides of the container , stop and scrape them down with a rubber spatula .
Continue processing until it begins to ball up .
You may have to break up the ball , but it is most important to be patient .
Sometimes the ball will bang around for a while before it begins to break down and look creamy .
It takes several minutes .
It is during this time when it is balled up that I add some oil .
I will add a teaspoon of oil and run the processor some more .
If the butter is creamy enough without it , I omit the oil .
I have never added more than 3 teaspoons of oil to the 2 cups of nuts .
It is important to be patient and give the processor a chance to make the butter .
Toward the end , more oil can be added if you like it creamier .
If chunky style is desired , just roast a few extra nuts , chop , and stir into the finished butter .
While it is possible to make peanut butter in this same manner , I do n’t bother , because I can buy excellent peanut butter at a reasonable price .
There are so many other possibilities for nut butters .
Below are some notes about different ones that I have tried .
Almond butter
Since almonds are more reasonably priced and easier to digest , I make this type of butter more frequently than any of the others .
Raw almond butter can be found in the health food stores and some people prefer the raw kind .
You simply process the nuts without roasting .
Two cups of raw almonds , processed with a minimum of oil , will fill a 10 ounce jar .
If you are roasting them , throw a few extra nuts on the baking sheet for a warm snack when you take the pan out of the oven .
They are quite tasty .
A jar of fresh almond butter
Cashew butter
Cashews are more expensive ( where I shop ) , so I buy the least expensive raw white pieces and roast them .
They brown much faster than almonds ( hardly seven minutes on the Air - bake pan ) , so be vigilant or they burn and taste terrible .
Cashews are softer than almonds and grind up quicker too .
While cashew butter can be made without oil , it is fairly dry , so add some oil for a creamy smooth butter .
This butter tastes more like peanut butter than any of the others I ’ve made , but yet slightly different .
Raw pecan butter
Raw pecan butter is the easiest to make .
No roasting .
Pecans are soft so they process quickly and make a very smooth butter .
Hazelnut butter
Hazelnut butter is available at health food stores , so I tried to make some .
Unfortunately , I roasted them a tad too much and the butter had a twangy taste .
Since hazelnuts are quite expensive , I have n’t tried it again .
Since I add no preservatives , these nut butters can become rancid .
I always store mine in the refrigerator and try to use them up within a month or so .
Each of the nut butters tastes a bit different , so each can be used differently .
I like the almond butter on a sandwich with apple butter or jam .
Some are best on a cracker of one kind or another .
I eat whole grain rye crackers , which always taste better with some kind of nut butter .
Any of these improve the taste of a rice cake , too .
One of my cookbooks uses these odd nut butters quite a lot ; they seem to work well in cookies and quick breads .
If you like experimenting , check a health food store for their variety of nut butters , buy the appropriate nuts , roast ( or not ) , and make the butter yourself .
It is n’t hard .
Crossing the road in the wrong place make cost you shoes , because road is … sticky .
" Leeches " -- that 's how Dave Rosenberg , co-founder and former CEO of MuleSource , and now part of the founding team of RiverMuse , refers to companies that use open source technology but do n't give back to the open source community .
Companies like Cisco's Linksys subsidiary , whose routers rely on Linux .
Companies like Amazon.com , whose Elastic Cloud Computing ( EC2 ) service depends on Eclipse Foundation 's open source offerings .
Your ear does n't have to be pressed to the ground for long to hear angry grumblings in the open source community about leeches , vampires , or freeloaders .
[ Is the commercialization of open source eliminating the customer 's advantage from access to the source code ?
InfoWorld 's Open Sources blogger Savio Rodrigues explores the issue . ]
" The future of Eclipse is in danger , " Michael Scharf , a member of the Eclipse Foundation 's architecture council , said in an angry April blog post .
" The problem is that there is no real pressure for companies to contribute back to the community and it is easy to use the Eclipse ' for free ' for their own products .
The Eclipse community should create peer pressure to prevent the freeloaders and parasites from getting away without punishment , " he wrote .
Scharf likens the lack of contributions back to the community to the " tragedy of the commons , " in which greedy individuals unthinkingly destroy a shared resource .
And in an e-mail exchange , he put it this way : " The general mentality of the industry frustrates me ; the attitude to take advantage of something like open source and not give back anything to the system . "
Scharf 's comments were not well received .
Not only is Eclipse doing just fine , say his critics , but the whole notion of leeches and freeloaders is a relic of open source 's Wild West era , when coding was a higher calling and free software a religion .
" You might call them parasites ; I call them users and adopters , " says Mike Milinkovich , executive director of the Eclipse Foundation .
" The fact that we have millions of users is what makes Eclipse commercially interesting . "
Indeed , when major enterprises use Eclipse , with or without contributing code back to the community , they create a market for Eclipse plug-ins and services , says Milinkovich .
Even critics acknowledge the major exceptions to enterprises ' freeloading ways .
For example , Rosenberg notes that Bank of America , H&R Block , and J.P. Morgan not only pay for what they use , but contribute code back to various projects .
The polarized open source " community "
It 's not surprising that the discussion has become so polarized .
There 's long been a tension within the open source community between those who have seen it as a movement and those who believe it is a business .
To be sure , the gulf between those poles is n't nearly as wide as it once was .
The increasing adoption of open source by mainstream enterprises has changed the terms of the debate and bolstered the community .
" Community " ?
For some , that 's a fighting word .
" Much is made of the importance of community in open source , specifically , and in software , generally .
But ' community ' is perhaps the most overhyped word in software , one that does n't deliver nearly as much value as marketing people would like you to think , " Matt Asay , vice president of business development at Alfresco , said in a post earlier this year .
Asay points approvingly to a 2006 article by John Mark Walker , a self - described " community dude , " who wrote a post ( and now an ongoing blog with the same title ) called " There is no open source community . "
Walker argued that the notion that open source software is controlled by a core group of " ideological believers " pushes away commercial customers " who are afraid of running afoul of the ' open source community . ' "
And Navica CEO
Bernard Golden expresses some impatience with those who complain about freeloading .
" If a license says anyone can use it , that 's what they have to live with .
Presumably they made an informed choice [ to use a particular license ] . "
Like it or not , open source companies are embracing parts of the commercial model , offering paid , enterprise versions of their software .
And that can lead to nasty disputes like the old beef between SugarCRM and vTiger , or the more current matchup involving Bascula Systems and Zmanda .
Hardware makers :
The new open source scofflaws
With open source adoption on the rise in the enterprise , the community ( if there is such a thing ) is struggling to adapt to a different set of rules .
" When it comes to open source communities , individuals are much better citizens than institutions .
The enlightened self - interest that causes individuals to send back bug fixes , contribute ideas for new features , and write documentation is much harder to find in institutions , " Dan Woods , CTO of Evolved Media , wrote in Forbes earlier this year .
True enough .
There are companies that pay little attention to the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) commonly used by open source applications -- though others are embracing it -- and its requirement that open source code be attributed and enhancements to it made public .
[ A federal court decision protecting open source code is good for developers , but it could open the floodgates of litigation . ]
Why that happens is n't simply a matter of corporate villainy .
" Of the small minority of companies that do n't comply [ with the GPL ] , it 's generally a case of laziness or ignorance , rather than a malicious attempt to get around the license , " says Brad Kuhn , technology director of the Software Freedom Law Center .
Although Kuhn says he prefers education to litigation , the SFLC has waged several important lawsuits defending the GPL .
Increasingly they involve embedded software in routers and other relatively inexpensive devices .
Given the complexities of global commerce , it 's not hard to see why the hardware business lends itself to open source abuse .
In 2007 , the SFLC filed a lawsuit against Verizon on behalf of open source software developer BusyBox .
The complaint alleged that Verizon infringed on BusyBox 's copyrights by distributing Actiontec wireless routers to Verizon 's broadband customers without properly making the BusyBox code available .
Further complicating the case was the origin of the code used by Actiontec : an unnamed Asian OEM that embedded it in the router 's integrated circuits .
Similarly , Cisco purchased parts from a vendor in China containing embedded code that should have been shared under the GPL -- but was n't , says SFLC attorney Aaron Williamson .
And that led to a suit filed late last year .
It 's quite possible that the Asian vendors had never even heard of the GPL , much less thought about complying with it , he says .
Still , the ultimate seller bears responsibility for the actions of its suppliers , and when education and persuasion fail , Williamson and his colleagues are prepared to sue for clients who step forward .
He figures that similar issues involving firmware are likely to arise .
The Verizon case concluded with a favorable settlement for the developers last year , and Williamson says the Cisco lawsuit is close to a similar outcome .
The provision of the GPL that tripped up Verizon and Cisco is known as " copy left , " which requires that users make changes public to code covered by the license .
But you wo n't find that provision in Apache 's licenses .
" We feel there are enough enticements without holding a gun to someone 's head , " says Apache Software Foundation president Justin Erenkrantz .
The Apache license , he says , " is hard to violate because it basically says you can do whatever you want as long as you do n't use our name . "
IBM , for example , can't claim its HTTP server is Apache , but it can note it is " powered or based " on Apache .
Why many enterprises are open source vampires
Given the forgiving terms of the license , it 's not surprising that Apache does n't have many problems with violations , but Erenkrantz goes further , praising Sun Microsystems , Hewlett - Packard , Yahoo , and even Google -- often labeled a freeloader -- for making significant contributions .
He 's not alone in letting Google off the hook .
Matt Asay puts it this way : " A year ago I was a vocal critic of Google , but they 've come around . "
Asay , though , does n't give everyone a pass .
" Enterprise IT is the biggest consumer of open source software , and it gives almost nothing back to the community , " he said in an interview .
Particularly galling to him is the fact that the worst offenders generally are n't technology companies that might reasonably worry about giving away a competitive advantage , but mainstream enterprises that do n't have such an excuse .
Why not comply ?
" I spoke at a CTO breakfast and asked that question , " Asay recalls .
" Some said it was hard to get approval from their company legal team , which worried about liability issues .
Others simply did n't see the benefit . "
No benefit ?
Open source projects -- and there are more than 100,000 on SourceForge alone -- may or may not use a license that " requires " a user to contribute back , but those who do n't contribute back lose a key advantage of the model : collective support for new code .
Companies that go it alone have to spend time and development money making fixes to " forks " that could be handled by others -- a powerful incentive to play by the rules .

Message From Shawna Forde , Executive Director , MAD
I would like to let everyone know that we are in full operation we have people coming from Florida and other parts of the country to assist in gathering exclusive footage of drug cartel drug smuggling and humane [ sic ] trafficking .
Our point is to let the world know that we as American citizens have a choice and a responsibility to those who have stained the ground red for our freedoms .
Even if the government refuses to consider the border a issue we as minutemen will not stand by while American jobs are lost and America becomes the future of corruption and a playground for those who trespass .
We will expose and report what we know and find , we will recruit the serious and train the revolutionist , time for words have passed the time for bravery and conviction are now .
I shall lead you to challenge yourself and your American heart into the future of what was once a great country and will be again but at what price ?
The patriot is a brave yet scarce man hated and scorned by most .
but when the cause succeeds the timid shall join for then there is no price to being a patriot .
Who ’s your BFF ever ?
President Obama !
How do you know ?
Because he said so himself !
Asked about whether GLBTs “ who wish to marry ” should consider the White House an ally , Barack Obama ( who ’s whooping it up celebrating gay pride ! ) insists : “ I think gays and lesbians have a friend in the White House because I ’ve consistently committed myself to civil unions , making sure that they have to visit each other in hospitals , that they are able to access benefits , that they have a whole host of legal rights that they currently do not have .
I do n’t think it makes sense for the federal government to get in the business of determining what marriage is .
That is n’t traditionally the federal government ’s role . ”
Indeed , President Obama believes friends let friends have separate but equal rights .
You probably want to go grab a beer with him now , right ?
It would give him another excuse to hold out on doing anything substantial on repealing the Defense of Marriage Act .
And he ’s right about that whole “ federal government ” thing .
You see , traditionally presidents are too cowardly to push for equal rights , and instead let the Supreme Court do it .
So when it comes to this “ friendship ” Obama thinks he has with America ’s gay community ?
It ’s of the sort where you run into a guy at a party , promise to get together for lunch next week , and never see each other except on Facebook .
( CNN ) -- Robin Beaton found out last June she had an aggressive form of breast cancer and needed surgery -- immediately .
Robin Beaton , 59 , found out just days before her mastectomy that her insurance provider would not cover the procedure .
Her insurance carrier precertified her for a double mastectomy and hospital stay .
But three days before the operation , the insurance company called and told her they had red - flagged her chart and she would not be able to have her surgery .
The reason ?
In May 2008 , Beaton had visited a dermatologist for acne .
A word written on her chart was interpreted to mean precancerous , so the insurance company decided to launch an investigation into her medical history .
Beaton 's dermatologist begged her insurance provider to go ahead with the surgery .
" He said , ' This is a misunderstanding .
This is not precancerous .
All she has is acne . ' ...
He said , 'Please do n't hold up her cancer surgery for this , ' " Beaton , 59 , said as she testified at a House subcommittee hearing on the terminations of individual health policies by insurance companies .
Still , the insurance carrier decided to rescind her coverage .
The company said it had reviewed her medical records and found out that she had misinformed them about some of her medical history .
Beaton had listed her weight incorrectly .
She also did n't disclose medication she had taken for a pre-existing heart condition -- medicine she was n't taking when she originally applied for coverage .
" I did n't know what to do .
The hospital wanted a $ 30,000 deposit .
I was by myself .
I did n't have that kind of money , " Beaton said through tears .
" Can you imagine , having to walk around with cancer growing in your body ?
With no insurance .
It 's the most terrifying thing in the world to not have anybody to turn to or anywhere to go . "
Beaton , who worked as a registered nurse for three decades , charged that the insurance company " searched high and low " to pull out anything on her so that they would not have to pay for her surgery .
Beaton turned to Texas Rep. Joe Barton for help .
Barton said his staff went to work , but the insurance company , he said , was " unyielding . "
Barton appealed to the company 's president , who promised to investigate personally .
The president called Barton back within four hours and said the coverage would be reinstated .
Beaton underwent surgery in October , but by then her tumor had grown from two to three centimeters to seven .
She had to have all the lymph nodes removed in her arm .
Beaton is one of more than 16 million Americans who have individual health insurance policies .
She and two others testified Tuesday about their experiences with insurance rescission .
The witnesses charged that insurance applications are purposely long and confusing , and that companies look for any discrepancy to avoid covering expensive treatments .
The hearing , which was a result of a yearlong congressional investigation in the individual insurance market , examined " post - claims underwriting , " a process by which insurance carriers cancel an individual 's policy after providers submit claims for medical services they received .
" Overall , what we found is that the market for individual health insurance in the United States is fundamentally flawed , " said Rep. Henry Waxman , the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce .
One of the witnesses , Wittney Horton , said her coverage was canceled after her carrier said she did not disclose that she had taken a drug prescribed for weight loss and because of her irregular menstrual cycle .
Her carrier sent her a letter saying they would not have accepted her had they known she had " polycystic ovaries , " a condition she did not know she had .
Peggy Raddatz testified on behalf of her brother , who was diagnosed with stage four non-Hodgkin 's type lymphoma .
In the midst of his chemotherapy treatment , his coverage was rescinded and he was not able to receive the stem cell transplant needed to save his life .
Raddatz 's brother was told his coverage was canceled for failing to disclose that , unknown to him , a doctor had once noted in his file that a CT scan showed a small aneurysm and some insignificant gallstones .
Peggy Raddatz worked with the Illinois attorney general 's office and eventually was able , after two appeals , to get her brother 's coverage reinstated .
Insurance companies argue rescissions are relatively rare , but Waxman said the practice saved the companies $ 300 million over the past five years .
Waxman said he and the insurers agree the solution to the rescission problem is to pass comprehensive health reform legislation .
The CEOs of Assurant Health , UnitedHealth Groups ' Golden Rule Insurance Co. and WellPoint 's Consumer Business also testified at the hearing .
Don Hamm , the CEO of Assurant Health , said his company regrets the " necessity of even a single rescission . "
He said the company has a fair rescission investigation process :
When the company becomes aware of a pre-existing condition that was not disclosed on a person 's application , a senior underwriter reviews the information to determine if the omission was " material " to the underwriting decision .
A manager verifies the analysis .
If the omission was not material , the review is complete , but if it was , the application goes to a review panel , which includes a physician .
The panel evaluates the information and makes a decision .
The amount of the claim is not revealed to the panel , Hamm said .
There also are multiple opportunities for a person to appeal -- including by means of an independent review panel , he said .
Richard Collins , the CEO of Golden Rule , noted that rescission " has long been recognized by the laws of virtually every state . "
" Rescission is uncommon , but unfortunate , and a necessary recourse in the event of material , and at times intentional or fraudulent , misstatement or omission on an insurance application , " he said .
Less than one - half of 1 percent of individual insurance policies were terminated or rescinded , he said .
Brian Sassi , president and CEO of Consumer Business , said WellPoint is proposing a set of rescission regulations with new consumer protections .
" In addition , the health insurance industry has proposed a set of comprehensive and interrelated reforms to the individual health insurance market as a whole .
The centerpiece of this proposal is the elimination of medical underwriting , combined with an effective and enforceable personal coverage requirement , " he said .
Members of the subcommittee grilled the CEOs on their rescission policies -- including the fact that some companies will not take on clients who have had insurance rescinded in the past -- but the companies maintained that rescission is not about cost .
Asked if they would commit to never rescinding a policy unless it was intentionally fraudulent , all of the CEOs said no , noting that a commitment like that does not coincide with the state laws and regulations they follow .
" Does n't it bother you that people are going to die because you insist on reviewing a policy that somebody took out in good faith and forgot to tell you that they were being treated for acne ? "
Barton asked the panel of CEOs .
" Yes sir , it does , and we regret the necessity that that has to occur even a single time , and we 've made suggestions that would reform the system such that that would no longer be needed , " Hamm replied .
CNN 's Kristi Keck contributed to this report .
All About Health Care Policy
I 'm stopped at a red light when a decrepit old Chevrolet pickup with its windows rolled down pulls into the adjacent lane .
Its radio is bleating Rush Limbaugh , and the rear bumper bears a sticker that reads , " My wife , yes .
My dog , maybe .
My gun , NEVER ! "
The driver looks disheveled and haggard , making it very easy to surmise that here 's the perfect example of an American totally screwed over by capitalism run greedily amok , decisively abetted by conservative ideology .
He 's probably unemployed , has no medical insurance , no pension prospects , and is likely facing having sheriff 's deputies put his family 's belongings out on the sidewalk , following a heartbreaking eviction .
But he 's got that radio tuned to right - wing propaganda , and he's so completely brainwashed that he thinks his greatest worry is gays getting married !
He 's undoubtedly convinced that the " Democrat Socialist Party " is ruining his life -- not to mention his beloved country -- and that liberals are the reason his wallet has thinned to nothing but pictures of his gaunt spouse and sickly , skinny kids .
Meanwhile , Limbaugh and other well - compensated voices of radio or television reaction , live in luxury , exceeded in ill - gotten wealth only by the corporate Fat Cats who hire them to keep
the masses from angrily identifying their true enemy .
That allows the Silk Suits to laugh all the way to the bank , and then lean back with Mint Juleps in their poolside gazebos , while poor bastards like my guy in that truck fart out the remains of their
last unhealthy meal .
Or maybe a little cheap beer .
But here 's the real kicker :
A father from our area , pretty much like that Chevy dude , sent his son off to war a couple years back .
" There are n't any jobs here , anyway .
Plus , you 'll learn a useful trade . "
He did so with teary - eyed pride , emphatically believing both this nation 's foreign policy myths and George Bush 's lies .
It was beyond his awareness to comprehend that the U.S. aggressing a sovereign country for fraudulent reasons , in blatant violation of international law , made us no different than Nazis attacking Poland in 1939 , or the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor .
Despite letters from his boy that contained strange passages that a more critical soul would have seen as indicators of things on the battlefield being much different than what Republicans gloriously portrayed , Dad never let his patriotism waver .
Publicized photos of Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse did n't faze him , because right - wing media " explained " it all to his manipulated satisfaction .
Then , one tragic day , his precious child got blown to bloody shards by a rocket - propelled grenade .
Shortly thereafter , what was left of him came home in a box , and was lowered beneath cemetery sod as a bugler played taps .
The greatest tragedy , however , is that Dad will probably go to his own grave , decades from now , still convinced that his " Hometown Hero " served a noble cause , never mind those many thousands of foreign innocents who were themselves violently killed because the Americans needlessly , wrongfully invaded .
Or maybe , at some clarifying moment in otherwise foggy old age , he 'll have an epiphany , understanding that his entire life was spent fleshing out a massive Fox News falsehood .
That medal from the President , presented posthumously , will suddenly lose it 's luster .
It 'll perhaps get hurled against the wall , leading nursing home residents to wonder what that bang and the accompanying , agonized scream were all about .
That 's what it sadly boils down to for rank - and - file conservatives .
They 'll either die entirely unreconstructed and unenlightened , clinging to absurdity until the very end .
Or they 'll eventually see the light , as the armor of their fallacies finally turns to fully - powdered rust .
There 's nothing worse than realizing -- too late -- that one 's entire existence was spent living , breathing , sweating , and bleeding to advance somebody else 's abysmally selfish , decidedly wicked agenda .

Did a lightbulb finally go on over Harry Reid 's head ?
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he 'll ditch bipartisanship in the Senate if it means getting a health care reform bill .
" As important as bipartisanship is – and it is very important – it ’s not as important as helping the millions of Americans that have no health insurance . "
Reid stressed that Democrats have invited Republicans to the negotiating table , and he said that Democrats still wanted to achieve a bipartisan bill .
But Reid also stressed that the costs of not addressing health care this year were simply too high and that Democrats were ready to move a bill without Republican support .
" The cost of inaction is really unacceptable , " Reid told reporters .
" I repeat : ' Nothing ' is not an option .
We must pass health care reform and do it this year . "
Dr. Sicinska used a quarter of a million dollars of Ludwig money for this project , buying mice without immune systems , which meant they could not reject human tumors , and housing them in a germ - free basement lab .
She spent months learning to implant tumors in the mice and enlisted geneticists to study the implanted tumors , making sure they did not mutate beyond recognition .
She spends her days in the lab , using a miniature ultrasound machine to scan the mice , hairless creatures with prominent ears .
Four types of sarcomas  cancers of fat , muscle or bone  are growing in them and look genetically identical to the tumors removed from patients .
Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni , former director of the National Institutes of Health , said he was not sure that a grant for the project would have been turned down .
The N.I.H. , he said , does finance research on mouse models for human cancer .
But Dr. Demetri said he did not apply “ because we have lots of experience in what ’s fundable . ”
His mouse work , he said , is exploratory , and he cannot predict what he will find or when .
He certainly could not lay out a road map of what he would do and promise results in a few years .
Studies With a Different Goal
Researchers like Dr. Appelhans , who is studying weight control and tasty foods , do not expect to change the outlook for cancer patients anytime soon .
But , they say , that does not mean their work is unimportant .
Dr. Appelhans will study 85 overweight or obese women , measuring how much the tastes and textures of food drive their eating .
Then they will be given a weight loss diet and nutritional counseling .
Dr. Appelhans will ask whether those who are most tempted by the tastes and textures also have the most trouble following the diet .
As for the grant to assess a Web - based program to improve food choices , it is predicated on studies indicating that what people eat in childhood and adolescence may have an impact on cancer risk in middle and old age , said the grant recipient , Karen Weber Cullen , associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine .
Some studies have found that people who reported having eaten fruits and vegetables when they were younger and maintaining a healthy weight were less likely to have cancer .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Unemployment rates in 109 metropolitan areas reached 10 % or higher in March , almost eight times more than a year earlier , according to a government report released Wednesday .
Just 14 cities reported jobless rates of at least 10 % last year , the Labor Department said .
The March 2009 report said unemployment rates in all of the nation 's 372 metropolitan areas rose in March compared with the same month in the prior year .
Jobless rates of at least 15 % were reported in March in 18 areas , compared with only one - El Centro , Calif . - the previous year .
The number of metropolitan regions that had unemployment rates under 7 % dropped significantly to 95 from 329 in March 2008 .
A total of 33 metro areas registered unemployment rates that were at least 6 percentage points higher than a year ago , and another 42 areas ' increases were 5 to 5.9 percentage points .
The Labor Department does not adjust the rates in its metropolitan unemployment report for seasonal changes in employment .
El Centro continued to have the highest metropolitan unemployment rate at 25.1 % .
The town is near the Mexican border and relies on agricultural employment , according to economists .
The area 's unemployment rate tends to rise and fall depending on the farming season .
Houma - Bayou Cane - Thibodaux , La. , and Iowa City , Iowa , reported the lowest rates in the country at 3.6 % .
Elkhart - Goshen , Ind. , reported the largest unemployment rate increase year - over - year , at 13 percentage points .
TRADITIONAL IRISH cuisine has been dealt a blow with the demise of the company that invented that staple of chippers nationwide , the spice burger .
Walsh Family Foods closed its doors earlier this month with the loss of 50 jobs and a receiver is to be appointed to the business next week .
The company , based in the Poppintree industrial estate in Finglas , could no longer sustain heavy losses caused by the weakness of sterling against the euro and tough competition from UK rivals .
One of its main customers , Tesco , recently cut the number of products it bought from the company from 16 to one , but internal sources said this was not a significant factor in Walsh ’s closure .
Spice burgers have been on the Irish market since the early 1950s and were the first product manufactured by Walsh Family Foods .
Pork butcher Maurice Walsh developed the product , described on its website as “ a delicious blend of Irish beef , onions , cereals , herbs and spices coated with traditional outer crumb , ” at the rear of his shop in Glasnevin .
From these humble beginnings , the firm expanded into burgers , garlic mushrooms and another favourite of chip - shop habituees , the onion ring .
Maurice Walsh ’s son and daughter , Paddy and Helen , joined him in the business as it grew and started to export to the UK and beyond .
The company patented its recipe for spice burgers , but the product ’s popularity never really expanded beyond Ireland .
It remained the only producer , so future supplies may depend on the ability of a receiver to find new interests to take over the business .
In 2000 , the Walsh family sold most of its shareholding in the company to a management buy - in team and ICC Venture Capital .
The team , led by Pat McCaughey , former managing director of Boyne Valley Group , purchased a controlling interest for less than € 1.27 million .
Annual turnover rose to € 14 million , of which € 4 million was in exports to Britain .
However , the company lost heavily on a big contract in the UK where the price was set before sterling weakened .
Mr McCaughey could not be contacted yesterday and there was no answer from the company ’s telephones .
However , a message on its lines on Tuesday stated that a receiver would be appointed on June 22nd .
The firm closed after an appeal to Enterprise Ireland for emergency funding was rejected .
“ They did n’t want to know , ” said an internal company source .
“ It ’s a sad tale . ”
Having failed miserably in previous attempts to stamp out illicit filesharing , the record industry has now joined forces with other entertainment lobby groups to demand that the government takes action to protect their business model .
Speaking at a joint meeting of the Federation of Entertainment Unions , UK Film Council and Bafta on the future of the creative industries last week , the chairman of the British Phonographic Industry called on the government to take seriously the argument that , in the face of illicit file - sharing , a " write and sue " policy will not be effective , to introduce legislation requiring ISPs to act against persistent unauthorised downloaders and to recognise that the music industry has already transformed its business models online .
Not for the first time , we at the Featured Artist Coalition are forced to question whether the record industry is representing the best interests of artists in calling for such measures .
Stating that a " write and sue " policy will not work is an admission that the current copyright law is no longer fit for purpose in a digital age .
The government has pointed out to the BPI that if it wants to crack down on unauthorised file - sharing , the law is already on its side .
Fearful of the prospect of dragging their customers though the courts , with all the attendant costs and bad publicity , members of the record industry have come up with a simple , cost - free solution to their problem : get the ISPs to do their dirty work for them .
They are asking the government to force the ISPs to cut off the broadband connection of customers who persistently download unauthorised material , without any recourse to appeal in the courts .
Never mind that this is a shameful attempt to pass responsibility on to another sector of industry , the question remains whether or not such measures will have the desired effect .
Technology has so far stayed ahead of enforcement .
Any unauthorised filesharers who fear being caught out can simply encrypt their exchanges .
Even if this proposal should become law , as recording artists we question the wisdom of pursuing and penalising our potential audience .
The people who are doing the most damage to our industry are not the music fans swapping files for no commercial gain – it's the sites that are making money without paying for content that are really ripping us off .
The Pirate Bay had to be closed down , but what about the fans who use such sites to find music they cannot get legally or DRM - free elsewhere ?
The Featured Artist Coalition is opposed to copyright infringement , but we recognise that , if technology allows people to access music for free , they will take advantage .
The next generation of music fans may no longer want to pay for music , but they are still hungry to hear it .
The challenge to the industry is to find ways to monetise their behaviour .
The question is , are the major labels too wedded to their old business model to be capable of leading the next generation ?
It is all very well to claim that they have already transformed their business models online .
Evidence suggests otherwise .
Earlier this year , British cable ISP Virgin Media was set to launch a peer - to - peer filesharing service , paid for by subscription .
Research had shown that over 80 % of the users of Pirate Bay were willing to pay for a similar service .
At the 11th hour , the two biggest labels in the UK , Universal and Sony , sank the project by demanding stringent " anti-piracy " controls .
Clearly , some form of P2P subscription service is the way forward , if only because it provides the most convenient way for consumers to access music .
Yet for the major labels , the success of such an initiative would mean the end of their control over the distribution of music .
Is this the real reason why they seem determined to do everything they can to clip the wings of the fledgling digital industry before it can fly ?

Tragedy Strikes Justin Timberlake 's Tennessee Golf Course
bought the Big Creek Golf Course in his hometown of Millington , Tennessee in November and immediately hired a crew to begin a major renovation project .
Tragedy stuck when a construction worker , clearing trees to make way for a new road on the property , was killed in a freak accident at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday morning .
Shelby County Fire Department used heavy cutters and other prying equipment to cut through the heavy steel cab and remove the victim from the track hoe that he was operating when it toppled on its side , crushing him .
Spokesperson Brent Perkins reported that one tree became dislodged , fell over and crushed the cab of one of the track hoes that was down working on the project .
" We think at this point that the ground was unstable .
It was very wet and very muddy at the bottom of the tree and it just gave way . "
Timberlake purchased the secluded 18 hole course a few months back and hired an outside company to do some excavation work , as part of a major project .
The victim worked for a private contractor and was not an employee of the golf course .
An investigation is underway .

It ’s easier than you might think to determine whether to fix or nix your creaky refrigerator or temperamental stove , and doing the simple research could save you big , says Angie ’s List Founder Angie Hicks .
“ Large appliances are a long - term investment but many consumers do n’t get their full money ’s worth , ” says Hicks , whose company collects consumer reviews in more than 425 service categories , including appliance repair .
New appliances could cost thousands .
The average service call ranges from $ 60 to $ 100 .
The call charge does n’t include parts and labor , but many service pros will forgive the initial fee if they get the repair job .
With proper maintenance and use , consumers should expect 10 to15 years of good life out of refrigerators , freezers , dishwashers , washers , dryers and central air conditioning units .
Ovens , ranges and water heaters should hold up for 10 to 20 years .
10 questions to determine whether to fix or nix a major appliance :
1 . Is it really broken ?
Check the troubleshooting section of the unit ’s manual for guidance and also check plugs , cords , circuit breakers and surge - protectors .
2 . Is the first time the unit has had a problem or does it have a long , bad history ?
3 . How old is the appliance ?
4 . How much will it cost to repair the unit ?
5 . Are there additional costs to remove , install , dispose of your existing unit ?
6 . What would a new appliance cost ?
7 . Are there renovation costs attached to a new unit or can it slide right into place ?
8 . What new , useful features will a new appliance offer ?
9 . Will energy savings make it more affordable to nix vs. fix ?
10 .
Will tax credits on your purchase make it more affordable to nix vs. fix ?

Joe Delaney : 1958 -1983
Kansas City Chiefs running back Joe Delaney died 26 years ago .
A second round pick by the Chiefs in 1981 , Delaney played only two seasons in Kansas City before his life came to a tragic end .
Three boys were swimming in a pond in Monroe , LA at about two in the afternoon .
As they waded out farther away from the shore , they would soon find that the bottom dropped off .
Screaming and thrashing in the water , only one man in a crowd of people stepped forward .
Joe Delaney .
" Can you swim ? " a little boy asked Joe .
" I can't swim good but I 've got to save those kids .
If I do n't come up , get somebody . "
Unfortunate for the rest of the world and the Kansas City Chiefs , those were the last words of Joe Delaney as he died while trying to save the kids .
One of the boys was able to find his way to the shore .
The two others and Delaney did not .
This article by Frank Deford of Sports Illustrated from November 7th , 1983 , is a must - read on Joe .
On this day , we tip our hats to a man we proudly call a member of the Kansas City Chiefs family .
Delaney 's inspiring act reminds us of the common bond that connects all human beings , which is perhaps his greatest legacy .
More on Joe :
1981 AFC Rookie of the Year
Rushed for 1,121 yards in his rookie season
1982 Pro Bowl selection
All - American selection in 1979 and 1980
Elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997
His name is on the Ring of Honor at Arrowhead Stadium
For those of you wondering why Joe 's # 37 is n't one of the Chiefs ' officially retired numbers , it 's because Lamar Hunt set the standard of retiring a Chiefs player number only when they have been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
RIP , Joe .

I really hate to fan the flames here , but Dollhouse just is n’t doing anything for me .
I feel torn between my need to support and trust Joss Whedon and my other need to be entertained by the TV shows I watch .
I do n’t want to get into specifics ( no relatable characters , Eliza ’s acting chops , etc etc ) and I ’m not ready to cast final judgment because all of the problems I see in Dollhouse have the stink of FOX all over them .
And from what I ’ve read , they ’ve given up on screwing with the show and stopped interfering .
That means one of two things :
They are through with the show , so they do n’t care what happens to it between now and when the 13 episode commitment runs out they realize their decisions to put on Friday Night O’ Death , second guess Joss and air the episodes out of order are the real problems and their meddling is n’t improving the show or its ratings
In a recent interview , Eliza addressed the slow start and asked that we hold out until episode six .
At that point , Whedon ’s vision will become clear and we ’ll all get the shiny feelings that we ’ve been lacking so far .
Honestly , I ’ll be watching no matter what until it gets canceled .
I feel like I owe Whedon that much .
If this is the last hurrah for Joss in the medium of television I wo n’t be too heartbroken .
The next frontier of entertainment is high quality shows , shorts and movies produced for the internet ( paging Dr. H.? ) and I know he will be one of the pioneers if not the leader in that field .
If you are Whedon Zombie and currently watching Dollhouse , you are probably feeling the same confusion / frustration that I am .
The pilot was weak and boring , the 2nd ep. was fun and quite entertaining but the 3rd went right back to blah and made me care LESS about everyone on the show .
Are you going to stick it out or are you too worried about falling in love only to be heartbroken by cancellation again ?
Care to add your own Whedon Scripture ?
COMMENT AWAY !
The equity firms counter that banking desperately needs cash if the economy is going to recover , and that they are the only big sources of money around .
An executive at the Carlyle Group said the industry had an estimated $ 400 billion in “ dry powder , ” or ready - to - invest reserves .
To push their case at the White House , the Treasury and the Fed , Mr. Flowers and others in his industry have enlisted an all - star cast of advisers , lobbyists and lawyers .
They include H. Rodgin Cohen , chairman of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm and Wall Street éminence grise , and Randal K. Quarles , a managing director of the Carlyle Group and a Treasury under secretary in the administration of President George W. Bush .
Part of their strategy , Mr. Flowers said , is to persuade the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , to pressure the Fed to back down .
“ Chris is obviously a get - it - done type of person  and he wants to get this done , ” said Mr. Cohen , who represents Mr. Flowers .
“ He believes , as I do , that it is unfortunate to deprive the banking system in the United States of this key source of capital . ”
While they press their case , the firms have found some ways around the rules .
They have formed so - called club deals , in which teams of private equity firms and other investors each buy up to the legal limit of a bank  about a quarter or a third , depending on the type of bank  with their individual pieces adding up to 100 percent control .
IndyMac , the failed California bank , was sold by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last fall to one such club , which includes funds controlled by Mr. Flowers ; the hedge fund billionaires George Soros and John Paulson ; and Michael S. Dell , founder of the Dell computer company .
The investors are barred from acting in concert to , in effect , take control of the bank  an unwieldy arrangement but one that regulators insist they can enforce .
As part of the IndyMac deal , the F.D.I.C. agreed to take most of the risk from future losses on loans acquired by the partnership  leading Mr. Flowers to quip at one investor forum in New York in January that “ the government has all the downside and we have all the upside . ”
Mr. Flowers has come up with another way around the restrictions .
There is no limit on an individual ’s taking over a bank , so he purchased all of the First National Bank of Cainesville in his own name and with his own funds .
But that deprives him of the billions his equity firm has set aside to buy banks , so his new bank sits in this tiny town , waiting for a change in the rules .
First National  whose second story is boarded up and whose $ 17 million in assets are worth about a third of what Mr. Flowers paid for an Upper East Side town house in 2006  seems an unlikely launching pad for a new American banking empire .
Scientists have surveyed the lobster population in the Gulf and concluded that adult lobsters continue to have lots of sex and make lots of babies .
The lobster catch has been going up over the past 20 years because there are more fishermen and more traps than there used to be , but also because there are more lobsters , which is good news .
In fact , the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery has been an unusual success story .
But here 's the problem -- and this is the key to understanding what 's happening now .
Way before our current recession began , lobstermen were doing such a good job conserving their resource that beginning in the 1990s , they were already catching more lobsters than the market could sustain .
There 's never been enough demand for all those live lobsters .
They 've always had to go somewhere else .
Remember how I said stocks of codfish in Canada had collapsed 20 years ago ?
Those cod used to be packaged and frozen by Canadian processing plants .
After the cod collapse , the same Canadian plants started packaging and freezing the extra lobsters being caught in New England .
They took up the slack .
By an unfortunate twist of fate , those plants had their financing tied up in the Icelandic banking system , and when it collapsed last fall , the capacity of the processing plants did , too .
Ever since then , the market has been flooded with excess live lobster .
Lobsters that used to get turned into frozen claws and tails for mid-level chains like Red Lobster are now filling the fresh lobster tanks to overflowing .
Thus the crash in price .
The fact that luxury dining has declined does n't help , but it 's not the cause .
The problem is simply that New England 's lobsters have finally come home to roost .
Now lobstermen are trying to hawk their extra lobsters on the street , and retailers are furious , because it 's undercutting prices even more .
The retailers have reason to be upset .
While the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery has been a success story in terms of conservation , the industry has been less savvy about marketing its product .
Lobstermen might be better off now if they'd been more disciplined in the past , by catching fewer lobsters and making sure that they protected the status of their premium live - lobster brand .
They'd be in trouble now , too , but they'd have fewer lobsters on hand to worry about unloading at rock - bottom prices .
What lobstermen in the Gulf of Maine should be doing is coordinating with each other to cut back their catch , fish fewer traps , and market the heck out of their lobsters as a highly - desirable item of sustainable seafood .
To the industry 's credit , it has already sought marketing assistance from the Marine Stewardship Council , which certifies sustainable seafood .
There 's a real and increasing demand for sustainable seafood among environmentally conscious eaters , even during a recession .
If New England lobstermen behave less like Down East cowboys and more like a clever cooperative , they could make their industry as well as their fishery sustainable again .
But with lobster now dirt - cheap , it 's going to take some work to claw their way back up the food chain .
When people think about investment , considers all aspect of investment property always best investment rather than any investment , you can utilize your property in many ways for example if not getting perfect selling prices , we can give our property on rentals and earn interest of our investment but what about when huge and costly property or you bought huge home with 4 or 5 bed rooms but no one able to pay for such huge home so here all these things you have to think when making buying decision now a days condos become most wise choice of investment , it also helpful to earn handsome money according to trend , waterfront condos or beach condos beneficial short term or long term investment , because people love to stay at such cool place in not only vacation time but also take rest in hectic work schedule .
Condos give pleasant time spending at any time or any season .
There is another aspect to condos that have helped them to become one of the best investments going .
That fact is the popularity of condos and the huge call and rush for them .
It appears that all across the country that condos are going up faster than they can be sold .
Most new developments are sold out long before they are completed .
The skyline of most major cities has changed drastically over the past few years with new high - rise complexes going up in every vacant space .
Not only are these condos changing the way we live in an urban setting , but they are conveying much more to the bargaining table then ever before .
Condos have really developed into a whole new lifestyle alternative for home buyers .
With spas , fitness clubs , meeting rooms and many other property condos have congeal their place as one of the best housing deals available ever .
One more fastidious selling point of condos is the fact that they have a lower entry cost than most single family homes .
Homes are costing more and more as the price of living increases .
Many condos start around the $ 100 K mark and it is possible to find conversions for even lower prices condos .
Conversions are becoming one of the most sought - after investments by investors who having the knowledge .
These condos offer great value and an attractive affordable condo price .
They may not have all of the valuable extras that the new complexes can offer but in terms of a great place to live they fit the bill quite nicely .
If you are looking for a grand beneficial investment or just a great home , be sure to ensure what the local condos market has to offers you !!
After my Rolling Stone piece about Goldman , Sachs hit the newsstands last week ( unfortunately the piece is not yet up on the magazine ’s web site , so I ca n’t link to it yet — but it is out in print ) , I started to get a lot of mail .
Most of it was thoughtful and respectful criticism , although there was an amusingly large number of people writing in impassioned defense of their right , under our American system , to be ripped off by large impersonal financial companies .
“ If my pension fund is buying [ crap mortgages ] from Goldman , and my pension fund loses lots of value , that ’s not Goldman ’s fault , ” wrote one reader .
“ No one is forcing anyone to buy anything .
The only thing Goldman is guilty of is making profits . ”
I ’m not even going to go there — the psychology of a human being who would take the time to actually write in a complaint like that is so bizarre that it would take more time than I have today to even begin discussing it .
One other complaint that I will address quickly , though , is the notion that I did n’t tell Goldman ’s side of the story .
“ Not exactly a balanced approach , ” complained one reader .
“ You should take an ethics class .
You have to give the other side a fair shot . ”
Actually I did contact Goldman and gave the bank every opportunity to respond to the factual issues in the article .
I ’m bringing this up because their decision not to comment on any of those questions was actually pretty interesting .
We figured ahead of time that Goldman was probably not going to respond to many of the allegations in the article , since its MO in the past with regard to hostile journalists has usually either been to make bald denials or to simply avoid comment ( that ’s when they ’re not using the carpet - bomb litigation technique , as in the case of GoldmanSachs666.com ) .
So what I decided to do the first time I approached them was to send a short list of simple factual questions .
If the bank decided to engage us and educate us as to its point of view on these simple questions , we would send more queries and expand the dialogue .
Given this , I tried to make that first list of questions as basic as possible .
I asked if Goldman would have turned a profit in Q1 2009 if it had n’t orphaned the month of December 2008 .
Then I asked if Goldman had made changes to its underwriting standards during the internet boom years ; if Goldman ’s position was still that the steep rise in oil prices last year was due to normal changes in supply and demand ; and if it could explain its 1991 request to the CFTC to have its subsidiary J. Aron classified as a physical hedger on the commodities market .
Citing various sources , I also noted that some people had complained that its move to short the mortgage market in 2006 even as it was selling those same types of instruments proved that the bank knew the weakness of its mortgage products , and asked if the bank had an answer for that .
And I asked if the bank supported cap - and - trade legislation , and if it was fair to say ( as we planned to in the piece ) that the bank would capitalize financially if such legislation was passed .
I intentionally put a lot of yes / no questions on that list .
If the underlying thinking behind any of those questions was faulty , it would have been easy enough for them to say so and to educate us as to the truth .
Instead , here is the response that we got :
“ Your questions are couched in such a way that presupposes the conclusions and suggests the people you spoke with have an agenda or do not fully understand the issues . ”
You have to have swallowed half a lifetime of carefully - worded p.r. statements to see the message written between the lines here .
That this is a non-denial denial is obvious , but what ’s more notable here is that they did n’t stop with just a flat “ no comment , ” which they easily could have done .
No , they had to go a little further than that and — and this is pure Goldman , just outstanding stuff — make it clear that both I and my sources are simply not as smart as they are and do n’t understand what we ’re talking about .
So the rough translation here is , “ No comment , but if you were as smart as us , you would n’t be asking these questions . ”
So now word filters through that Goldman has issued yet another statement in response to the piece , this one by amusingly - named mouthpiece Lucas Van Pragg .
Again , the company does not take issue with any of the facts in the piece — not one .
Here ’s what he says :
Taibbi ’s bubble case does n’t stand up to serious scrutiny either .
To give just two examples , even with the worst will in the world , the blame for creating the internet bubble cannot credibly be laid at our door , and we could hardly be described as having been a major player in the mortgage market , unlike so many of our current and former competitors .
Taibbi’s article is a compilation of just about every conspiracy theory ever dreamed up about Goldman Sachs , but what real substance is there to support the theories ?
We reject the assertion that we are inflators of bubbles and profiteers in busts , and we are painfully conscious of the importance of being a force for good .
Okay , let ’s look at that bit piece by piece .
Van Pragg takes issue with the bubble argument by citing two “ examples ” of the case not holding water , the first being :
… the blame for creating the internet bubble cannot credibly be laid at our door …
I kept waiting for the “ because … ” clause here , but there was n’t one .
He just says so and leaves it at that .
Now there is obviously some measure of hyperbole in solely blaming Goldman Sachs for something like the internet bubble , or any of the other recent Wall Street disasters , for that matter .
But you ’d have to be absolutely crazy ( and you would n’t need “ the worst will in the world , ” either ) not to accept the notion that Goldman shouldered a significant portion of the blame for the internet mess .
They were , after all , the leading underwriter of internet IPOs during the internet boom years .
In 1999 , at the height of the boom , they underwrote 37 internet companies , most of which had little or no history and were losing money at the time of the launch .
By late 1999 Goldman was underwriting one out of every five internet IPOs .
They were repeatedly caught and punished for manipulating the prices of their IPOs , either via laddering or spinning .
Van Pragg does n’t deny any of this , and just blithely says that one can’t credibly blame them for the internet bubble .
I ’m almost insulted by the lameness and half - assedness of that comeback , but that might be part of the point , to be insulting .
He moves on :
… and we could hardly be described as having been a major player in the mortgage market , unlike so many of our current and former competitors .
Again , not to beat this into the ground , but in 2006 , at the height of the housing boom , Goldman underwrote over $ 75 billion in mortgages , over $ 59 billion of which were non-prime .
That represented 7 % of the entire market , which seems like a pretty “ major ” slice to me .
It is true that they did not jump so completely ass - first into the market as Lehman and Bear did ( note Van Pragg ’s bemused reference to “ former competitors ” ) , but if you read the piece , we noted why that does n’t take them off the hook at all .
Because while their “ former competitors ” ( one of whom is clearly “ former ” in large part because a former Goldmanite , Hank Paulson , elected to save Goldman ’s hide instead of Lehman ’s ) were dumb enough to hold their mortgage paper and be sunk by it , Goldman shorted their own crap , which means ( and I know I ’m repeating myself here ) they knew that what they were selling was a loser .
So while they maybe were n’t the biggest player , they were still a major player , and one can easily make the case that they were the most obnoxious player , given that they dove into this muck with their eyes wide open , unlike so many other idiots on Wall Street .
In the middle of this weirdly substanceless retort , Van Pragg then goes on complain about the lack of substance in the article , makes the predictable charge that the piece was a compendium of invented conspiracy theories , then moves on to “ reject ” the notion that the company inflates bubbles and profits in busts ( about that last part : I recommend checking out Goldman ’s profit / bonus numbers in 2002 , 2008 , and 2009 to date .
I ’m not sure how they can refute the notion that they have profited during the recent financial calamities ) .
Lastly , he says that the bank is “ painfully conscious ” of the importance of being a force for good , which I noted with amusement is not quite the same thing as saying that that bank is a force for good , or wants to be .
So to sum up , this all translates as :
“ Taibbi ’s bubble case does n’t hold water .
To use just two examples , Taibbi ’s internet bubble case does n’t hold water , and we did n’t sell as many mortgages as Lehman brothers .
Taibbi’s article is a compendium of every other story about Goldman that does n’t hold water .
We reject these theories that do not hold water , and are aware of the difference between right and wrong , making us legally sane according to the law . ”
I ’m aware that some people feel that it ’s a journalist ’s responsibility to “ give both sides of the story ” and be “ even - handed ” and “ objective . ”
A person who believes that will naturally find serious flaws with any article like the one I wrote about Goldman .
I personally do n’t subscribe to that point of view .
My feeling is that companies like Goldman Sachs have a virtual monopoly on mainstream - news public relations ; for every one reporter like me , or like far more knowledgeable critics like Tyler Durden , there are a thousand hacks out there willing to pimp Goldman ’s viewpoint on things in the front pages and ledes of the major news organizations .
And there are probably another thousand poor working stiffs who are nudged into pushing the Goldman party line by their editors and superiors ( how many political reporters with no experience reporting on financial issues have swallowed whole the news cliche about Goldman being the “ smart guys ” on Wall Street ?
A lot , for sure ) .
Goldman has its alumni pushing its views from the pulpit of the U.S. Treasury , the NYSE , the World Bank , and numerous other important posts ; it also has former players fronting major TV shows .
They have the ear of the president if they want it .
Given all of this , I personally think it ’s absurd to talk about the need for “ balance ” in every single magazine and news article .
I understand that some people feel differently , but that ’s my take on things .

Yeah this is where I step in with my usual moan .
There is also no way to preserve frame timings when you import a .gif into cs4 , regardless of how you do it .
So if the original gif relies on lots of different frame delays , you 'll have to reconstruct it once it 's imported into the stack .
A minor change to what Jeru said : in cs4 you 'll probably need to use File -> Import -> Video Frames To Layers .
The rest of his advice still holds .

Knowing Hitchens ’ penchant for denouncing and ridiculing religion , I decided to approach the subject of God ’s existence , not from the standpoint of religion , but from the standpoint of philosophy .
Hitchens seems to have no appreciation at all of the fact that one of the central questions of philosophy is whether God exists and that , regardless of religion , there is a long history of arguments for / against God ’s existence .
As a professional philosopher , I said that in the debate I was going to focus on the arguments and leave other issues aside .
This strategy worked beautifully , as Hitchens showed himself utterly incapable of interacting with the arguments in a substantive way .
By his third speech he had reverted to his usual railing against God as a North Korean dictator who robs us of our freedom .
Hitchens actually forfeited his closing statement in favor of taking audience questions , so that I wound up having the last word in the debate .
The reaction in the blogosphere was immediate and unanimous .
Hitchens was uniformly denounced for his empty rhetoric and posturing and his failure to interact with the arguments .
One atheist blogger summed it up : “ Hitchens was rambling and incoherent , with the occasional rhetorical jab .
Frankly , Craig spanked Hitchens like a foolish child . ”
For my part , I ’m gratified that one of the so - called four horsemen of the new atheism should be publicly exposed in this way .
In the Fish piece the other day , one of the commenters wrote something about how he thought that debating Dawkins or Hitchens would put Fish in his place .
Which is somewhat amusing , considering that the New Atheists keep getting their heads handed to them whenever they dare debate anyone but decrepit Anglicans and lady journalists :
As I 've pointed out in TIA , and as numerous individuals from D'Souza , Wilson , and Craig have demonstrated in their debates , neither Hitchens nor Dawkins actually have any effective arguments to offer .
What little they do have is nothing more than appeals to personal experience and ad hominem attacks on irrelevant strawmen ; they have absolutely no capacity for defending either their atheism or their secular humanism .
The fact that the second - tier atheists are cowardly buffoons and overmatched strippers like PZ Myers and Kelly O'Conner tends to support my contention that the New Atheist moment has come and gone .

Here 's a surefire way to destroy your expensive TV or severely injure your loved ones : CTA Digital 's Wii Bowling Ball , an accessory that 'll give Wii Bowling that extra edge of realism that 's acquired by nearly guaranteeing you 'll break something while using it .
For all that Nintendo tries to make sure that people 's idiocy or clumsiness does n't get the better of them and cause something to be destroyed while using the Wii , at some point it just becomes inevitable .
Or , rather , more than inevitable if you 're talking about using something like CTA Digital 's newest accessory , the Wii Bowling Ball .
Designed to be the first accessory " to be fashioned after an authentic bowling ball , " the Wii Bowling Ball , should you be ballsy enough to try it , will probably break windows , TVs , expensive vases , and maybe some bones too .
It 's supposed to turn your Wiimote into " the optimum performance - enhancing accessory , " which I think is a secret code for wrecking ball .
Here 's how it works :
You open up the ball , place your Wiimote inside , and then stick your fingers into the three holes , just like a real bowling ball has .
Then you can proceed to enjoy Wii Bowling , Brunswick Pro Bowling , Ten Pin Alley 2 , and other quality bowling titles .
Do n't forget to put on that industrial strength wrist band though , and , finally : " Even though holding and bowling the ball is so like - like [ sic ] to the actual sport , never , ever release the ball ! ! "
There are two exclamation marks there , so do n't forget that advice .
CTA Digital is not liable for any kind of destruction you cause with this thing , as they point out twice ( once in regular print , once in CAPS ) on their product page .
This product is not " licensed , designed , sponsored or manufactured " by Nintendo .
Big surprise , they probably do n't even want to be mentioned in the same breath as this thing .

That challenge confronts him next Saturday when he and 179 riders line up for this year 's Tour that starts in Monaco and finishes 3500 km later on the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 26 .
Interest in Armstrong 's return at the age of 37 will be massive .
In the book , Armstrong also reveals the strength of his belief that his winning days are far from over .
" I 'll kick their asses , " he told author John Wilcockson in a conversation soon after last year 's Tour while discussing his planned comeback .
" The Tour was a bit of a joke this year .
I 've got nothing against Sastre … or Christian Vande Velde .
Christian 's a nice guy , but finishing fifth in the Tour de France ?
Come on ! "
Armstrong also reveals his anger for the way in which the US television network Versus covered the Tour , and how it portrayed his sixth and seventh Tours in 2004 and 2005 .
" They had this ' Take back the Tour ' campaign , as if the past Tours were all won by dopers .
And I was pissed they had these references to Triki Beltran and Tyler Hamilton and Roberto Heras and Floyd Landis - all these guys who were once on my team [ and have since served doping suspensions ] .
Versus does n't want to take back the Tour , they want to take back the ratings they had in 04 and 05 ! "
Armstrong , who has faced constant doping allegations despite never testing positive , is also keen to prove he is clean and hopes by racing the Tour again his four children will read about it .
" I 'm doing this for my kids , " he says in the book .
" With news so accessible these days on the web , they 'll be able to read any story they want .
And I do n't want them growing up and reading all these things about me and doping . "
Armstrong will not start the Tour as the Astana team 's leader - at least officially .
The leader will be Spaniard Alberto Contador , the 2007 winner who did not race last year as the team was not invited due to its implication in doping scandals under a former management .
Astana yesterday named their nine - man line - up , regarded as the team to beat this year .
With Armstrong and Contador will be American Levi Leipheimer who was third in 2007 and German Andreas Kloden who was second in 2004 and 2006 , as well as domestiques Yaroslav Popovych , Haimar Zubeldia , Sergio Paulinho , and Gregory Rast and Dimitriy Muravyev .
Astana team manager Johan Bruyneel said Contador had earned the leadership role this season , but many are forecasting a fall - out between the pair if Armstrong gets a sniff of a win .
Armstrong said this week that he does n't care what number he has on his back .
He was also interested to read a report of rumours that Contador was ready to join the American Garmin - Slipstream team if Astana 's recent financial woes not corrected and the team disbanded .
Had the team folded , it was reported that Contador would not race in a proposed Livestrong team that would replace Astana and include Armstrong and those closest to him in the team .
Meanwhile , the fight for the final positions in the 20 teams that will race the Tour will reach its climax this weekend when European countries hold their respective national road race championships which will impact on the selection of short - listed riders .
This will have a spin - off effect for those Australians still in contention for Tour berths .
They will not be racing , but the poor performances of any European will enhance their selection odds .
On latest reckoning , there could still be a record - equalling 10 Australians in the Tour from the 19 who are on those 20 teams that been invited to race .

Hey .
Do you like Buttersafe ?
Also , do you speak Brazilian Portuguese ?
Has it been your desire for a long time to read Buttersafe in Brazilian Portuguese ?
Well , you ’re in luck !
Paulo Victor of Brazil has started translating Buttersafe for us at Buttersafe Traduzido , and he is doing a good job of it !
Some day when we become fluent in Brazilian Portuguese we will write all our comics in that language and somebody will have to translate the comics into English for us .

Well , Obama has been good at marketing his message and style , perception is everything no matter what you say .
He will have to get used to alot of this .
Gen Casey 's calculations about force levels are related to his attempt to ease the brutal deployment calendar that he said would " bring the Army to its knees " .
His goal was , he explained , to move rotations by 2011 to one year in the battlefield and two years out for regular army troops , and one year in the battlefield and three years out for reserves .
He called the current one - year - in - one - year - out cycle " unsustainable ” .
After we showed you how to disable the Caps Lock key , reader Philipp wrote in with his unbelievably geeky use for the otherwise pointless key — by using it to help navigate while editing text .

Philipp 's idea was to use the Caps Lock key as a way to toggle keys on the front row for navigation instead of having to constantly reach for the arrow keys — so you hold down Caps Lock and use J , K , L , I to move the cursor Left , Down , Right , and Up .

He took it a few steps further and added keys that simulate Home , End , and even copy / paste — might be a little complicated to learn at first , but once you get used to it , you might just be sold on the idea .
Since he implemented all the functionality as an AutoHotkey script , you can easily adjust it to fit your own needs —
I 'm working on my own version that uses the vim keys instead .
The list of functions includes :
Normal usage with capslock as a modifier :
j : left
k : down
l : right
i : up
h : simulates CTRL + left ( jumps to the next word )
ö : simulates CTRL + right ( commented out , you will need to adjust for your keyboard layout )
, : simulates CTRL +
Down
8 : simulates CTRL +
Up
u : simulates " Home " ( jumps to the beginning of the current line ) ( i forgot to mention this in my comment )
o : simulates " End "
Backspace : simulates " Delete "
b : cut
c : copy
v : paste
If you keep pressing
Alt in addition to Capslock it works as if you are pressing " Shift " —> you highlight the text .
Shift +
Capslock activates the actual Capslock functionality ( normal capslock - hitting deactivates it again ) .
The Hand Friendly Navigation script is a free download for Windows , requires AutoHotkey .
Great job , Philipp !

Here 's a list of frequently asked questions :
Q : Is it possible to overcharge the Lithium Polymer battery ?
A : No - the charger will automatically switch to trickle charging and then shut off .
Q : Is it possible to drain the Lithium Polymer battery completely and damage it ?
A : No - the battery has its own low voltage cut off circuitry that will prevent it from completely discharging - the low voltage cut off is around 2.8
v
Q : Does the solar cell have a blocking diode to prevent it from draining the Lithium Polymer battery ?
A : No blocking diode is necessary - the Lithium Polymer charger prevents the battery from leaking current .
Q : How long will it take to fully charge the Lithium Polymer battery and how long will it take to charge my iPod / iPhone ?
A : How long it will take to fully charge depends on the amount of sunlight available but as a rough guesstimate it would take around 20 hrs using the small solar cell in direct sunlight .
Using a larger solar cell could easily take half if not one third the amount of time .
Those same figures would apply if you were charging it over USB or using a wall wart power supply .
Charging your iPod is much faster .
How fast it does it depends on your device 's battery capacity .
An iPod Touch has a 1000 mAh battery so it should fully charge it in around 2hrs .
A 3G iPhone has a 1150 mAh battery so it will take slightly longer and a 2G iPhone has a 1400 mAh battery , so it will take around 3 hrs .
Q : The Lithium Polymer charger has an input voltage range of 3.7v minimum to 7v maximum - what if I want to use a higher output solar cell for faster charging ?
A : To use a solar cell with a voltage output greater than 7 v , you need a voltage regulator to drop the voltage to a level that the charger can handle .
You could use a 7805 voltage regulator to limit the output to +5 v - they only cost about $ 1.50 and are very simple to wire up .
The 7805 will give you as fixed +5 v and is usually good up to 1A current .
You could also use a LM317T which is an adjustable regulator , but it would involve a bit more circuitry to use .
Some people also use diodes to drop voltage , since many diodes have a voltage drop of .7
v
There 's a lot more info here :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regulator
The other option would be to use a 6v /250 mA solar panel .
This will stay within the current input range and voltage input range of the Lithium Polymer charger .
Remember that you can also connect smaller solar cells in parallel to increase the available current - two 5v/100 mA solar cells connected together in parallel will give an output of 5 v @200 mA
Q : What if I want to use a charger with a higher input current limit ?
A : Sparkfun does have a Lithium Polymer charger that maxes out at 1A :
http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8293
Q : How would I connect the more powerful charger - there does n't appear to be a clear way to do this ?
A : To use the more powerful 1A charger you would need to wire a two way switch to the battery so that in one position the battery would be connected to the charger and in the other position the battery would be connected to the MintyBoost circuit .
Q : Will this work with USB devices other than iPods and iPhones ?
A : You bet !
There 's a list here :
http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/
Q : Wo n't the inside of the Altoids tin short out the circuit ?
A : No - using double sided foam tape to mount the circuit boards keeps the bottom of the board from coming into contact with the inside bottom of the tin .
If you 're really worried you can cover the inside bottom of the tin with clear packing tape .
Q : How much does this cost ?
Can I build it for less ?
Is it cost effective ?
A : If you buy everything as listed it would cost $ 70.75 ( not including the Altoids tin or shipping . )
If you wanted to scratchbuild it using the MintyBoost PCB from Adafruit , building your own charging circuit and supplying your own parts from various sources you can save quite a bit .
Both the charging circuit and the MintyBoost circuit are available online - just go to the web pages listed in the tools and materials section - they 're also listed at the bottom of this page .
Both Maxim and Linear Technology supply free samples ( according to their websites ) of their ICs so you just need to provide all the other bits ( available from places like Mouser and Digikey . )
Using a slightly smaller solar cell and a 2200 mAh battery it is possible to build it for a lot less :
2200 mAh battery
solar cell
MintyBoost PCB
After adding up the small parts for the MintyBoost circuit , a small blank PCB for the charging circuit ( you would have to etch the board yourself ) and a mini USB connector , you could conceivably build this for around $ 21.00 ( not including shipping or an Altoids tin . )
It would n't be exactly the same of course , but it would be functionally the same .
I do n't know if the 2200 mAh battery would fit into an Altoids tin either .
It would be a LOT more work of course , and there could be a fair bit of troubleshooting if you 're not experienced in building these types of circuits or soldering surface mount components .
So is it cost effective ?
Absolutely - it just depends on the amount of work you want to do .
Either way , you get a very useful and versatile solar powered charger .
Q : How did you calculate the power usage and equivalent CO2 values ?
A : Here 's the math -
3.7v ( LiPo rated voltage ) x .1A ( solar charge current ) = .37 W
. 37W x 12.5hrs ( charge time based on average battery capacity ) = 4.625Wh
4.625Wh x 365 days = 1688.125 Wh per year
1688.125Wh per year x 30,000,000 units sold = 50,643,750,000
Wh total used per year ( 50.644gWh )
50.644gWh per year x 1.5 lbs CO2 produced per kWh used = 75,965,625 lbs. CO2 produced per year
Granted these are more or less maximum values but they clearly show some potential for some serious energy savings .
A 12.5 hr solar charge time per day is n't realistic for the majority of the planet but if you shorten the solar charge time to approximately 4.5hrs at a 280 mA current the results still remain the same .

BBC News , Enugu , Nigeria
Cosmos Aneke Chiedozie wants to break the stigma of being ' Osu ' Pastor Cosmos Aneke Chiedozie is about to make an admission that virtually no Nigerian like him would be prepared to make .
" My grandfather was an Osu , " he says .
He is standing outside his church in Enugu , south - eastern Nigeria , clutching his Bible which he believes has saved him from being a marked man .
Among the Igbo people of eastern Nigeria the Osu are outcasts , the equivalent of being an " untouchable " .
Years ago he and his family would be shunned by society , banished from communal land , banned from village life and refused the right to marry anyone not from an Osu family .
Marriage
The vehemence of the tradition has weakened over the last 50 years .
I remember when I was a child , seeing the Osu and running away
Prof Ben Obumselu
Nowadays the only trouble the Osu encounter is when they try to get married .
But the fear of social stigma is still strong - to the point that most would never admit to being an Osu .
They fear the consequences for their families in generations to come or at the hands of people who still believe in the old ways .
It took the BBC a long time track down an Osu willing to talk , Igbo journalists , human rights advocates , academics and politicians could suggest no - one .
It was only by chance that Cosmos admitted his family were Osu after an interview with the Pentecostal church - known to oppose the tradition .
Now a born - again Christian , he has had a hard fight to escape the stigma of the Osu .
Sacrifice People say the Osu are the descendants of people sacrificed to the gods , hundreds of years ago .
The village said the reason I was ill was I was being possessed by the spirit of my grandfather , and he was angry that we had rejected the old ways
Cosmos Aneke Chiedozie
But an academic who has researched Igbo traditions says he believes the Osu were actually a kind of " living sacrifice " to the gods from the community .
" I remember when I was a child , seeing the Osu and running away , " says Professor Ben Obumselu , former vice - president of the influential Igbo organisation Ohaneze Ndi Igbo .
" They were banned from all forms of civil society ; they had no land , lived in the shrine of the gods , and if they could , would farm the land next to the road . "
" It was believed that they had been dedicated to the gods , that they belonged to them , rather then the world of the human , " he said .
Nigeria 's growing cities began to break down such traditions of village life , he says .
" If someone lives in Lagos these days , the only time a person may come into contact with it is when they are planning to get married .
They go home to tell their families , their parents turn around and say , ' No you can't marry because they 're Osu . ' "
Initiated Cosmos ' father had denounced the traditional beliefs that made him an outcast from society .
The Osu are considered to be ' living sacrifices " to spirits
He raised Cosmos to be a Christian too , hoping the bloodline of the Osu would be broken .
But when Cosmos was a child his grandfather died and at around the same time Cosmos fell sick .
" The village said the reason I was ill was I was being possessed by the spirit of my grandfather , and he was angry that we had rejected the old ways , " he said .
The village elders put pressure on his father to initiate Cosmos into the old traditions and culture .
It was either that , or he would die , they said .
So he left church , learnt about the spirits and his status in the village .
Outlaw
But this ostracism , he now believes , left him without " moral direction " .
He became an itinerant smuggler and outlaw , bringing in goods illegally over Nigeria 's northern border from Niger .
The continued belief in ritual avoidance has caused great harm to society
Prof Ben Obumselu
Eventually he was arrested and thrown in jail .
" It was in the prison yard that I was born again , " he said .
" When I believed in the old ways , I could not marry or be part of my community , " he said .
" Now I 've been born again , I have rejected all that , and my wife , she is born again too , and does n't care about it either . "
His wife 's family had also rejected the traditions of the Osu and did not object to their daughter 's choice of husband .
Education advantage Other Osu have been able to use the ostracism to their advantage , says Mr Obumselu .
Unable to make a way in village life , some Osu embraced " Western " education and became Nigeria 's first doctors and lawyers , he says .
Consequently many of modern Igboland 's prominent families are Osu .
So why does the stigma remain ?
Mr Obumselu says the traditions have a lingering hold on people because they are not sure how much power the " old ways " still have .
Traditionally the Osu are treated as a people apart , but were never the victims of violence .
But today some community conflicts have erupted between people each accusing the other of being Osu , Mr Obumselu says .
" The continued belief in ritual avoidance has caused great harm to society , especially in Enugu . "
Pentecostal churches , like Mr Chiedozie's , are having an effect and a growing population may also drown out the stigma of being Osu , says Mr Obumselu .
" After all , if in 1800 there might only be a handful of Osu in any place , in 2000 it may be a third of the village ! "

Overall good poll for Obama but of course not as good as it was in April before Obama had to make tough decisions such as bailing out GM , Gitmo , higher unemployment , etc .
What I found fascinating about this poll was the health care part :
On health care , the public remains open to persuasion .
Without being told anything specific about the Obama plan in the survey , about a third of people said it 's a good idea , about a third said it 's a bad idea and the rest had no opinion .
When given several details of his approach , 55 % said they favored it , versus 35 % who were opposed .
There was also support for the Democratic push to let people sign up for a public health - care plan that would compete with private companies , one of the toughest issues in the health - care debate .
Three in four people said a public plan is extremely or quite important .
But when told the arguments for and against the plan , a smaller portion , 47 % , agreed with arguments in support of the plan , with 42 % agreeing with the arguments against it .
At the same time , nearly half the participants said it was very or somewhat likely that their employer would drop private coverage if a public plan were available .
In terms of how to pay for health care reform , Americans do NOT like the Baucus / McCain plan of how to pay for it which is taxing health care benefits .
As for how to pay for the package , estimated at more than $ 1 trillion over 10 years , the public favors proposals to require all Americans to get insurance , to raise taxes on the rich and , to a lesser extent , to require all but the smallest businesses to offer insurance or pay into a fund .
But majorities oppose plans to tax health benefits , even if the taxes only apply to particularly generous plans .
The public is divided about cuts to Medicare .
Chuck Todd said that the Democratic Senators are not reading polls correctly .
He said that Americans will NOT feel that there is health care reform unless there is a public option .
IMO , what Obama needs to do is go out on the road and SELL his health care plan .
In terms of health care , the Obama team is n't stupid .
They know that the public option when explained is popular and they have also devised a way of paying for it without taxing people 's health care benefits .
IMO , the fastest way of turning people off to Obama 's health care plan is to tax it .
The bottom line is that Obama has a health care discussion on ABC next week .
After that , Obama needs to go out on the road and sell this thing complete with public option and how they plan to pay for it .
Hundreds of millions of Europeans will cast their vote in the European elections this week .
In Sweden , The Pirate Party is confident that it will get at least one seat , but they are not the only party aiming to legalize file - sharing for personal use .
The Green parties in Europe are also known for their pro-sharing views .
The European Greens , which consists of many national Green political parties throughout Europe , currently hold 42 seats in the European parliament and aim to increase this number for the next term .
While the Pirate Party in Sweden received much press coverage for defending The Pirate Bay and sites alike , the Greens were already doing the same thing in the European Parliament .
In 2008 the Greens launched a pro-filesharing campaign named “ I Would n’t Steal ” .
The campaign clip they created ( see below ) was uploaded to The Pirate Bay .
Their goal was to counter the anti-piracy propaganda put forward by the entertainment industry , and encourage people to download and share .
Greens “ I Would n’t Steal ” Campaign
This view is also reflected in the party ’s principles and actions during the last term of the European Parliament .
The Greens were one of the parties that managed to block legislation that would make it easier to implement “ three - strikes ” and disconnect alleged pirates from the Internet .
In addition , they opposed the controversial and draconian IPRED legislation that would criminalize forms of copyright infringement .
“ Greens fought against IPRED , which attempted to generalise the use of criminal sanctions in all cases of intellectual property infringements .
Greens helped to make sure that criminal sanctions only apply in case of violation of intellectual property rights on a commercial scale and not for personal use , ” they write in their Green Book .
The Greens have a clear picture of what the future “ information society ” would look like .
Less copyright , more Open Source software , no software patents , a neutral net , no three strikes , open access to science and the legalization of non-commercial file - sharing , to name a few of their key points .
“ Greens support an active vision of the Web as a platform for the exchange of information , with peer - to - peer groups in which each user can upload or download content and applications of choice .
The non-commercial use of the Internet must be excluded from all sanction systems , ” the Greens write .
On the other hand , the Greens oppose “ any systematic surveillance of the net , because it is incompatible with the right to privacy . ”
So no spying on your download behavior by the entertainment industry or even your Internet provider , and thus no “ three strikes ” legislation .
For all the European Torrent Freak readers out there , whatever your choice may be , please go out and vote .
NYU professor Clay Shirky gave a fantastic talk on new media during our TED@State event earlier this month .
He revealed how cellphones , the web , Facebook and Twitter had changed the rules of the game , allowing ordinary citizens extraordinary new powers to impact real - world events .
As protests in Iran exploded over the weekend , we decided to rush out his talk , because it could hardly be more relevant .
I caught up with Clay this afternoon to get his take on the significance of what is happening .
HIs excitement was palpable .
What do you make of what ’s going on in Iran right now .
I ’m always a little reticent to draw lessons from things still unfolding , but it seems pretty clear that … this is it .
The big one .
This is the first revolution that has been catapulted onto a global stage and transformed by social media .
I ’ve been thinking a lot about the Chicago demonstrations of 1968 where they chanted “ the whole world is watching . ”
Really , that was n’t true then .
But this time it ’s true … and people throughout the world are not only listening but responding .
They ’re engaging with individual participants , they ’re passing on their messages to their friends , and they ’re even providing detailed instructions to enable web proxies allowing Internet access that the authorities can’t immediately censor .
That kind of participation is reallly extraordinary .
Which services have caused the greatest impact ?
Blogs ?
Facebook ?
Twitter ?
It ’s Twitter .
One thing that Evan ( Williams ) and Biz ( Stone ) did absolutely right is that they made Twitter so simple and so open that it ’s easier to integrate and harder to control than any other tool .
At the time , I ’m sure it was n’t conceived as anything other than a smart engineering choice .
But it ’s had global consequences .
Twitter is shareable and open and participatory in a way that Facebook ’s model prevents .
So far , despite a massive effort , the authorities have found no way to shut it down , and now there are literally thousands of people aorund the world who ’ve made it their business to help keep it open .
Do you get a sense that it ’s almost as if the world is figuring out live how to use Twitter in these circumstances ?
Some dissidents were using named accounts for a while , and there ’s been a raging debate in the community about how best to help them .
Yes , there ’s an enormous reckoning to be had about what works and what does n’t .
There have been disagreements over whether it was dangerous to use hashtags like # Iranelection , and there was a period in which people were openly tweeting the IP addresses of web proxies for people to switch to , not realizing that the authorities would soon shut these down .
It ’s incredibly messy , and the definitive rules of the game have yet to be written .
So yes , we ’re seeing the medium invent itself in real time .
Talk some more about the sense of participation on Twitter .
It seems to me that that has spurred an entirely deeper level of emotional connection with these events .
Absolutely .
I ’ve been saying this for a while — as a medium gets faster , it gets more emotional .
We feel faster than we think .
But Twitter is also just a much more personal medium .
Reading personal messages from individuals on the ground prompts a whole other sense of involvement .
We ’re seeing everyone desperate to do something to show solidarity like wear green — and suddenly the community figures out that it can actually offer secure web proxies , or persuade Twitter to delay an engineering upgrade — we can help keep the medium open .
When I see John Perry Barlow setting himself up as a router , he ’s not performing these services as a journalist .
He ’s engaged .
Traditional media operates as source of inofrmation not as a means of coordination .
It ca n’t do more than make us sympathize .
Twitter makes us empathize .
It makes us part of it .
Even if it ’s just retweeting , you ’re aiding the goal that dissidents have always sought : the awareness that the ouside world is paying attention is really valuable .
Of course the downside of this emotional engagement is that while this is happening , I feel like I ca n’t in good consicence tweet about anything else !
There was fury on Twitter against CNN for not adequately covering the situation .
Was that justified ?
In a way it was n’t .
I ’m sure that for the majority of the country , events in Iran are not of grave interest , even if those desperate for CNN ’s Iran info could n’t get access to it .
That push model of one message for all is an incredibly crappy way of linking supply and demand .
CNN has the same problem this decade that Time magazine had last decade .
They simultaneously want to appeal to middle America and leading influencers .
Reaching multiple audiences is increasingly difficult .
The people who are hungry for info on events of global significance are used to instinctively switching on CNN .
But they are realizng that that reflex does n’t serve them very well anymore , and that ca n’t be good for CNN .
Do you get the sense that these new media tools are helping build a global community , forged more by technology and a desire for connection , than by traditional political or religious divides ?
You can see it clearly in what ’s happening right now .
And it cuts both ways .
The guy we ’re rallying around , Mousavi , is no liberal reformer .
But the principle of freedom of speech and fair elections and the desire for reform trump that .
So how does this play out ?
It ’s complex .
The Ahmadinejad supporters are going to use the fact of English - speaking and American participation to try to damn the dissidents .
But whatever happens from here , the dissidents have seen that large numbers of American people , supposedly part of “ the great Satan , ” are actually supporters .
Someone tweeted from Tehran today that “ the American media may not care , but the American people do . ”
That ’s a sea-change .
DESPITE its diminutive size , the humble bilby can dig a desert back to life , according to research that reveals the marsupial 's vital role in arid environments .
Alex James , a PhD student from the University of NSW , said the bilby 's night - time foraging expeditions left the desert surface full of potholes , which made for ideal conditions for nutrient - rich " hot spots " to develop .
The endangered bilby helps make the desert bloom .

The potholes , the result of the bilby digging for food , are no deeper than 20 centimetres and about the size of a saucer .
But Ms James found they played an important role in revegetation , with the depressions trapping seeds , plant matter and water .
" Soils in arid areas are very nutrient - poor , so any ( plant ) litter that gets trapped and decomposes increases the nutrients in the soil which benefits plant growth , " she said , noting that bilby diggings contained up to twice the levels of nitrogen and carbon nutrients as undisturbed soil .
After a decade of research , and 2.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money , government funded research into so - called “ alternative ” medicine has little to show for it .
The AP has put out a fairly insightful review of this research , which echos many of the points I have been making over the years .
They report :
Echinacea for colds .
Ginkgo biloba for memory .
Glucosamine and chondroitin for arthritis .
Black cohosh for menopausal hot flashes .
Saw palmetto for prostate problems .
Shark cartilage for cancer .
All proved no better than dummy pills in big studies funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine .
The lone exception : ginger capsules may help chemotherapy nausea .
As for therapies , acupuncture has been shown to help certain conditions , and yoga , massage , meditation and other relaxation methods may relieve symptoms like pain , anxiety and fatigue .
And to reinforce that point :
( Dr. Josephine Briggs ) conceded there were no big wins from its first decade , other than a study that found acupuncture helped knee arthritis .
That finding was called into question when a later , larger study found that sham treatment worked just as well .
Dr. Briggs is the current director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) – the NIH center that funds this research .
To summarize – the government spent 2.5 billion dollars to determine that unpurified , poorly controlled drugs with generally low doses of active ingredients do n’t work very well , that treatments based upon unscientific notions do n’t work , and exercise and relaxation make people feel better .
Oh – and they found that acupuncture does not work , proponents just have n’t noticed yet .
Actually , the government spent 2.5 billion dollars to advertise and promote unscientific medicine to the public .
And yet Briggs says that they are just getting started .
“ More research is needed , ” is the mantra of CAM scientists , no matter how much negative evidence is piled on top of implausibility .
The report included some juicy quotes from names I recognize .
“ There ’s been a deliberate policy of never saying something does n’t work .
It ’s as though you can only speak in one direction , ” and say a different version or dose might give different results , said Dr. Stephen Barrett , a retired physician who runs Quackwatch , a web site on medical scams .
That ’s right .
The NCCAM never met an alternative modality that did not work .
I have pointed out that the point of medical research is more often to weed away what does not work .
Further , science - based medicine means stopping the use of modalities that are shown to be unsafe or ineffective .
CAM proponents never ( to my knowledge ) do that .
NCCAM researchers have not crossed a single CAM modality off the list .
“ It ’s the fox guarding the chicken coop , ” said Dr. Joseph Jacobs , who headed the Office of Alternative Medicine , a smaller federal agency that preceded the center ’s creation .
“ This is not science , it ’s ideology on the part of the advocates . ”
Jacobs was the first director of the OAM – and resigned for the very reason he states above .
He saw what was happening – the office was created to promote an ideology , not conduct scientific research .
So he was replaced by Wayne Jonas , a homeopath , who apparently was a much better fit .
“ You expect scientific thinking ” at a federal science agency , said R. Barker Bausell , author of “ Snake Oil Science ” and a research methods expert at the University of Maryland , one of the agency ’s top - funded research sites .
“ It ’s become politically correct to investigate nonsense . ”
Go , Barker .
It is also politically - incorrect to criticize nonsense , even within academia .
“ There ’s very little basic science behind these things .
Most of it begins with a tradition , or personal testimony and people ’s beliefs , even as a fad .
And then pressure comes : ‘ It ’s being popular , it ’s being used , it should be studied . ’
It turns things upside down , ” said Dr. Edward Campion , a senior editor who reviews alternative medicine research submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine .
Again – a point I have hammered for years .
The CAM philosophy seems to be to promote first and ask questions later .
And then keep promoting , no matter what the answers are .
It is a bizzaro world of scientific medicine .
The response to negative data is also very telling .
After a massive echinacea study showed no effect for the common cold – it ’s most common use – proponents said that the wrong species was used .
Like those who submit for the Million Dollar Psychic Challenge , this criticism came only after the study was negative .
I wonder if they would have thought that if the study were positive .
But also this shows the bias in this community – treatments are thought to be effective until proven otherwise , as if they are “ innocent until proven guilty . ”
But that is not the world of scientific medicine , where treatments are assumed not to be safe and effective until they are adequately demonstrated to be .
Echinace sellers place the burden of proof on others to demonstrate that their products do not work – and of course they can set the standard as high as they wish .
Until you test every part of the plant of every echinacea species in a high enough dose with every cold - causing virus – you have not proven it does n’t work .
Unfortunately , US laws currently validate this bizzaro world view .
The supplement industry can assume safety and efficacy and make all sorts of quasi - health claims for their products , and the burden of proof is on the FDA to show that they are unsafe , or on the FTC to show that they are making fraudulent claims .
What this means , in my opinion , is that the NCCAM is broken , and it cannot be fixed because it ’s very reason for existing and founding philosophy are broken .
It seeks to set a double standard for medical research .
In so doing it serves only to promote unscientific modalities .
Negative studies do not make ineffective modalities go away .
There is no legitimate role for scientific evidence in an unscientific profession .
Having said that , I do think that certain individual studies within the NCCAM may be useful – especially those with herbs .
As I have said before , herbs are drugs , they are just not purified .
But herbal research can be funded without the NCCAM , through botanical research .

Zimbabwe 's Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has been forced to cut short an event where he was addressing Zimbabwean exiles in the UK .
Mr Tsvangirai was speaking before more than 1,000 exiles at London 's Southwark Cathedral , whom he urged to return home to rebuild the country .
BEIJING , June 2 ( Reuters ) -
The top item on the Chinese website of Beijing 's embassy in Pyongyang is a condemnation of North Korea 's nuclear test .
That , and a recent blast of blunt criticism of North Korea in China 's state - run press , suggest the rancour that officials feel towards their communist neighbour -- anger likely to bring Beijing behind a U.N. resolution condemning the May 25 test and threatening fresh sanctions .
North Korea 's second nuclear test took place 85 km ( 53 miles ) from China 's border , and the tremors from the blast forced many schools on the Chinese side to evacuate , wrote Zhang Lianggui , a prominent Chinese expert on the North .
He warned of catastrophe if Pyongyang mishandles a nuclear test .
" Future generations of the Korean people will have no place of their own , and China 's reviving northeast will burst like a bubble , " Zhang wrote in the Global Times , a popular tabloid , on Tuesday .
" This is an unprecedented threat that China has never faced in its thousands of years . "
On Monday , a commentary in the same paper called North Korea a " strategic burden " for China .
Not the kind of language the government would have allowed earlier this year , when the focus was on celebrating 60 years of ties with the Communist North .
Zhan Debin , an expert on Korea at Fudan University in Shanghai , wrote in the paper that the Chinese government could soon be pushed to abandon its usual reticence .
" If this continues , China will not be able to stall international expectations by saying that North Korea does n't listen or that we have no influence , " wrote Zhan .
If Pyongyang continues raising the international stakes , Zhan added , war cannot be ruled out , and North Korea will " either continue trapped in a Cold War or will swiftly disappear " .
Such harsh words may not have the express approval of China 's leaders .
But they reflect the government 's growing impatience with its neighbour .
STRATEGIC BUFFER
China has long regarded the North as a strategic buffer against the extension of U.S. and allied forces up to its 1,416 - km ( 880 - mile ) frontier with the North .
But Beijing also fears North Korea 's nuclear threats could tip the region into destabilising and expensive military rivalry .
For all the harsh words in the Chinese media , however , the government may not be so forceful when the U.N. Security Council considers fresh sanctions against the North .
Apart from the May 25 condemnation of the test , Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have avoided strong commentary about North Korea , which depends on its 1950 - 53 Korean War ally China for much of its food and oil .
In 2006 , China backed a U.N. resolution condemning the North 's first nuclear test .
But it fended off demands for sanctions that could choke its economic lifeline to Pyongyang .
" China will be extremely cautious about new sanctions this time , " Liu Jiangyong , an expert on East Asian security at Tsinghua University in Beijing , told Reuters .
" China wo n't agree to excessive sanctions that would only stoke conflict with North Korea , " he said .
" Actions like that might give psychological satisfaction to some countries , but they wo n't help solve the North Korean nuclear crisis . "
Notably , too , the Korean - language page for China 's embassy in North Korea does not feature the condemnation of the test , concentrating on bright reports celebrating the two nations ' friendship . (

A more basic question : Just what ARE these bonds ?
cash
are
Duecentoquarantanove bond della Federal Reserve statunitense per un valore nominale di 500 milioni di dollari ciascuno , più 10 bond Kennedy da 1 miliardo di dollari ciascuno
I used to trade treasury bonds and cash for several institutions ... there 's no such thing as " Federal Reserve Bond " .
It does n't exist .
The fed do not issue their own debt instrument .
Notes

" ... fakes .
Not forgeries .
Just plain fakes .
You can find a lot of those things in the Philippines .
From Yamashita's﻿ treasure maps to these so - called war bonds . "
Think of it !
All the gold looted in Asia during World War II !
So much gold that acknowledging it would force authorities to double their estimates of how much gold has existed in all of history !
And not just gold but silver and jewels and other valuables !
maps
On this anointment as God 's Chosen as Manifested on her saga , these collective of events are being put together as a proof of her events as the Anointed Spirit of God , and The Chosen One .
In any of all the places she goes , wherever she was , the Tribal Leaders / Lumads , Religious Organization Leaders , Islamic or Muslim group , had blessed her and appoint her to be their Queen .
This all happened unknowingly what is to come in the future .
The Federal Reserve is aware of several scams involving high denomination Federal Reserve notes and bonds , often in denominations of 100 million or 500 million dollars , dating back to the 1930s , usually 1934 .
In each of these schemes , fraudulent instruments are claimed to be part of a long - lost supply of recently discovered Federal Reserve notes or bonds .
The Federal Reserve has never issued any bonds or notes with coupons attached .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is not aware of any currency or debt stockpile of large denomination Federal Reserve notes from the 1930s and warns that any institution that pays out on such a claim does so at its own risk .
It should also be noted that the largest denomination of currency ever printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was the $ 100,000 Series 1934 Gold Certificate featuring the portrait of President Wilson .

Rumor has it that the Federal Reserve is considering selling bonds .
The legality is in question .
Leaving that aside , why would the Fed do such a thing ?
If it did , how would such a thing work ?
What would be its effects ?
theoretical construct

By the way :
" Wham , bam , thank you Pam ! "
Please do me a favor and spread word about this post .
My articles have been vindicated .
After you read the piece below , check out the sixth update to this Cryptogon article on the mystery bonds .
The main Cryptogon article was written before my work but the update -- which gloms onto the Filipino connection -- was written afterward , independently .
The giveaway was the " 1934 " date on the bonds .
Apparently , when someone tried to pull this trick back in 2005 , the bonds amounted to $ 3 trillion .
Those guys on the Italian - Swiss border were pikers .
For lots more info ( included a damning photo ) , see my updated post , " Vindication . "
Our previous story on " The Italian job " has gotten stranger .
Before we get to the new stuff , we must recap : Two " Japanese nationals " ( who may not actually come from Japan ) were caught in Italy just as they were about to take $ 134.5 billion dollars in bonds into Switzerland .
Most of these bonds , we are told , were of such a ridiculously high denomination ( $ 500 million each ) as to make them non-negotiable by normal humans .
Only states could hope to use such things . :
What did the " Japanese nationals " hope to do with these instruments ?
Are the bonds counterfeit or real ?
If real , Italy stood to gain a windfall -- Italian law allows the government of that country to take 40 percent of the booty .
Why has the American press kept mum about a possible swindle that dwarfs the Madoff affair ?
The Europeans and the Asians are all over it .
Now that we are caught up , here 's the latest :
This site by Karl Denninger quotes a translated German news article which indicates that the bonds are probably real , or so sayeth the Italians .
That clear up Mystery number 2 .
Or does it ?
Recall that the Italians , who are conducting the investigation , have a strong financial stake in the outcome .
Below , we will examine good evidence that the bonds are actually outrageous fakes .
Real or fake , just how did the two " Japanese " hope to cash such bonds ?
Who are these guys ?
Why are their names being kept out of all news accounts ?
One news story -- immediately taken offline -- identified one of the " Japanese " as a notorious con man from the Philippines named Yohannes Riyadi , a.k.a.
Wilfredo Saurin , whose associates in international crime are fairly well - known .
The other guy may have been his comrade Joseph Daraman .
These two men are the right ages , and they both could pass for Japanese .
They 've been trading indocuments from the Federal Reserve for years .
Karl Denninger seems to think that we are dealing with bearer bonds .
Such bonds are like the bills in your wallet ( only lots more compact ) -- they bear no record of the transaction .
If you possess them , the money 's yours .
That is , if you can figure out how toa $ 500 million bond , which you probably could n't .
Butthey bearer bonds ?
The original Italian story referred to the bonds as mostly " Federal Reserve Bonds " plus " Kennedy Bonds . "
Babel
Fish it :
And now I 'm trying to figure out just what these words mean .
Maybe you 'll have better luck than I did , but when I looked up the phrase " Kennedy bonds , " I encountered no previous usage of that term .
The classification almost certainly does not exist " Federal Reserve Bond " is a more difficult term .
This site offers a discussion of the Italian mystery which includes an eye - opening comment by one sjfan :
Is that claim true ?
The improper subject - verb agreement does not necessarily mean that we should dismiss what sjfan has to say .
I 've been researching the term " Federal Reserve Bond " and have found no hard evidence that such an animal has ever stomped the earth .
Yes , there are Federal Reserve , which we all know about .
But the bonds shown in the photograph are not those .
So what are they ?
Here 's where we enter the land of high strangeness .
I found a surprisingly relevant YouTube video produced by a group of Asian religious fanatics .
This video allegedly displays old Federal Reserve Bonds , dug up from an underground stash .
You reallywatch this video , because it has a direct impact on our tale .
Sorry about the annoying music , but at least the Beethoven is nice :
At about the 1:26 mark , you 'll see a rather soiled financial instrument that looks anlot like the ones pictured in the photo taken of the Italian job .
There must be a connection .
So where did these bonds come from ?
This cache is attributed to " Queen Salvacion A. Legaspi , " who , near as I can tell , heads up a cult in the Philippines .
As you will recall , we have tentatively identified the two " Japanese " nationals as a pair of notorious high - level Filipino grifters .
And where did the Queen supposedly find all this stuff ?
I 'mto hear her tale of treasure and adventure , which I 'm sure will be very entertaining .
In a 2007 press release preserved here ( but currently missing from her web site ) , she announced that she was keeping the bonds in a secret location but was willing to give them to President Bush because they were originally issued by the United States , long , long ago .
Alas , the press release does not explain how she " found " them .
The Queen also says that there are enough $ 500 million bonds to fill up an airplane .
One comment on the YouTube page refers to these Federal Reserve Bonds asSide note :
Over the past few decades , there have indeed been many maps floating around , allegedly identifying the location of Yamishita 's gold , the legendary horde best described by someone doing an expert imitation of Sidney Greenstreet .
Author Sterling Seagrave , whom I respect , says that the stolen war loot is or was real .
Perhaps -- but that does not mean that theare real .
Many a wild goose has been stalked .
End side note ; back to our story .
My internet research has uncovered a few references to " Federal Reserve Bonds " of 1934 vintage being stashed in the Philippines .
As far as I can tell , these yarns are pure legend .
If you know differently , feel free to educate us all .
( Recall that the queen says that she has enough of these $ 500 million bonds from 1934 to fill up an airplane .
Hm .
So what was the U.S. gross national product back in 1934 ...? )
One thing 's for sure : Those Filipinos do love their buried treasure stories .
Are you curious to learn more about Queen Legaspi , possessor ( printer ? ) of the bonds ?
Looks like she 's latest incarnation of JC .
( He keeps coming back ... and back ... )
If you want to see her in action , she has a couple of silent videos up , here and here .
Lo , it is written : Translation :
She 's a toon .
But she 's a toon with money and political ambition , or so it would appear .
A toon like Moon .
Except for this one video , which was produced by a bizarre Asian religious sect , I have seen no visual evidence that Federal Reserve Bonds exist .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , in a 2005 announcement , says that Okay , now we 're getting somewhere !
The same page offers a warning about Riyadi ( a.k. a Saurin ) , the likely culprit .
And this Bloomberg story mentions that the bonds in the Italian cache supposedly date from 1934 .
( They sure look new in the photo !
The ones in the video look aged .
That sort of thing can be faked , of course . )
So not only are the bonds captured in Italy a probable hoax , the entireof a " Federal Reserve Bond " seems to be a myth .
Nevertheless , such bonds did become a topic of discussion recently , within a section of the blogosphere not normally traversed by Cannonfire readers .
On Lew Rockwell 's site , one Michael Rozeff claims that Rozeff goes on from there , and it's all pretty interesting .
But he speaks of the Federal Reserve Bond as a .
Such things do notexist -- and may never exist , since they are probably not allowed by the law which created the Federal Reserve .
So :
What are our options ?
Can we cobble together a revised theory of the Italian mystery , based on all of this additional information ?.
They used the term " Federal Reserve Bond " incorrectly ; the financial instruments are actually bearer bonds .
This theory has one big problem :
The bonds captured by the Italians look exactly like the bonds pictured in the video , and they are clearly marked " Federal Reserve Bonds . "
The bonds in the video -- which has a terribly unpersuasive provenance -- are probably fake .
Yet the Italian authorities ( according to the German article ) lean toward the theory that these bonds are not counterfeit .
Not only that :
In their first press release , the Italians said that the bonds were virtually indistinguishable from the real thing .
Maybe theresuch a creature as a Federal Reserve Bond .
It 's not just a theoretical possibility ; they 've been around for decades .
But they are traded on a very august level , far from the sight of we ordinary mortals .
Thus , there is no mention of this type of bond in Wikipedia or on any other " respectable " web site .
The Federal Reserve of New York is lying when it claims that such bonds do not exist .
Is that theory possible ?
If you say " Yes , " then perhaps you also think that space lasers destroyed the twin towers .
Our pals Wilfredo and Joseph decided to put together their own cache of fake financial instruments , probably using the same printing press which " Queen Salvacion A. Legaspi " used .
Why ?
Perhaps their intent was not to negotiate the bonds but to use them to fleece the gullible .
There are lots of ways a con artist can cause mischief if he can convince a dupe that he ( the conster ) has a lot of money .
So why did the Italians say that the bonds are indistinguishable from real ?
As noted earlier , under Italian law , the government gets - a to keep - a 40 percent - a da money -- the bonds are genuine financial instruments .
Maybe Berlusconi somehow got wind of what Wilfredo and Joe - Joe were up to -- hey , SISMI is notuseless -- and decided to turn the situation to his advantage .
Maybe he decided to put the bonds in a bank and simply credit the money to a government account .
( Berlusconi to bank officer : " These bonds are real .
You want proof ?
My pal Vito the leg - breaker will give you proof . " )
Like magic , fake money becomes genuine coin .
But is such a thing possible ?
Could Silvio Berlusconi falsely label fake bonds real , stash them in a government bank account , and then start singing the Italian version of " We 're in the money " ?
Again , it all seems highly unlikely .
Of course , Silvio's whole life has been one massive experiment in unlikelihood .
Our Randroid " friend " Pam Geller feels certain that she knows who the real culprits are : The Norks !
( That is , the North Koreans . )
She has , of course , zero evidence for this assertion .
So far , the evidence tends to point to the Filipino underworld .
But if you enjoy baseless accusations , it 's Although the Italian job has engendered a lot of blogosphere speculation , no other site known to me has put together as much of the story as you 'll see here .
( Things may be different in a few hours , of course . )
Incidentally , a Daily Cheeto diary made mention of this story .
That post , along with six comments , has now been pulled .

100 Writing Prompts Canva
101 Great Ideas to Get You Inspired
Compiled here are 101 great ideas to get you inspired and working on your next writing project .
Want to tell a story , but have no idea where to start ?
That ’s where writing prompts come in .
Think of it like training wheels or the handrails on a staircase– these are here to support you in your endeavor , so use them often , use them well , and use them widely to create the most creative pieces of writing you can !
1. Focus on a memory of a game that you played when you were a kid .
It could be chess , it could be paintball , it could even be Cowboys and Indians– anything where you really got into the game .
Start by writing about the experience itself , and then make it more real .
Suddenly you are the king , the soldier , the intrepid native out to reclaim his lands !
2 . Think of a buddy or a relative and then focus on something that always reminds you of them ( like their perfume , their sense of style , maybe something they love to do ) and then write a story that centers around that .
3 . Think of a memorable quote from a book , show or movie , remove it entirely from its original context , streamline / improve it , and then write a story around it using a completely different plot , completely different characters , and even a completely different world !
4 . Pick up an object near you and look at it .
Really study it .
Try to find some aspect of it that future generations might change or improve on it .
Now imagine that it ’s your job to market this new and improved object to the public .
What do you say ?
How do you approach the futuristic masses with this item that could go so far in making their lives better ?
5 . Choose a mythological tradition ( i.e. Norse , Judeo - Christian , Babylonian , Greek , Roman , etc. ) and look it up on Wikipedia .
Next , follow links until you track down a specific god , goddess , angel or spirit that sounds particularly interesting .
Write a story that includes this entity and incorporates elements of the mythology surrounding them in a way that preserves some of the ambiance and flavor that attracted you to him / her / it in the first place .
6 . Pick three words of things that you like or that sound good when you say them .
They could be colors , places , even names .
Now , write a story using these three words in creative ways .
( I.e. you can combine them , use them for section headings , use them as character names , etc .
The possibilities are limitless ! )
7 . Go for a walk .
While you ’re out , look for something interesting ( it could be a car , a pamphlet , an unusual rock , a chicken , etc . )
Sit and think about it for a little while , look at it and really appreciate it , then follow that thought pattern , see where it takes you , and write about it .
8 . Take a pad of paper somewhere where you can people watch ( a park , a coffee shop , a restaurant ) and write down quick notes about the people you see .
Now– make up stories about them .
What kind of life do they lead ?
What ’s important to them ?
What sorts of troubles or joys do they come home to at night ?
9 . Think about a symbol .
It can be a peace sign , a star , a cross , a flag , or anything else you ’ve seen in the past .
Consider what it means to you , really deeply think about it , then put those thoughts into words .
Next , write a story using those words .
10 .
If you have a pet , ( a cat , a dog , a snake , a chicken , etc. ) take a moment to study them .
Look at their features , their eyes– then write about them .
Next , take it all a step further and write a story where the main character is a person that has all ( or even just some ) of those features !
11 . Look through the newspaper for a particularly interesting line like “ It was a day like any other for Joe Everyman ... ”
Ponder it for a moment , bend it around in your mind and explore the possible places a line like this could go ... then write one of them .
12 . Write down the basic elements of a whodunnit murder mystery – the name of a guilty person ( i.e. Miss Scarlet , Colonel Mustard , etc. ) the object they ’ve committed the murder with ( i.e. a candlestick , etc. ) and the place where it was done .
( i.e. in the conservatory . )
Make each element as random as possible ( i.e. Bob Dole with an overfed goat in the Soyuz module ) and then write a story that ties it all together .
Feel free to make it more fun than believable !
13 . Interesting things happen when different cultures come into contact for the first time .
Sometimes contact is peaceful , and sometimes it brings disease , war , famine , or other dire concequences .
Envision two distinctly different cultures , then write a story where they meet !
14 .
Type two random and seemingly unrelated words into a google image search ( like uncle fuzz ) and look through the images that come up .
Prepare to be surprised , and if you ’re under 18 or easily offended , make sure the family filter is on .
Now , find an image that strikes you , then write a story around it .
15 . Politicians are masters of spinning sentences of ambiguous commitment that ultimately mean nothing .
Look through the speeches of one or two that have had something to hide or get excited about lately and pick apart their words .
Find a particularly vague sentence or one teeming with doublespeak and then use it as the backbone of a story .
16 .
Take a famous line from a famous piece of literature and run it through several different languages on an online translator ( like Altavista ’s Babelfish ) with Korean or Chinese as the last language , and then translate it back to English .
Look at what comes out , consider the new meanings hidden within it , and then build a story around it .
17 .
Walk through an unfamiliar aisle of the grocery store or visit an ethnic grocery ( Indian , Chinese , Mexican , etc. ) and look for a product ( or several products ) that leap out at you as either strange , neat , frightening or wonderful .
Now , use that image as the key motivator or focus for a story .
Maybe people are passing the product back and forth while they talk .
Experiment , try new things !
18 . Write a story where a character is faced with a decision that is very difficult for him or her to make .
This is no ordinary decision– it ’s hard to make , and it needs to be made soon .
The stakes should be high ( or maybe just need to seem high to the character ) and you can even go so far as action if you want .
Whatever happens , more focus on the tension of the decision than on something else ( like people ’s looks or action - packed shoot - em - up scenes . )
19 . People act differently on camera .
Write a story from the perspective of someone watching a film where another person reveals a secret that is shocking or frightening .
Try to capture the mood of being afraid or angry or reluctant to put the secret into words , make the character in the video real , make them believable .
20 . Relationships are full of games , especially when the people in them are young or the connections that have been forged are superficial .
Write a story where relationship games are being played between the two people who make up an otherwise loving couple .
Put in action , make it real , scream and smash some things .
Make it exciting , and let the ending determine on its own where it will go .
21 . Take a classic tale from any period ( from the Odyssey to Ivanhoe or anything Dickens to anything Spielberg or Romero ) and turn it on its head by thoroughly integrating some new element into it ( as done in works like Pride and Predjudice and Zombies )
22 . You ’re on your way to a perfectly ordinary day at work when suddenly a sign looms up before you that says “ Road Closed . ”
You ’re forced to take an unmarked detour down an unfamiliar road that seems unusually devoid of traffic .
Is it an ordinary short cut , or is something more ominous going on ?
What awaits you around the next corner ?
Will the pavement suddenly and inexplicably end ?
Have you crossed into the proverbial twilight zone ?
23 . Write a piece where physical “ imperfection (s ) ” in a body or an object ultimately add to its beauty as opposed to making it merely “ less than perfect ” , and therefore “ less than beautiful . ”
Consider the patina of age or the ancient chipping of a Grecian urn , for example , or the beauty of a more “ average ” woman compared to the “ perfection ” of an over - the - top supermodel .
There are a lot of ways you could go with this , both creative and sentimental .
24 . Create a story filled with unexpected , unsettling and unexpected twists that still ultimately seem logical and / or realistic while being incredibly jarring .
( Maybe a man accidentally takes as hostage the one person who could easily disarm him , or maybe a typical , cliché event [ man slips on a banana peel ] ends on a different note [ man keeps his balance and uses momentum and slipperiness of peel to get to work on time . ] )
Be creative !
25 . Close your eyes and take a moment to focus on the sounds around you .
Listen to them , shuffle them around in your memory and use them as key points with which to drive a story forward .
What are the sounds of ?
What do they remind you of ?
Anything from your childhood ?
26 . I once had a Spanish teacher whose mother thought that the main reason why America is such a big player in the world today is because every time you leave the freeway , you see a sign that says “ exit ” .
( you see , exito means “ success ! ” in Spanish ) and she assumed that , ( as many Americans seem to ) the only difference between Exit and Exito was that Spanish seems to add an “ o ” to the end of a lot of words that either came from English originally , or that we stole wholesale from Spanish and other Latinate tongues over the centuries .
Write a story where a mistaken translation creates an erroneous assumption ( or judgement ) that has either comedic , dangerous , or otherwise interesting consequences .
27 .
Take a song you ’re really into , listen to it , then incorporate elements , concepts or themes from it into a story .
If it ’s an instrumental piece , think about how it makes you feel , what it reminds you of , and then create a story that uses those images and impressions as part of its most key aspects .
28 . Take a hike .
Literally .
Keep an eye out for a particular place ( like a clearing , a meadow , a thicket , a glade ) any place that inspires you .
Once you find a good spot , sit down and imagine a scene that might have taken place there .
It could be a romantic one , an argument , a scene from some world of high fantasy , a murder or anything else .
Next :
Put pen to paper and write !
29 .
Everyone has their taboos , phobias and things that disgust them .
By playing off these concepts , some of the most terrifying horror is created .
Think about what frightens you most , then create a story which incorporates and confronts those elements .
If you ’re claustrophobic , write about an unlucky someone trapped in the narrow darkness of a cave , alone , unable to escape the stifling pressure of the deep earth no matter how hard he or she tries , etc .
30 .
If there is one constant in the universe , it is change .
Think of a profound change or transformation that has occurred in your own life , then use it as the central theme for a piece more fiction and fantastic than fact .
Be creative , and feel free to twist the change or transformation until it is wholly unrecognizable from the event that inspired it .
31 . Consider a process of ordinary living that goes unseen by most people ( like what happens to a letter when it ’s between mailboxes , or how meat gets from the cow to the plastic box of the microwave dinner , ) and make it fantastic !
Maybe the postman puts the letter into an interdimensional pocket on his coat where it falls down a rabbit hole and lands in a heap of similar envelopes waiting to be sorted by spirits or to be carefully considered by a special ops detachment of Santa ’s Elves .
( The CEA : Central Elf Agency )
32 . Secrecy is just another form of government regulation .
Consider something unusual that the government might feel should be kept secret , ( you can use the previous prompt for ideas ) and then draw up a plan designed to keep it secret , including ways to “ clean up ” any security leaks which might eventually and inevitably occur .
Now , imagine that it is your job to blow the lid on this secret– pen your story , regardless of whether it ends in revelation and triumph or defeat and tighter security measures .
33 .
You ’re driving , and BAM !
you see an unusual animal out of the corner of your eye , just standing there improbably on the side of the road .
What is it ?
How did it get there ?
What happens next ?
You ’re the driver , you decide .
34 .
Take a place , any place at all – it could be the town or city where you live , the house where you grew up , or someplace entirely different , and then imagine what it will be like 25 years from now .
Now try to imagine it at 50 years distant .
Now try 150 , or even 500 !
Pick one of these future times , then set a story there .
What is going amid this future backdrop ?
Is there love ?
Spaceships ?
Are people arguing ?
Has there been a catastrophe , or just a period of steady growth ?
What ’s left of the place that you remember ?
35 .
Take the basic concept for a genre or a subgenre ( like Science Fiction , Fantasy , Historical Fiction or even Cyberpunk ) and recast it through the eyes of an entirely different culture .
( Think sword and sorcery gone Kalahari Bushmen or Ancient China ’s take on Steampunk , for example . )
If you need ideas , check out George Alec Effinger ’s “ When Gravity Fails ” , a book which expertly mixes the rich culture of the Islamic Middle East with the gritty , post - modern flavors of Cyberpunk .
36 . During the course of what would otherwise be a normal , ordinary day , you notice that someone you consider it your duty to watch out for has a tiny bag of strange powder that they ’re trying to hide– but they are n’t doing a very good job of it .
Do you confront them ?
Do you watch them from a distance ?
What ’s in the bag ?
A chemical ?
A drug ?
Fairy dust ?
What ’s the backstory here ?
How does your tale resolve itself ?
37 .
A man sits in a parking lot in a strange car that is so different from the norm that you ca n’t help but notice it .
What ’s his story ?
Describe the car .
What does it look like ?
Where has it been ?
Does the car itself frighten you , disturb you– or does it make you happy ?
If you were to go out and talk to the man in the car , what would he say ?
What would you learn ?
38 . Write a story in which the characters , the places , the products , the clothing brands and everything else take the names of people you know .
Throw in references to say , the “ Smith Café , ” or the “ Anderson N - 30 Sport Bike , ” etc .
Use the attributes of the people whose names you are using in order to drive the story forward as well as to set the tone for the environment in which it all takes place , the plot , etc .
39 .
Write a story about a character that blatantly defies conventions , ( like a kindly old elderly woman who wears a bonnet , powders her face , goes to church every Sunday – but also loves videogames , or a baby who travels through time and fixes the problems of the future or past , or a mild - mannered pastor who whips his congregation up by summoning demons or awakening hordes of the undead , ) and then take a trip through that character ’s life .
Is his or her unconventional nature ultimately something that will prove to be the instrument of his or her downfall , or is this unconventional person merely awesome ?

Write a poem where most , if not all of the words used begin with the same letter ( Percy ’s purple plastic purse portrays people peeling poofy pomegranates patiently ) and then explain how this might be possible .
Make it real , expand it , describe the scene ( in normal prose ) of people patiently peeling poofy pomegranates , and then build a story around it .
41 . Think about something that really bugs you , something in your life that irritates or frustrates you to no end .
Now , put words to that frustration , explore it , let yourself go off and rant on it , and then express your tirade in ink .
Finally , formalize it ( as an essay or an article ) or put it in the mouth of a character who has the same ( or a similar ) problem .
42 . Create a new holiday , one with a long , traditional background ( either on Earth or somewhere else entirely ! )
And use it as the backdrop for a story .
Detail it , give it festivals , parties , taboos , requirements , wakes , etc .
Flush them out and make them real , then merge it all into the plot of a story .
Use it to set the mood , to accentuate points , events , and even the climax .
Make it the metaphor for the tale you ’ve woven into it .
43 .
Write a story where two people are thinking about each other without being anywhere near each other .
Consider two lovers , or maybe two people who ’ve just gone home after their first date , or even two friends with some point of contention between them , any of whom are having their own silent conversations in their minds .
The thoughts could be dramatic , even misguided — the characters could make assumptions , judgments that could come quick and furious like the words of an argument — because that ’s exactly what you ’re going for .
Now take these two lines of internal conversation and interlace them so that it ’s almost as if the two people were talking or arguing all along .
44 . Create a story where all the characters feature objectified names .
Consider the relationship that could spring up between Left and Right , between Red and Tall , between Green and Cube .
Consider how these relationships could interrelate : Is Green stalking Tall ?
Is Cube cheating on Right with Red ?
Remembering to keep things abstract .
Put pen to paper and see where a few objectified names can take you !
45 . Consider for a moment a particle , a wave , an atom , a photon , or a neutron , and then consider what it might be like to be that thing if it were consciously aware of what was going on around it .
Consider the human implications of all matter being compressed into a single one - dimensional point right before the big bang that flung everything out and created the universe ( as if there were human thought , as if you were occupying the point along with countless others ) and then take it a step further .
Look for places in science and theory that seem alien and cold to you , places where no rational mind could logically project a human consciousness , and then go into it and play around with it .
Become a quark for a day and discuss how irritating the subatomic bonds that hold you to your brothers are , or marvel in the long trip a photon takes toward Earth , only to miss it just barely and be sent on into the depths of space .
46 . Write a modern story in such a way that it feels like Science Fiction– but is n’t .
Go heavy with the technology and the explanations of proven theory that in an earlier decade might have been classified as Science Fiction .
Talk about things is odd detail , like how the wireless transmitter in someone ’s iPhone links up with distant towers of silicon and steel to connect him to a massive unseen network of information people refer to as “ The Internet . ” or explore the technobabble of computer engineers , create a crisis of the network that echoes elements of Scotty in Engineering going “ She ’s not going to hold together much longer , Captain !
She ’s gonna blow ! ”
47 .
Take something in the society around you that makes you uncomfortable or disgusted ( like beauty contests , drag queens , McDonalds , pot smokers or American Idol ) and write a story that casts it in a good light .
Do it honestly , really try .
It can be a story of redemption , of inspiration and strength that either leads the character out of the disturbing thing or further into it , depending on which way you want to go .
( Like a drag queen who starts small but manages to transcend so many boundaries , so many stigmas and so much adversity that he wins some massive televised event and is recognized all over the world as someone incredible , someone who has fought hard and won through in spite of everything the world has thrown in his path to try to trip him up . )
48 . Write a story where two things that are normally seen as total opposites ( like love and garbage ) become metaphors for one another .
Be creative about it .
It can be anything– poverty and affluence , etc .
49 .
Take some time to check out some of the “ outer circle ” dialects of English in the world today and use their examples to create characters who speak these ( or similar ) unusual dialects .
Now , throw them into an unusual situation .
You can create a world where everybody in the upper class talks one dialect and everyone in the lower talks another , ( this actually happens in some countries ) or even throw three different dialect speakers into the same room and see where it goes , considering what words mean different things ( or nothing at all ) to people who speak a variation of English that comes from another side of the globe entirely .
50 .
Take something mundane that you have to do regularly and according to a certain schedule ( like going to school or work ) and make it fantastic .
Instead of walking across campus to sit in a musty classroom that smells like old banana pancakes to listen to lectures from a bespectacled professor with a comb - over who shakes and drools as he talks ( and probably farts dust when he ’s alone in his equally musty office ) , fly across campus in a biomimetic thrust pack , grind the asphalt with plates of steel and nanoregenerative shielding and slide across scarred linoleum into a hangar bay where a cute technician in a skin - tight jumpsuit ( who just happens to have a thing for you ) stands waiting to teach you how to pilot the latest in uberdestructive mecha .
51 . Create an end of the world , apocalyptic scenario , then invent a technology ( or other creative means ) with which a fraction of humanity can be saved from it .
Now project the setting of your story several centuries ( or more ) into the future from there .
How has the presence of this technology or means of survival affected the lives of the people living in that time ?
What are the new “ big problems ” and larger changes in the structure , mythology , and general way of life of the survivors ?
What is it like to live in this time ?
What are the little things of life ?
The common problems ?
( If you ’re strapped for ideas , consider the “ traction cities ” of Phillip Reeve ’s “ Mortal Engines ” or the “ Vaults ” of the Fallout series . )
52 . Visit an unfamiliar place ( like a coffee shop in a different town ) and sit around “ people watching ” .
Work on setting a scene in that place , describe the features that make it unique .
Feel free to draw from existing features , people and even individual conversations as you work .
53 .
Study an existing illness ( or create a new one ) that may or may not be fatal .
Now , pen the story of a person who has contracted that illness .
What kind of symptoms does that person suffer as the disease progresses ?
What does it feel like ?
Taste like ?
Smell like ?
Make the reader feel the experience exactly as the victim would .
Use fear and more familiar sensations of illness to maximum effect .
54 .
Take a moment from your past where you feel that you made the wrong decision and in doing so altered the course of your life in a way that you ’re not entirely happy with .
Now , imagine you have the chance to fix it , to go back and talk to or trick your past self into making the right decision .
How do you go about it ?
What do you say or do ?
Does it work ?
How does your present ( then future ) change as a result ?
55 .
The lone wolf is a key character type that recurs in some form or another in every genre of fiction that has ever been printed or penned ( even romance , though the loner might get snared eventually . )
Create a piece of fiction that incorporates just such a character , either as the main driving force of the story , or as a character who interacts directly with the main character and in enough of a way that we ca n’t help but watch him / her and be interested .
56 . Write a song , revise it , even go so far as to put it to music if you feel so inclined !
Make it real , imagine how it would sound performed live , and then build a story around that song .
Make it the most central metaphor for the story , the very crux upon which the entire piece rotates .
57 .
Step outside your bounds .
Think about something that you tell yourself you “ ca n’t write ” or “ suck at ” and force yourself to write it .
If you get stuck , study stories that follow the same idea , pick them apart and try to figure out what their authors are doing , how they ’re able to write what you think you cannot .
Remember– no matter what you might think , you can write anything .
It just takes time , effort , and practice .
58 . Create your own mythos — H.P. Lovecraft did it with Cthulhu and the elder gods , and others have done it since ( like Alan Campbell and the mythos of Ulcis and Labyrinths that rises out of the novel “ Scar Night ” or the Faith of Yevon from Final Fantasy X. )
Write the stories that tie the gods , goddesses and other aspects of divinity and faith together for an entire people , then make a series of short stories ( or even just one , like a creation story ) out of them , almost as if you were the chief historian or head theologian dedicated to the preservation of all knowledge associated with this interesting and unique faith .
59 .
Languages are constantly changing .
Going back a thousand years , even English becomes virtually unrecognizable to people who speak the modern tongue as their first language .
( Take a look at the original work done by Chaucer or the original Anglo Saxon Chronicles if you really want to see what I mean )
Take a look at some of the most recent changes that have taken place in the language ( or in any given pidgin or creole ) and then exaggerate and project them into the future .
Create a tongue that might be spoken in the next hundred , several hundred , or even one thousand years .
Get creative : introduce new mannerisms , new expressions , concepts , words , and even grammatical rules that reflect where the language has gone in the intervening time .
What kind of impact would space - faring frontiersmen have on the language ?
Alien contact ?
Exposure to humans from other universes ?
Other realities ?
Now , write a story either told in that language , or featuring someone who speaks that way .
( If you need ideas , consider the difference in the English spoken by the characters in Joss Whedon ’s Firefly , or the differences and variation between forms of Stripjap as illustrated in Richard K. Morgan ’s novel Woken Furies .
60 .
Take a historical figure like Einstein or Gengis Khan ( or even a group of historical figures ) and put that figure ( or them ) in an unfamiliar environment .
It could be your present , the future , the distant past , or another planet / universe altogether .
How would Winston Churchill and Joan of Arc react if they were both suddenly abducted by the same trans - dimensional alien ship and then put in close proximity ?
Pol Pot and Gandhi ?
You can also consider where people who have disappeared have gone .
What really happened to Amelia Earhart ?
Jimmy Hoffa ?
Does it involve a ‘ 37 chevy floating inexplicably in a distant corner of the galaxy ?
61 . Create a setting where everything seems perfect and way beyond the best expectations ... until the characters of your story begin to dig beneath the surface .
Soon , everything turns out to be little more than a facade– Luxury gives way to mold and disease , opulence gives way to cheap corner - cutting , and what was originally seen as something incredible and perfect is quickly exposed for what it really is .
62 . Consider for a moment what it would be like to be directly involved in analyzing a situation or a threat to a population ( of humans , bacteria , or other forms of plant or animal life ) and addressing a solution of alternative action that could either be a fix ( however temporary or permanent ) or a preventative measure .
Put yourself in the shoes of a professional scientist who considers it to be her or his duty to look at and handle this burgeoning situation– then write your groundbreaking report .
If you ’re stuck for ideas , create a new disease or “ Chronic defect ” and then approach it from the observational and detached position of a researcher who is trying to nail down and outline the facts .
63 .
People in today ’s world have all kinds of strange allergies .
Just right now , I can think of three such people , one allergic to red dye # 5 , one allergic to chlorinated water ( as in pools ) and one who ’s allergic to cucumbers ( even in the form of pickles . )
Using an existing ( but bizarre ) allergy ( or by creating and using a new one ) write a story about someone who suffers from it , how it effects their life , and how they ultimately overcome it to live a happier ( or at least more interesting ) life .
64 . Television rules the nation .
Write a story where the mainstream media ’s domination over the common man is emphasized , where the average populace blurs together into an idiotic mass , and only a few people are truly aloof and free .
What makes them different ( besides not watching TV ? )
How do they view the hypnotized masses ?
As tools ?
Idiots ?
Souls to be pitied ?
Are they interested in change ?
What will they do to insure it happens ( or to keep it from happening ? )
65 .
Some series that have appeared since the advent of entertainment as a medium have become iconic , thoroughly integrating themselves into our society in a way that makes them unforgettable and subject to a massive fan base or to instant recognition ( like Sherlock Holmes or Star Wars ) .
What is it that makes them so iconic , so popular ?
What is it that they have and so much else seems to so painfully lack ?
Try to capture that something ( or at least a piece of it ) and instill it into a story of your own invention .
66 . Write a “ Chop - Saki . ”
Think about every Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee film you ’ve ever seen , every late night kung - fu flick you ’ve ever sat and watched without reaching for the remote and changing the channel .
Now , put that knowledge to work !
Craft something wholly new , something exciting – something that ’s only cheesy if you want it to be .
67 .
The idea of being invaded by a hostile force of any kind is a terrifying one .
Write a story where an invasion ( either real , fantastic or futuristic , etc. ) is imminent , and the invading force is superior in both equipment , tactics , and / or raw bodily strength .
How do you prepare to meet this invasion ?
Will you defend yourself ?
If so , then with what ?
However far your ingenuity takes you , will it be enough to turn the tide , or will you and your compatriots fall before your foe (s ) anyway ?
68 . A lot of college humor in the last few decades has focused on the comedic way that binge drinking tends to erase all of the memories of the night before and leave a person holding their head , wondering where they left their pants– and their dignity .
Write a story where this is the case , but provide a way for the character ( or at least the reader ) to track back through the night of debauchery until the true list of the previous night ’s events is finally laid bare .
69 . Experiment with poetry and form .
Try something new , write whatever comes to mind , then play with it until it all fits together .
If you ’re strapped for ideas , try a Sestina form , a Fibonacci Sequence or a 26 line poem with lines that all begin with a letter of the alphabet , in proper order .
70 .
Resisting any impulses you may have of seeing it as disturbing or morbid , visit a graveyard and check out the grave markers and headstones until you find one that catches you .
Write a story about that person ’s life , what it might have been like , the kind of things they might have had to deal with , the people , places and things they loved or held dear .
71 . We as humans tend to use a very small percentage of our brains .
Write a story where a psychic or a scientist discovers a way to “ use ” the brain to perform one particular ( or more than one ) feat that could be classified as superhuman ( like flying , teleporting , telekinesis , transformation into another form , etc . )
Does this pioneer choose to share this new technique , or instead try to hide it and keep it from being discovered by the general public ?
If it becomes common knowledge ( and common practice ) , then how does it affect the workings of the world ?
The economy ?
Warfare ?
72 . Go somewhere that there are people , but not too many people ( like a coffee shop , a classroom , an airport terminal , an airplane , a business meeting , etc. ) and then imagine that you ( and the people around you ) are suddenly the only people left on Earth .
How does the story unfold ?
Do you all survive ?
Does someone die ?
What happens to this last , tiny fragment of the human race ?
Are there , by some freak miracle , others in similar situations lost in distant corners of the globe ?
73 . Craft a speech .
It could be a future politician ’s rallying cry , the war plans of a freedom fighter operating out of the underground , or the lost words of some hero ( or villain ) from the past .
Make it real , make it crisp , make it strong and full of power augmented by whatever emotion the “ speaker ” is trying to convey , whether it be anger , pride , or a solemn sadness .
74 .
Write a story about a place that comes into existence only once every hundred years or on some other rare basis , presenting itself as mythical and meaningful whenever it appears .
It could be a restaurant , an island , a bar , an outhouse , or anything else .
The person ( or people ) that encounter it can be oblivious tourists totally unaware of the majesty of it all , someone actively hunting for this mythical place , or anything in between .
Make the place unique , give it character , make it stand out .
75 . Write a high seas , swashbuckling adventure .
Consider all the pirate movies you ’ve ever watched , all the films where sailing ships and rapiers figure prominently , and then write your own pirate legend !
Do n’t just limit your imagination to Pirates of the Carribean– think about Yellowbeard , Baron Munchausen , Gulliver ’s Travels , or even Treasure Island .
76 .
Try writing something interactive , an adventure in a story or a book that pulls the reader in and forces them to act in order to keep the story going .
You might even try writing an adventure for RPG use .
Whatever it is , make sure that there are plenty of options for the player (s ) , and leave the ending up to the reader ’s choice ( and skill ) to determine .
77 .
Write about someone in your family , someone different , unique , and distinctive .
Cast them in a story , whether fiction or non-fiction , and write it in such a way that it reveals , emphasizes and casts a beautiful light on who they truly are .
78 .
Pick a social issue that bugs you to no end and then blow it all out of proportion in a way that is comedic and not wholly improbable as a possible vision of the future .
( If you ’re strapped for ideas , consider the way films like Brazil and Idiocracy approach myriad social issues in a bizarre and ultimately comedic way .
79 .
Create a new career and then write about it .
It ’s a given in any society that , as new technologies and new needs appear , new people will be trained to work with or repair each new technology and satisfy those new needs .
You can write it from a first - person , worker ’s perspective , or even from the perspective of a pitch .
It ’s your story .
Make it what you want it to be .
80 . Write an Indiana Jones - type of thriller , something with a race to get to some ancient object of mystery and power .
It can take place in any time period , any setting , any world , but the central idea should center around the action - packed recovery of an object of potentially great importance , either historic , monetary , or even military .
81 . When we look at the historical record , things tend to get a little sparse and iffy between the period when humans first became fully modern ( about 150,000 years ago ) and when what we currently see as the first civilizations ( Sumeria , etc. ) popped up about 8 - 10,000 years ago .
Sure , we have the paintings of Lascaux and Pont d’Arc in France ( 30 - 40,000 years ago ) but what happened in all the years that happened in between ?
Write a story that addresses this , that takes place in ( or relates to ) something now lost in these grand gulfs of ancient history .
After all , it ’s only been 2,000 years from Christ to Cellphones– did our fully modern ancestors really just sit around for 100,000 years doing nothing but picking berries and chipping rocks ?
82 . Think about a season and all that is stereotypical about it .
( For winter , think ice and snow , bitter cold , etc. )
Now , imagine a world where that season is the only season .
How is life affected ?
It does n't have to be wholly realistic — it can be fantastic !
Make that world the setting for your story .
83 .
Write a story that incorporates ideas or things that seem fantastically outside the norm of reality ( like trees of glass and crystal that live and grow , or men and women that exist in a state of pure plasma . )
What is life like in this new reality ?
What is different ?
What is the same ?
Be creative , and feel free to let your mind go places it would normally fear to tread .
84 . Create a story , and do it like knitting together sections of a quilt .
Create each section individually , each piece strong , independent and complete , then “ stitch ” them all together to create one cohesive whole .
85 . Write a story ( though it could take the form of a mock interview or anything else ) where the main character ( even if [ especially if ! ] it ’s the narrator ) is clearly under the influence of some kind of drug .
It could be a hallucinogen , sodium pentothal ( truth serum ) , some illegal substance , or even just a heavy dose of something prescribed by a doctor , but get creative with it .
Cast the light on its effects , how it feels to be under its influence , and describe what the character sees that ’s different or is n’t there ( if anything . )
86 . In contrast ( or perhaps in comparison ) write a story where the main character is at the mercy of some kind of multiple personality disorder .
He / she could be like a collective of souls , the victim of a botched possession , a simple psychotic , or anything else you can think of .
Get creative .
87 . Write a story where a dark secret in a character ’s past comes back to haunt them .
It could be anything from the blatant closet skeleton of a murder to something much more subtle and much more on the direct , everyday , human level .
Whatever it is , make it real enough ( no matter how fantastic it is ) that the reader really feels it , really understands the haunting nature of it .
88 . While the roof - tile thrown by an old - lady did n’t kill the once - famous conqueror Pyrrhus exactly , the impact of this clay projectile was enough to stun him and give a local soldier a chance to shank him .
Write a story where the main hero ( or villain ) triumphs wildly over his or her foes , only to be taken out utterly by the most unexpected and unlikely of occurrences .
( Like a bee sting or a pickle - farmer ’s crackshot cucumber throw . )
89 .
Write a story that explains what happens when we die , but take an alternative path with it .
Instead of writing about the valley of eternal spring or the pearly gates , write about something totally unexpected , something that would make the reader look twice .
Maybe the afterlife is something glamourous like a realm of pure light and pleasure , and maybe it ’s something far more down to earth , gritty and not at all like the heaven painted in the minds of most of the western Christian world .
90 .
Create a character who embodies one of the classic seven deadly sins ( Greed , gluttony , lust , etc. ) and then write a story where they ultimately meet their demise at the hands of that which they so heavily indulge in .
Do n’t go all overboard biblical with it– make the allusions to the cardinal sin more subtle , almost subconscious , and play around with it .
91 .
Write a story that describes its imagery using terms specific to some other form of art ( i.e. describe it as you would describe a painting . )
Point out and talk about brush strokes , the way colors blend into one another , etc .
Describe people in terms of instruments , tools , methods , strokes or even musical notes– make the effect pervasive , all - encompassing , constant .
92 . Look at the ceiling where you are .
Truly consider it , study it , and then think about what it would be like if it was suddenly your floor , if suddenly your own personal gravity ( and nothing else ’s ) were reversed !
What would life be like on the ceiling ?
Would you have tea parties ?
Panic uncontrollably ?
Contemplate mantras of zen Buddhism ?
How would this sudden change in gravity effect your personal life ?
93 .
Write a story where love is created and maintained over a distance .
The length and nature of that distance is up to you .
It could be the distance between two continents , two cities , or even just between two windows or the rooftops of two neighboring buildings .
What lies between , physically and metaphorically ?
What are the barriers that must be overcome ?
Are they overcome ?
How ?
94 .
Some of the most provocative , interesting , disturbing , and downright experimental works out there take a very different and very interesting look at sex .
Try writing a story that approaches sex in a way the reader would not expect , but that still retains interest .
You can do it by allusion , teasing , putting other words in , leading the reader to a wholly different situation altogether than they were expecting to be led to , by yanking the viewer away at the last second , or anything else creative you can think of .
95 .
Think of the most beautiful and / or interesting place you ’ve ever been to and then set a story there .
It does n’t have to be the exact place ( i.e. Tahoe , Vegas , Yellowstone , etc. ) it can be a place that only exists in your mind , or even a place you ’ve only seen before in pictures .
Be creative , feel free to set any scene there , and remember — the only limits are the limits you impose on your own creativity .
96 . Revisit the atrocities of the past in a story .
You can either write it as a historical fiction ( i.e. something that happens in the period in which the atrocity was practiced – like slavery , etc. ) or as something that ’s happening in a different form ( with obvious corollaries ) today , or in a future setting .
97 .
Poke fun at a current social or political issue by taking the opposite stance from what you feel and using that side ’s own wit ( or lack thereof ) and “ evidence ” to undermine the position utterly .
Many authors , including Johnathan Swift and Alexander Pope , have taken this same approach in many of their most famous works .
It ’s effective , it ’s funny , and it makes a great way to get your point across while also cross examining the validity of the views your own ego holds so dear .
98 .
Try writing in a situation or mindset in which you would never normally write because you feel like too much of what you write would be garbage ( i.e. when you ’re really tired , when you ’re drunk , etc . )
Do n’t just write a little , write a lot .
Then , put it aside for about a week .
Forget about it .
Once the week has passed , pick it up again and look through it for nuggets of wisdom to use in your next story .
You ’ll be surprised what you ’ll find !
99 .
Write a medical triage scene .
It can take place anywhere , at any point in the history or past ( to the thundering of civil war muskets , under the suppressive blasts of photon cannons , or in the ER of modern - day Detroit , etc . )
Make the action everpresent , put the feeling of running and rushing into the story , and try to capture the way that everything is frantically performed while still being powerful , exact and professional .
Or , conversely , write about off - hour and try to capture the tense and lazy boredom experienced by people who know that at any minute , a dozen ambulances could cram into their doorways with payloads of patients in critical condition .
100 .
Write a story that you are several times removed from .
Write a tale of an author , who ’s writing a tale about an author , who is also writing a tale about an author .
The challenge ?
Making it comprehensible , interesting , and just the right amount of complex to grab your reader and keep them reading .
101 . Write your own writing prompt(s ) .
Take the broken and basic ideas that come to you during the course of any given day and put them on paper as instructions for others ( or yourself – at a later date ) to follow .
Be creative !
Try new things , and urge others to do the same !

Deputy who drove into cyclists is demoted
A Santa Clara County sheriff 's deputy who struck and killed two bicyclists last year when his cruiser crossed the center line has been demoted to an unsworn , civilian position that bars him from driving a patrol car or carrying a gun , his attorney said today .
James Council , 28 , is expected to be sentenced June 25 to four months in county jail after pleading guilty last month to two misdemeanor counts of vehicular manslaughter in the deaths of Matt Peterson , 29 , of San Francisco and Kristy Gough , 30 , of San Leandro .
Sheriff Laurie Smith made the decision to demote Council , said his attorney , Michael Rains .
" Given the nature of the plea and what it involves , I think the demotion is fair , " Rains said .
He said Council hopes to apply for a deputy 's position at some point in the future .
The sheriff 's office declined to comment on what it called a personnel matter .
Council will be eligible to serve the expected jail term in a sheriff 's furlough program or in home detention , authorities said .
He will also be required to perform 800 hours of community service .
The crash happened March 9 , 2008 , when Council 's cruiser crossed the center line on Stevens Canyon Road in Cupertino and struck three cyclists .
Peterson died at the scene , and Gough died a short time later at a hospital .
The third bicyclist , Christopher Knapp of Germany , was badly injured but survived .
Witnesses later said there were no skid marks and that the deputy had reported falling asleep at the wheel .
Council , who had been with the department for 18 months , was 4 1/ 2 hours into a 12 - hour shift at the time of the Sunday morning crash after working a 12 1/2 - hour shift the day before .
Gough 's father , Rip Gough , said of Council 's demotion , " On the surface , this would appear to be a long overdue adjustment .
...
There is no solace in any of this , but when two people lose their lives , we owe it to them and we owe it to the community to ask questions and not permit anyone to sweep this under a rug . "
Back pain can often be the result of very tight gluteal muscles .
So we all need to stretch our hips .
This is true for athletic people and for those who are sedentary .
Here are two variations of stretches that will help you develop more flexibility in your outer hip muscles .
-- Karen Voight
1 Stand arms ’ length away from a sturdy chair .
Facing the back of the chair , balance on your left leg as you bend your right knee and place your right ankle across your left thigh ( just above the knee ) .
Reach forward and rest your hands on the top of the chair .
Maintaining a straight back , hinge forward at the hips and bend your left knee .
Sit your hips back until you feel a deep stretch in your right outer hip .
Hold for 3 breaths .
Continue on to the next variation to intensify the stretch , or release your leg and repeat on the other side .
2 Move your hands down to the seat of the chair and bend your left knee a little deeper .
Keep pressing your right knee away from your chest as you bring your chest closer to the right shin bone .
Be sure your neck is in a neutral position and in line with your spine .
Hold for three breaths , slowly raise your upper body , move your hands to the top of the chair again and release the right leg down .
Repeat on the other side .

Your testbed has to have the same volume of data as on production otherwise you are not really testing anything .
This blogpost is kind of a rant after I noticed this post on Stackoverflow
I do not believe there is a problem with the create trigger statement itself .
The create trigger statement was successful and quick in a test environment , and the trigger works correctly when rows are inserted / updated to the table .
Although when I created the trigger on the test database there was no load on the table and it had considerably less rows , which is different than on the live / production database ( 100 vs. 13,000,000 + ) .
Now how on earth can you expect anything to behave the same when you compare 100 rows against 13 million ?
This is one of the fundamental flaws when people design a database , move it to production and then find out that it blows up / breaks down / is unusable on production
The worst case I have seen was when someone designed a table with a CompanyName column which was CHAR ( 5000 ) .
Yes you read that right CHAR ( 5000 ) nor VARCHAR ( 5000 ) .
On ‘ staging ’ it was all fine with 50 rows or so .
They moved this to production loaded it up with 100000 rows and it was slow as hell .
What can you expect when you have only one row per page ….. this was just terrible .
I understand that not every shop has the money to store terabytes of data but guess what ?
You can buy a USB TB hard drive for about $ 100 .
Plug in 5 of those and test with volume otherwise you will suffer later .
Now let ’s look at some code to see what the difference is
First create these two tables
create table TestSmall ( id int identity not null , Somevalue char( 108 ) , SomeValue2 uniqueidentifier ) go create table TestBig ( id int identity not null , Somevalue char( 108 ) , SomeValue2 uniqueidentifier ) go
We will populate the small table with 256 rows and the big one with 65536 rows
-- 256 rows insert TestSmall select convert( varchar ( 36 ) , newid ( ) ) + convert ( varchar ( 36 ) , newid ( ) ) + convert ( varchar ( 36 ) , newid ( ) ) , newid ( ) from master .. spt_values t1 where t1.type = ' p ' and t1.number < 256 go -- 65536 rows insert TestBig select convert( varchar ( 36 ) , newid ( ) ) + convert ( varchar ( 36 ) , newid ( ) ) + convert ( varchar ( 36 ) , newid ( ) ) , newid ( ) from master .. spt_values t1 outer apply master .. spt_values t2 where t1.type = ' p ' and t1.number < 256 and t2.type = ' p ' and t2.number < 256 go
Now we will create a clustered index on each table
create clustered index ix_somevalue_small on TestSmall( Somevalue ) go create clustered index ix_somevalue_big on TestBig( Somevalue ) go
Time to run some code
First we have to turn on statistics for time
set statistics io on
Now run these queries
select * from TestSmall where Somevalue like ' 2 % ' select * from TestBig where Somevalue like ' 2 % '
Table ‘ TestSmall ’ .
Scan count 1 , logical reads 2 , physical reads 0
Table ‘ TestBig ’ .
Scan count 1 , logical reads 74 , physical reads 0
As you can see the reads are much higher for the TestBig table , this is of course not surprising since the TestBig has a lot more rows
What will happen if we write a non sargable query by using a function in the WHERE clause ?
select * from TestSmall where left ( Somevalue , 1 ) = ' 2 ' select * from TestBig where left ( Somevalue , 1 ) = ' 2 '
Table ‘ TestSmall ’ .
Scan count 1 , logical reads 7 , physical reads 0
Table ‘ TestBig ’ .
Scan count 1 , logical reads 1132 , physical reads 0
Okay , so the smaller table had 3.5 times more reads while the bigger table had 15 times more reads .
Just imagine what would happen if the bigger table was even bigger ?
Time to turn of the statistics for IO
set statistics io off
Now we will look at statistics for time , you can do that by running the following command
set statistics time on
Let ’s run the same queries again
select * from TestSmall where Somevalue like ' 2 % ' select * from TestBig where Somevalue like ' 2 % '
SQL Server Execution Times :
CPU time = 0 ms , elapsed time = 0 ms .
SQL Server Execution Times :
CPU time = 15 ms , elapsed time = 97 ms .
As you can see the numbers are much better for the smaller table
When we do the non sargable queries the numbers do n’t increase for the smaller table but they do for the bigger table
select * from TestSmall where left ( Somevalue , 1 ) = ' 2 ' select * from TestBig where left ( Somevalue , 1 ) = ' 2 '
SQL Server Execution Times :
CPU time = 0 ms , elapsed time = 0 ms .
SQL Server Execution Times :
CPU time = 31 ms , elapsed time = 132 ms .
Since data might be cached and you would like to start fresh every time you can execute the following command to clear the cache
dbcc freeproccache dbcc dropcleanbuffers
Finally I will leave you with execution plan pics
Sargable Query
select * from TestSmall where Somevalue like ' 2 % ' select * from TestBig where Somevalue like ' 2 % '
Non Sargable Query
select * from TestSmall where left ( Somevalue , 1 ) = ' 2 ' select * from TestBig where left ( Somevalue , 1 ) = ' 2 '

ST . PAUL , Minn. , June 8 ( UPI ) -- Supporters of Minnesota Republican Norm Coleman say a decision by the state 's governor to forgo re-election wo n't influence Coleman 's U.S. Senate lawsuit .
Speculation was mounting in St. Paul and elsewhere that Gov. Tim Pawlenty 's decision not to seek a third term in 2010 -- perhaps to seek the 2012 Republican U.S. presidential nomination -- means Coleman is planning to end his legal battle with Democrat Al Franken to overturn his recount loss in November 's Senate race and instead run to replace Pawlenty .

But unnamed Coleman sources say that 's not the case , the Washington publication Politico reported Monday .
" Not at all , " said the source .
" He ran for U.S. senator , wants to continue being a U.S. senator . …
What ( Pawlenty ) has done or not done has never been a factor in his decision - making . "
" I do not think he will quit before the ( U.S. ) Supreme Court rules on the case , " added an unnamed former Coleman staffer .
" He has too many resources invested and has a good case on equal protection . "
Coleman 's case to overturn Franken 's apparent 312 - vote win is being considered by the Minnesota Supreme Court .
Did I mention that I played World of Warcraft ?
I was late to the game , playing maybe 10 hours a week mostly after midnight .
It was fun !
After about a year I finally achieved the highest level of the game and lost interest .
In case you were wondering why Cockeyed.com sucked from August 2007 to January 2009 , Warcraft is to primarily to blame .
The game itself sells for $ 30 , and requires a seperate $ 15 / month fee after the first 45 days .
The game is vast .
You create a character and control his actions through a sprawling universe .
There are six very large cities , each with more than 40 businesses , plus probably another 150 smaller towns to explore .
In all there are probably 2,000 non-player characters in the game , and the cities and lands are crawling with other human players , each of whom you can chat , trade , cooperate and die with .
Below is a directory of the diary I kept , writing on Wordpress as " Piehands " .
I added some images to the descriptions to set the scene a little .
GENESIS OF EVOLUTION
Adam and Eve , naked and not smart , sat somewhere in the Garden of Eden .
A snake slithered afoot .
It said , “ Tss , come gorge yourselves upon the forbidden fruit and escape from your self - incarceration in the prison of ignorance . ”
Adam and Eve looked at each other , shrugged , and started having sex .
The snake shook its head and took a pair of quick bites from Adam ’s and Eve ’s ass cheeks .
“ Yow ! ” they yelled .
The couple quickly grew afraid and looked upon the snake much the same way they looked upon God .
The snake said , “ Tss , tss , follow me . ”
The snake snaked its way to the Tree .
It stopped in front of the trunk , perched upon the end of its tail and stared at Adam and Eve through the dark universe of its black eyes .
“ Nourish your bodies and souls with fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and thus attain knowledge equal–nay ! –superior to the one you call God ! ”
Adam looked at the snake for a long time .
So did Eve .
The wait was nerve - wracking for the reptile .
It perspired .
Finally , Adam made his move and started having sex with Eve again .
The snake momentarily pondered killing the both of them , thinking their existence barely constituted life anyhow .
Instead , the coily animal plucked the moistest fruit from the thickest limb of the Tree .
It carried the produce all the way down the trunk and rolled it to the foot of the fornicating organisms .
The snake waited for Adam to ejaculate , which was mercifully soon .
It then nudged the fruit upon Eve ’s still heaving chest .
“ Eat , ” the snake said .
Having just finished a vigorous round of coitus and noting Adam ’s flaccidity , Eve could think of nothing better to do .
As she chewed , all sorts of strange new thoughts zipped through her brain .
She thought about the shape of the fruit , its color , the way light reflected off its surface .
She thought about matter and the true meaning of it and if the immortal soul lives within that matter or if it ’s just a construction of the human consciousness .
Adam had n’t yet tasted the thing , so he was mostly thinking about getting his dick hard again .
Eve pried open Adam ’s mouth and placed the fruit inside .
He bit down .
The blood rushed straight from Adam ’s cock into his head as his synapses began firing for pretty much the first time .
“ Who am I ? ” he thought .
“ What is my purpose ?
Do I want more from life than merely lounging around ass - naked amongst the animals and the dinosaurs ? ”
The snake smiled , smiled , smiled .
Its job was done .
It had brought thought to the thoughtless .
Consciousness to the unconscious .
Ambition to the bored .
Then God appeared and stomped the snake into a lumpy salsa .
This event caused Adam and Eve to think about the transience of life and how one must appreciate existence whilst blood flows within one ’s veins as opposed to pooling on the ground outside those veins as per the snake ’s current situation .
The conversation between God and the couple went as follows :
God : Why the Hell did you eat that ?
Eve :
It was there , God .
God : I told you not to do one fucking thing and then you go and do it .
Adam : But , dear Lord , was n’t it an exceedingly arbitrary rule ?
Eve :
We comprehend your glory even more effervescently now that we understand the delicate mechanics of your work .
God :
You guys are fucking assholes .
Get the fuck out of my garden , you ’re going to die , and life is going to be shit for you .
Thus , Adam and Eve realized that God was sort of a dick .
God met the humans at the Gates of Eden where he refused to make eye contact with either of them .
Adam decided to be the bigger man , “ Lord , why do n’t we talk about this ? ”
To which , God responded , “ Why do n’t you shut the fuck up and get the hell out of my eternal garden ? ”
* * *
Life outside the Garden started out okay , what with the couple ’s newfound intellect .
They built a comfortable air - conditioned home on a gorgeous mountain side .
They made the planet ’s first foosball table .
They harnessed wind power and hydroelectricity to run appliances that ranged from a drip coffee maker to an 800 - watt microwave .
All in all , it was n’t a bad setup .
For years this went on , Adam and Eve barely mentioning their vindictive ex-land Lord .
Every now and then at breakfast , however , Eve would remark , “ We should really get a hold of that God and have him over for a late - lunch , early - dinner thing . ”
“ No , ” Adam would always reply .
And so it went until one certain December morning .
Adam woke up with a headache .
He sat up in bed and attempted to breathe through his nose but was surprised to find that air did not flow through his nostrils as it once did .
Instead of breath , he heard the splatter of mucus fluttering about the inside of his nasal cavities like an army of sticky windsocks straining against the wind .
Panicking , he looked to Eve who quickly invented facial tissue by stacking two squares of toilet paper on top of each other .
Adam blew his nose throughout the night .
He had a sinus infection .
He still had it two days later .
He even had it two weeks later .
Still , two months later .
It was almost spring and Adam could n’t comfortably breathe .
He was going mad .
“ God is going to get it for cursing my sinuses !
Hear you me , Eve ! ”
Eve tried to calm Adam down , “ Babe , do n’t worry , we ’ll figure this out . ”
Well , Adam teetered on the edge of sanity for a few more snot - filled months until something happened that changed Eve ’s soothing tune .
The pollen count was high .
It started with scratchy eyes and developed into a full facial assault of runny nose and inflamed face .
Eve had developed allergies .
“ Vengeance will be ours , ” she said .
Adam gleefully cackled as boogers shot out his nose .
He hyperventilated , regained his breath , and inhaled noisily through his mouth .
The plan was hatched : the couple would use their intelligence and technology to make God woefully regret his piss - poor attitude .
But how ?
What would tick God off more than anything ?
The answer was immediately obvious to the Earth - dwellers : Evolution .
They began by fostering tiny one - celled organisms and breeding them into more and more complex creatures until those life forms were structurally identical to even the most complicated entity .
Using their mighty science , Adam and Eve recreated all varieties of life .
They went on developing connections between those species through a terrific invention they called “ DNA . ”
It made the phony theory of Evolution seem air tight .
It was incontrovertible .
Oh , how they reveled in their genius .
The biped defrauders spent their next birthdays hunting dinosaurs and backdating the bones by modifying the carcass ’ carbon isotopes .
There was but one job left to do and that was the job of propagating a version of the human species so stupid it could believe such unnatural and unintuitive facts as presented by Evolution .
With that in mind , Adam and Eve birthed many children who were put to work having sex with each other .
Those children had children who had sex with each other and then they birthed children who had sex with each other , birthing children , and so on .
Genetic defects compounded , becoming the rule rather than the exception .
As Adam and Eve managed their incestuous family throughout their own scientifically extended lives , they joyously noticed a downward trend in mental capacity .
By the time they could no longer satisfactorily keep themselves spry , thousands of morbidly stupid human beings roamed the planet totally unaware that with every progeny producing boning , the species was losing the ability to know the truth .
After many generations of rearing retarded children , Adam and Eve finally called God .
Adam said that if God could stop masturbating in heaven for just one second , he and Eve would give Him a tour of planet Earth .
God replied , “ Sure , what else do I have to do on a Sunday ? ”
Eve led the tour , pointing out the burgeoning societies of total nincompoops .
At first , God did n’t put all the pieces together .
“ And there you see Barry .
He ’s our dumbest yet .
We ’re so proud , ” Eve commented .
“ Yes , yes , indeed .
Why , yesterday I told him that when animals die , their bones sometimes become fossilized in the ground and human beings can study those fossils to know just how long ago the animals lived on planet Earth ! ” Adam added .
God laughed .
“ And you know the best part ? ” Adam continued , “ He believed me . ”
God stopped laughing .
Adam and Eve smiled all the while the lightning bolt torched their insides .
Pissed , God had Noah –the smartest guy at the time–build an Ark with which his family could live upon while the Almighty did a mulligan on the human race .
Problem was , God did n’t really think it out .
When the waters receded , Noah ’s family unsurprisingly all banged each other and the species continued to reproduce through a series of close familial encounters .
People just kept getting dumber .
“ Fuck it , ” God thought .
* * *
From then on , God steered clear of Planet Earth for the most part .
This one time , he sent down his son to try and explain the whole situation , but that guy got killed .
He pretty much stopping paying attention after that .
The original problem was of course the lack of drug coverage under Medicare .
Back in the early 1960s when Medicare was first designed and implemented it was modeled on what were then the not - for - profit Blues , which back then ran almost as state - based Utilities ( they are mostly all now for - profit and swallowed up by the big private for profit insurance conglomerates ) .
Hence the Part A for hospital reimbursement and Part B for physician reimbursement .
Notice that insurance coverage for drugs was missing .
This was they would not compete with private insurance , be considered " too socialized " , and allow for supplemental insurance to be sold .
Of course , back then there were not as many medicines available and they were less expensive .
Fast forward , and we have more elderly of 65 with more chronic diseases and conditions and more medicines available to treat or at least ( better for the drug company than cure ) manage them .
And they are expensive .
Part D was originally meant to provide a real drug benefit for persons under Medicare coverage .
The U.S. government currently gets a discount for those drugs that covered under Medicaid ( the federal - state program for the very poor ) , and even better discounts for the people covered under the Dept of Defense and other Uniform Services ( Care at military hospitals and physicians , TriCare , etc ) , and for the Veterans Administration , and for a program called 340B .
One idea was that people under Medicare should get those discounts , and that Medicare would pay most of all ( with the tax dollar paying for the drugs under the better discount ) .
PhRMA did not like that .
They wanted a higher rate , less discounting .
They got it .
And they and the government got the infamous donut hole where there is no drug benefit for 3.4 million people per year who are caught in between annual drug costs covered up to $ 2,200 , but then with no coverage from $ 2,000 to $ 5,550 wherein they have to pay full cost out of pocket .
Remember :
When they say that Medicare was not allowed to negotiate a lower price , this means they were not allowed to even get the same " discount " ( " special , just for you " ) rate the U.S. government was already getting for benefits under Medicaid , DOD , Veterans and those eligible for 340B pricing .
One horrible , but deliberately planned result , is that many seniors and the disabled , who had been dually eligible for lower drug prices under Medicaid , wound up paying ( either under Medicare or out - of - pocket ) HIGHER prices to the drug companies under Medicare Part D , than they had before .
Expensive for taxpayers , poor seniors and the disabled , but a windfall for the drug companies .
In one of the more blatant examples of the corrupt system , Tauzin was a leader in making Medicare Part D so bad for government , taxpayer and the elderly but so good for the drug industry , while he was at the same time secretly negotiating his near future job as chief lobbyist for the same industry .
This was of course with the Bush white house and the corrupt D.C. - lobbyist leadership of the AARP ( which is to a great extent a for - profit insurance company , and not a senior - rights organization ) .
As to the current deal between Baucus and Tauzin ( can anything good possibly come from such dealmakers ? ) , Dean Baker point out its limitations :
the projected $ 80 billion in savings in context .
This is equal to a bit more than 2 percent of the $ 3.8 trillion that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services project the country will spend on drugs over the next decade .
The Post quotes its unnamed source as saying : " this is real money on the table . "
In the next paragraph the Post tells readers that " The concessions by drug manufacturers would essentially lower the cost of reform by a small fraction of the $ 1 trillion needed . "
That fraction would be 8 percent , assuming the commitment is met .
In fact what is actually being offered so far sounds pretty minimal and / or vague :
Under the proposal , U.S. drug companies would provide half - price discounts to Medicare recipients in the " doughnut hole " and provide other unspecified discounts and rebates for a total of $ 80 billion in savings to the government .
But more importantly this deal is a completely b.s. compromise , essentially a cave - in to PhRMA , compared to what had been talked about by the congressional Democrats and President Obama previously :
Complete elimination of the donut hole .
That under Medicare , drugs would not be paid more for than whatever was the cheapest that the government negotiated , including whatever was the cheapest for the Dept. of Defense , or the Veterans Administration or Medicaid or 340B .
Those prices are typical one - half to one - fourth the cost of the same medications under Medicare .
The official full price of drugs are completely artificial , and highly elastic to negotiation under a real free market .
What we have had up until now are PhRMA lobbyists successfully fixing a higher price and preventing the government from acting as a free market consumer .
Indeed , unlike the Baucus - Tauzin deal which was unfortunately vaguely endorsed , the House leadership was standing a little bit stronger .
In their draft proposal ...
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif. ) singled out drug manufacturers , saying the legislation attempts to recoup the " windfall " that companies received when Congress created the Medicare prescription drug benefit , which took effect in 2006 .
As a result of that program , some patients who received deeply discounted medications through Medicaid moved to Medicare , which has generally paid higher drug prices .
" We 're simply going to ask the pharmaceutical companies to pay us back the money , " Waxman said during a news conference .
Indeed , there is no reason for the U.S. to paying more for drugs , as we pathetically do , than the cheapest INTERNATIONAL market rates out there : American should not be paying any more for the same medications as whatever is the cheapest rate for the given medication in Canada , France , Germany , Japan , Taiwan , any other OECD country , to say nothing of our own Dept of Defense , Veterans Administration , 340B Drug program ... or Wal - Mart , Target , and etc .
We already subsidize most of the underlying research ( and the training of the drug companies ' researchers ) via the National Institutes of Health .
When the same drug is offered to at a lower cost to purchaser -- be it at DOD or France or Canada , etc -- and at a higher cost to us , then we are suckers being asked to subsidize that too .
The Baucus - Tauzin " deal " is just an attempt to cut - off the debate and fast - track a great deal for PhRMA and a really bad deal for America .

David Doty does n’t pinch pennies , much less collect them .
He could n’t care less about owning all 50 state quarters in mint condition .
Doty ’s passion is weird money .
The weirder , the better .
David Doty , who collects some of the world ’s oddest currency
The oddball currency he has collected over the years blows the doors off our prosaic card - check - cash payment paradigm .
How do you feel about card - check - squirrel pelt ?
Card - check - holy - water ?
Or card - check - eight - ton - rai - stone ?
Just imagine making change !
Doty , a vice president for Advanta Bank in Horsham , Pa. , traveled extensively overseas as a consultant in credit analysis and loss mitigation after graduating from the Wharton School of Business .
His mundane day job led him to a most unusual hobby .
“ I invariably came home with a pocketful of change from interesting places , and my kids loved to fish through it , ” he says .
“ I remember coming back from Hong Kong one time with a 1 - penny bill in my pocket that was only printed on one side to save money .
Somehow , I kind of got diverted into the ethnographic or cultural types of money .
It ’s a nice way to take my work home — but not literally . ”
Doty organizes his 200 - piece collection around such themes as “ money has use , ” “ money requires scarcity , ” “ money combats counterfeiting ” and “ money as propaganda ” to illustrate some of the common qualities of currency .
But unlike garden - variety numismatics , Doty is out to capture the ingenious extremes to which we have stretched the concept of money to fit our purposes .
“ I have found that money is almost like gravity : everyone is aware of it and acts within its influence , yet nobody can give a precise definition of what it is , ” he says .
“ I ’m drawn to one - off examples that look across time , geography and cultures .
Through this lens , we see that oddities are not as great as they first appear , but in other cases , man has the extraordinary gift of being able to outwit himself in terms of the impractical and absurd . ”
Impractical ?
Absurd ?
Those and even stranger destinations just ahead as we count down the world ’s 10 weirdest currencies .
Story continues below .
10 . Wooden bills
Wooden bills may have been rough on the wallet , but they were one of the ingenious ways that Germans devised to rebuild their economy following World War I .
When the war settlement left the German economy in shambles , local townships took to printing “ notgeld ” ( or “ emergency money ” ) on everything from wood and aluminum foil to silk linens and playing cards as a local form of payment until the Reichsbank recovered .
“ What they realized was that collectors would buy up really odd money for collections , which essentially took it out of circulation and returned hard currency in its place , ” says Doty .
His collection also includes a coin stamped on anthracite coal , a rarity now because , once Germany recovered , notgeld coal coins became more valuable as fuel .
9 . The death penalty dollar
The U.S. dollar has grown into one of the world ’s most stable currencies , but such was n’t always the case .
In fact , before it could grow in value , it had to rein in counterfeiting .
“ When the colonies first started , it was pretty easy to print ; there were a lot of printers , money was n’t very sophisticated and there just was n’t a lot of anti-counterfeiting , ” Doty explains .
“ So how to you create artificial scarcity ?
You print on the money , ‘ To counterfeit is death . ’
All 13 colonies printed this on all of their money , which was eventually replaced by ‘ In God We Trust . ’
Before we had ‘ In God We Trust , ’ it was actually in the death penalty we trust . ”
8. “ Green stamp ” money
We normally think of money as fully fungible , meaning it is interchangeable for like value of all goods and services .
But this is by no means universal .
In some cultures , certain currencies can only purchase certain things , such as a bride or raw land .
This Vietnamese bill is one such example .
It operated like the old Green Stamp coupon book .
“ Around the edges are a bunch of perforated coupons that you would tear off to buy pieces of clothing ; you would tear one off for a shirt or a pair of pants , ” says Doty .
“ It literally was denominated in clothing . ”
7. Edible currency
Salt is one of the world ’s oldest forms of payment .
In fact , the word salary derives from the Latin “ salarium , ” which was the money paid to Roman soldiers to buy salt .
It was the main form of currency in the Sahara Desert during the Middle Ages , and was used extensively throughout East Africa .
Typically , one would lick a salt block to make sure it was real and break off pieces to make change .
Doty ’s block , seen here , is 1,500 years old .
Other incredible , edible currencies include “ reng , ” a yarn - ball of tumeric spice wrapped in coconut fibers that is used for trade in the Solomon Islands ; cacao ( or chocolate beans ) , widely used throughout Mexico and Central America ; and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese , so highly regarded that it was used both as currency and bank collateral in Italy .
One particularly inedible currency : the poisonous money seeds of Burma .
Which if nothing else proves that money does indeed grow on trees — or at least bushes .
6 . The world ’s largest note
Worried about inflation ?
You ’d have to go some to beat Hungary circa 1946 , which issued the world record denomination , the 100 Million Billion Pengo .
That ’s right —
100,000,000,000,000,000,000 Pengos .
It was worth about 20 cents U.S .
5 . The unlikeliest Kennedy coin
What must the yak - herding descendants of Genghis Kahn have thought when they first encountered the 2007 Mongolian 500 Tugrik coin , flipped it over and discovered President John F. Kennedy on the tails side ?
Much less when they pressed a tiny button on JFK ’s chest and heard an actual sound bite from his famous “ Ich bin ein Berliner ” speech ?
Chances are we ’ll never know , since collectors quickly snatched up most of the oddities , which may have been the sole reason for printing them in the first place .
Nevertheless , Kennedy is well beloved in Mongolia for launching the Peace Corps .
4 . Off with his head !
The African nation of Zaire , known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo , does n’t have money to burn .
So when the totalitarian regime of Joseph Mobutu was overthrown in 1997 , the new government found itself in a cash crunch until it could design and print new currency .
It ’s thrifty solution ?
It took large stacks of 20,000 - zaire notes and simply punched out Mobutu ’s image .
3. Squirrel pelts
All apologies to PETA , but in medieval Russia , squirrel pelts were a common currency of exchange .
So common , in fact , that snouts , claws and ears were also used , presumably as change .
Doty speculates that converting squirrels into spending cash may have had an unexpected benefit as well : “ During the Black Plague , Russia did n’t get hit as hard as everybody else .
By making their currency the squirrel pelt , it may have reduced the number of disease - bearing parasites . ”
2 . Holy water dollar
Taking “ In God We Trust ” one step further , the island nation of Palau issued a silver dollar coin in 2007 with the image of the Virgin Mary and a tiny vial containing holy water from the Grotto at Lourdes , France .
The following year , it issued a second series to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Apparitions of the Virgin Mary at the Grotto .
The holy water dollar was not the first coin to contain unconventional materials however .
Palau also has issued coins with small pieces of mother of pearl and meteorites embedded in them .
The Cook Islands topped that when it commemorated the invention of the television by embedding an actual moving video clip of its inventor , J.L. Baird , within the world ’s tiniest flat - screen TV .
1. Rai stone
On the island of Yap in the Solomon Islands , you ’ll find the world ’s largest and strangest form of currency : the rai stone .
Forget pocket change : these limestone disks with the hole in the center can run 12 feet in diameter and weight up to eight tons .
Because Yap lacks the proper limestone for rei stones , the villagers would risk their lives to paddle their ocean - going canoes to Palau , where they would carve these behemoths from a mountainside and row them back to the island .
“ Part of the value is size , but the real value lies in what it took to get it there , the number of people who died bringing it back , ” Doty explains .
As for its monetary use , the stones typically remain in place ; only the ownership changes .
“ Once it gets there , these things ca n’t be moved , but everybody on the island knows who owns which stones , and transfer is done in a public ceremony , ” says Doty .
“ But how different is that really from moving bits around in a computer ?
I mean , do the bits really move , or do you just change the association of the name in the bank account ? ”
The Yap government has banned export of rei stones .
One of the few on display resides in the lobby of the Bank of Canada in Ottawa .

Poe 's Law :
Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor , it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone wo n't mistake for the genuine article .
Throughout their years of practice , scatological satirists Trey Parker and Matt Stone have had a very effective secret weapon in providing much needed laughs week after week .
When lampooning the absurd , how do you top its own absurdity ?
South Park knows it 's futile to try , so it opts to recreate instead .
It ’s amazing how many people would then assume these things were fiction , when in reality the South Park guys did n’t have to invent a thing .
Through their simplistic animation style and poorly impersonated celebrity voices , it ’s easier to notice how insane our world truly is .
As the old saying goes , truth is stranger than fiction .
One of the most famous examples of this particular South Park comedy tactic is the Season 7 episode “ All About the Mormons , ” in which they accurately reenact Joseph Smith ’s founding of the Mormon Church .
South Park ’s only original contribution ?
A musical chant going , “ Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb ! ”
Which surely mirrors the sentiment of anyone who do n’t fall for Smith ’s trickery .
The episode was a tightrope of insult .
Technically , it did n’t muck with the Joseph Smith legend .
It was merely condescending .
Two seasons later , they did the same “ joke ” in an infamous episode called “ Trapped in a Closet , ” this time targeting the Church of Scientology .
The episode offended chief Scientologist Tom Cruise so , the producers of Mission : Impossible III called Comedy Central ’s parent company Viacom and demanded the episode ’s reruns be yanked off the air .
They partly succeeded , but word of the shady practice soon got out , making both Viacom and Paramount look bad and South Park once again the victor .
Contained in the episode was an animated depiction of Scientology ’s taught history , so mindbogglingly preposterous that South Park had to flash the disclaimer “ THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE ” during the sequence , lest the viewers assume the guys were fooling around with all that stolen - alien - souls baloney .
It was insane , it was hilarious , it was perfect in its stupidity — and again , Matt and Trey simply took what was already there .
Poe ’s Law — If they had invented a raucous fictional Scientology belief and then present it side by side with the real deal , would the uninitiated be able to tell which is which ?
To a lesser extent , “ Trapped in a Closet ” also contains another example .
In the episode , a running joke is R. Kelly randomly pulling out his Beretta while singing about it .
One might assume that it ’s just South Park ’s way of parodying R. Kelly ’s epic musical soap opera and the fake - thuggery displayed , but if you watch the damn thing , R. Kelly really does randomly pull out his Beretta throughout the series .
While singing about it .
Applying Poe ’s
Law to the absurdity of pop culture rather than fundamentalism , you ’ll find out that many of South Park ’s jokes are not jokes ; but rather a form of snarky journalism .
Last week , the show debuted its 13th season , kicking off with a Jonas Brothers - centric episode called “ The Ring . ”
The episode harshly criticizes Disney ’s use of Jonas Brothers ’ purity rings as a mean to put up the facade of an innocent family friendly company while blatantly marketing sex to young children .
One of the episode ’s most over - the - top moments was when the supposedly pure and virginal Jonas Bros pull out phallic hoses and shoot white foam all over their mostly underage female audience .
This stage act was so disgusting and obviously Freudian that no one would blame you if you thought it was all Matt and Trey 's mischievous concoction .
Guess again .
This is something the Jonas Brothers actually did at their concerts , as depicted in their recent 3D Experience concert movie .
Below is a video taken at one of their shows in 2008 .
Disturbed ?
Welcome to the party .
It was n’t the first time South Park had done this to Disney .
Last season , they did a brilliant spoof of the High School Musical craze .
In one scene , the South Park boys sit down to watch the movie together .
Cartman declares , “ If this is what 's cool now , I think I 'm done .
I no longer have any connection to this world .
I 'm gonna go home and kill myself , ” during a scene where the kids in the movie sing “ Go with the status quo . ”
If you think that ’s just a simplification / mockery of how boring and squeaky - clean the kids are , you are sorely mistaken yet again , because it was a direct parody of an actual song from High School Musical called “ Stick to the Status Quo . ” Observe :
At one point , Comedy Central did Matt and Trey ’s job for them .
It happened in the highly controversial “ Cartoon Wars ” episode , in which they talk about the Muhammad cartoon scandal .
The gist of the two - part episode ’s moral is this : Terrorism is scaring people into doing something ; by pussing out of showing Muhammad ’s image in fear of Muslim retaliation , TV networks are essentially surrendering to terrorists .
Kyle ’s anti-censorship and anti-terrorism speech to a FOX network exec named “ Doug ” was taken almost verbatim from Matt and Trey ’s own argument with Comedy Central head honcho Doug Herzog .
Not content with verbally bashing TV networks , South Park wanted to push the envelope further by actually showing a depiction Muhammad briefly .
Comedy Central pulled the plug — nevermind that South Park had already depicted Muhammad in an episode five years prior , in a far more sacrilegious manner — thus proving the point that the censorship was motivated by fear and not moral integrity .
Where the Muslim prophet was supposed to enter , a black screen appeared with the words , “ In this shot , Muhammad hands a football helmet to Family Guy .
Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Muhammad on their network . ”
Many fans thought it was a meta - joke meant to poke fun at Comedy Central .
It was simply the truth .
Matt and Trey then highlighted this hypocrisy by ending the episode with a short cartoon supposedly paid for by Al Qaeda .
It shows Jesus being defecated on by President Bush in front of the American flag .
Comedy Central had no problem airing it .
The examples just keep on going , depending on the viewers ’ awareness of what ’s going on in the world .
Who had n’t wished that NAMBLA is just a fictional organization South Park came up with for a Season 4 episode ?
Who else was surprised to find out that Butters ’
“ What What ( In the Butt ) ” video was a verbatim copy of an actual YouTube sensation ?
In the Season 9 episode “ Death of Eric Cartman , ” South Park made popular the existence of Super AIDS .
“ There 's no reason to be afraid of things that are n't real .
There 's plenty of real things to be scared of .
Like Super AIDS , ” warns Butters ’ father to a terrified Butters .
“ A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs !
Just one teaspoon of Super AIDS in your butt and you 're dead in three years ! ”
The joke here is not that he ’s scaring Butters with something equally unreal .
The joke here is that what sounds so outrageous actually exists .
While not formally called Super AIDS by the medical community ( though totally should be ) , in 2005 doctors in New York discovered a rare and highly aggressive strand of HIV which , as Butter ’s dad said , is resistant to drugs and develops much faster .
So yeah , Super AIDS .
It ’s fascinating to see how South Park , hiding behind its guise of juvenile humor , can illuminate and discuss real life incidents without their fans even realizing it .
It has transcended reactionary and gone fully into the realm of education , even if the creators never meant to build a flock .
Of course , you ca n’t stay this cutting edge if you only go for the cheap shots .
In the 13th season opener , when many expected them to completely rail on the Jonas Brothers for their goody - goody pretty boy nature , South Park once again proved themselves more clever than that , pointing out the real enemy and even made the Jonas Brothers somewhat sympathetic .
It ’s a familiar tactic they ’ve displayed before with Britney Spears , going against the grain when it was hip to make fun of Crazy Brit the falling star .
Search the internet and you ’ll find many comments left by people who were so disturbed and saddened by the Britney Spears episode that they vowed to lay off Spears ’ media mania .
In " All About the Mormons , " Matt and Trey balanced their sneering account of Joseph Smith with a concluding moral that basically says , " So what if their religion is irrational ?
If the people who follow these religions are truly nice , why should their faith be a problem ? "
In a 2006 interview with Reason magazine , Matt Stone offered the following summation of South Park 's approach to the subject matters they bring up on the show .
It is perhaps the best way to understand how a comedy show can be so provocatively sophomoric and yet intellectually satisfying .
Until the military moved in illegal diggers were seeking their fortune Lobby group Human Rights Watch has accused Zimbabwe 's army of using forced labour , including children , to mine diamonds in the east of the country .
Local villagers who do not co-operate with the military are beaten and tortured , the US - based group says .
Their report also details an alleged massacre of diamond diggers last year , after the disputed elections .
It urges the unity government to take control of the mines and use the revenue to help rebuild the country .
" Zimbabwe 's new government should get the army out of the fields , put a stop to the abuse , " Human Rights Watch 's Africa director Georgette Gagnon said .
" The police and army have turned this peaceful area into a nightmare of lawlessness and horrific violence , " she said .
' Buying off the military '
The report is based on interviews done in February in Marange district .
Its researchers say that as far as they are aware , the situation has not changed since the former opposition joined the government four months ago .
Millions of dollars in potential government revenue are being siphoned off through illegal diamond mining ,
Human Rights
Watch statement
Eerie silence at Zimbabwe mine Blood diamond scheme ' is failing '
Human Rights
Watch claims control of the mines is part of a systematic attempt by President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party to buy support from the military .
The diamond fields in Marange were seized just one month after the power - sharing deal was first agreed in September 2008 .
On the face of it , the military takeover was an attempt to seize control from unlicensed miners , the lobby group says .
But in reality it was a systematic attempt to enable key army units , whose support President Mugabe needed following June 's elections , to have access to riches , Human Rights Watch says .
" Documents that we reviewed that we got from the military and the police clearly indicate that this was a clearly designed system to benefit the army , " researcher Dewa Mavhinga said .
Witnesses say it involved a brutal military operation that saw some 200 people killed in three weeks .
It says army brigades are still in control forcing hundreds of children and adults endure forced labour for mining syndicates .
While the new Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai is touring the West lobbying for aid , " millions of dollars in potential government revenue are being siphoned off through illegal diamond mining , smuggling of gemstones and corruption " , the rights organisation says .
If the diamond industry was legally regulated , Human Rights Watch estimates it could amount to $ 200 m a month for the country .
It is calling for diamond exports from Zimbabwe to be banned and for the country to be suspended from the Kimberly Process - the certification scheme for diamonds - until the demilitarisation of the mines is achieved .
On Wednesday , Global Witness reported that the Kimberly process was failing - partly because of the situation in Zimbabwe .

A University of Colorado at Boulder research team has discovered the first definitive evidence of shorelines on Mars , an indication of a deep , ancient lake there and a finding with implications for the discovery of past life on the Red Planet .
Estimated to be more than 3 billion years old , the lake appears to have covered as much as 80 square miles and was up to 1,500 feet deep -- roughly the equivalent of Lake Champlain bordering the United States and Canada , said CU - Boulder Research Associate Gaetano Di Achille , who led the study .
The shoreline evidence , found along a broad delta , included a series of alternating ridges and troughs thought to be surviving remnants of beach deposits .
" This is the first unambiguous evidence of shorelines on the surface of Mars , " said Di Achille .
" The identification of the shorelines and accompanying geological evidence allows us to calculate the size and volume of the lake , which appears to have formed about 3.4 billion years ago . "
A paper on the subject by Di Achille , CU - Boulder Assistant Professor Brian Hynek and CU - Boulder Research Associate Mindi Searls , all of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics , has been published online in Geophysical Research Letters , a publication of the American Geophysical Union .
Images used for the study were taken by a high - powered camera known as the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment , or HiRISE .
Riding on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , HiRISE can resolve features on the surface down to one meter in size from its orbit 200 miles above Mars .
An analysis of the HiRISE images indicate that water carved a 30 - mile - long canyon that opened up into a valley , depositing sediment that formed a large delta .
This delta and others surrounding the basin imply the existence of a large , long - lived lake , said Hynek , also an assistant professor in CU - Boulder 's geological sciences department .
The lake bed is located within a much larger valley known as the Shalbatana Vallis .
" Finding shorelines is a Holy Grail of sorts to us , " said Hynek .
In addition , the evidence shows the lake existed during a time when Mars is generally believed to have been cold and dry , which is at odds with current theories proposed by many planetary scientists , he said .
" Not only does this research prove there was a long - lived lake system on Mars , but we can see that the lake formed after the warm , wet period is thought to have dissipated . "
Planetary scientists think the oldest surfaces on Mars formed during the wet and warm Noachan epoch from about 4.1 billion to 3.7 billion years ago that featured a bombardment of large meteors and extensive flooding .
The newly discovered lake is believed to have formed during the Hesperian epoch and postdates the end of the warm and wet period on Mars by 300 million years , according to the study .
The deltas adjacent to the lake are of high interest to planetary scientists because deltas on Earth rapidly bury organic carbon and other biomarkers of life , according to Hynek .
Most astrobiologists believe any present indications of life on Mars will be discovered in the form of subterranean microorganisms .
But in the past , lakes on Mars would have provided cozy surface habitats rich in nutrients for such microbes , Hynek said .
The retreat of the lake apparently was rapid enough to prevent the formation of additional , lower shorelines , said Di Achille .
The lake probably either evaporated or froze over with the ice slowly turning to water vapor and disappearing during a period of abrupt climate change , according to the study .
Di Achille said the newly discovered pristine lake bed and delta deposits would be would be a prime target for a future landing mission to Mars in search of evidence of past life .
" On Earth , deltas and lakes are excellent collectors and preservers of signs of past life , " said Di Achille .
" If life ever arose on Mars , deltas may be the key to unlocking Mars ' biological past . "

Was Vick overrated ?
Only because media made him that way .
There ’s something that still chaps my hide whenever the topic of Michael Vick ( the quarterback , not the dog fighter ) gets brought up .
ESPN.com is running an “ All - Decade ” feature this week and for one of their topics they listed the top 25 most overrated NFL players of the decade ( Insider subscription required ) .
Who is No. 2 you ask ?
Well the dog fighter former Falcons quarterback himself , of course .
2. Michael Vick : Even before Vick ’s sordid off - field activities came to light , he was a disappointing No. 1 overall pick .
Vick was a great runner , sure , but when he dropped back to pass , he turned into Tyler Thigpen or Derek Anderson , quarterbacks who are close to Vick ’s career averages of 6.7 yards per pass attempt , 1.4 touchdowns for every interception and 52.8 completion percentage .
His upside at this point is “ Best Wildcat Quarterback , ” not best NFL quarterback .
What I ’ve always found funny is that the media was the one that built Vick into this Super Jesus Quarterback ( SJQ ) coming out of college , then when he never lived up to their lofty expectations , they were the first to say he was one of the most overrated signal callers ever to lace up the cleats .
The media were the ones who said Vick would reinvent the quarterback position , find a cure for lupus and solve the world ’s hunger problem .
And some fans bought into that because of all the hype that surrounded him coming out of college .
But what was he at Virginia Tech ?
A runner .
And what was he in Atlanta ?
A dog fighter .
A runner .
So how is he overrated ?
Because he did n’t live up to the media ’s expectations ?
That ’s what makes him overrated ?
Why is it such a conundrum that Vick was n’t a great passer ?
Frank Beamer only gave him six plays to learn at VA Tech , so it ’s not like Vick was Peyton Manning ( a great passer who put up great passing numbers at Tennessee ) coming out of college .
Dan Reeves and Jim Mora did their best to try and make Vick a quarterback , but obviously he just did n’t have it in him .
The media saw Vick ’s big arm and thought , “ passer . ”
But the fact of the matter is that Vick was an athlete first and always .
Fans are partially to blame in all of this because they hyped him up too , but they mostly loved his athletic ability and marveled at what he could do with the ball in his hands .
It was the media that wanted him to reinvent the position as both a runner and a passer .
Now they want to claim , “ Vick was n’t a good quarterback – he was overrated . ”
Really , Captain Obvious ?
Well you made him that way .
You know what ’s overrated ?
The term “ overrated ” in sports .
A player is only overrated when the media over hypes him and he fails to live up to those expectations .
So let ’s relax with all the overrated talk and just enjoy the damn games for once .
Either that , or let ’s only talk about the players who are underrated , because at least it focuses on those who deserve more attention for what they can do on a field .
they ’ll blush and try not to sound xenophobic
On Saturday I took the Chuo line from Tokyo station to Shinjuku after work as always .
I sat down in a spot dividing two seats , as per the Japanese custom of avoiding sitting next to anyone .
Two guys got on the train and saw that there was a seat available on either side of me , frowned , and moved on .
No one ever politely asks for someone else to move over , lest the disturb the sacred Wa .
I got their attention , said –douzo , and scooted over .
The one who sat nearest me , to my dread , immediately started a conversation – where are you from ?
I took off my headphones and we got to talking , and as always I was pleasantly surprised to find that the purpose of the conversation was not a free English lesson but merely curiosity .
I do n’t remember the exact contents and course of the conversation but he asked me what I do , to which I hesitantly responded that I teach English .
He gave me the benefit of the doubt and asked if I ’m a businessman .
– I wish , I wanted to say and asked him his deal .
So , he told me he lived in Thailand for seven years , and can speak English and Thai pretty well .
We got to talking about the economy and the recession and as we meandered through this topic I asked him about the Japanese side of things — something about which I ’m always curious .
He told me that what Japan must do to survive is to find new breakthroughs in it ’s various industries .
For example , to combat the cheap new Tata Nano from India , he said Japanese car manufacturers will have to come up with something revolutionary .
How can Japanese companies , and by extension the country , consciously do this ?
The man ’s answer was simple : cultural diversity .
I was shocked to hear this coming from a Nihonjin .
But I guess living in Thailand for seven years has broadened the man ’s horizons .
He pointed out that Japan is a very closed nation , with stringent immigration laws that make it unfriendly to immigrants .
He also noted that despite the recession , one of the greatest assets that the US has is it ’s great cultural diversity .
Make note of these facts to a typical Japanese person and suggest that maybe the solution to the low birthrates , cultural stagnation , and impending foreign competition on all fronts is merely a more lax immigration policy , and they ’ll blush and try not to sound xenophobic as they tell you it ’s not a good idea for no particular reason .
So it was refreshing to hear the opposite coming from a Japanese native .
I do n’t want to make a crude generalization .
Japanese people from my experience are mostly tolerant and friendly individuals .
But they have a deep seated paranoia that too much foreign cultural influence — especially in the direct form of immigration — will somehow forever infect and dilute Japan ’s cultural heritage .
In the age of globalization this is a farce .
On the contrary , cultural diversity strengthens a culture the same way that genetic diversity does .
Hearing this minority - held perspective from a Japanese person was a breath of fresh air for me , and as usual I ’m glad I had a nice chat on the train .
We parted ways in Shinjuku .
I did n’t get his name but I got something to think about .
A few weeks ago I read an article addressing the misconception that human evolution has come to a near standstill .
The article pointed out that modern era humans are evolving at a faster pace their ancestors , the reason being a staggeringly large gene pool .
Because our civilization is so large and varied we have great genetic diversity .
This diversity , the article argues , increases the rate at which the human race evolves .
What does this have to do with my run in with a liberal Nihonjin on the train ?
I ’ve been recently tossing around ideas in my head that cultural diversity affects society in the same way that genetic diversity affects the gene pool .
The more diverse a culture , the more ideas get tossed around and the quicker the culture changes and adapts ( usually for the better I think ) .
Hearing my thoughts come from another mouth really drove this idea home for me .
I firmly believe that higher cultural diversity in a society greatly increases that society ’s ability to adapt and improve .
Anyway , the sun has long come up and my eyes burn .
I ’d love to wake up to find feedback on this matter .
Says public should “ trust ” government when it institutes draconian measures to deal with pandemic
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , April 28 , 2009
Time Magazine ’s coverage of the swine flu scare has a noticeable subplot – preparing Americans for draconian measures to combat a future pandemic as well as forcing them to accept the idea of mandatory vaccinations .
In an article entitled How to Deal with Swine Flu : Heeding the Mistakes of 1976 , the piece discusses how dozens died and hundreds were injured from vaccines as a result of the 1976 swine flu fiasco , when the Ford administration attempted to use the infection of soldiers at Fort Dix as a pretext for a mass vaccination of the entire country .
Despite acknowledging that the 1976 farce was an example of “ how not to handle a flu outbreak , ” the article still introduces the notion that officials “ may soon have to consider whether to institute draconian measures to combat the disease . ”
Later we discover exactly what this will entail , namely “ when to institute mass vaccination programs , ” according to Howard Markel , director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and a historical consultant to the CDC on flu pandemics .
Markel notes that the less politically combustible situation in America today compared to the post - Watergate era of Ford would make such draconian measures more achievable .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Even so , he says , citizens still need to trust that the government is working for the greater good , ” adds the article .
“ The American public has to be forgiving and patient and do [ their ] part too , ” according to Markel .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Americans would indeed have to be very trustworthy and ultimately forgiving in taking a vaccine by government decree manufactured by a company that was been caught red - handed contaminating their vaccines with far deadlier viruses than swine flu .
As we reported yesterday , Baxter International confirmed over the weekend that it is working with the World Health Organization on a potential vaccine to curb the deadly swine flu virus that is blamed for scores of deaths in Mexico and has emerged as a threat in the U.S. , reports the Chicago Tribune .
As reported by multiple sources last month , including the Times of India , vaccines contaminated with deadly live H5N1 avian flu virus were distributed to 18 countries last December by a lab at an Austrian branch of Baxter .
Since the probability of mixing a live virus biological weapon with vaccine material by accident is virtually impossible , this leaves no other explanation than that the contamination was a deliberate attempt to weaponize the H5N1 virus to its most potent extreme and distribute it via conventional flu vaccines to the population who would then infect others to a devastating degree as the disease went airborne .
These are the people we are supposed to “ trust ” and “ forgive ” according to Time Magazine and Markel when the federal government breaks down our door , guns drawn and dripping needle in hand .

Comment on this article
Right photo by Diana Davies from the New York Public Library
The Stonewall Rebellion , when lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people fought back against police repression at a Greenwich Village bar with a six - day riot in June 1969 is considered the birth of the modern " gay rights " movement .
President Barack Obama just declared June LGBT Pride Month in the United States , following an example set by President Bill Clinton during his second term .
( This year , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued her own proclamation at the State Department . )
Obama then switched his position and let his Justice Department file briefs supporting both the Defense of Marriage Act , prohibiting federal recognition of legal same - sex marriages , and the Don't Ask , Don't Tell policy excluding open gays from the military -- even though he campaigned against both laws .
The 40th anniversary will be marked by the usual LGBT Pride Parade down Fifth Avenue and by pride marches all around the world from Youngstown , Ohio , which is having its first this year , to Moscow , Russia , where activists get beaten every year by skinheads and police .
There now are separate African American pride parades across the U.S. as well .
Stonewall gives New York a certain preeminence in the LGBT movement , but the clash was neither the first public display of gay resistance , nor has the city and state maintained their claim to be the world leader in progress since then .
Five states -- from Massachusetts to Iowa -- have already beat us to opening up marriage to gay couples .
Maybe it is New York arrogance , but it was not until this year that New York City launched an ad campaign , euphemistically called " Rainbow Pilgrimage , " seeking gay tourism -- something that cities such as London and Amsterdam have been doing for years .
( Maybe the rainbow theme is meant to pick up on the 40th anniversary of the death of Judy Garland , whose signature song was " Over the Rainbow . " )
With gay issues so much in the forefront this year , it 's a good time to look at some examples of where New York has led and where it has followed -- despite its reputation as the birthplace of the modern movement .
Pre-Stonewall History
While the religious right likes to speak about homosexuality as something that was always condemned , plenty of cultures have celebrated it -- the evidence appears on some of the Greek urns in the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
There is even evidence of same - sex union ceremonies in early Christianity , not to mention the Bible 's celebration of the love of such pairs as Ruth and Naomi as well as David and Jonathan .
These couples may or may not have been gay in the modern sense , but their ardency for each other certainly goes beyond friendship .
Indeed , Ruth 's words to Naomi ( " whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God " -- Ruth 1:1 6 ) are often used in wedding ceremonies .
In the modern Western world , German physician Magnus Hirshfeld founded the Scientific Humanitarian Committee to fight for gay rights and overturn Germany 's anti-sodomy laws in 1897 .
He enlisted such supporters as Albert Einstein , Thomas Mann , Rainer Maria Rilke , Martin Buber , Herman Hesse and Richard von Krafft - Ebing .
His Institute for Sexual Research was housed in a villa near the Reichstag from 1919 until the Nazis drove him out in the 1930s , famously burning the group 's library in 1933 .
New York 's first gay center was a space the post - Stonewall Gay Liberation Front rented above what was then Gerde 's Folk City on West Third Street in 1969 .
The Gay Activists Alliance worked and played in a space called The Firehouse at 99 Wooster from 1971 until it was destroyed in a suspicious fire in 1974 .
The current LGBT Community Center opened in 1980 .
The first significant American gay group was the Mattachine Society , founded in Los Angeles by Harry Hay and Rudy Gernreich in 1950 -- and now being dramatized in a new play called The Temperamentals at the Barrow Group Theatre through July 5 with Thomas Jay Ryan as Hay and " Ugly Betty " star Michael Urie as Gernreich , who became a famous designer .
New York got a Mattachine chapter in 1951 , and it lasted until 1976 .
What may well have been the first public gay demonstration in the United States took place here in 1964 when Randy Wicker led the Homosexual League of New York and the League for Sexual Freedom in a protest against the exclusion of gays from the military on Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan at the U.S. Army Induction Center .
Two years later , New York Mattachine leader Dick Leitsch , John Timmons and Craig Rodwell , who went on to establish the recently departed Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop in the Village , successfully challenged the law banning bars from serving gay people with a 1966 " sip in " at Julius ' bar , which is still operating on the corner of Waverly and West 10th Street .
Post - Stonewall History

Stonewall had immediate repercussions in the movement .
Soon after , a group of gay activists formed the Gay Liberation Front , which was of a piece with the radical liberation activism of the day and made alliances with other left movements , including the Black Panthers and the Young Lords .
Its members were confrontational and unapologetic , and their intense group splintered and ultimately burned out in April 1971 .
( Some veterans of the group are having a reunion panel on June 25 at 6 p.m. at the LGBT Community Center , which I 'll be moderating . )
The Gay Activists Alliance broke with the front to focus on single - issue gay activism in 1970 .
The alliance lasted about 10 years , spawning splinters of its own such as Lesbian Feminist Liberation , part of a lesbian separatist movement .
On the first anniversary of Stonewall -- in June 1970 -- New York City saw the world 's first big gay march .
Craig Rodwell played a key role just by posting a sign in the window of his gay bookstore calling on people to mark the first anniversary of the rebellion , but he was aided by both Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance .
The Legislative Battles
During the 1960s , states around the country began repealing anti-sodomy laws as part of the effort to rid legal codes of archaic laws .
New York 's legislature , however , would not act on repeal despite the urgings of a young member of the State Assembly named Ed Koch .
The New York Court of Appeals ruled the state law was unconstitutional in 1980 .
It took until 2003 for the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the nation 's 13 remaining state sodomy laws .
New York City was the first municipality in the world to propose amending its human rights law to ban discrimination on the basis of " sexual orientation , " a legal phrase coined by the Gay Activists Alliance in 1971 .
The City Council , though , refused to pass the law for years , while many other major U.S. cities moved ahead and passed gay rights bills .
New York did not join them until 1986 .
Village Assemblymember Bill Passanante introduced New York State 's gay rights bill -- the first such state bill in the nation -- in 1971 , but that did n't pass until 2002 , long after states such as Wisconsin led the way in offering statewide protections in 1985 .
New York State still has not added protections on the basis of gender identity and expression covering people of transgender experience , but the city did in 2002 .
New York State 's hate crimes law was held up by a Republican - controlled Senate until 2000 -- more than 13 years after it was first proposed following the Howard Beach racial killing in 1986 .
The sticking point was including " sexual orientation . "
Most states had passed hate crimes laws in some form by the time New York did .
A school anti-bullying bill , the Dignity for All Students Act , has also been held up in the State Senate for more than a decade despite almost unanimous support in the Democrat - led Assembly .
The barrier is , again , the category of " sexual orientation , " as well as " gender identity and expression . "
Two members of Congress from New York , Bella Abzug and Ed Koch , introduced the first federal gay and lesbian rights bill in 1973 , then an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1965 .
The bill was eventually watered down to just provide some job protections through the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and passed the House last year but not the Senate .
Gays in Office
In the 1970s , out gays began running for -- and getting elected to -- public office .
Here , too , New York lagged .
The first out gay officials anywhere in the U.S. were such pioneers as Kathy Kozachenko in January 1974 to the Ann Arbor City Council , Allan Spear , a state senator in Minnesota who came out in 1974 , and Elaine Noble , elected that same year to the Massachusetts legislature as an out lesbian .
Harvey Milk was n't elected a supervisor in San Francisco until 1977 , only to be murdered by former Supervisor Dan White the following year -- and immortalized by Oscar - winning Sean Penn in the movie " Milk " just last year .
In 1991 , Passanante was succeeded in the Assembly by Deborah Glick , the first out gay or lesbian person ever to be elected to a legislative office in New York .
Significantly , New York now has an out lesbian City Council speaker in Christine Quinn , one of the highest ranking out gay or lesbian officials in the United States .
Marriage Matters
The big gay news these days concerns the fate of same - sex marriage in New York .
With the Republicans taking over the State Senate in a coup with dissident Democrats , the prospects for the bill letting gay couples marry here is up in the air , even though new Majority Leader Dean Skelos , a Long Island Republican and opponent of same - sex marriage , has said his members can vote their consciences on the bill .
The dissidents Democratic senators , Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate , are for the marriage equality bill .
However , it apparently had nothing to do with their coup , which observers have attributed to billionaire Tom Golisano 's desire for lower taxes and the landlord lobby 's fear the Senate Democrat majority would strengthen rent regulations .
Assemblymember Daniel O'Donnell , a Democrat from Manhattan 's West Side , who got the marriage bill passed in his house , remains hopeful it will pass the Senate .
Prior to the coup , Sen .
Tom Duane , also a Manhattan Democrat was insisting it had the votes to pass .
While the Republican - led majority can block action on the bill , it does not now nor has it ever had the votes to block New York State from recognizing same - sex marriages performed in other place .
Legislation that would have denied legal recognition to those marriages was introduced in the 1990s in Albany and never even received a hearing in the Senate .
As a result , New York is alone among states in that it recognizes legal same - sex marriages performed elsewhere but does not perform them itself .
All New York gay couples have to do to be married is travel to such neighboring jurisdictions as Vermont , Connecticut , Massachusetts or Canada and wed legally .
When they come home , they will be married in the eyes of the state -- just as if they had been able to legally marry here .
This has been true since same sex couples in New York began legally marrying in Canada in 2003 .
Gov. David Paterson drew much more attention to this quirk in New York law last year , though , when he ordered state departments and agencies to report on how they were complying with it .
Like all other same - sex married couples , New Yorkers lack federal rights associated with marriage due to the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. Sen. Charles Schumer , who voted for that anti-gay bill , this year became the last statewide official to come out in favor of same - sex marriage , joining Paterson , Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli , Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who announced her support the day the governor picked her to succeed Sen.
Clinton , who does not support same - sex marriage .
Serving a Community
Beyond the political arena , New York has played central roles in the development of the LGBT community , especially in the arts ( a whole other column ) but also in the provision of services .
Lambda Legal Defense , founded in 1973 in New York as the first legal group devoted to defending gay rights , now has offices around the country .
The New York LGBT movement , which I was very much a part of , was tragically rather weak when the syndrome that came to be called AIDS was first noticed in 1981 .
AIDS devastated the gay community but also led to development of a vast gay social services establishment starting with the Gay Men 's Health Crisis co-founded by Larry Kramer and five others .
Kramer went on to give a speech in 1987 that sparked the creation of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power or ACT UP , a group dominated by dying gay men and supportive lesbians who radicalized activism again and changed forever the way people with diseases advocate for what they need to survive .
ACT UP chapters spread around the world , and the New York contingent still has a few stalwarts carrying the torch of AIDS activism .
New York City had the first predominately gay , lesbian and transgendered high school with Harvey Milk High School founded by the Hetrick - Martin Institute for LGBT youth in 1985 .
Its continued existence is testimony to the fact that many mainstream city schools are still not safe places for such students .
The institute itself , where I once worked as director of education , was founded to advocate for these youth in 1979 by the late Damien Martin and Emery Hetrick .
New York 's SAGE -- for Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders -- was the first U.S. group for older gays and lesbians in 1978 .
Gay journalists founded the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in 1985 to fight anti-gay defamation in the media , especially at the New York Post .
Originally a fierce watchdog , it has gone on to become a largely West Coast operation famous for big annual dinners honoring positive LGBT portrayals in the media .
Such has been the arc of the movement .
Joining the Establishment
For better or worse , the political movement has become much more institutionalized , too .
None of the early activists , from the Gay Liberation Front in 1969 to the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights , with which I worked in the 1970s and ' 80s , had paid staff .
The National Gay Task Force ( now the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force ) began to change that in 1973 .
Its executive director , Bruce Voeller , received a ( modest ) salary , and it favored the suits of lobbyists over jeans , t- shirts and the " zap " actions of the Gay Activist Alliance .
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force now has offices all over the country with a major presence in New York .
In New York , the Empire State Pride Agenda with paid lobbyists in New York and Albany and organizers around the state , dominates the movement in New York politics .
The city also has lots of LGBT political clubs , mostly Democratic but also the Log Cabin Republicans .
Diverse New York has also had a wealth of racial and ethnic LGBT groups , including the defunct Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization whose exclusion from the St. Patrick 's Parade sparked international campaigns for LGBT Irish people seeking to participate in mainstream .
( Now gay Irish can march in the parade in Dublin and Queens but still not Manhattan's . )
There are also groups for people of color such as the Audre Lorde Project , named for the late lesbian poet laureate of the state .
Virtually every major religious sect has an LGBT caucus of some kind .
Beyond the City
Stonewall , while a spontaneous reaction to police abuse , resulted from the liberationist and anti-war activism that was in the air in 1969 along with the actions of individual LGBT folk at the bar and in the street that night who collectively reacted with anger to the latest indignity to which they were subjected .
Forty years later , New York City still beckons as somewhat of a Mecca for people who are gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender , though it has become too expensive for many young people just starting out and less than hospitable when you look at the recent false arrests of gay men for prostitution .
At the very least , New York and its gay and lesbian residents sparked a nascent movement that spread across the country and around the globe .
Their effort made it easier for millions of people to live open and satisfying LGBT lives -- without moving to New York .

[ digg - reddit - me ] America has – since its inception – been a major influence on the world order , from the explosive idea of American democracy that reverbrated through Europe in the 18th century – to Woodrow Wilson ’s 14 points and FDR ’s dismantling of the colonial empires and George W. Bush ’s calls for elections to drain the swamps of tyranny .
Since the 20th century , American presidents have been judged in a large part by how they affected the world order .
Which is why today it is worth speculating what impact Barack Obama ’s young presidency will have – and what vision of a world order Obama has already sought to articulate .
I predict – and propose – that Obama ’s vision will be of a world order grounded in the proposal that each nation must obtain the free consent of it ’s people to govern .
This idea is an interesting variation on the themes of American presidents since Woodrow Wilson , and indeed since America ’s founding .
Since the beginning of the 20th Century , American presidents have had an outsize role on the world stage , especially in shaping the world order by laying out standards for the moral legitimacy of nations .
The world order at the turn of the 19th century would be turned on it ’s head by American interventions .
At that point , colonialism was accepted ; the right of a people to govern themselves was not ; and most rules related to international warfare – from standards for treating prisoners to a respect for the sovreignty of nations ( or at least European ones ) .
But this system broke down and conflagration that followed was only ended with timely American intervention .
Woodrow Wilson used this intervention as leverage to explain how the world order should change – and his vision of a world at peace captured a weary Europe .
At the core of Wilson ’s Fourteen Points was an amendment to the world order , as Wilson saw peace as contingent on granting peoples ’ their right of self - determination :
We are glad , now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples , the German peoples included : for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience .
The world must be made safe for democracy .
Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty .
We have no selfish ends to serve .
Wilson believed this goal – of democracy and therefore , peace – was best accomplished and maintained through treaties and a League of Nations .
Of course , we all know that Wilson ’s vision collapsed as he lay debilitated by a stroke and the Senate refused to ratify the treaty he had fought for .
The next three presidents had a less expansive view of the American role in the world – and mainly ignored foreign policy matters .
Franklin Roosevelt focused on domestic matters as well as he sought to end the Great Depression at home .
But as he positioned the country to enter World War II he framed the conflict as one of democracy against tyranny .
And FDR saw the colonialism of Europe as another form of tyranny .
Thus , as he , Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin decided on the outline of a post - war world , FDR was able to secure the independence of many countries throughout the world from their colonial masters in Europe .
At the same time , he bargained away Eastern Europe to the tyranny of Communism , convinced that the Soviet Union would take it anyway .
FDR thus set in motion a new world order in which colonialism was no longer tolerated , but Communism was .
This set up the Cold War as a battle of two competing attempts at changing the world order .
Truman , Eisenhower , and JFK were less concerned about shaping the order of things than they were in securing advantages against the Soviet Union .
What mattered more than how a regime acted or how it was legitmized was whose side it was on .
So , while all spoke highly of democracy – they were willing to accept all allies in their struggle against the Soviet Union – democratic or not .
And they were willing to overthrow democratically elected governments if it fit their interests .
Later , Richard Nixon , as a proponent of real politik , did not believe in the attempts to shape the world order with moral commandments , and thus he did not attempt to do so .
But his significant contribution was to recruit China into the American - led world order ( or at least ensure that it was not opposed to it ) – thus paving the way for its gradual acclimation to the American - led order over the next decades .
When Jimmy Carter came into the White House , he attempted to redefine again what the world order saw as a legitimate government .
Rather than focusing on the struggle against the Soviet Union , he attempted to set universal standards by which to judge both the American - led order and the Soviet order .
He described this universal standard as “ human rights ” :
Because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere .
Our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights .
We do not seek to intimidate , but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well - being of all people .
With his focus on human rights , Carter and more hawkish liberals such as Scoop Jackson attempted to point out the grave flaws of the Soviet system .
This focus also explains why Carter championed the rights of Palestinians and pushed the Shah of Iran to allow greater freedoms to his citizens to protest his regime , leading in 1979 to his downfall .
Ronald Reagan used this foundation to call the Soviet Union the “ evil empire ” – though he abandoned the self - criticism that came with setting a universal standard .
However , Reagan soon began to see the Soviet Union and the leaders he met with as more than the caricatures of evil he had railed against – and he sought to negotiate , to the consternation of many of his staff .
Reagan believed that Communism was contrary to human nature – and that traditional forces – greed , laziness , religion – would be its downfall .
Reagan ’s genius was to combine in clear , forceful terms the human rights approach of Carter with the anti-tyranny framework of FDR – and to push the world to reject the Soviet world order as “ evil . ”
Perhaps more importantly , he benefited from America ’s dynamic economy and the Soviet Union ’s dependence on oil revenues which , in sinking , sank the USSR .
George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton – despite all the talk of a “ New World Order ” as the Soviet Union fell – only sought to enforce through diplomacy , sanctions , and when necessary military action , the previous conceptions of the world order .
Bush condemned the crackdown at Tianamen on Carter - like human rights grounds and pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait as he violated the primary rule of the world order for the past century : do not invade another country .
Bush and Clinton did begin to expand free trade as a component of the world order – and Clinton sought to create a consensus around amending the world order – creating delegitimizing exceptions beyond invading sovereign nations and the maltreatment of prisoners for terrorism , genocide , the development of weapons of mass destruction , and drug trafficking .
With September 11 , though , George W. Bush felt compelled to shake up the world order – and instead of seeking mere amendments , he sought to change the basic ground upon which a regime was legitimized , recalling Woodrow Wilson ’s demand and justification for self - determination .
As Bush declared in his second inaugural :
We have seen our vulnerability and we have seen its deepest source .
For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder , violence will gather and multiply in destructive power , and cross the most defended borders , and raise a mortal threat .
There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment , and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant , and that is the force of human freedom .
We are led , by events and common sense , to one conclusion :
The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands .
The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world .
America ’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one .
But while Wilson had sought to use the leverage America had in the aftermath of the War to End All Wars , and FDR sought to use the leverage America in the aftermath of World War II , Bush seemed to believe the sheer rhetorical power of his words were enough .
As Gregory Scoblete described it :
President Bush did speak out boldly against North Korea and Iran .
And both made considerable gains in their nuclear capabilities .
From Egypt to Georgia , President Bush … wrote rhetorical checks he had no intention ( or ability ) to cash .
George W. Bush had radically declared that no nation was legitimate if it was not a democracy – and he declared that it was a vital national security interest for America to ensure that other nations were in fact democracies .
This – if applied – would overturn the entire world order .
Under this Bush Doctrine , America would become a revolutionary state exporting our values via force , invading for ideology , and fomenting revolution .
It would mean that many of our allies were illegitimate governments .
But these powerful words were undercut by apparent hypocrisy – as Bush , after insisting on elections , rejected those whose results came out contrary to his wishes – from Hamas in Palestine to Chavez in Venezuala
At the same time , Bush was open to charges of hypocrisy as he had supported a coup against the democratically - elected Hugo Chavez – and as he rejected the election of Hamas in the Palestinian territories .
This freedom he sought to export to the world was also threatening to many – as majority - Muslim nations and their sharia law were seen to conflict with the Western model of freedom .
But the opportunity Bush left Obama was a significant one – by not being Bush , and by being a black man who had captured the imagination of America and much of the world , and most importantly , by coming into office after America ’s radical actions had severely undermined the world order , Obama begins his presidency with a greater opportunity to re-shape the world order than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt .
It remains to be seen what Obama will do with this opportunity – and if he will pursue the agenda that some in his campaign , including Samantha Power , believe is necessary – reinventing the international institutions maintaining the world order .
So far , what Barack Obama has seemed to suggest is an amendment to Bush ’s radical notion of democratic revolutions in his Cairo speech , as he referred not to “ democracy ” but to “ consent ” :
So let me be clear : no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other .
That does not lessen my commitment , however , to governments that reflect the will of the people .
Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way , grounded in the traditions of its own people .
America does not presume to know what is best for everyone , just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election .
But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things : the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed ; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice ; government that is transparent and does n’t steal from the people ; the freedom to live as you choose .
Those are not just American ideas , they are human rights , and that is why we will support them everywhere …
No matter where it takes hold , government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who hold power : you must maintain your power through consent , not coercion ; you must respect the rights of minorities , and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise ; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party .
Without these ingredients , elections alone do not make true democracy .
America has re-defined its moral goals for the world over the past century : from self - determination , to freedom from tyranny , to freedom from Communism , to human rights , to the free market , to democracy , and now , with Obama , the consent of the governed .

The general availability of the second service pack for Windows Vista is just around the corner .
Microsoft is reportedly gearing up to make the gold bits for Vista SP2 available for download for all users of the operating system on May 26 , 2009 .
The Redmond - based company has so far failed to confirm or deny such a scenario .
In fact , it has been completely mute on the specific date when it plans to start rolling out the RTM development milestone of Vista SP2 .
As was the case with Vista SP1 , Vista SP2's RTM and GA , deadlines did not coincide .
However , while with SP1 , Microsoft provided explanations related to incompatibility problems for the delay of the service pack , it did not do the same with SP2 .
The final bits for SP2 were signed off at the end of April 2009 .
Actually , it was on April 29 that Vista SP2 was released to manufacturing , with the software giant indicating that public availability was set in the second quarter of 2009 .
The May 26 delivery date for Vista SP2 comes from TechARP , and is unconfirmed by Microsoft .
Still , the Redmond - based company did manage to provide a heads up as to the vicinity of the Vista SP2 GA earlier this month .
On May 21 , a representative of the Microsoft Update team indicated that the Vista SP2 RTM bits , and along with them those of Windows Server 2008 SP2 RTM , would be offered in the “ coming weeks . ”
Again nothing specific , but the notification does prove that the software giant is gearing up to deliver the second service pack for Windows Vista .
In a sense , Microsoft has already made the first step on the path to general availability , as the DVD ISO images of Windows Vista SP2 were made available on MSDN and TechNet to the company 's communities of developers and IT professionals .
But it wo n't be long now before the service pack hits the Download Center along with Windows Update and Windows Server Update Services .

Some players historically take a while to get going , and some start off blazing hot and then cool off .
Here we take a look at five pleasant surprises , and five busts through the first 40 or so games of the 2009 season .
Top 5 Suprises
1. Zack Greinke , SP , Kansas City Royals
—
One of the reasons the Royals are off to a great start is that Greinke has found his rhythm , to the tune of 7 - 1 with a 0.82 ERA , as well as 73 strikeouts and 12 walks in just 66 innings .
Greinke has given up a microscopic six earned runs so far .
Six !
It ’s not like the kid was n’t talented , but his career record before 2009 was 34 - 45 and his ERA 3.96 .
2. Jason Bartlett , SS , Tampa Bay Rays — Before this season , Bartlett was a career .285 hitter with 16 career home runs .
So far this season , he ’s off to a wicked start–.376 batting average , 6 homers , 23 RBI , 9 doubles , 12 stolen bases and an OPS of 1.004 .
3. Raul Ibanez , OF , Philadelphia Phillies — This is looking like the free agent signing of the off - season .
Or maybe coming over to the world champs from soggy Seattle was a good move .
Ibanez was a respectable .288 hitter and was averaging 22 homers and 95 RBI , but so far in 2009 he ’s hit 15 home runs and driven in 40 runs , while hitting .349 with 10 doubles , 4 stolen bases and a .724 slugging percentage .
You think the Mets should have made a run at the guy instead of wasting all that money on P Ollie Perez ?
4. Aaron Hill , 2B , Toronto Blue Jays —
It ’s not like Hill did n’t have potential , but an injury de-railed him in 2008 .
Maybe he ’s come back with a bionic bat , because he ’s hitting .352 with 11 homers and 35 RBI .
Before this season , Hill ’s career high in home runs was 17 , so at his current pace he will shatter that mark ..
5. Shairon Martis , SP , Washington Nationals — Who ?
I mean , who ?
But here is this Nats ’ pitcher with a blistering 5 - 0 record on a team that ’s 12 - 28 , worst record in the majors .
If you ’re keeping score at home , that means Martis has 42 % of his team ’s wins .
Honorable mention : Trevor Hoffman , RP , Milwaukee Brewers — Since coming off the DL to start the season , Hoffman is 11 for 11 in save opportunities in 12 innings pitched with 10 strikeouts for his new team .
Top 5 Busts
1. David Ortiz , DH , Boston Red Sox — Okay , so maybe he ’s injured and all , but did anyone expect this ?
Ortiz is batting .211 with one home run and 18 batted in with a .324 slugging percentage .
To put that in perspective , his career averages are 35 homers , 120 RBI , .285 average and .547 slugging percentage .
Something is afoot at Fenway , dude .
2. Chien -Ming Wang , SP , New York Yankees — This is almost unfair because Wang is currently rehabbing an injury , but still .
Wang had 38 wins in 2006 and 2007 combined , and this season got off to a rocky 0 - 3 start with an astronomical 34.50 ERA — giving up 23 hits and 23 earned runs in just six innings of work .
Yikes .
3. Jimmy Rollins , SS , Philadelphia Phillies —
It ’s a good thing the Phils picked up Ibanez , because their perennial MVP candidate is batting just .234 with 2 homers and 15 batted in with only 5 stolen bases and 1 triple .
Rollins has never been a huge power guy , but he ’s averaged .276 with 38 steals per season over the course of his career .
4. Cliff Lee , SP , Cleveland Indians — The reigning AL Cy Young was 22 - 3 with a 2.54 ERA in 2008 .
This year he ’s off to a 2 - 5 start but his ERA is still a very respectable 2.90 .
You can blame this one on the Tribe ’s inability to score runs like they normally do .
5. Brian Giles , OF , San Diego Padres — Sure , he ’s getting long in the tooth , but Brian Giles is a lifetime .291 hitter who averages 25 homers and 95 batted in .
In 2009 , he ’s off to a .161 start , with 2 homers and 15 RBI , and a paltry .235 slugging percentage .
Honorable mention : Jason Giambi , DH , Oakland Athletics — You ’d think the change of scenery would energize Giambi , but he ’s hitting just .208 with 3 home runs and 18 RBI so far .

The government has told Bank of America it needs $ 33.9 billion in capital to withstand any worsening of the economic downturn , according to an executive at the bank .
If the bank is unable to raise the capital cushion by selling assets or stock , it would have to rely on the government , which has provided $ 45 billion in capital through the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
It could satisfy regulators ’ demands simply by converting non-voting preferred shares it gave the government in return for the capital , into common stock .
But that would make the government one of the bank ’s largest shareholders .
Executives at the bank , one of the largest being examined , sparred with the government over the amount , which is higher than executives believed the bank needed .

設定
Git には様々なオプション設定がある。中には挙動を大きく変えるものもあるので注意が必要である。
設定をすべて表示す る
$ git config -- list
システム ( /etc/gitconfig ) の設定
$ git config -- system -- list
や、ユーザーごと ( ~/.gitconfig ) の設定
$ git config -- global -- list
など表示する対象を絞ることもできる。
ユーザ名とメール・アドレスを設定する
$ git config -- global user.name " John Doe " $ git config -- global user.email " john.doe@example.com "
コミットする時に記録されるユーザー名とメール・アドレスである。
エイリアスを作成す る
$ git config -- global alias .co checkout
これで git co = git checkout になる 。
エディタを設定す る
$ git config -- global core.editor vim
ページャーを設定す る
$ git config -- global core. pager " nkf -s | LESSCHARSET=utf - 8 less "
msysgit ではコミット・ログや diff の日本語が文字化けしてしまうので nkf 等を使って対処してやる必要がある 。
~/.inputrc : 最近の msysgit ではマルチバイトの扱いの設定は
/etc/inputrc で設定済みなので、~/.inputrc
で設定してやる必要は無い。
less : 最近の msysgit では日本語を扱えるものなので差し替える必要は無い。
改行コードの扱いを設定する
$ git config -- global core.autoCRLF false
true にすると、コミットする時に CR＋LF を LF に変換し、チェックアウトする時に LF を CR+LF に変換する 。
リポジトリごとに設定する
$ git config user. name " Jane Doe "
設定は .git/config に保存される。
基本
リポジトリの作成からコミットその他、ローカル・リポジトリでのブランチ内作業をざっとまとめる。
リポジトリを作成す る
$ git init
いつでもどこでも git init で
Git リポジトリを作成することができる 。
他のリポジトリをクローンしてリポジトリを作成する
$ git clone git@yourbox.com :/var/git/my_project clone_project
カレント・ディレクトリに clone_project というディレクトリが作成され、そこにリポジトリが作成される。
リポジトリごとに無視するファイルの設定する
リポジトリのルート・ディレクトリに .gitignore という名前のファイルを作成すると、無視するファイルを設定できる ( # で始まる行はコメントとみなされる ) 。
*.log db/schema.rb db/schema.sql
Git はデフォルトで空のディレクトリを無視するので、 log / という名前のディレクトリを含めたいが中にあるファイルは無視したいというような場合は、 .gitignore に log /* を加えた上で log/.gitignore を作成すれば良い。
touch log/.gitignore
全リポジトリ共通の .gitignore を設定する
$ git config -- global core.excludesfile $ HOME/.gitignore
*.bak や .DS_Store などいちいち指定するのは手間なものをまとめて指定したい場合は
~/.gitignore を作成して core.excludesfile に指定すると良い。事情があって特定のリポジトリで ~/.gitignore で無視するようにしているファイル ( 例えば *.bak ) を無視しないようにするには、そのリポジトリの .gitignore で、
!*. bak
などと行頭に !
を付けてやれば良い。
すべてのファイルをステージに追加する
$ git add .
カレント・ディレクトリのすべてのファイルとディレクトリがステージに追加される。
ステータスを表示す る
$ git status
ファイルが更新されたかどうか
ファイルがステージに追加されたかどうか
ファイルが新しく作成されたかどうか
などといったカレント・ブランチの状態が表示される。
コミットす る
$ git commit -m " First import "
ステージに追加されたファイルだけがコミットされる。
管理下のファイルを表示する
$ git ls- files
コミット前のファイルや .gitignore で指定されているファイルは表示されない。
ファイルを管理下から削除する
$ git rm < filename >
次にコミットした時に管理下から削除される。ファイル自体も削除されるので注意が必要。
変更されたファイルをステージに追加してコミットする
$ git commit - a
削除されたファイルは反映されるが、新たに作成されたファイルはステージに追加されない。
ファイル名を指定してステージに追加する
$ git add < filename >
コミットする時に同時に差分も表示する
$ git commit -v
git commit と git diff の結果がまとめて表示される。もちろんそのままコミット・メッセージを入力してコミットできる。
コミット・メッセージを指定してコミットする
$ git commit -m " This is the message describing the commit "
- m オプションを付けない場合は、設定済みのエディタ ( core.editor ) でコミット・メッセージの編集画面が開かれる。
コミットをやり直 す
$ git commit -- amend
直前のコミットをなかったことにしてやり直すことができる。
$ git reset -- soft HEAD ^ $ git commit -c ORIG_HEAD
と実行するのとほぼ同じである。
コミット・ログを表示する
$ git log
デフォルトではコミットのIDやコミットしたユーザー名とメール・アドレス、コミットされた日付、コミット・メッセージが表示される。
簡潔なコミット・ログを表示する
$ git log -- oneline
各コミットが一行にまとめられたフォーマットで表示される。
詳細なコミット・ログを表示する
$ git log -- stat
コミット・メッセージに加えて、ファイルに加わった変更が + と - の記号でおおまかに表示される。
コミット・ログをリリース・ノート向けに整形して表示する
$ git shortlog
そのままリリース・ノートに貼り付けられるようにコミット
ID 等を省いてコミット・メッセージのみを羅列したフォーマットに整形する。
GUI で履歴を表 示
$ gitk -- all
gitk は日本語をうまく扱えない 。
GUI で表示できます！という程度のものと思っておいた方が無難。
Mac OS Xなら GitX が良いという話である 。
$ git config -- global gui.encoding utf -8
とすると UTF - 8 のファイルの変更差分が文字化けしなくなる
( コミット・メッセージは常に文字化けしない)。設定しない場合はシステムのデフォルト・エンコーディング
( Windows なら Shift_JIS ) で表示しようとする。この設定は Git Gui と共通で、 gitk の設定ダイアログでは設定できない 。
タグを付け、リモート・リポジトリにタグをプッシュする
$ git tag " v1.3 " $ git push -- tags
GitHub ではタグをプッシュすると、自動的に tar - ball ( zip - ball ) を作成してくれる 。
ブランチ
Git での開発作業はブランチを作成することで始まり、そのブランチを削除して終わる。
ブランチを作 成
$ git branch < branchname >
作成するだけで、そのブランチに切り替わりはしない。
リモート・リポジトリにブランチをプッシュする
$ git push origin < branchname >
オプションを省略した場合は設定 ( push . default ) によって挙動が大きく変わる。
リモート・リポジトリのブランチをダウンロード
$ git fetch origin < remote branchname > :< local branchname >
ダウンロードして < local branchname > でブランチを作成するのみ。
ローカル・リポジトリにあるすべてのブランチを表示する
$ git branch
カレント・ブランチの前に * が付く。
すべてのブランチを表示する
$ git branch - a
リモート・リポジトリのブランチも表示される。
ブランチを切り替え る
$ git checkout < branchname >
ブランチを作成して切り替える
$ git checkout - b < branchname >
< branchname > でブランチを作成し、すぐにそれに切り替える。
$ git branch < branchname > $ git checkout < branchname >
と実行するのとほぼ同じである。
ブランチを削除す る
$ git branch -d < branchname >
削除しようとしたブランチが他のブランチにマージされていない場合は削除することができない。
ブランチを強制的に削除する
$ git branch - D < branchname >
マージされていないブランチも強制的に削除することができる。そのブランチでの作業を復活させることはできない。
master ブランチでの変更点ををカレント・ブランチに反映させる
$ git rebase master
まずカレント・ブランチでの変更点を一時的に退避させた後、カレント・ブランチを master ブランチの最新の状態に合わせ、カレント・ブランチでの変更点を順に反映していく。 rebase は強力で便利ではあるが、多くの危険も持ち合わせている。使用にあたっては git help rebase を熟読した方が良い 。
xyz ブランチを master ブランチにマージさせ る
まず master ブランチに戻る 。
$ git checkout master
二つのブランチの差分を確認する。
$ git diff master xyz
xyz ブランチを作成した後に master ブランチへ何かしらの変更が加わっていた場合には、両ブランチの最新版同士の差異が表示される。場合によってはそのままマージすると面倒なことになるので、事前に xyz ブランチで `git rebase master` として master ブランチでの変更点を反映させるなどの下準備が必要になるだろう。
マージする 。
$ git merge xyz
マージした結果をコミットしない
$ git merge -- no - commit xyz
通常はマージした結果コンフリクトが無かった場合は自動的にコミットされる。
マージする前の状態に戻す
$ git reset -- hard ORIG_HEAD
マージした直後の場合 ( マージした結果が既にコミットされている場合 )
ORIG_HEAD はマージする前の HEAD になる 。
他のローカル・ブランチの特定のコミットだけをマージする
$ git cherry - pick < commit ID >
コンフリクトの解 決
各ファイルに追加されたコンフリクトのマークを目印にして、手作業でファイルを編集しコンフリクトを解決する。そしてステージに追加し、コミットする。
現在のブランチをリセットする
$ git checkout -f
すべてのコミットしていない変更点は破棄され、ブランチの最新のコミットの状態に戻る。 svn revert 相当である 。
ファイルをリセットす る
$ git checkout < filename >
< filename > のすべてのコミットしていない変更点は破棄される。
リモート・リポジト リ
分散型バージョン管理システムである
Git はリモート・リポジトリを手軽に扱うことができるように作られている。
リモート・リポジトリに名前をつけて追加する
$ git remote add laptop duo2book.local:repos/m_project
リモート・リポジトリはいくつでも追加することができる。
リモート・リポジトリの変更を取得する
$ git pull laptop
リモート・リポジトリをコピーする
$ git fetch laptop
ローカル・ブランチ同士をマージする
$ git merge laptop / xyz
カレント・ブランチに laptop / xyz ( リモート・リポジトリのブランチ ) をマージする 。
リモート・リポジトリの情報を表示する
$ git remote show laptop
リモート・リポジトリのURLやブランチの一覧、ローカル・リポジトリのブランチとの対応などが表示される。
ローカル・リポジトリのブランチとリモート・リポジトリののブランチを関連付ける
$ git branch -- track local_branch remote_branch
git push や git pull のオプションを省略した時のターゲットとして使われる 。
オプションを指定せずにプルする
$ git pull
カレント・ブランチがリモート・リポジトリのブランチと関連付けられている場合、オプションは省略することができる。例えば、友人
( Bob ) の upgrade というブランチを bobs_upgrade に関連付ける一方で、 origin の master ブランチを master ブランチに割り当てるなど、別々のリモート・リポジトリのブランチを関連付けることもできる。
ローカル・ブランチからプルする
$ git pull .
experimental
ローカルの experimental ブランチからプルする。この場合は merge と等価で、オプションも共通である 。
git -stash
ブランチと似た動作をするが、一時的な変更に特化させることによって、 git branch と git commit 、 git merge 等を駆使して行うことを 、
$ git stash $ edit something $ git commit - a -m " fix something " $ git stash pop
というように簡潔に行えるようにするコマンドである。
コミット前の変更を一時的に退避させる
$ git stash save < stashname >
それまでの変更点を < stashname > に保存した後、前回のコミット時の状態に戻す。オプションは指定しなくても良く、 git stash だけで自動的に名前が付けられて保存される 。
退避させたスタッシュをすべて表示する
$ git stash list
スタッシュはいくつでも作ることができる。
退避した変更を復活させる
$ git stash apply
最新のスタッシュから退避した変更を復活させるだけ。オプションとして < stashname > を指定すると特定のスタッシュから退避した変更を復活させることができる。
$ git stash pop
とすると、最新のスタッシュから退避した変更を復活させた上でそのスタッシュを削除する。
スタッシュの削 除
$ git stash clear
すべてのスタッシュを削除する。特定のスタッシュを削除する場合は clear オプションの代わりに drop オプションを使う 。
$ git stash drop < stashname >
スタッシュを復活させることは非常に困難である。
git-svn
Git から Subversion リポジトリを扱うことを可能にするコマンドである。
SVN リポジトリをクローンしてローカル に
Git リポジトリを作成す る
$ git - svn clone < svn repository url >
SVN リポジトリの各リビジョンごとにダウンロードし 、
Git のコミット・ログを作成しなおすので、履歴が多いほど時間がかかる。
リモートの SVN リポジトリにコミットす る
$ git -svn dcommit
リモート・リポジトリ ( SVN ) での変更点をローカル・リポジトリ ( Git ) へ反映させ る
$ git -svn rebase
svn update や git pull と似たような動作をする 。

First , let me say that it is really a complete misnomer to refer to “ gene patents ” because despite what the popular press may write , and perhaps believe , genes are not patented .
Nevertheless , I will cave into the masses and concede ( at least for now ) the linguistic high ground and refer to gene - related innovations that are examined by patent authorities and provide exclusive rights to owners as “ gene patents . ”
This is , however , a big part of the problem facing the US patent system and patent systems around the globe insofar as genetics , bio-technology , software and business method patents are concerned .
Because we live in a world dominated by sound bites and pithy commentary , reality and truth are frequent victims of easy , misleading and sometimes completely inaccurate reporting .
While it is admittedly important and necessary to dissect and present complex information to those who are unfamiliar but interested , this desire to inform cannot and should not be at the expense of accuracy .
Intellectual honesty must not be replaced by dumbing down the debate to the point where people can understand the concepts , but the information conveyed is wrong .
Individuals , including members of Congress , make decisions based on the information they receive , and when that information is inaccurate , misleading and / or wrong , bad decisions result , which can not be deemed acceptable to anyone .
It is critical to understand the broader context of the debate , and to get to the heart of the matter so that an open , honest and fair debate of the issues can take place .
With this in mind , lets explore how so - called gene patents came about .
The overwhelmingly most important development was the United States Supreme Court decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty , which occurred in 1981 .
In this case the US Supreme Court determined that living matter could be patented .
This has lead to many throughout the anti-patent community to become incredulous , but how many of them have actually taken the time to familiarize themselves with the case or the patent involved ?
I suspect the answer is few , if any , have really explored what this case was all about , choosing rather to focus on the pithy sound bite explanation I set forth a few sentences ago , which is typically all the reporting you ever hear about the case .
[ Bio - Pharma ]
In this case the US Supreme Court determined that a live , human - made micro-organism is patentable subject matter under 101 .
The inventor , Chakrabarty , created a genetically engineered bacterium capable of breaking down multiple components of crude oil .
This unique characteristic was possessed by no naturally occurring bacteria , and it was believed that this genetically engineered bacterium could have significant value for the treatment of oil spills .
The Supreme Court explained that Chakrabarty ’s micro-organism constituted a “ manufacture ” or “ composition of matter ” within the meaning of US patent laws .
Further , the Supreme Court explained that when Congress chose such expansive terms as “ manufacture ” and “ composition of matter , ” modified by the comprehensive “ any , ” the intention was unambiguously to give wide scope to the patent laws , at least in terms of what is capable of qualifying for patent protection .
Of course , it is important to keep in mind that the fact that something is patentable subject matter is but one of the inquiries on the road to patentability .
So many who are offended by some patents , such as software patents , business method patents and bio -tech patents , either intentionally or unknowingly think that if something is patentable that means a patent will issue .
When those in the patent industry talk about something being patentable , at least in this context , we are referring to but one of the patentability requirements .
An invention still has to be useful , new , non-obvious and described sufficiently to inform the relevant public how to make and use the invention .
In any event , while laws of nature , physical phenomena , and abstract ideas are not patentable , Chakrabarty claimed a heretofor previously unknown and unnatural creation ; namely a nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter , which was a product of human ingenuity .
If there is concern whether such human - created life should be patentable subject matter that is a matter of policy for Congress , not for the courts .
The courts are supposed to interpret the law , not make the law .
In this context the law is incredibly clear — “ anything under the sun that is made by man ” is patentable subject matter in the United States , and quite obviously the genetically created living matter at issue in Chakrabarty qualified as “ made by man ” and was , therefore , correctly determined to be patentable subject matter within the dictates of US patent law .
The History of Gene Patents Part II will pick up from here with discussion of patents related to genetically engineered oysters and the so - called Harvard Mouse , which were additional steps down the patent path , toward where we are today .
Pirates are believed to be holding Capt Richard Phillips US crew members have recaptured their ship after it was hijacked by Somali pirates , but their captain is still being held hostage by the attackers .
The Maersk Alabama was taken by the pirates about 500 km ( 311 miles ) off Somalia 's coast after a lengthy battle .
The crew later fought back and retook the ship , but the captain was captured by the pirates who fled in a lifeboat , crew members have told US media .
A US warship and other vessels are speeding towards the scene .
The cruise - missile carrying USS Bainbridge is among the ships the US Navy has despatched , officials told the Associated Press .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the government was following the situation very closely and urged the world to act to end the " scourge " of piracy .
' No injuries ' US media have telephoned members of the ship 's crew to get details of their struggle against the pirates .
Second mate Ken Quinn told CNN how the crew captured one of the pirates and kept him tied up for 12 hours .
As they attempted to negotiate the release of their captain , who has been named as Richard Phillips , they freed the captive attacker .
But the gang refused to free Capt Phillips .
" Right now they want to hold our captain for ransom , and we are trying to get him back , " second mate Quinn said .
" So now we 're just trying to offer them whatever we can - food .
But it 's not working too good . "
He said the attackers had fled in a lifeboat and crew members were using radios to keep in contact with Capt Phillips .
In a statement , the ship 's owners , Maersk , confirmed much of the sailor 's account .
" The armed hijackers who boarded this ship earlier today have departed , however they are currently holding one member of the ship 's crew as a hostage , " Maersk said .
" The other members of the crew are safe and no injuries have been reported . "
Upsurge in hijackings
The ship was first attacked by several pirate boats in the early hours of Wednesday .
It is not clear how many attackers were involved , but accounts from the sailors on the Maersk Alabama suggest that four boarded the vessel .
Maritime officials said the ship took all possible evasive action before it reported that the pirates had boarded .
Pirate attacks have been increasing rapidly in recent years - more than 130 incidents were reported in 2008 , including almost 50 successful hijacks .
Pirates typically hold the ships and crews until large ransoms are paid by the shipping companies - last year the firms handed over about $ 80 m ( £ 54 m ) .
After a lull earlier this year , this was the sixth ship seized off Somalia in the past week .
The attacks are threatening to destabilise one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .

The Big Picture
Credit & Copyright : Dennis di Cicco ( TWAN ) & Sean Walker , Skyandtelescope.com
Explanation : Intricate , glowing nebulae that shine in planet Earth 's night sky are beautiful to look at in deep images made with telescopes and sensitive cameras .
But they are faint and otherwise invisible to the naked - eye .
That makes their relative location and extent on the sky difficult to appreciate .
So , consider this impressive composite image of a wide region of the northern winter sky .
With a total exposure time of 40 hours , the painstaking mosaic presents a nebula - rich expanse known as the Orion - Eridanus Superbubble above a house in suburban Boston , USA .
Within the wide and deep view are nebulae more often seen in narrower views , including the Great Orion Nebula , the Rosette Nebula , the Seagull Nebula , the California Nebula , and Barnard 's Loop .
The familiar constellation of Orion itself is just above the foreground house .
Brightest star Sirius is left of the roof , and the recognizable Pleiades star cluster is above the tree at the right .
A version of the big picture that includes simple constellation guidelines is available here .
And the BIGEST question of them all .................. What was the REAL story behind Rich , WB2OTK and the FCC ?
The new law will take effect immediately .
Legislators voted in favor of the measure by wide margins on several votes today ( vetoes of both House and Senate bills had to be overcome in each chamber ) : 67- 0 and 64- 0 in two votes in the House , and 35 - 3 in both House votes .
This marks yet another victory for marijuana reformers in 2009 , a year that has seen major advancements toward the inclusion of marijuana reform in the mainstream political lexicon .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger suggested a public debate on marijuana legalization in May , after the state 's budget crisis and the Mexican drug war added some rationales to reform efforts .
A Field poll showed 56 percent of Californians in support of outright legalization .
President Obama , who had pledged to back off federal raids on medical marijuana users and sellers , took office , and with him new drug czar Gil Kerlikowske , who does n't support legalization but oversaw the implementation of a decriminalization program as Seattle 's chief of police .
The new administration is viewed in the marijuana reform community as much easier to work with than the previous one , and as having a much friendlier approach to reformers ' goals .
Rhode Island 's action " is of actual significance because it is the first state to take an existing medical marijuana law and add state licensed dispensaries to it , " Mariuana Policy Project Communications Director Bruce Mirken said .
" This is a direct result from a more enlightened policy from the administration , " Mirken said , citing Attorney General Eric Holder 's cessation of medical marijuana raids .

Elizabeth Warren : Finally someone with a clue how to handle the financial crisis
Warren ’s the chief watchdog for the 700 billion TARP fund .
Unfortunately , she has no real power , but it ’s still nice to see a government official say not just some of the right things , but almost all of the right things .
Talk of how the US is following Japan ’s path is finally everywhere ( myself and a few others have been talking about it for years , and started really beating the drums last year ) .
Here ’s Elizabeth :
Warren , a Harvard law professor and chair of the congressional oversight committee monitoring the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) , is also set to call for shareholders in those institutions to be “ wiped out ” .
“ It is crucial for these things to happen , ” she said .
“ Japan tried to avoid them and just offered subsidy with little or no consequences for management or equity investors , and this is why Japan suffered a lost decade . ” … …
Warren also believes there are “ dangers inherent ” in the approach taken by treasury secretary Tim Geithner , who she says has offered “ open- ended subsidies ” to some of the world ’s biggest financial institutions without adequately weighing potential pitfalls .
“ We want to ensure that the treasury gives the public an alternative approach , ” she said , adding that she was worried that banks would not recover while they were being fed subsidies .
“ When are they going to say , enough ? ” she said .
She also calls for the resignation of the CEOs of the worst firms .
One thing I ’m tired of hearing though is the phrase “ lost decade ” .
Japan did n’t just lose a decade , it has never really recovered .
The good times have never come back .
I also think that bondholders need to take a haircut as well , not just shareholders , though they may not need to be wiped out in all cases .

Dutch supermarkets are hoping to phase out the use of cash by 2014 , the Financieele Dagblad reports on Thursday , quoting the retail board CBL .
The aim of the ban on cash is to make supermarkets less vulnerable to armed robberies , the paper says .
According to CBL research , 87 % of customers support moves to stimulate the use of direct debit cards .
The Telegraaf reports that € 10bn of supermarket total turnover of over € 30bn last year was in cash .
Supermarkets had to deal with 200 ‘ incidents ’ , ranging from a grab at the cash register to armed robbery , the paper said .
Other solutions will be found for customers who do not want to use direct debit cards , a CBL spokesman said .
‘ Technology is making enormous advances .
Trials are also being done with payment by mobile phone , but you can also pay with a finger print or iris scan , ’ the spokesman said .
The Dutch consumers association said the move was ‘ going too far ’ .

Why you need your own company 2009 - 06 - 10
It was early 2008 .
I had agreed to sell my company — my sole obsession of the last 10 years .
The paperwork was processing .
I hated having 85 employees .
It had become a little hell .
I needed to get away and clear my mind .
I went as far away as I could — to a hot - springs Shinto shrine on a volcano at the southern tip of Japan .
I sat silently .
I steamed .
I soaked .
I slept to the sounds of the sea .
I could not have been more relaxed .
My head was empty .
For the first time in ten years , I had nothing I needed to do .
No responsibilities .
No plans .
What a relief , right ?
Can you imagine ?
I brought along the great book “ Seeking Wisdom ” , and read in my peaceful Japanese ocean - facing room .
The book was great .
Charlie Munger ’s thoughts on behavioral finance were brilliant and contrarian .
This book was inspiring all kinds of entrepreneurial ideas that I wanted to try !
When I was at CD Baby , I ’d be able to play with new ideas immediately .
Any time I had an idea , I ’d be able to test it out within days .
But now , for the first time in 10 years , since I had no company , I could n’t test out these new ideas !
All I could do was read , think , and maybe write about it .
Damn !
Then I realized why I need to start a new company .
Not for the money .
Not because I ’m “ bored ” .
But because a company is a laboratory to try your ideas .
The word “ laboratory ” is defined as a room for research , experimentation or analysis .
I think of it as a sandbox or playpen .
Realizing this in my peaceful hot - springs , I caught a train back to Fukuoka , and jumped into action .
I started MuckWork so I could play with crowdsourcing while helping people get their boring work done .
I re-launched MusicThoughts to experiment with a fully multi-lingual site .
And this made me happier than doing nothing .
This is n’t work , it ’s play .
It ’s my place to try my ideas .
We all need some time off .
A change of scene and pace .
Silence and solace if we ’re stressed .
Reckless adrenaline if we ’re in a rut .
But for those of us who think that an eternal escape from work would be paradise , do n’t forget that we all need a playground , and your own company is one of the best playgrounds of all .
There ’s a great quote from Australian psychiatrist W. Béran Wolfe : “ If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat , writing a symphony , educating his son , or looking for dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert . ”
And another from psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky : “ Find a happy person , and you will find a project . ”
Computer manufacturers are starting to make it easy to recycle your retired computers and peripherals .
It will take a little extra work on your part , but it ’s worth it would n’t you say ?
So stop piling your old equipment in a bin in the alley or stacking it on the curb .
They ’ll end up in landfills or shipped to other countries where they ’ll foul up the environment for years to come .
Plus if you play your cards right and you ’re disposing of computers of a relatively modern vintage , there ’s the possibility of earning some cash back .
But before you responsibly recycle your old gear , take some precautions like completely wiping those hard drives .
I do n’t mean to imply that these services are shady , but you just ca n’t account for everyone that may come in contact with your old stuff once it leaves your hands .
Most asset recovery programs will certify that the data on your drives has been wiped , but this is a step you ’ll want to do in - house , especially if they stored any sort of confidential , proprietary , personal or customer data at any time .
Listed below are the computer recycling programs for the major IT brands you ’re likely to be using at your office and / or home .
Let ’s start with the undisputed industry leader in this regard , Dell .
Dell
Dell offers free recycling to Home , Home Office , and Small Business Customers for Dell branded equipment .
What if you do n’t have a Dell system ?
If you happen to be shopping for a new Dell system and make a purchase , they ’ll recycle your old PC and monitor regardless of brand for free .
If you ’re a large business , things are a bit more complicated but not unmanageable .
This requires you to interact with your Dell rep as part of their Asset Recovery service .
They ’ll help you resell your old servers and guarantee that the drives on those units have been scrubbed .
If there ’s no value in hardware , Dell will recycle them .
HP
HP will see to it that your old equipment gets a new life or a recycled afterlife via a couple of programs and trade - in / up partnerships .
For instance , recycling HP ink and toner cartridges is free .
HP also offers free consumer recycling for HP and Compaq branded machines .
It will require that you embark on a slightly intimidating clickfest but you will emerge from it with nothing to pay out of pocket provided that you ’re indeed recycling those HP and Compaq relics .
IBM
Business clients ( the vast majority of you ) are better off contacting their rep for info on IBM ’s asset recovery programs .
You ’ll find that they can help tailor an arrangement that will help you properly and security dispose of your old IT gear along with the possibility of recapturing a sliver of that initial investment .
Individuals have a tougher time of it , but that ’s to be expected when you have an International Business Machine in your possession .
Though they have a partnership with the UPS Store , some states do n’t require manufacturers to take - back their electronics at end - of - life .
And while their website offers direct links to the relevant guidelines by state , there ’s precious little else to be gained .

The Richat Structure or Eye of the Sahara or Earth
Eye of the Sahara ?
Mauritania
The Eye of the Sahara is a magnificent landform located in the southwestern area
of the Sahara desert .
Geologists originally thought the formation was crated when
a meteorite hit the earth , but now believe it was caused by erosion .
Still , the
massive 30 mile diameter and the fact that it has a circular shape makes the formation
quite a mystery .
This spectacular landform in Mauritania in the southwestern part of the Sahara desert
is so huge with a diameter of 30 miles that it is visible from space .
Called
Richat Structure -- or the Eye of the Sahara -- the formation was originally thought to
be caused by a meteorite impact but now geologists believe it is a product of uplift
and erosion .
The cause of its circular shape is still a mystery .
The part of the sedimentary rock corresponding to the white of the eye is a plateau
standing some 200 m above the sand desert .
The Richat Structure corresponding to the
iris of the eye lies in a depression , and the peak of the outer rim is 485 m above sea
level .
The Richat Structure consists of Early Paleozoic rocks , some 600 million years old .
Around the center , rocks resistant to weathering and erosion ( purple and blue - green part )
make 100 m high ridges , and nonresistant rocks ( yellow and brown part ) form valleys .
These
features alternate and are concentric .
Nearly 900 people on the FBI ’s terror watch list applied for and received a certificate to buy a gun in the United States between 2004 and 2009 , according to a Government Accountability Office report released today .
In all , some 90 percent of the people on the watch list who applied passed the required background check , said the report , which was requested by Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D ) of New Jersey .
Gun-control activists say the report demonstrates potentially lethal flaws in gun laws .
But gun-rights advocates counter that the terror list is perhaps a greater menace in itself .
They see it as ripe for manipulation – allowing the government to tar people as terrorists when it is politically expedient to do so .
The FBI can halt the purchase of a gun by someone with a criminal conviction , so the 900 people in the GAO report " are people who have no criminal conviction , but they 're on this mystery list , " says Gary Kleck , author of " Stopping Power : Why 70 million Americans own guns . "
The GAO document is a follow - up to a 2005 report , which said the FBI cleared gun purchases for 80 percent of terror watch subjects who applied .
The current report shows that the percentage has gone up : of 963 background checks , 865 were given the go - ahead – 90 percent .
There 's currently no basis to automatically prevent a person from buying a gun simply because they appear on the terrorist watch list , wrote Ellen Larence , the GAO 's director of homeland security and justice issues .
There must be additional disqualifying factors , such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration status .
Senator Lautenberg calls this " the terror gap , " and he wants to fix it with new legislation .
His proposed law would give the US attorney general broad discretion to stop a purchase , but would also give affected gun-buyers a chance to appeal the decision .
A similar bill failed in Congress last year .
To gun-rights advocates , Lautenberg is essentially trying to undermine the constitutional concept of due process in order to disarm law - abiding Americans .
" This report and the legislation originate from the idea that we can deprive people of basic constitutional protections based on allegations , " says Larry Pratt , executive director of Gun Owners of America .
Gun owners have long said that gun restrictions impinge on due process .
But the issue has taken on added significance in the current political climate , in which the Obama administration – through the Department of Homeland Security – has expressed concerns about the growth of right - wing extremism .
A spate of politically - motivated killings in recent months involving white supremacists and American - born jihadists has only added to this concern .
Now , the report 's conclusions will further play on fears in some quarters that the US government wants to clamp down on gun-owning Americans simply for having conservative views .
When you conflate serious terrorist threats with " a right - wing extremist being anyone not driving a Prius with an Obama sticker , then I start having a little bit of a problem , " says Jeff Knox , director of the Firearms Coalition in Manassas , Va .
Civil libertarians , too , have concerns about the list .
" There 's no way to find out if you 're on the list or not , and no way to assure that you can see the evidence that got you on the list or got you off , " says Chris Calabrese , counsel for the ACLU 's Technology and Liberty Project in New York .
" There 's no reason why it could n't become a political list , " he says .
G-rated films are teaching children about the wonder of love , but only heterosexual love
In the world of Disney , falling in heterosexual love can break a spell , save Christmas , change laws , stop wars and even , in the case of The Little Mermaid , cause an individual to give up her personal identity .
While such dramatic plot twists may keep kids glued to television and movie theater screens , they send a memorable message to impressionable young viewers that heterosexual love is not only the norm , but that it is also exceptional , powerful , transformative and magical , concludes a new analysis of top - grossing G- rated children 's films .
The findings , published in a paper in the latest issue of Gender & Society , challenge the notion that such movies are without sexual content .
The determinations could even help to explain why multiple prior ethnographic studies suggest children understand the normativity of heterosexuality by the time they enter elementary school , relegating homosexuality to the abnormal , unusual and unexpected , necessitating explanation .
According to co-authors Karin Martin and Emily Kazyak , " The media are an important avenue of children 's sexual socialization because young children are immersed in media - rich worlds . "
The University of Michigan sociologists point to other studies that show thirty percent of children under the age of three , and forty - three percent of four - to six - year - olds , have a television in their bedrooms , with many also owning a VCR / DVD player .
For the new study , Martin and Kazyak analyzed all G - rated movies released , or rereleased , between 1990 and 2005 that grossed more than $ 100 million in the United States ( see Supplemental Materials ) .
Three trained research assistants extracted story lines , images , scenes , songs and dialogue that addressed anything about sexuality , including depictions of bodies , kissing , jokes , romance , weddings , dating , love , where babies come from , and pregnancy .
The text describing this material was inductively coded using a qualitative software program .
The analysis found the films " depict a rich and pervasive heterosexual landscape , " despite the assumption that children 's media are free of sexual content .
The movies repeatedly mark relationships between opposite sex lead characters as special and magical .
" Characters in love are surrounded by music , flowers , candles , magic , fire , balloons , fancy dresses , dim lights , dancing and elaborate dinners , " the researchers observed .
" Fireflies , butterflies , sunsets , wind and the beauty and power of nature often provide the setting for -- and a link to the naturalness of -- hetero - romantic love . "
The analysis of the films further determined heterosexuality is construed through depictions of overtly feminized women and masculine males , with the male characters spending much of their time longingly gazing at the former .
Toys and other products tied to the films later reinforce the images .
Such heavily gendered depictions and glorified portrayals of heterosexual relationships appear to maintain old ideals presented in 19th century Brothers Grimm fairy tales , many of which inspired Disney films .
In a separate , earlier study , Western Illinois University 's Lori Baker - Sperry and University of Central Florida 's Liz Grauerholz explored the extent to which " feminine beauty " is highlighted in fairy tales .
They discovered attention to female attractiveness has likely become more prevalent over the past century , with beauty in fairy tales most often associated with " being white , economically privileged and virtuous . "
" We suggest that this emphasis on a feminine beauty ideal may operate as a normative social control for girls and women , " the researchers added .
Together , the two studies indicate children are frequently exposed to powerful , influential media messages concerning both attractiveness and sexuality .
President Obama may have declared June to be Gay Pride Month , but entertainment for children therefore continues to perpetuate a less inclusive message , leaving those outside its confines with little to build their own dreams of happily ever after .
As Martin and Kazyak conclude , " Both ordinary and exceptional constructions of heterosexuality work to normalize its status because it becomes difficult to imagine anything other than this form of social relationship or anyone outside of these bonds . "

So according to the FT , it appears that the banks selling assets will also be able to bid on each other ’s assets .
US banks that have received government aid , including Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase , are considering buying toxic assets to be sold by rivals under the Treasury ’s $ 1,000bn ( £ 680 bn ) plan to revive the financial system .
The plans proved controversial , with critics charging that the government ’s public - private partnership – which provide generous loans to investors – are intended to help banks sell , rather than acquire , troubled securities and loans .
I brought this up when the plan was first released , via a marginalrevolutions ’ post in that link , but the idea seemed so absurd that I did n’t mention it in any subsequent posts .
It is apparently staying , and we need to consider what this will do to the process .
I was out at “ Debaser Night ” , a 90s - music dance party in San Francisco , with some friends .
A riot grrl rock cover band opened , followed by lots of great singles .
I was getting a bit nostalgic .
A friend of mine , who used to be on an energy trading desk back in the early 2000s , was listening to me talk about the government plan .
He could n’t believe what I was telling him about letting the banks that are selling auctions also bid on them .
In the middle of my explanation , he had his own wave of nostalgia : “ Man does that bring back memories … . ”
Before we go there , what will happen with these banks when they can bid on each other ’s assets ?
Let ’s do a thought exercise .
Let ’s say you are a bidder for Bank A .
You know your banking asset is worth $ 50 , and you also know the asset Bank B has is worth $ 50 .
You call your buddy up , the trader at B , and make a deal .
Happens all the time .
You go to bid , and you bid $ 80 for B ’s asset .
Then you wait .
If B does n’t come through , you are screwed out a lot of money .
And hey , is n’t this wrong ?
Well , you are pretty sure one of those Rubin - protégé government whiz - kids has given someone who knows someone you know a wink - wink about this .
You take a drink , steady the nerves .
Then , the bid comes back for your asset – $ 80 from B .
You have each bid up each others assets and traded them .
And now the government is screwed .
Let ’s chart out that payment :
Yup .
Bad news .
Bank A pays $ 6.50 for its new asset because of the leverage , and it loses all of that .
It also loses the $ 50 from not having the asset anymore .
However it gains $ 80 , net profit – same as Bank B .
The government has paid $ 73.50 for a $ 50 asset , twice .
( See previous for how the levered non-recourse loan turns into a put option . )
We tend to call this collusion if you and I did it .
So why did my energy trading friend get all nostalgic ?
“ Because what you are telling me brings back some great memories from what Enron was up to back in the day .
All of us energy traders back then watched with our jaws on the floor .
2000 was a hell of a year . ”
It is August , 2000 .
Let ’s say you are a trader for Enron .
You know your energy in California is worth $ 50 , and you also know the energy that Reliant Energy has is worth $ 50 .
You call your buddy up , the trader at Reliant , and make a deal .
Happens all the time – you even have a nickname for it , The Daisy Chain Swap .
You go to bid , and you bid $ 80 for Reliant ’s energy .
Then you wait .
If Reliant does n’t come through , you are screwed out a lot of money .
And hey , is n’t this wrong ?
Well , you are pretty sure one of those Rubin - protégé government whiz - kids has given someone who knows someone you know a wink - wink about this .
You take a drink , steady the nerves .
Then , the bid comes back for your energy – $ 80 from Reliant .
You have each bid up each others assets and traded them .
And now the government is screwed , because it has to pay you $ 80 .
Let ’s chart out that payment :
You can go ahead and replace an Enron subsidiary for Reliant in that example , as I did in the chart .
Enron did , and the banks are probably going to now .
My friend was very excited telling me all the strategies Enron deployed – “ Forney Perpetual Loop ” , “ Ricochet ” , “ Ping Pong ” , “ Black Widow ” , “ Red Congo ” , “ Get Shorty ” , the whole works – and how all of them will be reliable guides for gaming the legacy asset market here .
Buy assets high , write them down , then pay back with “ fees . ”
Got it .
Create SIV to bid up the profits .
Brilliant .
What is really exciting , from the evil point of view , is the idea that we are going to get to see one giant , massive , Enron Death Star put into play :
The Death Star strategy ( yes , they called it that ) was where Enron would take a fee for relieving a congested market of its excess supply by moving it elsewhere .
Just like our legacy assets !
There are too many of them , it is clogging up trade , let ’s get them to someone else who wants them .
However Enron would just move the energy in a circle , collecting a fee for not doing what it was supposed to .
As their memo famously said , they are paid “ for moving energy to relieve congestion , without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion . ”
And , it appears , that the large banks are gearing up to do just that ; with the Geitner Death Star that they ’ll just be collecting a large fee to run them in a circle , without actually moving any of them off their collective books .
For old time ’s sake , I hope they route their loan bids through Oregon and then Utah before putting them back right where they started .
Mind you that was the electrical grid of California – this appears to be at the scale of the entire financial market .
In case you are wondering , traders out there are licking their lips to try and find ways to game this even better than Enron .
It appears the public will get to invest in these vehicles too .
Direct Democracy in the 21st century means that all of us get to take part in collusion and ripping off taxpayers – we are the ones we ’ve been waiting for !
I ’m not the biggest Enron junkie – else I would have seen this connection sooner .
If any people who know their playbook of strategies want to leave a comment with a move that could be made by the PPIP bidders , I ’d be much obliged .
And please , tell your representatives to keep the selling banks and their subsidiaries from bidding .
I ’m still hoping this part is a bad dream …
Kim Kardashian Makes A Splash Playing Beach Football
Total Pro Sports –
It seems like Kim Kardashian has been taking notes from her boyfriend , and New Orleans Saints running back , Reggie Bush .
She finally got to show those moves off a few days ago on a Miami beach .
We are n’t sure whats more impressive .
He body in a swim suit , or her throwing arm .
Spectators were impressed by the throwing and catching abilities of the busty celebrity .
Dating one of the NFL ’s highly skilled offensive players , it is not hard to determine where she is getting her advice from .
It is good to see she is getting her off season football workout , while Reggie takes some flights at the Red Bull Air Race .
So should we expect to see Kim in attendance to watch her man and the Saints in action this year ?
It seems like she is getting the hang of the sport .
Hopefully she does n’t bring Reggie the same type of luck that Jessica Simpson brings Tony Romo .

What 's this ?
A Mr. William H. Gates , III , ( that would be Bill Gates of Microsoft fame , of course ) is listed as one of the inventors on a recent patent application for an " Electromagnetic engine . "
What 's that mean ?
According to the filing at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , the contraption somehow " converts mechanical energy of a piston to and from electrical energy during each piston cycle . "
There are two engine designs illustrated in the patent , and the basic premise of both is to combine the electrical generating capabilities of a generator with the moving pistons of an internal combustion engine .
Also on the patent filing is a design for a " plasma injector . "
Ostensibly a replacement for a spark plug , the plasma injector would kick off " a chemical reaction " ( think : combustion cycle ) that would be required to get the piston moving in the first place .
It 's all rather interesting stuff , and if you 've got an hour or two ( or ten ) to digest it , click here [ Source : U.S. Patent and Trademark Office via Jalopnik

This is Part IV of a Mother Jones special report on the defense budget .
Click the links for Parts I , II , III , and V .
As the defense budget moves into its final stages , the horse - trading is going to get pretty intense .
Who will be the key players ?
The heads of the appropriations committees act as the ultimate gatekeepers in this process .
In the House that ’s Rep. Dave Obey ( D - Wis. ) , and in the Senate , Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) — or , as he likes to call himself , the “ king of pork . ”
It ’s also worth scrutinizing legislators from states where Boeing is active ( like Missouri , Kansas , Washington , and California ) because Boeing is the contractor hit hardest by the Gates budget .
Here are five lawmakers who deserve extra-close attention :
Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . )
Pet program : Future Combat Systems , which is partly manufactured in Oklahoma
MO : Inhofe will leave no rhetorical bomb unthrown in his battle to save weapons systems which are vital to the nation ’s security and which also happen to be made in Oklahoma .
Here he is standing on a tarmac in Afghanistan charging that Obama is trying to “ disarm America ” to increase “ welfares to an unconscionable high . ”
Sen . Saxby Chambliss ( R - Ga . )
Pet program :
The F - 22 fighter jet is partly manufactured in Georgia .
MO : The Georgia delegation is expected to fight hardest for the F - 22 — it employs around 2,000 workers who construct the plane ’s airframe at a Lockheed plant in Marietta .
Like Inhofe , Chambliss is not a very subtle guy .
He has already said that the administration is “ willing to sacrifice the lives of American military men and women for the sake of domestic programs favored by President Obama . ”
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . )
Pet programs :
The F22 , whose engines are manufactured in Connecticut .
Also missile defense , which is not manufactured in Connecticut .
Lieberman just likes it .
MO : Lieberman is likely to be a major opponent of even small cuts to missile defense .
He may also pull some tricky maneuvering on the VH - 71 presidential helicopter .
He ’ll probably support cutting it , but only because he wants a replacement contract to be awarded to a Connecticut - based company called Sikorsky .
Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa . )
Pet program :
Too many to list
MO : The House ’s reigning porklord originally wanted to add $ 10 to 12 billion dollars worth of extra defense spending to supplemental war spending bills this year .
He did n’t succeed , although the final legislation still contained nearly $ 5 billion for equipment that the Pentagon did n’t request .
Look for Murtha to try again when the House appropriations committee gets its hands on the main defense budget bill .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . )
Pet program : The C - 17 cargo plane .
More than 5,000 workers assemble the C - 17 at a plant in Long Beach , and thousands more work on the plane elsewhere in the state .
MO : For three years the Pentagon has said it does n’t need any more C - 17s , which cost around $ 276 million each .
And for three years California ’s congressional delegation has insisted that the government buy more of them , with Boxer playing a leading role .
This may be the only issue on which she and Republican hardliner Dana Rohrabacher have ever seen eye to eye , although as far as we know only Boxer attempts to justify the program by arguing that the C - 17 comes in handy on humanitarian missions .
This year the plane ’s backers have won out yet again : Congress already inserted $ 2 billion for more C - 17s into the war supplemental legislation .

29 Structural & Civil Engineers Cite Evidence for Controlled Explosive Demolition in Collapses of All 3 WTC High - Rises on 9/11
More than 700 architects and engineers have joined call for new investigation .
For Some , the Doubts Began Early
“ Something is wrong with this picture , ” thought Nathan Lomba , as he watched replays of the Twin Tower collapses on television on September 11 , 2001 .
A licensed structural engineer trained in buildings ’ responses to stress , Lomba saw more on the screen than you or I .
He puzzled , “ How did the structures collapse in near - symmetrical fashion when the damage was clearly not symmetrical ? ”
Lomba was hardly alone in his discomfort .
Most structural engineers were surprised when the towers fell .
They mainly kept their misgivings to themselves , though , as Scientific American and the Journal of Engineering Mechanics , BBC , the History Channel and government agencies such as FEMA and NIST offered varying and often imaginative theories to explain how fires brought the towers down .

Something appears to have gone a little wrong with Terminal Reality ’s PlayStation 3 Ghostbusters engine .
At first touted as their lead platform , the native rendering resolution of the game is a little shocking .
In previous interviews , the game developers at Terminal Reality had talked up their PlayStation 3 technology for their upcoming Ghostbusters game .
In a conversation with VideoGaming 247 Terminal Reality president Mark Randel said :
“ Personally , I want to show off our PS3 technology .
We ’re one of the few developers who love the PS3 and have a great time with it .
We have great technology for the PS3 and we want to show it off .
“ We ’re running the same game for both platforms but if we made a PS3 - only game , for example , you could double the amount of objects on screen that you ’re seeing .
The PlayStation 3 has seven processors and the 360 only has three , so seven versus three means you can do a lot more on the PS3 .
We ’re keeping the game the same over both platforms so we do n’t want to take out any features , ” Randel added .
Alarms were raised after a comparison published on website Lens of Truth .
They pointed out a number of differences that put the Xbox 360 version on top , including a lower texture quality and a mysteriously blurred image .
After the above comments from the developers themselves , you would n’t expect them to shoot themselves in the foot like this .
You can find the Lens of Truth comparison after this link .
What the Lens of Truth were confused about was the resolution of the game .
Was the PlayStation 3 version really running in high - definition at 720 p ?
The answer is ‘ No . ’
We can confirm that the PS3 version of Ghostbusters is natively rendered at 960 by 540 pixels with quincunx AA .
The Xbox 360 version is actually rendered at 720 p ( 1280 by 720 pixels ) with 2xMSAA .
You can find the proof of the PS3 ’s rendering resolution in the below images provided by MazingerDUDE of Beyond3D technical forums , after referring to high - definition Ruliweb footage .
If the PlayStation 3 was able to render so many objects on screen , it certainly appeared to come at a cost to Terminal Reality .
It does n’t look like they ever had the time to refine their PS3 engine and instead heavily compromised the game to get it out the door .
We must certainly question whether it was their ‘ lead platform . ’
We know how good PS3 games can look at 720 p ; you ’ve all seen the incredible gameplay footage of Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves .
So why the mix up between what Terminal Reality said during development and the final product ?
Of course , the team said a lot about objects on - screen , rather than textures and resolution , but that ’s surely pulling the wool over our eyes .
A PSU.com interview might highlight the reason for complimenting the PS3 version of the game ; pressure from Sony Pictures who owns the film ’s rights :
“ Sony and the talent were adamant that before they got involved with a Ghostbusters game , the tech had to be capable of providing an authentic Ghostbusters experience , and that required graphics and physics tech , ” Terminal Reality Executive Producer Brendan Goss told PSU .

" What we ’re most concerned about is things can still get worse . ”
Since Apple integrated age ratings for apps the door has been flung open to adult content on the iPhone .
Whether Apple would actually allow an iPorn app is not known but Hottest Girls makes it ’s shot at the FHM / Loaded / Maxim pin ups .
Hottest Girls comes armed with some 2200 odd pics of ‘ topless , sexy babes and nude models ’ ( the first app to include nudity according to the developer ) .
The app includes a rating system to let the developers know what kind of female flesh takes you fancy for refreshing the library of pics and lets you save the pics to your camera roll to do what you will with them .
So for less than a cup of coffee you can get what you really buy FHM for , not the cars , gadgets or the interviews , the women of course , in the palm of your hand .
The 17 + rated Hottest Girls is available in the App Store for $ 1.99 ( £ 1.19 ) .
[ Via Macenstein ]
UPDATE :
The app has been pulled from the App Store and according to the developers site it ’s because they wholly under estimated the popularity of the app and their servers just ca n’t take it .
Allen
The Geek is insisting that the app will be back soon and that the grounds for removal from sale are n’t because of the adult content .
Whether the app returns to the App Store with the content intact remains to be seen .
Will Apple smite the slightly risquÃ© app from it ’s Store blocking it ’s return ?
It will be interesting to find out whether Apple really has let any kind of content lose with the App Store age restrictions .
UPDATE 2 :
Looks like Apple did indeed pull the app from the App Store .
No porn for you young Timmy !
Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content .
The developer of this application added inappropriate content directly from their server after the application had been approved and distributed , and after the developer had subsequently been asked to remove some offensive content .
This was a direct violation of the terms of the iPhone Developer Program .
The application is no longer available on the App Store .
Looks like it ’s back to web apps for the porn industry , sorry you aint getting on Apple ’s pride and joy .

With Dick Cheney and the infamous torture memos making headlines , President Obama and our nation face a choice .
Should they prosecute or protect those responsible for the torture of detainees in secret CIA detention centers ?
If our leaders wish to steer our country back to the right side of the law , they must act immediately and unequivocally to prosecute .
The problem is that leading senators want the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to complete its investigation into the treatment and interrogation of detainees ( which could take between four and six months ) , before any prosecution is launched .
Yet such a delay would potentially risk running out the clock on certain types of prosecution .
The federal Anti-Torture Act , for example , is subject to a statute of limitations after only eight years .
For the prosecution of crimes committed in the months leading up to September 2002 – when Bush administration lawyers produced the first of the " torture memos " that purported to make torture legally permissible – that expiration date is spring 2010 .
But there is no need to wait that long .
There is already ample evidence that shows the previous administration concocted , approved , and implemented a torture policy .
What 's more , there is no legal imperative holding the Department of Justice or federal prosecutors back from launching a criminal investigation , beginning with the task of identifying who is responsible for the crimes that have already been documented .
Although the Senate Intelligence Committee report may eventually provide some insights , it cannot be a substitute for the criminal investigations required for prosecution .
But given the committee 's possible complicity in allowing torture to continue despite multiple Central Intelligence Agency briefings , we should not expect its report to break much new ground .
When Mr. Obama rescinded the torture memos upon taking office , he took an important first step toward repairing the damage wrought by the previous administration on our country 's commitment to human rights and rule of law .
But his statement in April to forgo prosecution of those CIA agents who carried out torture is a breach of international law .
Some critics argue that a full investigation might lead the US public to ultimately side with torture and thus prosecution could be politically counterproductive .
Others argue that prosecuting hundreds of people would waste resources during a war on terror , and that it should stay focused on going after terrorists .
However , the International Convention Against Torture , adopted by the United States in 1994 , compels the US to prosecute everyone who is responsible for torture , all the way up the chain of command to top government officials who authorize it .
Obama himself said in April that he's " a strong believer that it 's important to look forward and not backwards , and to remind ourselves that we do have very real security threats out there . "
At the same time he also said that " nobody is above the law , and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing , that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen . "
The law allows no exceptions .
Congress also has an urgent and important role to play :
It must eliminate a loophole written into the 2005 Detainee Treatment Act .
That piece of legislation contains provisions that were crafted to provide legal cover to torturers .
This includes the defense that those who committed torture believed the acts were legal at the time , since they had been interpreted as such by the White House torture memos ( none of which carried the force of law ) .
Legislators must also attend to the back end of the accountability process by eliminating or extending the statute of limitations beyond 2010 , as Rep. John Conyers ( D ) of Michigan has proposed .
Efforts to hold torturers and torture enablers accountable have been launched abroad , most notably in Germany , Italy , and Spain .
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón , a central figure in the prosecution of Gen. Augusto Pinochet , is an example of a quick , effective actor .
He recently launched an investigation into the Bush administration last month over the alleged torture of four Spanish nationals at Guantánamo under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction .
He also has ordered an inquiry into whether or not six former Bush administration lawyers created a legal framework to permit torture .
Should the Spanish court ultimately indict anyone pursuant to these claims , it is unclear whether the Obama administration would extradite former US officials .
But such a development might , at the very least , prevent those former officials from traveling anywhere in the European Union and further discredit their already tainted legacies .
The Obama administration promised a new era of international cooperation and respect .
It now faces the first major test of its rhetoric .
If the US fails to prosecute those responsible for torture , we can take our place alongside countries we have long criticized for privileging politics over justice and accountability by letting criminals go free .
Beyond the United States ' global standing , the former administration 's policies also made Americans less safe by providing recruiting tools for terrorists .
The Obama administration must show that such abuses wo n't stand .

Allies : Christian beliefs cost Texas schools chief his post School board reins yanked from McLeroy
Supporters say his Christian beliefs cost him the post

AUSTIN —
In a rare rejection of an appointment by the Texas governor , the Senate Thursday ousted Don McLeroy as chairman of the State Board of Education , with his supporters claiming the Bryan dentist was the victim of his strong religious beliefs .
McLeroy is a devout Christian who believes in creationism and the notion that the Earth is about 6,000 years old .
He has steadfastly argued that Texas students should be taught the weaknesses of evolution .
His opponents portrayed him as “ a decent human being ” lacking leadership skills to chair the board divided between social conservatives and others .
He will remain a member of the board .
“ It ’s not about evolution versus creationism , and it ’s not about Democrats versus Republicans , ” Sen . Kirk Watson , D - Austin , told his colleagues .
“ This is not about partisanship .
Please forget all the shouting and protests about this nomination from day one .
This is about his leadership as chairman . ”
McLeroy ’s hometown senator , Steve Ogden , R - Bryan , defended the chairman , saying “ his service has not been incompetent , illegal or out of bounds . ”
“ I think Texas is watching here because I think , whether intentional or not , there will be a perception … that we are applying a religious test for serving in this state , ” Ogden said .
Earlier this year , the State Board of Education approved new science curriculum standards that changed a long - standing Texas tradition over how schoolchildren learn about evolution .
The vote did away with a provision that Texas students be instructed on the strengths and weaknesses of evolution and the theory about the origin of life developed by Charles Darwin 150 years ago .
“ If this is n’t about evolution , if this is n’t about what the Bible teaches , what is it all about ? ” asked Sen .
Dan Patrick , R- Houston , referring to opposition to McLeroy .
Democrats argued that McLeroy ’s leadership has polarized the board , and that he has disregarded experts in the shaping of science curriculum standards and English , language arts and reading standards for 4.7 million Texas public school children .
“ The state board has become increasingly divided and deeply dysfunctional and almost paralyzed to action at certain times , ” Sen. Leticia Van de Putte , D - San Antonio , said .
Senate confirmation of gubernatorial appointments requires a two - thirds vote .
McLeroy won the support of all 19 Senate Republicans , but 11 Democrats voted against him .
It takes 11 votes to block an appointment .
Sen. Eddie Lucio , D - Brownsville was present but did not vote .
The Senate seldom rejects gubernatorial appointments .
The Senate ’s blocking of McLeroy will force Gov. Rick Perry to appoint a new board leader .

Backbars on social link - sites is a GreaseMonkey script to turn the headlines and comments of social link - sites into ambient bar charts ( of votes / diggs / views / users … )
It works on Reddit , Delicious , Digg , Hacker News , and Stack Overflow ( and MetaFilter now ! ) .
The idea is to give you subtle non-verbal clues to improve your browsing experience almost subconsciously .
The backbars do n’t replace the count they represent , what they do is convey you its magnitude unobtrusively , and , crucially , compare that magnitude to those around it .
So you can now see , almost without thinking , that , say , some comment is popular , but that there ’s a comment around that ’s twice as popular .
Once you have it , just start browsing at your favorite social link - site : Reddit , Delicious , Digg , Hacker News , and Stack Overflow .
It ’s the first release but it ’s very usable already , I hope .
I hope you enjoy and find it useful , please let me know what you think of it in the comments .
Here ’s what the backbars mean :
For Reddit , they are a headline ’s votes , a headline ’s number of comments , and a comment ’s votes .
For Delicious , the numbers of users that have bookmarked a link , or applied a tag .
For Digg , a headline ’s diggs , a headline ’s number of comments , and a comment ’s diggs .
For Hacker News , a headline ’s upvotes , a headline ’s number of comments , and a comment ’s upvotes .
For StackOverflow , a question ’s views , an answer ’s votes , the number of users that have applied a tag , and a user ’s reputation score .
For Metafilter , an article ’s number of comments and the number of users that have favorited a comment .
There are some other very minor special cases too , but hopefully they are self explanatory by their context .
( Javascript geeks might want to take a look at the source code , it can get messy as all scraping , but I think it ’s a good example of the power and elegance that Javascript and jQuery allow . ) )
Changelog : June 12 , 2009 : Stopped messing Hacker News ’ comment threading sometimes .
June 12 , 2009 : Added support for MetaFilter !
( Note that in MeFi , at most 200 backbars will be drawn , or not at all , for performance reasons . )
Made comment author backbars more accurate .
Jan 17 , 2010 : Added the script to github , http://github.com/elzr/Backbars/, to continue its development there .
Everyone ’s invited to pitch in !
Changed to minified jQuery .
Dr. Sabin was leading the research on the " live " version of polio vaccine , and stood bitterly and condescendingly against Dr. Jonas Salk 's less - tested , more - risky " killed " version .
When the manufacture of some of Salk 's vaccine was butchered by a pharmaceutical company , Sabin helped get its use stopped , for months .
Unknown numbers of kids became victims of polio , in part because Sabin insisted the production mistakes meant the Salk vaccine itself was n't safe .
Years later , Sabin awoke with body - wide , sometimes paralyzing , intense pain .
There was no diagnosis and no relief .
Only years later , as Sabin recounted through tears , did the searing pain abate .
He had totally misunderstood his job , he said .
He had wasted his gifts .
He had forgotten that the first task of the doctor is relief of pain .
Cure , restoration , research - each was vital .
But only when his own pain became the only thing in his life , did he understand what it meant to be a patient , and how wrong he had been during the most dramatic medical events of his life .
I 'm not kidding myself here .
Hannity does n't have the material to work with , to manage a full - scale epiphany .
To use an unkind phrase we use to bat back and forth at ESPN : No pain , no gain ; no brain , no pain .
But his offer the other night to Chuck Grodin to ' prove ' that waterboardng is n't torture by allowing it to be done to him , is too important to pass up , because of the image it will certainly produce .
No matter what he says afterwards or how he tries to laugh it off , Hannity 's certitude will be smashed by Hannity 's natural , human panic .
He does n't have to become Dr. Sabin for more than ten seconds .
And many , maybe most , of his viewers , will join him in the collective post - waterboarding lie that he never feared for his life .
Regardless , the impact will be sufficient .
If it changes the minds of one percent of his supporters , it will have been worth it .
And think about the vast numbers of people who have no idea who he is , or who I am , or what this site is , who will know only that a boastful man literally had reality forced upon him .
Thus last night I made my offer to Hannity .
He told Chuck he'd do it for families of the troops , and he'd let Chuck do it ( Grodin demurred ) .
Those were his only conditions .
I 'll add a few :
Hannity may be waterboarded live on his show .
All I require is that a trustworthy outside observer be present to make sure the waterboarding is a legitimate recreation of what we did to detainees .
Chuck Grodin is perfectly acceptable , or Hannity may nominate an alternate , but I must approve the identity of the observer .
Hannity may instead be waterboarded on tape if he prefers .
In that event , I require that at least one non-Fox camera crew be permitted access to record all events , along with a trustworthy outside observer .
Again , Grodin will be fine .
Hannity must identify the charity or charities , organization or organizations , to which he wants the donation made , so I can verify in advance that the money will indeed get to the families of American troops .
The organization cannot be sponsored by , nor affiliated with , Hannity or his employers .
I will donate $ 1,000 ( one thousand dollars ) for every second of water - boarding Hannity endures .
We will start the clock the moment the first water is poured on him .
The clock will stop when Hannity confesses or begins to shout or scream on a prolonged basis , or the medical supervisor determines he is danger of organ failure .
If Hannity admits afterwards he was afraid for his life and that waterboarding is indeed torture , I will double my total contribution .
And I will repeat this offer each night on Countdown until he agrees or declines .
UPDATE , 12:54 PM
EDT : I think we 're going to have to have a simulated interrogator there .
And yes , he 's going to have to admit to something instead of just saying " stop . "
A simulated interrogator will have to be present and vocal , insisting Hannity confesses .

The purpose of government is for those who run it to plunder those who do not .
Throughout history , governments have used violence , intimidation , coercion , and mass murder to enforce this system .
But governments ' first line of " defense " is always a blizzard of lies — about its own alleged benevolence , altruism , heroism , and greatness , along with equally big lies about the " evils " of the civil society , especially the free market .
The current economic crisis , which was instigated by the government 's central bank and its boom - and - bust monetary policies , among other interventions , has once again been blamed on " too little regulation " and too much freedom .
Will Americans ever catch on to this biggest of all of government 's Big Lies ?
When the Pilgrims came to America , they nearly starved to death because they adopted communal agriculture .
When William Bradford , leader of the Mayflower expedition , figured this out he reorganized the Massachusetts pilgrims in a regime of private property in land .
The incentives created by private property promptly created a dramatic economic turnaround and the rest is history .
Most history books ignore this reality , however , and blame the starvation crisis of the Pilgrims on corporate greed on the part of the Mayflower company .
After the American Revolution , it was imperative to build roads and canals so that commerce could expand and the economy thrive .
George Washington 's
Treasury secretary , Alexander Hamilton , declared in his famous Report on Manufactures that private road and canal building would never succeed without government subsidies .
President Thomas Jefferson 's
Treasury secretary , Albert Gallatin , concurred .
Meanwhile , private capital markets and the private " turnpike " industry were busy financing thousands of miles of private roads without any governmental assistance .
When government did intervene in early - American road building , it was a financial catastrophe almost everywhere , so much so that by 1860 only Missouri and Massachusetts had not amended their state constitutions to prohibit the use of tax dollars for " internal improvements . "
Americans have been taught by their government - run schools that the post - 1865 Industrial Revolution was bad for the working class , which made government regulation of work and wages , and the creation and prospering of labor unions necessary .
In reality , people left the farms for factories because the latter offered far better wages and working conditions .
Between 1860 and 1890 , real wages increased by 50 percent in America , as myriad new products were invented , and made available to the common working person thanks to low - cost , mass production .
It was capital investment that dramatically increased the productivity of labor , allowing hours worked to decline from an average of 61 hours per week in 1870 to 48 hours by 1929 .
Higher worker productivity , fueled mostly by capital investment by entrepreneurs and private investors , also made it less necessary for families to force their children to work .
Child labor was on the wane for decades before government got around to regulating or outlawing it .
And when it did so it was to protect unionized labor from competition , not to protect children from harsh working conditions .
The " robber barons " of the late 19th century robbed no one .
Most of them made their money by providing valuable — if not revolutionary — goods and services to the masses at lower and lower prices for decades at a time .
John D. Rockefeller , for example , caused the price of refined petroleum to drop from 30 cents per gallon in 1869 to 8 cents in 1885 , and continued to drop his prices for many years thereafter .
James J. Hill built the most efficient and profitable transcontinental railroad without a dime 's worth of government subsidy .
In return for their remarkable free - market success the government prosecuted both of these men , kangaroo court style , under the protectionist " antitrust " laws .
The real " robbers " were politically connected businessmen like Leland Stanford , a former California governor and senator , who succeeded in getting laws passed that granted his company a monopoly in the California railroad business .
The federal antitrust laws were passed beginning with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 because the government informed Americans that industry was becoming " rampantly cartelized " or monopolized .
In reality , prices everywhere were plummeting as new products and services were being invented everywhere .
The entire period from 1865 to 1900 was a period of price deflation .
As I show in How Capitalism Saved America , all of the industries accused of being monopolies by Congress in 1889 – 1890 had been dropping their prices for at least a decade thanks to vigorous competition .
And it was not a result of the idiotic theory of " predatory pricing . "
No sane businessperson would intentionally lose money for decades by pricing below cost with the hope that he would somehow frighten away all competition forevermore .
Everyone " knows " that President Herbert Hoover was a staunch advocate of laissez - faire economics , and it was his lack of interventionism that caused the Great Depression .
This is the biggest governmental lie in the history of America .
Hoover was a " progressive " ( as today 's socialists , also known as " Democrats , " have taken to calling themselves ) .
Hoover strong - armed corporate executives into raising wages at a time when wages needed to adjust downward in the free market in order to minimize unemployment .
He devoted 13 % of the federal budget to a failed " stimulus " program of pork - barrel spending and imposed some of the biggest tax increases in history to fund it all .
He was a protectionist who signed the notorious Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act , which increased the average tariff rate to nearly 60 percent and spawned a worldwide trade war that shrunk world trade by two - thirds in three years .
He cartelized the agricultural industry with " farm boards " that began the insane practice of paying farmers for not growing crops or raising livestock .
He pioneered the politicization of capital markets by creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation .
And he ranted and raved against " greedy capitalists " while launching numerous government " investigations " of investors and the stock market .
FDR 's top domestic advisor , Rexford Tugwell , said that his fellow New Dealers " owed much to Hoover , " who began many of the policies that they simply extended .
Every time the price of gasoline goes up significantly , Congress convenes a Nuremburg Trial–style inquisition of oil - company executives .
This practice began in the 1970s when the government 's own foolish price controls on petroleum products caused massive shortages , and it needed someone to blame .
Oil company executives are never praised when gasoline prices fall , as they have in the past year from over $ 4 / gallon to under $ 2 / gallon in many parts of the United States .
Most recently , the current economic crisis is said to be caused by the " excesses " of economic freedom and " too little regulation " of the economy , especially financial markets .
This is said by the president and numerous other politicians , with straight faces , despite the facts that there are a dozen executive - branch cabinet departments , over 100 federal agencies , more than 85,000 pages in the Federal Register , and dozens of state and local government agencies that regulate , regiment , tax , and control every aspect of every business in America , and have been doing so for decades .
Laissez - faire run amok in financial markets is said to be a cause of the current crisis .
But the Fed alone — a secret government organization that is accountable to no one and which has never been audited — performs hundreds of regulatory functions , in addition to recklessly manipulating the money supply .
And it is just one of numerous financial regulatory agencies ( the SEC , Comptroller of the Currency , Office of Thrift Supervision , FDIC , and numerous state regulators also exist ) .
In a Fed publication entitled " The Federal Reserve System : Purposes and Functions , " it is explained that " The Federal Reserve has supervisory and regulatory authority over a wide range of financial institutions and activities . "
That 's the understatement of the century .
Among the Fed 's functions are the regulation of
Bank holding companies
State - chartered banks
Foreign branches of member banks
Edge and agreement corporations
US state - licensed branches , agencies , and representative offices of foreign banks
Nonbanking activities of foreign banks
National banks ( with the Comptroller of the Currency )
Savings banks ( with the Office of Thrift Supervision )
Nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies
Thrift holding companies
Financial reporting
Accounting policies of banks
Business " continuity " in case of an economic emergency
Consumer - protection laws
Securities dealings of banks
Information technology used by banks
Foreign investments of banks
Foreign lending by banks
Branch banking
Bank mergers and acquisitions
Who may own a bank
Capital " adequacy standards "
Extensions of credit for the purchase of securities
Equal - opportunity lending
Mortgage disclosure information
Reserve requirements
Electronic - funds transfers
Interbank liabilities
Community Reinvestment
Act subprime lending requirements
All international banking operations
Consumer leasing
Privacy of consumer financial information
Payments on demand deposits
" Fair credit " reporting
Transactions between member banks and their affiliates
Truth in lending
Truth in savings
That 's a pretty comprehensive list , the result of 96 years of bureaucratic empire building by Fed bureaucrats .
It gives the lie to the notion that there has been " too little regulation " of financial markets .
Anyone who makes such an argument is either ignorant of the truth or is lying .
Blizzard is on full publicity mode today , with a number of sites posting preview stories and interviews with the people behind the game .
StarCraft 2 is one of the most anticipated games of the year , and with Blizzard promising a new version of Battle .
net launching alongside the game and three single - player full - game releases instead of one game with three campaigns , there are many questions gamers have about the product .
We 've scoured everyone 's coverage to try to pick out the surprising , the odd , and the downright cool details from each one , bringing you a gaggle of StarCraft news .
Let 's get started .
There may not be LAN play , and do n't expect a console port
Rob Pardo is the VP of Game Design , and he had strong words for LAN play when he spoke with IncGamers .
" We do n't have any plans to support LAN , " he told the site , also saying , " We will not support it . "
The issue of a console port also came up .
" We have tried in the past , we actually tried the original StarCraft on Nintendo 64 .
It works , it 's playable , it 's just such a different playability gameplay experience than on PC and we really do n't want to have it be that different , " they said .
Pardo said the chances of the game coming to a console are " zero percent . "
A lack of LAN play would be a serious omission to fans of the series ; StarCraft is still a popular choice at LAN parties and gaming cafes around the world .
There has to be some way to link up computers and play against each other without being online ... right ?
StarCraft II lead producer Chris Sigaty and lead designer , Dustin Browder said they were still discussing it .
That 's not the most reassuring answer .
Expect huge , almost cinematic battles in single - player
" We have missions where the lowest level of the terrain gets flooded by lava every five minutes — if you do n't get off low ground , you die .
We 've got missions where hordes of infested Terrans attack , but only at night , " Browder told Destructoid .
" You have to hold off at night , and then during the day , it's ' EVERYONE GO OUT AND KILL 'EM WHILE THEY SLEEP !'
We 've got missions where you 're trying to defend an infested colony .
We 've got missions where you control a single Ghost , trying to change the tide of a war . "
Even the units are different in the single player .
" Like Medics ?
I 've got a couple upgrades to the Medics that would blow them off the charts , " Browder explained .
" They 'd never last in multiplayer — like it 's way too powerful , so we could never do it .
But in solo play , we can .
That 's why we do n't have Medics in multiplayer , but we do in solo . "
The goal is to use each level as a way to explore the game 's mechanics , to create something almost like a minigame , and to feature things you wo n't see in multiplayer or in skirmish mode .
It 's this sort of dedication and creativity that will make players more forgiving of the three - game strategy when it comes to the single - player , although there are almost no details about the Zerg or Protoss campaigns yet .
The game will be noob - friendly
" We expect a lot of casual WOW players to go , ' Hmm , I want to check out StarCraft 2 , ' and we want to help those players . "
Chris Sigaty told 1up .
" We want to cut down on the amount of newbies jumping into a match and
getting their asses handed to them as their initial online experience . "
So what steps have they made to make that happen ?
The tech tree can now
be viewed from within the game , and includes information about what
units are used to counter each character or vehicle , as well as what
units it 's strong against .
Replays will include much more information , with players being able to toggle overlays that detail actions per minute , number of units created , number of units killed , and much more information about how each player is performing .
Every time you play a game the replay is automatically saved as a tiny file , so you 'll be able to save a huge number of matches and take a look at your performance .
There will also be Challenges that explain certain concepts to players through in - game scenarios , such as how to effectively counter certain units , how to efficiently gather resources , that sort of thing .
By playing Challenges , gamers will be able to get their heads around higher - level tactics and strategies , making them better equipped to play online .
There will also be casual leagues for those who want a friendly game online .
It 's most likely going to completely awesome
With this new rush of information available , it seems as if Blizzard has upped the quality and number of features on damn near every aspect of the game .
While there are still more questions than answers when it comes to the new Battle .
net system , we 're getting close to learning more as the beta looks to be getting closer .
Blizzard has promised us four beta keys so we can play inter - office Ars Technica 2v2 , so you can expect more coverage as soon as the beta hits .
Until then , fiendish anticipation .

In a surprising announcement today , Australia kicked off its AUS $ 43 billion " National Broadband Network , " which it calls the " single largest national - building infrastructure project in Australian history . "
Not only will the fiber network reach all the way to 90 percent of Australia 's homes , but it will also be open access and available for use by any ISP .
The National Broadband Network ( NBN ) scheme has been progressing for some time , but when we last looked in on it in 2008 , it was a fiber - to - the - node plan that would offer Australians 12 M bps minimum connections .
It was also going to be built by a private company , but incumbent telcos like Telstra ( which was government - owned into the 1990s ) quickly began to make noise about the open access rules — such conditions might not offer enough of a return on investment .
Critics were aghast .
Why would the government invest taxpayer money into a private network that might neuter the open access rules ?
And why bother at all with fiber - to - the - node , when Telstra 's last - mile copper network would still be needed for last - mile access at low speeds ?
The Rudd government appears to agree with critics .
Telstra 's bid was disqualified last year for not meeting the project criteria , and the government has decided to get directly involved in a much faster " next - gen " network .
Today 's announcement signaled the government 's intent to create a private / public company to build the new network , with the government owning at least a 51 percent stake .
The goal is a fiber - to - the - home network that will reach 90 percent of Australian homes ; the rest will be linked with 12 M bps minimum wireless and satellite connections .
The new company will build and operate the network , but the NBN will feature " separation between the infrastructure provider and retail service providers . "
Australia 's future Internet will depend exclusively on this fiber backbone ( it 's possible that private companies will build another one , though the cost of such a redundant system makes this unlikely ) , but the backbone will be open to any ISP .
The government concluded that none of the bids for the original fiber - to - the - node system " offered value for money , " and it said that a panel of experts had suggested fiber - to - the - home as a better long - term investment .
Given the state of broadband in Australia — which generally features low DSL speeds and low data caps — the move might turn out well for customers , but it wo n't be so great for Telstra , which runs the existing copper infrastructure .
As the Sydney Morning Herald pointed out today , " Telstra was recalcitrant at every turn , playing hardball with the competition regulators and the Government .
It lost its right to take a role in partnering the Government by not delivering a conforming bid in December ...
Telstra has now been caught flat - footed . "
Telstra 's reputation has not been helped by charges that it already makes things difficult for ISPs that want access to its last - mile lines .
Australia 's competition regulator even filed a federal lawsuit against the company three weeks ago .
Deployment of the new network is set to begin in 2010 with an initial investment of AUS $ 4.7 billion from the government .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
The Israeli military 's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the Gaza offensive " was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes , " Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) said in a report on Wednesday .
Human Rights
Watch says Israel used white phosphorus shells over populated areas in Gaza .
" In Gaza , the Israeli military did n't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops , " said Fred Abrahams , a HRW senior emergencies researcher .
" It fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas , even when its troops were n't in the area and safer smoke shells were available .
As a result , civilians needlessly suffered and died . "
Entitled " Rain of Fire : Israel 's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza , " the 71 - page report provides " witness accounts " and " presents ballistics evidence , photographs , and satellite imagery , as well as documents from the Israeli military and government . "
HRW is an independent international organization dedicated to defending and protecting human rights .
The group urged Israel and the United States to investigate the attacks .
Israel should prosecute those who carried them out and the U.S. government , which supplied Israel , should look into the issue .
HRW said white phosphorous was a chemical substance dispersed in artillery shells , bombs and rockets , used primarily to obscure military operations .
" ( While ) it is not considered a chemical weapon and is not banned per se , it ignites and burns on contact with oxygen and creates a smokescreen at night or during the day to mask the visual movement of troops .
" It also interferes with infra-red optics and weapon - tracking systems , thus protecting military forces from guided weapons such as anti-tank missiles .
When WP comes into contact with people or objects , though , it creates an intense and persistent burn .
It can also be used as a weapon against military targets , " the group said .
In response , the Israeli military said " smoke shells are not an incendiary weapon " and defended its actions .
The Israel Defense Forces said it was close to completing its probe into " the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous . "
" ( The invesitgation ) is dealing with the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous , including , among others , the 155 mm smoke shells which were referred to in the HRW report .
This type of ammunition disperses in the atmosphere and creates an effective smoke screen .
It is used by many Western armies .
" It is already possible to conclude that the IDF 's use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law .
These shells were used for specific operational needs only and in accord with international humanitarian law .
The claim that smoke shells were used indiscriminately , or to threaten the civilian population , is baseless , " the IDF said .
It said " that weapons intended for screening are not classed as incendiary weapons . "
But Abrahams said past IDF investigations into allegations of wrongdoing suggest their inquiry would be neither thorough nor impartial .
" That 's why an international investigation is required into serious laws of war violations by all parties .
" For the needless civilian deaths caused by white phosphorus , senior commanders should be held to account , " Abrahams said .
The report said white phosphorus munitions were n't illegal when deployed properly in open areas , but it determined that the IDF repeatedly used them " unlawfully over populated neighborhoods , killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures , including a school , a market , a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital . "
" First , the repeated use of air - burst white phosphorus in populated areas until the last days of the operation reveals a pattern or policy of conduct rather than incidental or accidental usage .
Second , the IDF was well aware of the effects of white phosphorus and the dangers it poses to civilians .
Third , the IDF failed to use safer available alternatives for smokescreens , " the report said .
A medical report prepared during the recent hostilities by the Israeli Health Ministry said that white phosphorus " can cause serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin , is inhaled or is swallowed . "
The report said that the IDF could have used a non-lethal smoke shells produced by an Israeli company if it wanted to provide a " smokescreen " for its troops .
Israel launched the offensive in late December to take on militants from Hamas , who had been shelling southern Israeli communities for months from Gaza .
The offensive , called Operation Cast Lead , was launched December 27 and ended January 17 with a cease - fire .
Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict , 1,440 were Palestinian , including 431 children and 114 women , a U.N. report recently said .
The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas , and four soldiers killed by friendly fire , it said .
HRW also said it found no evidence that the Hamas militants Israel was targeting in Gaza were using human shields " in the vicinity at the time of the attacks . "
Israel has said Hamas militants used civilians as human shields and fought from civilian locations , HRW points out .
" In some areas Palestinian fighters appear to have been present , but this does not justify the indiscriminate use of white phosphorus in a populated area . "
Co-owner Michal Lotocki ( L ) and a customer argue and insult each other in a friendly way at the ' Casa Pocho ' bar in Cullera , near Valencia , June 18 , 2009 .

MADRID ( Reuters ) - A Spanish bar is encouraging clients to insult its staff and offering free drinks for original or hilarious abuse .
“ When you come in after work , you can say swear at them and call them bastard or imbecile , ” said client Antonio Ossa , who told state news agency EFE the promotion by the “ Casa Pocho ” bar in the southern town of Cullera near Valencia seemed like a good idea to him .
Polish - born bar owner Bernard Mariusz said he thought people needed somewhere to release their frustrations at a time of economic crisis , employing the Spanish language ’s rich store of earthy obscenities .
“ That way they wo n’t let it out on their family , ” he said .
After a 5 - week bull run , investors took a breather and stayed on the sidelines ahead of some US Bank earnings this week .
Profit taking took place as oil slid and the GM saga continued .
It seems that the auto maker is running out of time to restructure and is being herded into Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœtemporaryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ bankruptcy by the US government on or before June 1st .
It looks like this Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœarchaic behemothÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ will be surgically carved into a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgood and badÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ company .
No wonder the greenback came under pressure yesterday and Capital Markets still cannot measure the potential fallout .
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
GS came , delivered , surprised and the market has taken a positive stance on their Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœhigherÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ than expected earnings .
Even Citi has advanced 10 % in the O/N session .
Good bank results will only help the risk sentiment .
Of course all of this depends on the accounting procedures and results , the whitewash effect , can we believe them ?
Will the stress tests inform us that Obama will have to go Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcap in handÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ once again to seek more money to prop up the undercapitalized ?
However , if we take the US financial results at face value , it looks like the banking sector has tentatively recovered and the worst may be over for the financials .
We of course expect other sectors to follow , but they will obviously lag , as company results continue to give a mixed picture .
This morning US retail sales and Fed buy - back program will dominate proceedings .
With markets back at full strength , we will have depth again .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s lack of liquidity had the market gyrating in all directions for little reason .
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.65 % , CHF - 0.81 % and lower against GBP +0.15 % and JPY +0.39 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.28 % and AUD - 0.68 % .
All the North American markets had to chew on yesterday was the BOC outlook survey .
There were very few surprises to be had .
The 1st Q survey showed some improvement in major indicators as expected , but business sentiment remains negative and close to record low levels .
Borrowers reported that credit conditions continued to tight over the last little while , and the countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s output gap widened as sales growth , business investment ( machinery and equipment ) , employment expectations and capacity pressures remain weak , leading many firms to expect a slowdown in input price growth , with some even expecting an outright decline over the next year despite higher energy prices .
Despite this , the loonie remains vulnerable as oil fell yesterday .
The volatile trading range was aided by the Easter Monday holiday in Europe and Asia .
Initially the CAD found support on the back of investors wanting to increase their risk and yield exposure .
But , with oil collapsing close to 4 % , on USD pull backs expect investors to want to sell the currency .
It is anticipated that BOC Governor Carney will announce next week a plan that would Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœflood banks with cash to halt the hoarding of capital and expand lending Ã¢â‚¬â „¢ .
A quantitative easing method has seen currencies depreciate significantly when their governments started the program ( BOE , BOJ , and Fed ) .
For now look to buy USD on pull backs .
The AUD has retreated from its 6 - month high as it was deemed that the recent 3 - day rally was a tad excessive .
Couple this with both Japanese and US equities declining and convincing investors to reduce their demand for higher yielding assets .
For now , look for investors to sell on upticks , of course this depends on how both commodities and investor risk appetite shapes up this morning after US sales data ( 0.7284 ) .
Crude was lower in the O/N session ( $ 49.86 down - 19 c ) .
Crude has started the week under pressure after an IEA report for this year shows that total global demand may fall to its lowest level in 5 - years .
They expect consumption to fall - 2.4 m barrels a day to +83.4 m , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a decline of +2.8 % as worldwide GDP falls by - 1.4 % .
Last week we witnessed prices advancing as the market once again put the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdonkey ahead of the cartÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ believing that global equities meteoric rise since the beginning of Mar. had investors believing that economies are stabilizing and by default increase demand for the black stuff .
The EIA report from last week showed a smaller inventory gain than the earlier API industry report .
Inventories increased + 1.65 m barrels to +361.1 m , while the API report said that stockpiles jumped +6.94 m barrels ( the highest in 20 - years ) .
The bullish report provided temporary market support but with inventories approaching record levels once again has investors thinking twice about investing .
It was the 24th gain in 28 - weeks .
Until we see inventories decline substantially and sustainable demand destruction , there will not be a sustainable price gain .
Industrial reports continue to show that rising oil inventories and falling demand signal that the worst of the recession may not be over .
With US equities under pressure and gold unable to break its support level , investors were happy to own some of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative investment .
However , some vocal analysts are starting to shy away from the commodity as the IMF will be required to offload some of its enormous position to raise capital for various projects and they are encouraging investors to sell on upticks ( $ 896 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,842 down - 81 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,536 up + 46 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,019 up +35 .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 7 bp yesterday ( 2.85 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Despite it being a lethargic trading session , Treasuries rallied as investors and traders continue to speculate that certain banks will require additional cash infusion after the US government completes its stress tests .
Also , the Fed continues its buy - back program until Wednesday this week to try and keep rates low to promote growth .
Expect traders to make the government pay up for off - the - run issues .

The Grey Thumb Archives
History
From late 2005 until some time in 2009 , a social group met in Cambridge , Massachusetts and later Silicon Valley to discuss the creation of life .
Picture a drinking club for wannabe Dr. Frankensteins with a severe case of nerd , and you 're pretty close .
The original Grey Thumb Boston was founded by ( in no particular order ) Adam Ierymenko , Brian Peltonen , Chuck Lewin , Jonathan Klein , and others .
If your name is missing and you want it here , e-mail me .
Later a Silicon Valley chapter was created by Bruce Damer , who also attended a few of the Boston meetings when he happened to be on the right coast .
What brought these folks together was a shared interest in artificial life , a small and aggressively interdisciplinary field of study that brings together ideas from biology , computer science , mathematics , physics , and even philosophy to attempt to study and even create " life as it could be . "
Most of the early work in the field was computational , with Tierra being widely regarded as the first true attempt to simulate open - ended evolution in a computer .
In the past decade some work has been done to attempt to create life in actual biochemical media , with most of this work coming under the related heading of synthetic biology .
Major related areas of study include cellular automata , complex systems , chaos , thermodynamics , economics , game theory , and combinatorics , to name just a few .
The name Grey Thumb was a play on " green thumb , " referring to skill at making synthetic ( " grey " ) things grow .
As for why anyone would want to do this the reasons vary from just tinkering , to harnessing of evolutionary processes to create artificial intelligence , to the quest to define life in a medium - independent way .
Dr. Christoph Adami of Michigan State University was among those who worked with early computational artificial life ( though he never attended Grey Thumb ) , and his TED talk entitled Finding Life We Can't Imagine deals with the sorts of questions that might be answered with simulated (? ) living systems .
Grey Thumb Boston met monthly across most of its life span , first at a small bar and restaurant in Central Square in Cambridge and then later at a larger venue close to MIT .
At its peak it boasted almost a hundred attendees at some meetings .
It brought together people as diverse as students and professors , computer hackers and IT professionals , financial quants and economists , authors , journalists , philosophers , and even folks with no related technical background but who just found the ideas cool .
Like many such things , it eventually came to an end -- though I 've heard rumors of attempts to reactivate chapters in New York City and the San Francisco / Silicon Valley area .
A few years after the last meeting I let the domain lapse and it got gobbled up by a so - called " portal pottie , " one of those fake spam - portals run by domain squatters .
In the last year or two I 've thought about it from time to time and regretted letting its Internet presence fade .
A week or so ago I checked the domain on a whim and ... nothing !
I did a WHOIS and e-mailed the domain 's owner .
He 'd let the domain lapse as well , so I paid him the ransom required to wrench it from the filthy drooling maw of GoDaddy and its " lapsed domain process " or whatever it 's called .
A few days later I got an e-mail : " domain transfer complete , " and now here we are .
What follows is as much surviving material as I 've been able to find .
Thanks to YouTube most of the lectures that were recorded are still available , and many of the projects created by Grey Thumb participants are still online as well .
If you have something you 'd like to add , drop me a line !

ED #109 : Do YOU Really Know What 's Inside Your Computer ?
When we first posted about the availability and sale of Intel Core 2 engineering samples , many people scoffed at the report .
The prevalent opinion was that the issue was n't widespread enough to be of any concern and if anyone got fooled into buying one , well , they certainly got what they paid for .
In other words , it was something worth worrying about .
If anything worried the consumer , it was the counterfeiting of Intel retail processors .
That generated a lot of attention since it involved everyone buying Intel processors .
Even Intel was concerned enough to chip in on the report .
Oddly enough , they refused to comment on the sale of engineering samples , which in our opinion also adversely affects their sales and reputation .
It is odd that consumers can be so concerned about the counterfeiting of a boxed processor but hardly worried about the availability and sale of processor engineering samples .
Of course , many assume that engineering samples only affect those who actually buy them from the " black market " , while fake boxed ( retail ) processors affect everyone buying a supposingly legit boxed processor from the open market .
However , we had already pointed out that large quantities of these engineering samples ( see Update @ Dec. 24 ) were being sold at a pittance , and that it was highly likely that many of these processors would end up inside computers sold to unsuspecting customers .
We would be deluding ourselves if we refuse to believe the sale and misuse of engineering samples are far more prevalent than everyone would like us to believe .
Just How Many Engineering Samples Can There Be ?
This is an interesting question , is n't it ?
If Intel does not produce many engineering samples , then there can't be that many available in the black market .
However , Intel has steadfastly refused to divulge any numbers on the engineering samples they produce and distribute .
They would n't even confirm or deny that the reported large numbers of engineering samples in the black market are possible .
We did our own digging , of course , and found out that such numbers are indeed possible .
However , it would require the connivance of the OEMs ( or the people working for them ) which received those engineering processors .
Otherwise , it would be impossible to obtain the engineering samples in such large quantities .
Our sources claim that while it is possible for engineering samples to leak from Intel facilities in the US , it is unlikely for them to obtain so many to sell .
Most of these samples seem to originate in China , which is n't surprising since practically all of Intel 's major OEM partners have factories in China .
Which major OEM does n't ?
So , if you ask us , it is highly likely that the reports are true and that there are many engineering samples out there .
Some are sold as engineering samples on the black market as we all know .
However , we fear that many more are being sold to unsuspecting customers by unscrupulous system assemblers who use them in their computers , instead of genuine Intel retail or tray processors .

As for the ' XJ Hybrid itself '
" The company plans to bring the XJ Hybrid into production in 2011 .
It will have a slightly lower 30 mile all - electric range , and get a slightly higher 57 mpg in generator mode "
1 ) Production of the ' basic ' version is pegged to begin at the beginning of 2011 ( at best ) ... so probably not going to see the ' hybrid ' in ' 11 , ( especially considering they are laying off anyone who is n't putting nuts on a wheel directly - how can they spend a billion on this project now ?
Is there a payback ? )
Maybe we could see a few in 2012 , and a couple thousand in 2013 ?
Which leads me to wonder if they do produce anything will it not just be a few ' one - offs ' as they are already on the record as having a ' all - new ' XJ debuting in late 2014 , as a 2015 model .
Are they really going to spend a billion dollars to just have to rework the whole thing ?
Feels like a green wash as they need a boatload of cash ... likely they are just getting into the ' you give us money , we will built this for you ' line .
2 ) The ' new XJ ' is basically a heavily reworked current XJ ... so that means it weighs in at 3,800 pounds to start ... then pack another 600 on for battery and we are at 4,400 .
I 'm guessing at best a cd of around .30 ( with what that looks to displace from the picture ) ... so 57MPG is totally unreasonable to me , especially with the performance that would be expected here ( I 'd say 33 and count yourself lucky ) .
As for a 30 mile AER , probably looking at a 20 kWh pack to boot .
The XJ bases out around $ 70,000 , the next gen maybe $ 80,000 ... add on another 15 - 20 K for the ' hybrid ' , and you are looking at this going up against the six figure super premium imports and high end EVs ( Tesla Roadster / Model S and Fisker Karma ) .
Side note :
How do people get to these fantastical MPG numbers on E - Revs when they have done zero ground / real - world work on them ?
If you can just pencil in 50 + based on this platform ( series ) when the battery is depleted , regardless of pesky things like shape or weight of the car , and is still viable to sell on even a small limited run of vehicles ... why have n't we already seen this setup adopted ?
4,400 pound Jag that gets 57 MPG ICE and performs like a Jag ?
I call shenanigans .

# 10 Nasaman : Happy Easter to you too .
My 3 year old had a blast hunting for Easter eggs this morning ... although I think I had a better time watching him . (=
You may have noticed a new badge appeared recently on the right side of this blog that says Keep Libel Laws out of Science .
It has to do with an ongoing legal case in England where a major chiropractic association is suing science writer Simon Singh for libel over an article in which he referred to certain chiropractic procedures as “ bogus . ”
I encourage you to click the badge and sign the petition .
Today there was a fascinating development in this case that relates directly to skeptical software tools .
Because the case hinges on whether or not chiros promote procedures they know to be “ bogus ” , skeptics have been scouring chiropractic websites in the UK looking for evidence of this .
In response , another chiropractic association has advised its members to take down their websites entirely !
This is stunning .
As skeptics one of the key things we do is hold woo - woos feet to the fire when they make ridiculous claims .
Perhaps the most public place of all to make a claim is on a website , because it is instantaneously visible to everyone on earth who chooses to look .
Tracking claims made on websites is thus an important skeptical technique .
But this move by the chiropractors reminds us that the web is mutable thing .
Any content anywhere on the web can be changed at any time .
Paranormalists and pseudoscientists can edit their web sites constantly to present a moving target or to remove evidence of their missteps .
In order to do our jobs as skeptics , we need to be constantly aware of this and use tools to compensate .
Fortunately such archival tools exist .
One is the well - known Internet Wayback Machine , but several others ( including commercial products ) exist .
After the jump , I ’ll talk more about some of the uses of these tools and show you how to use them as a skeptic .
The psychic two - step
A standard technique used by psychics is to claim to have predicted something , when in fact they are doing so retroactively .
Credulous media will often let them get away with this with little or no checking .
It is up to skeptics to check .
Catching a psychic doing this is always a big win for skepticism .
This has been done successfully several times over the years .
Last year the skepTick caught Nikki , Psychic to the Stars in a retroactive prediction of Heath Ledger ’s death .
Robert Todd Carroll of Skeptic ’s Dictionary also pointed out that Ellie Crystal ‘s so - called predictions of the 9/11 attacks apparently were n’t posted on the web until 2005 .
As I mentioned in my presentation at TAM6 , I think we skeptics need to be more systematic about how we approach what we do .
The skepTick only happened to notice the Heath Ledger prediction because he had copied her web site for a presentation he was giving the same week Ledger died .
How many more retroactive predictions like this might we catch if we were actively looking for them ?
Reactive archive tools
There are a number of tools that can be used reactively to deal with this .
Some are online services that monitor web pages for you and send you an email when a change is detected .
Many of these tools are completely free .
As I mentioned , the most famous tool that can be used for this is The Internet Wayback Machine .
This is a massive archive of the web that allows you to see multiple old versions of virtually any popular web page .
Robert Lancaster used this tool to research Sylvia Browne ’s predictions for the U.S. presidential elections , even though the older predictions had been removed from her website .
There are other tools that can be used similarly to find old copies of web pages , such as the Google cache .
Several of them are reviewed here .
Of course the advantage of public archives like this is they can be used to check pages you were n’t monitoring in advance .
The disadvantage of Google Cache is that it can only be used to catch changes in the very recent past ( a few days at most ) .
There are several other practical issues with using these reactive tools .
First of all , free web - based tools have a tendency to disappear suddenly when the operator decides it is no longer a priority or taking too much effort .
( This is not true of the Wayback Machine or Google , of course , but of the other monitoring tools I linked to above ) .
The quality of service can vary as well .
You get what you pay for .
Another problem is some of them are only oriented toward archiving copies of pages or noticing when changes occur .
They often will do nothing to alert you as to the exact nature of the change , leaving you the job of laboriously comparing versions to figure out if there was a change at all , or what the change was .
Further , if you do n’t choose your sites to monitor in advance , you are at the mercy of whether the tool found that site “ interesting ” enough to archive .
The Wayback Machine has an algorithm for choosing what sites to copy that tends to ignore little - known sites .
It also will not show any results for a site until 6 months have past , so it is useless for time - frames shorter than that .
So these tools are not going to be too useful for tracking a little - known psychic or chiropractor with a brand new website .
Achilles heel : Robots. txt & “ noarchive ”
Perhaps the biggest problem with public archiving tools like the Google Cache and the Wayback Machine is they can be manipulated by the webmaster of the target site .
There ’s a well known system known as the robots .
txt protocol that has existed for many years .
This is a way for webmasters to specify that certain web pages should not be crawled or indexed by search engines .
Originally it was intended to keep these automated crawlers from getting “ lost ” on deep websites , but it can be used to block any content at all , including entire sites if desired .
More recently , Google and others have introduced a way to request that a particular page not be archived even though it is available for indexing and searching .
This is used by news sites in particular to protect their advertising revenue .
But it can also be used by woos to prevent you from using the Wayback Machine or Google cache to monitor their site .
Any woo who has already been caught once and / or has a clever webmaster running their site , is going to take advantage of these features , locking skeptics out from using these tools .
Proactive archive tools
The best way to play this game is to be proactive about it .
Pick your skeptical targets ahead of time , and regularly archive copies of their website that you can control .
Then you can catch them in their foolishness without having to rely on the vagaries of the Wayback Machine or whether or not they have a robots .
txt defined .
One possible option you might consider here is using WebCite .
This is a service intended for use by scholars and academics who need to cite particular versions of web - based resources in papers and other research .
You can give it the URL of a resource and it will archive a copy that can be accessed at any future time via a WebCite url .
Thus it gives you the same result as the Internet archive , but a greater level of control .
It might be particularly well suited to use in tracking psychic prediction pages since these are usually localized within a site .
Sometimes , however , you really do need to have an entire site archived , because you are not sure what part of it might become significant due to later changes .
Online tools such as Wayback or WebCite not great for this , because they usually will not archive everything on a site .
What we need is a tool you can run on your own computer .
Command line tools
Particularly if you are a command - line nerd like myself , you may want to use one of the free command - line tools that does this .
( If you are averse to using command line tools , you may want to skip down to the section below on commercial tools ) .
There are two well - known command line tools useful here .
One is called cURL ( Wikipedia ) and another is called WGET ( Wikipedia ) .
Either can easily retrieve individual pages by URL , and because they are free and open - source they are often pre-installed on some computers .
( In particular if you have a recent - vintage OSX Macintosh , you have a copy of CURL already installed .
Any Linux computer is likely to have either CURL or WGET or both pre-installed ) .
In essence , each of these tools let you type a command line to fetch a particular URL , and the content of the page at that URL is downloaded to a file on your disk .
I ’m going to highlight WGET here , because it has a nice recursive option that will come in handy .
This tells it to chase all the hyperlinks in HTML content and recursively download an entire website .
This is perfect for our use as skeptics .
A few months ago when there was a problem with the Stop Sylvia website , I used this tool myself to pull an archive copy of everything on that site just in case .
I later used my local archive to easily and quickly build a list of all the URLs of articles on the site for purposes of sub -linking to them .
The basic technique is to point WGET at the home page of the site in question , include the options to recurse the site and ignore ROBOTS .
TXT , and let it run .
The result will be a set of files and subdirectories on your disk that mirror the structure of the site .
Here ’s a typical WGET command - line you might use to pull down an entire site .
This will give you a browsable local mirror of What ’s the Harm as written below , change the domain in both places to point it at your woo - woo target .
( And please take it easy on my server when experimenting ! )
wget -r - nc - p -k -l 0 -erobots=off - D whatstheharm.net
http://whatstheharm.net
The above should be on one line as a command , though it probably wraps on your screen .
The switches used here are as follows :
-r is recursive , the key to downloading an entire site .
- nc is “ no clobber ” , it will not overwrite existing files .
Useful for resuming a long run .
-p is “ prerequisites ” it ensures all graphics and other files needed are downloaed too .
-k is an option to rewrite all the links in the HTML so they point to your copy .
-l 0 tells it to follow all the links as far as they go .
This can be dangerous on huge sites .
- D whatstheharm .net tells it to stay within the original site and not follow outside links .
- erobots=off of course tells it to ignore the ROBOTS .
TXT .
There are many other switches that are useful , type wget -- help to see many of them .
Also , there are also verbose versions of the command line switches if you prefer .
This post at Linux Journal gives you an approximately equivalent command line using verbose switches .
WGET is a free & open source software ( FOSS ) project , which means you can use it freely and even modify it for your own use if you are a programmer .
Unfortunately the fact that it ’s FOSS and also a command line tool means it can be difficult to find an easy - to - install package for it that is simple to use .
There is one for Windows systems here and for Mac OSX systems here .
The installation instructions for that OSX version are incomplete , you will need to use commands such as sudo , mkdir and chmod to complete installation .
Here is a typical sequence once you have extracted the zip file and are sitting at a command line in that directory :
chmod +x wget
sudo mv wget /usr / local / bin
sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc
sudo mv wgetrc /usr/ local / etc
The above worked on my MacBook Pro with 10.5.7 installed , your mileage may vary .
The biggest problem with WGET is it does n’t give you any assistance with finding the key changes on a web site once you have mirrored it to your local disk .
You are on your own to use whatever differencing tools you may have on your computer .
Programmers and other IT people usually have one handy .
For regular humans , there are a number of free tools available to perform this task .
Pick one out and learn it well .
Commercial solution : Versionista
Enter Versionista , a recently launched pay service .
During the U.S. presidential campaigns in 2008 , it got some publicity because the John McCain presidential campaign was using this service to track changes in Barack Obama ’s website , which is certainly an interesting application .
Now that the election is over , public interest organizations are using it to track changes in policy as reflected on the White House website .
This service will track up to 2500 URLs for you , emailing you when any change occurs .
It can even show you a side - by - side view of a changed web page , with changes between the versions highlighted .
It seems to be a much more professional version of the free services I mentioned above .
You can use the service for free to track just 5 URLs ( with 4 versions tracked per URL ) .
This might be enough for certain key skeptical uses , such as tracking the “ predictions ” page on a given psychic ’s site .
Beyond that it does get a bit pricey :
30 urls : $ 16.00 per month
100 urls : $ 29.00 per month
200 urls : $ 59.00 per month
400 urls : $ 99.00 per month
1200 urls : $ 249.00 per month
2500 urls : $ 499.00 per month
There are also some sub-features that are enabled as you move upward in their pricing tiers .
I suspect they ’ll simplify that price list over time , it seems overly complex to me .
Looking forward , another similar tool that might become useful is Zoetrope at the University of Washington .
Skeptics should keep an eye on this project for usable spinoffs .
Conclusion
Clearly any skeptic targeting someone with a web presence should consider availing themselves of web archiving tools like these .
The application to psychic predictions is huge , and the use in tracking pseudoscientific claims such as those of chiropractors is also clear .
The commercial tools are easy to use albeit expensive , but there are plenty of free options available as well .
In the comments , lets discuss any tools like these you have used personally and the pros and cons that you ’ve seen .
I ’m also interested in hearing from any skeptics who are already actively using this technique to catch the bad guys in the act .
( And yes , the folks tracking the chiropractors mentioned in the opening paragraph are using this technique already , their archive of chiropractic websites is already available . )
If we can stop talking about nofollow and PageRank sculpting for a second , maybe we can openly talk about the bigger story of last week ’s SMX Advanced .
The one that has to do with Matt Cutts taking the stage during the You&A and openly stating that Google profiles SEOs like common criminals .
I was naïve in my youth .
I ’d read blog posts that accused Google of “ having it out ” for SEOs and laugh .
There ’d be rants about how Google was stricter on sites that were clearly touched by an SEO and how SEOs were dumb for “ self - identifying ” with attributes like nofollow .
At the time , I thought these people were insane .
Now I know they were right .
Google does profile SEOs .
They ’re identified as “ high risk ” and so are all of their associated projects .
One of the hot issues during last week ’s You &A session was the paid link drama that resulted when Google oprah ’d 500 free Android phones during the Google I /O conference .
As the story goes , for their attendance , developers received brand new Google Androids , many of which were later pawned on eBay for prices as high as $ 760 .
For their Oprah generosity , Google received tens of thousands of free links to help the Android in a competitive telecom market .
But calm those raised eyebrows .
Because if it looks like a Google paid link , and walks like a Google paid link … then Google ’s going to start talking about intent .
And that ’s exactly what Matt did .
He used the “ intent ” card to misdirect the audience .
He explained that a line was not crossed because Google was not after the thousands and thousands of links they received .
Google wanted to encourage these developers to create applications for Google ’s Android … so they gave them phones .
Okay .
Let ’s pretend that ’s true .
Michael Gray was seated next to me during the You &A session and mentioned Viral Conversations , his product review site that hooks bloggers up with free products .
When Viral Conversations was first launched , he received an email from Matt Cutts with recommendations for things he ’d like changed .
[ Clearing this up after some further discussion with Michael . ]
During a lunch conversation and follow up email conversation with Matt , Michael received some advice on things to change on Viral Conversation to help them “ match ” what Google suggests .
One “ recommendation ” obviously being hinted at was to make sure bloggers used a nofollow on all links to rid any sense of paid link impropriety .
In session , Michael asked why he had to place a nofollow when he gets free links but Google does not .
That ’s when Matt started talking about SEOs as being “ high risk ” and “ people who do things deliberately for links ” .
Fact : Viral Conversations faced more scrutiny because Michael is an SEO .
Michael and his sites are profiled the same way a black kid is when he ’s out too late and the convenience store on the corner gets robbed .
Make no mistake , the way Google handles your site is both site - specific and SEO - specific .
And they do hold grudges .
And Michael ’s not an isolated case .
It ’s happening every day on the Web .
If you ’re an SEO , you ’re presumed guilty .
If you ’re not , you ’re given a bye .
As Michael Gray points out today in his own post on Google profiling :
Those suspicious links on TechCrunch ?
Not paid links .
The all expense paid trip Robert Scoble and Sarah Lacey received to Israel and then wrote about ?
Not paid links .
Guy Kawasaki ’s growing collection of “ loaned ” cars ?
Not paid links .
Why ?
They ’re not SEOs .
Let ’s post two hypotheticals :
Rae Hoffman , marketer and owner of BBGeeks , decides to loan 50 BlackBerries to some of her site ’s most engaged users to build content and get unique customer reviews .
And the handout works .
She gets tons of reviews and free content for her site .
And because BB users are tech savvy , they also have blogs and write about the experience , linking to BBGeek.com in droves .
Rae does n’t ask users to nofollow their links .
A new bakery in town ships out 500 cupcakes to residents of a small suburb encouraging them to come into the store and try them out .
There ’s even a coupon for a few bucks off when they come in .
The promotion spreads like wildfire when a few of the lucky cupcake recipients use their Twitter accounts to tell others about the bakery , it gets picked up by blogs and suddenly , they ’re on TechCrunch .
It does n’t even have to be cupcakes .
It could have been , I do n’t know , pizza .
Are these paid links ?
For BBGeeks.com , yes .
For the bakery , no .
Why ?
Because Rae Hoffman , by profession , knows the power of a link .
Her site will either get dinged or receive a handwritten love letter from Matt .
The TechCrunch - featured mom and pop , however , will be applauded for their ingenuity .
Not a double standard .
Simply evidence of Google ’s astonishing mind - reading ability when it comes to intent .
Google , you need to stop with the intent card .
You have NO WAY of determining someone else ’s thoughts .
You do n’t know the face of evil .
You never did .
And these days , that face of evil that you ’re looking so hard for is YOU as you continue to push your way through the Web intimidating webmasters , applying double standards , and playing the game of misdirection .
And in case there ’s some confusion , your standard , back - up - against - the - wall response of , “ you can do whatever you want with your site , but it ’s our index ” is n’t ACTUALLY an answer .
It ’s you being a bully .
It ’s an abuse of power .
And more importantly , it ’s WRONG .
Profiling a site associated with an SEO as being “ high risk ” is no more egregious and an abuse of power than a cop questioning that black kid who just happens to be walking down the wrong street .
You ca n’t tell someone ’s intent by looking at the color of their skin , their gender or their business card .
Not every SEO is a link broker or thinking up ways to manipulate the system you created .
In fact , most are n’t .
Most want to create great content and to help their sites do interesting things so they earn their rankings .
When you assume otherwise and bucket SEOs into a “ high risk ” group , holding sites hostage , it ’s malicious .
And I ’m no longer wet behind the ears .
I ’ve seen sites unfairly punished and left for dead simply because of the SEO association .
It ’s wrong , you ’re a bully and if anyone ’s intent needs to be questioned , it ’s yours .
I ’m not naive enough to think Google will change .
But as Michael Gray states , I think it ’s up to us to continue to point out and educate people to Google ’s inconsistent and egregeous behavior .
Consider the spotlight on .
Ayn Rand , Objectivism , and Religion ( Part 1 of 4 )
by Neil Parille PREFACE
This essay attempts to summarize Ayn Rand 's view of religion .
It highlights some aspects of Rand 's thought and details certain weaknesses and superficiality in her discussion of religion .
It should be noted that I have made minimal references to Rand 's fiction , with the exception of occasionally quoting " Galt Speaks " from Atlas Shrugged .
I have made generous use of the extremely helpful Ayn Rand Lexicon , edited by Harry Binswanger .
Apart from Rand 's works , I have utilized Leonard Peikoff 's Objectivism : The Philosophy of Ayn Rand , which is based on a lecture course given by Peikoff in 1976 .
According to Peikoff 's preface , Rand helped him prepare the lectures , and it can be assumed that they are faithful to Rand 's thought .
[ Peikoff , OPAR , p. xiv. ]
1
INTRODUCTION
Among authors and philosophers , Ayn Rand is noteworthy for her atheism and uncompromising opposition to religion .
Unlike many non-believers who see utilitarian value to religion , Rand is somewhat unique in seeing ( with minor exceptions ) virtually no value to religion .
As Chris Sciabarra notes , Rand developed a secular philosophy .
[ Sciabarra , ARRR , p. 147 . ]
She called this philosophy " Objectivism . "
She considered writing a book on Objectivism subtitled " a philosophy for living on earth . "
[ Rand , PWNI , p. 12 . ]
She concisely set forth the humanistic basis of Objectivism : " Since everything man needs has to be discovered by his own mind and produced by his own effort , the two essentials of the method of the method of survival proper to rational beings are : thinking and productive work .
" 2 [ Rand , VOS , p. 25 . ]
ATHEISM , RELIGION , AND MYSTICISM Biographical Note Ayn Rand was born in Russia in 1905 to secular Jewish parents .
Although Russia was an officially Orthodox country , her non-fiction makes hardly a mention of Russian Orthodoxy .
Likewise , there is virtually no explicit mention of Judaism in her works .
Since Judaism heavily influenced Christianity and Islam , one might expect greater mention of the Jewish faith .
Considering that Rand taught that " mysticism " is man 's chief enemy , one might expect a passing reference to the Jewish mystical tradition .
Yet there is none .
3
In 1926 , Rand moved to the United States ( a predominantly Protestant country ) , yet she makes few references to Protestantism in her work .
Curiously , Rand 's principal interest in religion appears to be Roman Catholicism .
She devotes two essays to papal encyclicals .
In " Of Living Death , " she critiques Paul VI 's encyclical Humanae Vitae ( which opposed artificial contraception ) and in " Requiem for Man " she critiques his Populorum Progressio ( a discussion of economics ) .
While non-Catholic religions generally do n't have equivalents to papal encyclicals , this attention given the Roman Catholic Church is noteworthy .
Rand went so far as to blame the existence of American laws against abortion ( which she opposed ) on the Roman Catholic Church , even though such laws predated the arrival of large number of Catholic immigrants by decades .
[ Rand , VOR , p. 59 ; Robbins , WAP , p. 208 . ]
Rand 's focus on Catholicism likely stems from a belief that Catholicism is the principal opponent of reason and capitalism .
Because she had a certain respect for Catholicism 's leading philosopher , Thomas Aquinas ( who attempts to integrate faith and reason ) Catholicism constituted the greatest threat .
In " Requiem for Man " she sees Catholicism as the principal rival to communism :
Today , Catholicism and communism may well cooperate , on the premise that they will fight each other for power later , but must first destroy their common enemy , the individual , by forcing mankind to unite to form one neck - ready for one leash .
[ Rand , CUI , p. 316 . ]
A few other reasons for Rand 's preoccupation with Catholicism ( as opposed to Protestantism ) come to mind .
First , Protestantism is a more variegated system of belief , making it harder to analyze than Catholicism .
Second , Protestantism is often represented as friendlier toward Capitalism and individualism than Catholicism ( the so - called " Weber thesis , " for example ) .
Third , Catholicism is associated with a period of time – the Middle Ages – which plays a substantial role in Rand 's philosophy of history .
It would be interesting to know to what extent Rand was acquainted with religious thought in general and apologetics ( that is the defense of religious belief ) in particular .
As will be seen below , Rand claimed to have rejected the " proofs " for the existence of God at age thirteen .
However , her published writings do not indicate the extent of her familiarity with the " proofs " for God 's existence ( at age thirteen or later ) .
4
Based on her posthumously published " marginalia , " it is clear that Rand read at least parts of Etienne Gilson 's The Unity of Philosophical Experience and C. S. Lewis 's The Abolition of Man. Gilson was one of the premier Roman Catholic philosophers of the twentieth century .
Lewis , an Anglican , was a professor of literature at Oxford and Cambridge and an author of a number of works of apologetics .
He was not a philosopher and his apologetic works are written on a more popular level .
5
Rand 's Opposition to Religion Rand 's opposition to religion is of course a central theme of this paper .
It is important to keep in mind that Rand opposed religion at its most basic level .
That is to say , she believed that it was untrue in all its manifestations and that its consequences were disastrous .
The religious view of existence teaches " the damnation of life and the worship of death . "
[ Rand , FNI , p. 18 . ]
She has been accused of " totalism , " [ Sciabarra , TF , p. 165 ] due to her penchant for seeing systems of thought as " organic wholes . "
There are no minor mistakes for Rand , because she searches out the " logical import of all the truths that support " an idea with which she disagrees .
[ Id. quoting Lester Hunt . ]
As we shall see , her view of religion is to a large extent a creation of what a person should logically believe if he drew all the conclusions from the ( alleged ) premises of his belief .
Most religious believers do not in fact " worship death . "
However , if they took their premises seriously , that is the logical conclusion they would draw .
Rand 's Atheism Ayn Rand was an atheist .
According to her one - time associate Barbara Branden , Rand became an atheist at age thirteen .
Branden records
Rand writing in her diary at that age : " Today I decided to be an atheist . "
Branden then reports her as later explaining , " I had decided that the concept of God is degrading to men .
Since they say that God is perfect , man can never be that perfect , then man is low and imperfect and there is something above him – which is wrong . "
[ Branden , PAR , p. 35 . ]
Branden continues that Rand's " second reason " is that " no proof of the existence of God exists . "
Rand therefore proposes two objections to the existence of God.
First , belief in God degrades man , by positing something " higher " or more " perfect . "
Belief in God is anti-man .
Second , there is no proof for the existence of God .
While Rand would later emphasize the irrationality of belief in God , the impression from her writings is that her principal objection to belief in God was a moral or psychological one .
[ Ryan , OCR , p. 270 . ]
Agnosticism
The term agnosticism was coined by Aldous Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 .
Agnosticism is typically taken to mean the position that one cannot be certain about the existence ( or non-existence ) of God .
The entry in for " agnosticism " in The Ayn Rand Lexicon contains only one entry : that of Leonard Peikoff from his 1976 course on Objectivism , which constitutes the basis for OPAR .
We will quote from OPAR , which is similar to the entry in the Lexicon :
Agnosticism is not simply the pleading of ignorance .
It is the enshrinement of ignorance .
. . .
A passion for the arbitrary does not derive from concern for logic .
Its root is a feeling that has been given precedence over logic .
In some agnostics , the feeling is cowardice , the simple fear that a stand on contentious issues will antagonize people .
In other agnostics , the feeling is more convoluted .
It is akin to glee , the malicious glee of subverting all ideas and thus of baiting the men who have integrity required to hold convictions .
This is the glee of the destroyer , the mind - hater , the nihilist .
[ Peikoff , OPAR , pp. 169-70 . ]
This no doubt accurately represents Rand 's view .
Rand had nothing but contempt for the " middle or the road " position , which claims to be sophisticated but is in fact the avoidance of a position .
Note : references will be at the end of part 4
1 The author wishes to thank Chris Matthew Sciabarra for his helpful comments on a previous draft of this paper .
The usual caveats apply .
2 Broadly speaking , Objectivism is a version of secular humanism .
Rand no doubt would have rejected this label given the various degrees of statism found in advocates of secular humanism , as well as the non-Objectivist roots of the movement .
For example , philosophers as diverse as John Dewey and Brand Blanshard were signers of secular humanistic " manifestos . "
For Peikoff 's rejection of the term " Secular Humanism , " see VOR , pp. 80 - 81 .
3 Interestingly , Ronald Merrill sees parallels in Rand 's fiction to the Jewish Talmud .
[ Merrill , IAR , pp. 61-62 . ]
Jeff Walker argues for a broad Jewish background to the Objectivist movement .
[ Walker , ARC , pp. 277-87 . ]
4 She does state in her 1973 essay " The Metaphysical Versus the Man - Made " that :
And although few people today believe that the singing of mystic incantations will bring rain , most people still regard as valid an argument such as : ' If there is no God , who created the universe ? '
[ Rand , PWNI , p. 26 . ]
5 In the course of her marginal notes , she refers to Lewis as a " monstrosity , " " lousy bastard " and a " cheap , drivelling non-entity . "
Curiously , she writes that Lewis ( an Anglican ) wants a " science subservient to the Pope . "
[ Mayhew , ARM , pp. 90-94 . ]

A five - year - old boy was made to clean toilets by a caregiver as punishment at a Child , Youth and Family - funded after - school care programme in Rotorua .
Now his mother is seeking legal advice on the punishment – dished out after the boy supposedly hit a girl in the face with a ball .
Oriwa Pehi-Livapulu said her son Noble could have become sick after the incident at the Chipmunks Centre last week .
He was only five and did not even clean the toilet at home , she said .
" My mana has been taken away from me .
Noble 's spirit has been trampled on " , she told The New Zealand Herald .
She has complained to CYF , which funded the programme .
Noble has denied hitting the girl on purpose and the incident was an accident , she said .
Chipmunks centre owner Doug Lambert did not return calls yesterday but has said Noble was made to squirt cleaning product into a toilet before scrubbing it with a brush while being supervised by the 40 - year - old caregiver , who was new .
The caregiver had been told she must not use cleaning toilets as a punishment .
CYF would not comment on whether making a child clean a toilet was appropriate .

Everyone is blaming H1N1 , but could a different strain of Influenza be the cause of Mexican deaths ?
Clinica - a news source for the medical technology industry - wonders what implications that would have for Mexico and the rest of the world .
Clinica is investigating the details and significance of Mexican health ministry statements that the H2N3 influenza virus was responsible for the majority of cases tested in an influenza outbreak in early April , three weeks before H1N1 came on the scene .
The existence of an additional strain of the disease would raise fundamental questions concerning the management of the swine flu epidemic internationally .
Comments made by Mexican health minister José Angel Córdova Villalobos during an April 27 press conference refer to the investigation of an outbreak reported in Perote , Veracruz , on April 2 .
The response on that day is said to have triggered a local alert and that in looking for the influenza virus , the majority of cases tested were H2N3 .
Clinica said they have not been able to ascertain from the health ministry the details behind these assertions , and that they await a response from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to a request for feedback related to the presence or otherwise of H2N3 in Mexico , and the potential implications .
In terms of national pandemic control policies , the UK's Health Protection Agency said that its current screening of suspected cases is being targeted at detecting H1N1 and that , in not monitoring H2N3 , the presence of this virus would not be revealed automatically .
What would be the implications of undiscovered H2N3 infection , such as in cleared suspected cases of H1N1 ?
Would the co-presence of H2N3 fill in the ongoing gaps in understanding of H1N1 's higher mortality rates in Mexico ?
At this point , I walked around the house gathering up things to use to make some nifty items for the ball to roll around on , over , through , etc .
All of these items were hot glued together , and then hot glued directly to the table top .
The loop is made from and old plastic bottle .
I detailed the making of that more ( in photos ) , because it was a little more tricky .
Everything else is mostly cardboard .
Once the paddles and launcher are working properly , you can go nuts with the top half of the table .
You can make whatever you can think up .
The nice thing about melamine is that hot glue sticks to it well , but you can pop it off ( or scrape it off ) quite easily .
If an item you 've glued down does n't work well , or is positioned wrong , you can remove it without too much hassle .
I will probably make some changes and move things around on mine , but you get the idea .
This was fun to build , and is really fun to play with .

It was not hunger that compelled the cat to hunt .
Still , she stalked each possible prey with purpose and skill , strolling past many , before discovering a worthy hunt , focused her eyes , twitched her ears .
Before the chase began , she showed indifference .
A casual stretch , a nap under the bush , tail loosely wrapped around her .
Then , yawning , she emerges , eyes still focused on her prey .
She studies its behavior , still yards away , as she imagines her conquest trapped within her teeth .
And then , the chase .
She means to trap it in a place with no way out , in an unfamiliar world it cannot navigate .
But it runs , zigzagging through the low brush , finally hiding in a small burrow she cannot reach .
She waits .
She pounces at the first sign of movement , but the prey escapes beneath her weight .
She stops to watch the direction it moves , fur twitching just above her neck , then sets off running at a cougar ’s pace .
Finally , exhausted , the prey falls at her feet .
She sits before it , paws it gently , admiring the faint heartbeat still fluttering under its chest .
Then , losing interest , she walks away .
Satisfied with her refusal of its offering .
Satisfied with her prowess .
At peace with the choice of her heart .

Why is sex worth losing your head over ?

 Forget the sweat and contorted posturing , just think about the biology .
Sex is nuts .
Cloning makes much more sense 
A clone , after all , just quietly gets on with copying itself .
And since every clone can produce more clones , cloning produces far more offspring .
There is no need for males – a waste of space , as hard - line feminists and evolutionists agree .
What ’s more , each clone has a combination of genes that has already been found fit for purpose .
Sex , by contrast , randomly mixes genes into new and untested amalgams .
And the horrors of sex do n’t end there .
There is the problem of finding a mate , and fighting off rivals .
Not to mention the risk of picking up horrible diseases like AIDS and all sorts of selfish replicators that exploit sex to spread themselves through the genome .
Queen of problems
All this made sex the “ queen of evolutionary problems ” in the 20th century , taxing some of the finest minds in biology .
The issue is n’t just explaining why almost all plants and animals engage in sex .
It is also explaining why the life forms that ruled the planet for billions of years and remain by far the most abundant – the bacteria – manage fine without it .

Advertisement Shots have been fired during a massive rally in Iran against last week 's presidential election results , with reports saying one person was killed .
Hundreds of thousands rallied to support candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , but a group of them was fired on from a militia base they had surrounded .
Mr Mousavi has lodged a legal appeal against the result but says he is not optimistic it will succeed .
US President Barack Obama has said he is " deeply troubled " by the violence .
On Monday evening , in his first public comments since the election results , he said that free speech and the democratic process must be respected in Iran .
See map of Tehran protests
The BBC's Jon Leyne , in Tehran , says Monday 's rally was the biggest demonstration in the Islamic republic 's 30 - year history and described it as a " political earthquake " .
Mr Mousavi says the vote was fixed - a claim President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies .
AT THE SCENE Jon Leyne
Reporting from Tehran
It was an incredible sight .
A huge crowd , hundreds of thousands of people maybe even millions of people there in defiance of open threats from the government that they should not assemble .
The security forces were staying well away - we were even able to film and usually the secret police come in straight away and stop you .
But the crowds were so enormous they were stepping back .
The government had outlawed any protest following two days of unrest , with the interior ministry warning that " any disrupter of public security would be dealt with according to the law " .
Despite this , correspondents said riot police had been watching the rally during the afternoon and had seemed to be taking no action .
The first indications of trouble came at about 2045 local time ( 1615 GMT ) , when the protesters were beginning to disperse from Tehran 's Azadi ( Freedom ) Square .
" There has been sporadic shooting out there ...
I can see people running here , " Reuters quoted a reporter from Iran 's Press TV as saying .
" A number of people who are armed , I do n't know exactly who they are , but they have started to fire on people causing havoc in Azadi Square . "
A photographer at the scene told news agencies that security forces had killed one protester and seriously wounded several others .
A man is said to have been arrested over the shooting .
At work today , they were n't letting people leave the office to attend Mousavi 's demonstration

He said the shooting began when the crowd attacked a compound used by a religious militia linked to the country 's powerful Revolutionary Guard .
Other sources told the BBC as many as six people might have died in the incident .
The AFP news agency reported that police fired tear gas and groups of protesters set motorbikes alight .
A BBC correspondent said there had also been gunfire in the north of the city - traditionally an anti-government stronghold - and that the security forces appeared to be hunting down protesters .
There was a large police presence on major streets of the city on Monday night , but evidence of few ordinary people , our correspondent added .
Ayatollah 's intervention Earlier , the demonstrators had gathered in Tehran 's Enghelab ( Revolution ) Square , chanting pro-Mousavi slogans , before marching to Azadi Square .
" Mousavi we support you .
We will die , but retrieve our votes , " they shouted , many wearing the green of Mousavi 's election campaign .

And Mr Mousavi eventually appeared , addressing the crowd from the roof of his car .
" The vote of the people is more important than Mousavi or any other person , " he told his supporters .
His wife , Zahra Rahnavard , a high - profile supporter of her husband 's campaign , later said they would keep up their protests .
" We will stand until the end , " she told the AFP .
The renewed protests come after Mr Mousavi and fellow defeated candidate Mohsen Rezai filed official complaints against the election result with the Guardian Council - the country 's powerful clerical group .

Guide : How Iran is ruled Internet brings events to life Challenge to republic State television reported that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has upheld the election result , urged the Guardian Council to " precisely consider " the complaints .
The 12 - member council is due to meet Mr Mousavi and Mr Rezai on Tuesday .
Its head said the decision would be taken soon .
" I hope it will not take long that the noble people will see that the question has been examined in the best way and we will give the result to the people , " Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati told state television on Monday .
But the Iranian leadership has put itself in an impossible position , our Tehran correspondent says .
He says that Ayatollah Khamenei has given his complete endorsement to the election result and to President Ahmadinejad , and by doing so he has put at risk the very foundations of the Islamic republic .
And Mr Mousavi 's website quoted him as telling crowds on Monday that he was " not very optimistic " about the judgment of the Guardian Council .
" Many of its members during the election were not impartial and supported the government candidate , " Mr Mousavi said .
Dozens of opposition activists have been arrested since the protests began , while internet sites appear to have been blocked and the media heavily restricted .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said he was following the situation closely .
" The position of me and the United Nations is that the genuine will of the Iranian people should be fully respected , " he told reporters .
EU foreign ministers expressed " serious concern " and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the election , while France and Germany each summoned their Iranian ambassadors to explain what was going on .
Ahmadinejad supporters protested at French and UK embassies in Tehran German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised the use of " completely unacceptable " force against protesters and called for a " transparent evaluation of the election result " .
Groups of Ahmadinejad supporters gathered outside French and British embassies in Tehran , protesting against what they consider to be foreign interference in Iran 's affairs .
" We have gathered here to protest the hidden interference of the Brits and the world , who are trying to create chaos in our country , " one protester said .
The French government issued a statement saying they had told Iranian diplomats that security forces " must protect the French embassy " .
Among the countries congratulating Mr Ahmadinejad on his victory were Iraq , Afghanistan , Venezuela and North Korea .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Imagine if Ku Klux Klan members had stood menacingly in military uniforms , with nightsticks , in front of a polling place .
Add to it that they had hurled racial threats and insults at voters who tried to enter .
Now suppose that the government , backed by a nationally televised video of the event , had won a court case against the Klansmen except for the perfunctory filing of a single , simple document - but that an incoming Republican administration had moved to voluntarily dismiss the already - won case .
Surely that would have been front - page news , with a number of firings at the Justice Department .
The flip side of this scenario is occurring right now .
The culprits were n’t Klansmen ; they belonged to the New Black Panther Party for Self - Defense .
One of the defendants , Jerry Jackson , is an elected member of Philadelphia ’s 14th Ward Democratic Committee and was a credentialed poll watcher for Barack Obama and the Democratic Party when the violations occurred .
Rather conveniently , the Obama administration has asked that the cases against Mr. Jackson , two other defendants and the party be dropped .
The Voting Rights
Act is very clear .
It prohibits any “ attempt to intimidate , threaten or coerce ” any voter or those aiding voters .
The explanation for moving to dismiss the case is shocking .
According to the Department of Justice : “ These same Defendants have made no appearance and have filed no pleadings with the Court .
Nor have they otherwise raised any other defenses to this action .
Therefore , the United States has the right … to dismiss voluntarily this action against the Defendants . ”
In other words , because the defendants have n’t tried to defend themselves , the Justice Department wo n’t punish them .
By that logic , if a murderer does n’t respond to the charges , he should be let free .
That ’s crazy .
The Obama Justice Department did take one action against one of the four defendants :
It forbade him from again “ displaying a weapon within 100 feet of any open polling location ” in Philadelphia .
Given that it already was illegal to display a weapon at a polling place and that he was not even enjoined from carrying a weapon at polling places outside of Philadelphia , it is hard to see what this order accomplished .
We asked the Justice Department if it was unable to provide any explanation for dropping the case .
Justice press aide Alejandro Miyar merely said : “ That is correct . ”
Multiple times we asked both the department and the White House to comment on charges that the dismissals represented political bias .
We received no substantive response .
Hans Von Spakovsky , a legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation and a former commissioner at the Federal Election Commission , tells us , “ In my experience , I have never heard of the department refusing to take a default judgment … .
If a Republican administration had done this , it would be front - page news and every civil rights group in the country would be screaming about it . ”
Consider that the behavior of the defendants was so bad that witness Bartle Bull , a former Robert F. Kennedy organizer who did extensive legal work on behalf of black voters in Mississippi , testified it was “ the most blatant form of voter discrimination I have encountered in my life . ”
Eric Eversole , a former litigation attorney with the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department , told us : “ It is truly unprecedented for the Voting Section to voluntarily dismiss a case of such blatant intimidation .
The video speaks for itself . ”
We could n’t agree more .
After the 2000 Presidential election , Democrats complained about voter intimidation in Florida by pointing to a police car that had been two miles away from a polling place .
The police did n’t do anything to anyone , but their presence was deemed sufficient to vaguely intimidate people en route to the polls .
In this case , the New Black Panther Party actually blocked access to a poll .
Unlike the Florida incident , this case involving the New Black Panthers screams out for tough justice .
Instead , the Obama administration looks the other way .
This all but invites racial violence at future elections .

( CNN ) --
Humans are a step closer to returning to the moon after NASA launched a lunar orbiter Thursday to provide a comprehensive survey of our nearest celestial neighbor .
A rocket - propelled lunar orbiter lifts off from Florida 's Cape Canaveral Thursday on its way to the moon .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter lifted off aboard an Atlas V Rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:32 p.m. ET , powered by two liquid - fueled engines and a pair of solid - fueled boosters .
NASA described the liftoff as " flawless " on its Web site .
It is the first mission in NASA 's plan to return to the moon , then travel to Mars and beyond , NASA said .
The data that the orbiter collects and sends back to Earth will be used to build an eventual lunar outpost , NASA said .
Watch the orbiter head to the moon »
The orbiter will send back all kinds of data , from day - night temperature maps to color imaging and UV reflection , NASA said .
There is particular emphasis on areas of the moon that may have continuous access to sunlight and where water may exist .
Because building a lunar outpost implies extended periods on the moon 's surface , NASA is hoping the orbiter can help it identify safe landing sites and moon resources , and how the lunar radiation environment would affect humans .
The orbiter 's trip to the moon will take about four days .
It will then spend at least a year in a low polar orbit around the moon , eventually orbiting about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) above its surface , NASA said .

The orbiter will have six instruments aboard , including the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation -- called CRaTER -- to characterize lunar radiation and its potential biological impacts .
It will also have instruments to do thermal and ultraviolet mapping .
Some of the instruments will look for surface ice and frost , and one will be able to search for water below the surface .
The Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter will measure the slope of potential landing sites and the roughness of the moon 's surface , and generate a high - resolution 3 - D map of the moon .
Though not quite as high - tech as the orbiter and its on - board instruments , the mission also has its own Twitter page to allow those on Earth to monitor its progress .
" The return to the Moon will enable the pursuit of scientific activities that address our fundamental questions about the history of Earth , the solar system and the universe -- and about our place in them , " NASA said .
" It will allow us to test technologies , systems , flight operations and exploration techniques to reduce the risk and increase the productivity of future missions to Mars and beyond .
It will also expand Earth 's economic sphere to conduct lunar activities with benefits to life on the home planet . "

Whatever 's fair and equal
by Jeremy Hooper
Some late afternoons when we need a break from LGBT rights , we switch our Sirius / XM radio away from Michelangelo Signorile 's OutQ show and onto " Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer " on the Martha Stewart Channel ( 5 - 7PM , Sirius 112 / XM 157 ) .
Usually we do so because we need a late - in - day respite from the " pro-family " nonsense , and the frank , often ridiculous chatter from Alexis Stewart ( Martha 's daughter ) and Jennifer Koppelman Hutt ( not Martha 's relative , but far from anyone 's " sidekick " ) that can go from what the two are having for dinner that night , to " The Real Housewives of NYC " ( Jennifer used to live with Bethenny ! ) , to whether or not Alexis was right to take camera phone pics of an anonymous subway rider 's facial hair , typically does the trick .
Fluffy but not flighty , the show puts a nice cap on our oft - demonized day .
Last night , however , we found unexpected power / inspiration in one of the show 's phone calls .
During a discussion on Prop 8 and marriage equality in general , a misinformed caller phoned in thinking that she did n't support same - sex marriage .
But as you will hear , Alexis and Jennifer ably and calmly gave the other end of their phone line some great food for thought , showing how victims of the far - right 's lies really can be taught a thing or two about what does and does not constitute civil fairness .
Listen in :
( Hutt is first voice ; Stewart is the third )
Excellent .
This exemplifies why we have to keep talking : Because our opposition NEVER .
STOPS .
MISINFORMING .
We have potential supporters all around us who have no clue that they 've been duped by a well - financed , well - connected , strategically code - worded disinformation machine .
We just need to talk to them .
And on that same note :
This snippet also speaks to how we can be informative without being textbook , connecting with out would - be , could - be allies in a style that 's more conversational than traditionally educational .
When we talk like humans , we bring out the humanity .
Now Jennifer : Back to Bethenny ...
Your thoughts
Outstanding !
These two women were able to explain to their listener in simple language and examples just WHAT the lies she had been fed were really about !
Maybe someone should contact that radio station to pass on thanks to them

I 'm still amazed how many people seem to think of marriage as a religious institution only .
Do they not realize that atheists and other non-christians can marry ?
Yet the ridiculous argument always comes up that somehow having the same rights means that specific churches also have to marry us .
Posted by : Ron | May 29 , 2009 7:34:06 PM
We need agressive fighters to rail against the institutions and professional bigots who try to deny us our rights and humanity .
But we also need patient , compassionate people who can explain the truth about our lives to our neighbors , many of whom are simply misinformed by lazy media or the inertia of ingrained prejudice .
My parents and family are just such people - they made a huge change and live in a small conservative town in rural Washgington State .
We can't deny the power of respectfully educating our fellow citizens , affording the same respect that we expect , and giving them time to process what can be perceived as a huge shift in their values .
Posted by : Sykler | May 30 , 2009 8:41:08 AM
Sad .
So many religious people fail to realise that when we 're talking about marriage and the right to marry we mean CIVIL marriage - IE .
going to the town hall and getting that all important piece of paper that says we 're married so it makes those legal things so much easier than they would be if we just had a civil union , which in many parts of the world makes things far more complicated .

You 've got to hand it to the hired fearmongering religiots ; they are very good at instilling their unsupportable lies in the gullible minds of the religious affected .
Their biggest threat if rational truth .
And , that one of the minions actually changed her mind as a result of learning the truth , they would call that being beguiled .
But the fact of the matter is that it is the professionally employeed religious are the ones who rely on their ability to beguile ; it 's their bread and butter .

Marshall leaves Broncos ’ facility with “ packed boxes ”
According to a report by the Denver Post , Broncos ’ wide receiver Brandon Marshall had a private meeting Friday afternoon with team owner Pat Bowlen and then left the facility with packed boxes .
According to the report , Marshall does n’t want his injured hip to be treated by Denver ’s medical staff , but that ’s only part of the reason he has sand in his shorts right now .
The main reason is that he wants more money .
Since he was a fourth round pick , Marshall made just $ 1.5 million in combined salary and signing bonuses over his first three years .
In his fourth year , a Pro Bowl incentive in his contract pushed his total salary up to $ 2.198 million , but obviously Marshall wants more heading into the final year of his rookie deal .
Marshall is extremely underpaid considering his on - field production .
But he ’ll have to excuse the Broncos for not wanting to dole out a big second contract to someone who ca n’t keep his act together off the field .
It ’s hardly a savvy business decision to guarantee a truckload of money to a player that might just wind up being suspended again in the future .
Marshall has already had at least seven reported incidents since being drafted , so he ’s hardly a reliable investment for Denver .
That said , if the Broncos do n’t want to lose another gigantic piece of their offense , they ’re going to have to pony up .
Denver does n’t want another mess on its hands like it had with Jay Cutler , so Bowlen and company need to make a decision regarding whether or not they want to take a risk by paying Marshall to keep him happy .
I do n’t envy their situation .

Why should we still consider Internet Explorer ?
May 12 , 2009 at 6:16 pm
All the web developers should be knowing the Odd behavior of IE ( Internet Explorer ) compared to other browsers .
Mostly it wo n’t follow any standards .
Both javascript and HTML will behave differently in IE than than they behave in other browsers .
I feel that time needed to put special conditions for making the webpage work with IE will be more than the actual time taken to develop the website .
If we search the internet for any IE specific issue , we can understand most of the people are highly irritated with behavior of IE .
I think most of the users are now started using Firefox instead of IE .
I can clearly understand this from my google analytics results .
And also our blog poll also tells the samething .
Lot of add - ons are available for Mozilla firefox to improve user experience .
I am just curious to know why we should still give importance for IE .
i-e why should we write special conditions to make our webpage work in IE instead of asking our users to use Firefox ?

Does Ida , the latest “ missing link , ” really support human evolution ?
At a Glance Researchers have identified a new “ missing link ” nicknamed Ida .
The allegedly 47 - million - year - old fossil was discovered in Germany .
Despite the headlines , Ida gives no support to primate ( or human ) evolution .
For all the headlines and proclamations , this “ missing link ” story includes an amazing amount of hot air .
A story we first previewed on May 16 has since rocketed to the heights of media hype as a team of scientists reveals “ Ida , ” the latest and greatest supposed missing link .
But does Ida actually support “ the evolution of early primates , and , ultimately , modern human beings , ” as one news outlet reported ?
1
Another reporter raved , “ The search for a direct connection between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom has taken 200 years — but it was presented to the world today at a special news conference in New York . ”
2
Formally identified as Darwinius masillae ( in honor of Charles Darwin ) , the fossil originated in Germany and is purportedly 47 million years old .
One scientist gave the find the nickname Ida ( after his daughter ) .
As for a more level - headed explanation of the evolutionary excitement , the Wall Street Journal reports :
Anthropologists have long believed that humans evolved from ancient ape - like ancestors .
Some 50 million years ago , two ape - like groups walked the Earth .
One is known as the tarsidae , a precursor of the tarsier , a tiny , large - eyed creature that lives in Asia .
Another group is known as the adapidae , a precursor of today 's lemurs in Madagascar .
Based on previously limited fossil evidence , one big debate had been whether the tarsidae or adapidae group gave rise to monkeys , apes , and humans .
The latest discovery bolsters the less common position that our ancient ape - like ancestor was an adapid , the believed precursor of lemurs .
Thus , rather than an apeman - like missing link that some media sources have irresponsibly implied , the real story is quite underwhelming and should in no way faze creationists .
Let ’s first review the facts :
The well - preserved fossil ( 95 percent complete , including fossilized fur and more ) is about the size of a raccoon and includes a long tail .
It resembles the skeleton of a lemur ( a small , tailed , tree - climbing primate ) .
The fossil does not resemble a human skeleton .
The fossil was found in two parts by amateur fossil hunters in 1983 .
It eventually made its way through fossil dealers to the research team .
Ida has opposable thumbs , which the ABC News article states are “ similar to humans ’ and unlike those found on other modern mammals ” ( i.e. , implying that opposable thumbs are evidence of evolution ) .
Yet lemurs today have opposable thumbs ( like all primates ) .
Likewise , Ida has nails , as do other primates .
And the talus bone is described as “ the same shape as in humans , ” despite the fact that there are other differences in the ankle structure .
3
Unlike today ’s lemurs ( as far as scientists know ) , Ida lacks the “ grooming claw ” and a “ toothcomb ” ( a fused row of teeth )
In fact , its teeth are more similar to a monkey ’s .
These are minor differences easily explained by variation within a kind .
Have n’t heard the real story of this supposed scientific breakthrough ?
Read the criticisms other evolutionists have made of the “ missing link ” claims and the science behind them .
Given these facts , it may seem incredible that anyone would hail this find as a “ missing link . ”
Yet British naturalist David Attenborough claims :
“ Now people can say , ‘ Okay , you say we ’re primates . . . show us the link . ’
The link , they would have said until now , is missing .
Well , it is no longer missing . ”
Unbelievably , Attenborough claims his interpretation is “ not a question of imagination . ”
The Creationist Interpretation
The principles that inform creationists about Ida are some of the same that allow creationists to interpret fossil after fossil hailed as “ transitional forms ” :
Nothing about this fossil suggests it is anything other than an extinct , lemur - like creature .
Its appearance is far from chimpanzee , let alone “ apeman ” or human .
A fossil can never show evolution .
Fossils are unchanging records of dead organisms .
Evolution is an alleged process of change in live organisms .
Fossils show “ evolution ” only if one presupposes evolution , then uses that presupposed belief to interpret the fossil .
Similarities can never show evolution .
If two organisms have similar structures , the only thing it proves is that the two have similar structures .
One must presuppose evolution to say that the similarities are due to evolution rather than design .
Furthermore , when it comes to “ transitional forms , ” the slightest similarities often receive great attention while major differences are ignored .
The remarkable preservation is a hallmark of rapid burial .
Team member Jørn Hurum of the University of Oslo said , “ This fossil is so complete .
Everything ’s there .
It ’s unheard of in the primate record at all .
You have to get to human burial to see something that ’s this complete . ”
Even the contents of Ida ’s stomach were preserved .
While the researchers believe Ida sunk to the bottom of a lake and was buried , this preservation is more consistent with a catastrophic flood .
4
Yet Ida was found with “ hundreds of well - preserved specimens . ” 5
If evolution were true , there would be real transitional forms .
Instead , the best “ missing links ” evolutionists can come up with are strikingly similar to organisms we see today , usually with the exception of minor , controversial , and inferred anatomical differences .
Evolutionists only open up about the lack of fossil missing links once a new one is found .
Sky News reports , “ Researchers say proof of this transitional species finally confirms Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution , ” while Attenborough commented that the missing link “ is no longer missing . ”
So are they admitting the evidence was missing until now ( supposedly ) ?
So it ’s clear what Ida is not .
As for our conclusion on what Ida is , we wrote in News to Note :
[ B]ecause the fossil is similar to a modern lemur ( a small , tailed , tree - climbing primate ) , it ’s unlikely that creationists need any interpretation of the “ missing link ” other than that it was a small , tailed , probably tree - climbing , and now extinct primate — from a kind created on Day 6 of Creation Week .
Much of the excitement over Ida appears to stem from a well - coordinated public relations effort to promote an upcoming documentary and a new book titled The Link .
The documentary will air on the History Channel in the U.S. ( as The Link ) on May 25 at 9 p.m. ET / PT .
It will air on BBC One in the UK ( as Uncovering Our Earliest Ancestor : The Link ) on Tuesday May 26th at 9 p.m. Filmmaker Atlantic Productions even launched a website to promote the discovery , revealingthelink.com .
Yet as Hurum commented , “ This fossil will probably be pictured in all the textbooks for the next 100 years . ”
So while the media rush may at first be a bid to promote the documentary and book , the ultimate result is one more trumped - up “ missing link ” presented to future generations as evidence of evolution .
Update : Mashable 's shiny new Twitter account is here .
If you subscribe , I promise to post regular updates about my cat .
So blogging has evolved once more , and the talk of the town - or at least the talk of Austin , Texas during the SXSW Conference - is Twitter , that increasingly popular text messaging / blogging service from the makers of Odeo .
It 's so popular , in fact , that Twitter has suffered some downtime over the last hour or so .
To some , it really feels like Twitter has stumbled upon a new blogging paradigm - short , to - the - point messages that let your friends , family and the world know exactly where you are and what you 're doing , every second of the day .
But others are asking : what 's the point ?
Those people just do n't get it .
Clearly , Twitter is an amazing new way to blog about your cat .

Dana Milbank was n't the only Beltway Villager all wanked out about President Obama prearranging a question with HuffPo's Nico Pitney yesterday .
On Meet the Press , David Gregory pressed David Axelrod about it , suggesting that somehow this sort of thing is anti-democratic :
MR. GREGORY : I just want to be clear .
Did the White House coordinate with a reporter about a question to be asked at a press conference ?
MR .
AXELROD : The White House did n't coordinate with the reporter about a question , we were looking for a way to get questions from within Iran .
We could -- we did not have access to Iranian journalists .
MR .
GREGORY : So you talked to a reporter beforehand and said , " Could you ask a question about -- from - - directly from Iran at a press conference ? "
MR .
AXELROD : We said if you -- we , we , we , we , we knew that he had been and he was very publicly involved in getting -- in trafficking and communications in and out of Iran , and we felt it was important ...
MR .
GREGORY : Well , why is it appropriate to coordinate with a reporter about what 's asked at a time when we 're championing democracy around the world ?
MR .
AXELROD : No , no , David , you miss ...
MR .
GREGORY : Is that , is that what you should do at a press conference ?
MR .
AXELROD : You 're not , you 're not listening to what I said .
We did n't coordinate with , with him about what was asked .
MR .
GREGORY : Right .
MR .
AXELROD : In fact , he asked probably one of the most -- the toughest and most probing questions at that press conference .
We had no idea what he was going to ask .
MR .
GREGORY : But you coordinated with him about , about that subject of a question beforehand .
MR .
AXELROD : He was a , he was a , he was a , he was a vehicle to get questions from Iran asked at this press conference , and that we thought was not only appropriate but , but necessary .
MR .
GREGORY : If President Bush had done that , do n't you think Democrats would have said that 's outrageous ?
Gregory is a Beltway Villager , and like all such folk , he wants to cling to the well - honed myths that preserve their favorite fictions about themselves .
One of these is that White House press conferences are actually exercises in democratic , even egalitarian questioning of government officials by the people 's representatives in the press corps .
So they are loathe to admit a simple reality : White House press conferences are in cold reality carefully stage - managed affairs , and the main beneficiaries of this arrangement have been the handful of " elite " reporters from big - name media outlets who traditionally have dominated them .
We 're perfectly aware that presidents have for some long time gone into these conferences with a prearranged list of reporters upon whom they are going to call .
The result has been an immense trivialization of press conferences , because those " elite " reporters have demonstrated over the years their eagerness to indulge trivial , celebrity - media - driven questions at the expense of serious policy matters .
In the process , they 've become increasingly manipulable .
This trend reached its apotheosis back when Jeff Gannon was lobbing softball questions to President Bush and White House press secretary Scott McClellan .
Not only was Gannon a phony journalist , he was being regularly selected to be among the main questioners at the daily briefings .
Considering that this same White House never came clean on exactly why it issued credentials to this fraud -- and especially considering that David Gregory never once objected to it -- his outrage over the Obama White House 's calling on Pitney for the toughest question any reporter at that conference asked seems strangely misplaced .
On the other hand , considering that this White House 's admission of people like Pitney into the circle of people who get to ask questions at these conferences represents a direct erosion of the " elite " status of people like David Gregory -- and in fact an opening of these questions to many more " representatives of the people " -- it 's really not too surprising .
Millions of Americans point to Ellis Island as the place where their family was first introduced to the United States .
Others trace their ancestry to ships that dropped anchor centuries ago in New England .
Still more greeted Lady Liberty by way of airplanes and a visa .
My father ?
He fondly remembers the comfortable space in the trunk of a Chevy Bel Air that was his ticket to the American dream .
In 1968 , Dad left his dying village of Jomulquillo , in the Mexican state of Zacatecas , to join his three older brothers in East Los Angeles .
Eighteen years old , impetuous and with a fourth - grade education , Lorenzo Arellano would have had to do months ’ worth of paperwork to enter the United States legally -- and there was still no guarantee that he ’d be allowed to enter .
Youth and a growling stomach have little patience , so my father paid a white woman -- a U.S. citizen -- to sneak him into the United States .
In Tijuana , he squeezed into the Chevy ’s trunk alongside a cousin and another man and prayed .
The Bel Air passed across the U.S. - Mexico border with no problem -- the agents just waved it through .
It sped north on Interstate 5 for an hour until it came to the Border Patrol checkpoint just south of San Clemente .
The car slowed to a crawl , then stopped .
A moment of tension .
The migra gave the Chevy the OK to leave .
“ We made it ! ” the other man whispered to Dad and his cousin .
They would n’t speak another word until the woman finally stopped in Chinatown , where two of my uncles greeted young Lorenzo by taking him to a bar and drinking long into the night .
That was n’t the only time Papi entered the United States illegally .
Twice , he climbed a fence from Tijuana and ran through the desert east of San Ysidro .
Once , he spent a month in jail for using false documents .
Perhaps Dad ’s most dramatic border crossing was when he crawled through a sewage - filled pipeline for about an hour to San Ysidro , in total darkness and with others ahead and behind him .
The sewer emptied out near a McDonald ’s -- insert your own Big Mac joke here .
My father , now a naturalized citizen , never tires of telling these stories to anyone who ’ll listen -- his eyes light up , he gestures wildly and a smile always cracks wide .
And , frankly , neither do I .
Although millions of Americans might consider Dad a repeat violator of national sovereignty , I see in his borderland adventures the pluck of the Pilgrims , the resolve of a homesteader , the type of pioneer ethos that has fueled this country for so long .
Frederick Jackson
Turner was wrong ; the American frontier will never close , not as long as there are people like my father who were and are willing to cross deserts , stuff themselves into cars , float across water -- just for the chance to establish themselves in this country and thrive .
Almost every Mexican family I know has followed the same trajectory we have : illegal entry , rough times , hard work leading to success and assimilation for the kids , with the 1986 amnesty helping mucho .
Twenty - nine years of living among illegal immigrants and their American - born children has taught me this truism .
And that ’s why my father ’s example is crucial and I ’ll retell it again and again .
His story is n’t important because it ’s special ; it ’s important because it ’s the rule rather than the exception , a rule few want to believe and that therefore must be repeated as often as possible .
I ’m glad that my father entered this country illegally .
If he had come “ the right way , ” our family ’s success would ’ve been chalked up as just another example of immigrant can - do .
But as an illegal , his accomplishments ( as well as mine and my siblings ’ ) contradict the conventional wisdom regarding undocumented Mexicans that ’s been prevalent for this decade .
My father ’s repeated breaking of immigration law is further proof that this country can and does rehabilitate all of her huddled masses , whether legal or not .
Personally , his stories motivate me .
If my father could leave his life back in the rancho and risk everything at age 18 , I have no excuse to whine about anything .
And his stories reward me with the pleasure of watching anti-immigrant loons stumble for words when I ask them to explain how my father and my family could ’ve excelled considering that we come from alien stock .
Dad is n’t perfect by any means -- indeed , he ’s suffered through most of the pathologies that many people attribute to illegal immigrants : Alcoholism .
Fecundity .
Lack of education .
Failure to fully assimilate .
It does n’t matter .
The life he ’s crafted for himself is no different from your typical white , middle - class Valley resident who rails about the Mexican invasion .
Does my pride in Dad ’s outlaw past mean I support a free - for - all at the border ?
No .
We deserve an accurate account of who enters and leaves the United States .
We deserve immigrants who do n’t cheat the system , do n’t commit crimes against others , who better their communities and do n’t become burdens .
But the traits embodied by Dad and so many more immigrants that spurred them to enter this country illegally -- courage , an indomitable spirit , the ambition to seek a better lot in this country -- are to be lauded and copied .
( And spare me the letters about the illegal - entry bit ; the Sooners did the same thing , yet we do n’t flinch when Oklahomans celebrate their spirit ) .
To say this is n’t traitorous or even an endorsement of the Reconquista , it ’s the truth .
We recently celebrated Dad ’s 57th birthday in the Anaheim home he ’s just a couple of thousand dollars away from finally paying off .
His brothers were there , no longer scared teens running from the law but middle - aged U.S. citizens who want Barack Obama to win the presidential election but hate L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ( ever since his extramarital affair was uncovered ) .
Their children -- my cousins , almost all children of former illegal immigrants -- sat alongside the pool , feasting on carne asada and keeping an eye on their kids , who do n’t speak a lick of Spanish .
My dad told his tales again , with my uncles corroborating each detail .
When we brought out the cake , everyone sang “ Happy Birthday ” in English .

Help !
I ’m being outgunned on K Street !
That ’s the message Afghanistan ’s ambassador to the United States is sending home , according to an internal government memo ( PDF ) obtained by Mother Jones .
His complaint signals that Kabul ’s man in Washington has learned a fundamental lesson about influence in the nation ’s capital :
With few paid lobbyists to push Afghanistan ’s agenda , the void is being filled by other regional players , like Pakistan and India , both of which spend millions of dollars each year to ensure that they ’re heard in Washington ’s corridors of power .
In his memo to Afghanistan ’s finance minister , Omar Zakhiwal , which is dated April 21 and marked “ confidential , ” Ambassador Said Tayeb Jawad surveys the competition .
Pakistan , he writes , employs nine American lobbying firms , including two “ that alone represent and promote President Asif Ali Zardari ’s interests in Washington . ”
According to the ambassador ’s missive , these include Locke Lord Strategies - LP , which since May 2008 has been on retainer from the Pakistan government for more than $ 100,000 per month , and JWT Asiatic and Hill & Knowlton , which together collect a monthly payment exceeding $ 100,000 .
All told , according to Jawad ’s estimate , Islamabad spent at least $ 3 million on Washington lobbyists in 2008 alone .
Explaining how he has been outspent , he cites a January 2009 report in the Washington Post stating that India ’s lobbyists successfully persuaded the Obama administration to remove Kashmir from Richard Holbrooke ’s portfolio as the White House ’s special adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan .
In hopes his government might learn from the example , Jawad suggests that Kabul needs “ to give serious consideration to allocating financial resources an on annual basis so that — like Pakistan and India and so many other countries — we are also able to effect pro-Afghanistan policy and legislation in Washington . ”
After I obtained a copy of the memo , I met with Jawad at the embassy , a redbrick mansion in Washington ’s posh Kalorama neighborhood .
The ambassador , in a neatly pressed blue suit and yellow - striped shirt , welcomed me into his second - floor office , where we sat around a small table and drank Afghan mint tea .
Had his plea for more resources had any effect , I asked ?
No , he said , adding that Kabul “ does n’t know exactly how Washington operates …
They ask , ‘ Is this legal , to buy influence ? ’
Yes , everybody ’s doing it ! ”
Jawad told me that he does n’t even have enough money to properly entertain embassy guests .
“ People like you , ” he said .
“ If you are interested , I can give you a book on Afghanistan , but nothing else . ”
The government of Afghanistan is not completely naive when it comes to the Washington power game .
In March 2002 , for example , the country ’s provisional government hired DC firms Verner , Liipfert , Bernhard , McPherson and Hand and DLA Piper to represent its interests .
Both initially agreed to work pro bono .
Among the early tasks was to relocate Afghanistan ’s diplomatic presence from a small rented office in downtown Washington to the embassy ’s former and current refurbished home , which during the Taliban years had fallen into extreme disrepair .
It was “ literally a shambles , ” recalls DLA Piper ’s Lawrence Levinson , with sensitive government papers strewn over a waterlogged floor in the embassy ’s basement safe room .
Rebuilding the country ’s diplomatic know - how also required some remedial training , including a “ Washington tutorial ” presented to Ishaq Shahryar , Afghanistan ’s US ambassador from 2002 to 2003 , on “ how you get things done in town , ” says Levinson .
The relationship grew from there and continues today .
In July 2007 , DLA Piper finally negotiated a small monthly retainer of $ 10,000 , but even that has been a stretch for the embassy .
“ Soon I ’m not going to be able to get it , ” Jawad told me .
“ There ’s no money … The budget of the embassy is pre-9/11 .
There was never any substantive increase . ”
Why has n’t Kabul spent more on K Street ?
According to Mahmood Karzai , eldest brother of Afghan president Hamid Karzai , the Afghan government lacks the savvy .
“ Unfortunately , the Afghan government is not clever enough to hire lobbyists , ” he explained .
Meanwhile , he said , his brother ’s opponents have spent millions in Washington aimed at destabilizing Afghanistan and undermining the Karzai family .
Karzai claims that media stories repeating that his brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , is a drug smuggler have been ginned up by DC operatives working for enemies of Afghanistan .
But he does n’t say which lobbyists and offers no proof of his charge .
As for Jawad , when asked how he feels about Mahmood Karzai ’s accusations , he seemed uncomfortable discussing it , but deferred to the president ’s brother .
“ He is inside Afghanistan , so he knows these things better than I do , ” he said .
“ Lobbying is not limited to the embassies .
Different entities have their own lobbyists — political parties and individual institutions .
It is not unusual . ”
But as for whether Pakistan ’s army of Washington lobbyists is working to destabilize the Karzai government , “ I do n’t have the details of what they do , ” Jawad said .
“ That is confidential information between the attorneys and their clients . ”
Correction appended :
This story states that Afghanistan has been represented by two lobbying firms : Verner , Liipfert , Bernhard , McPherson and Hand and DLA Piper .
In fact , Verner Liipfert was the name of the firm in 2002 before it merged with DLA Piper .
Furthermore , a representative from Hill & Knowlton says that Ambassador Jawad got it wrong , claiming that the firm has not represented Pakistan since the earthquake there in 2005 .
In a bid to bring doctors on board for his health - care overhaul , said Russ Britt in MarketWatch , President Obama “ ventured into the lion ’s den ” Monday , pitching a “ hard sell ” to the American Medical Association about the need for doctors to cut costs .
He got a “ thunderous standing ovation ” for mentioning malpractice tort reform , but the “ warm reception ” cooled quickly when he said he does n’t back malpractice award caps .
On the other side , Obama ’s mere mention of malpractice reform sent Democrats and trial lawyers “ into a fluster , ” said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
Tort reform is essential to cutting costs — some economists argue that fear over “ stratospheric jury awards ” costs us $ 100 billion a year — but the trial lobby need n’t fear Obama .
Without malpractice caps , medical liability is just an empty “ token policy ” to keep doctors at the bargaining table .
The doctors ’ “ tepid applause ” at Obama ’s other detailed policy prescriptions , said Jonathan Cohn in The New Republic , made the AMA seem less like a group of high - minded healers and more like just another “ interest group ” focused entirely on its “ narrow economic interests . ”
And maybe it is .
With only about a quarter of U.S. doctors as members , the AMA represents the medical profession “ at both its most craven and conservative . ”
At this “ Long Tease ” stage in the health care debate , Obama will back any idea , said David Brooks in The New York Times .
“ Doctors want relief from lawsuits ” ?
Sure .
Liberals demand a “ public option ” ?
He ’s all for it .
Most of the hard issues will be dropped in the final , frantic “ scrum ” to finish the reform bill , leaving a modest reform package and a “ ( partial ) health - care victory ” for Obama .
Every article on quantum gravity begins the same way .
On the one hand we have quantum mechanics — excellent at describing the very small and intrinsic lumpiness of the universe — and on the other hand we have general relativity — excellent at describing gravity , but it relies on a smooth universe .
At some point the two meet , and just like Manchester United supporters and Liverpool fans , they just do n't get along .
Luckily for the universe , tire irons have n't been deployed to settle this incompatibility .
A pair of unrelated papers , which appeared in Physical Review Letters , and a News and Views article in Nature Physics all indicate that progress is occurring , but it is coming at the expense of a long - cherished tenet of physics , called the Lorentz Invariance .
Progress in uniting quantum mechanics with general relativity has typically proceeded along two lines .
Option one is to generate seemingly outlandish ideas , such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , and their brethren , which resolve the problem by positing the existence of things as yet unobserved .
The more sedate approach is the rapid - fire production of grand unified theories , which are neither " grand " nor " unified " and , completing the trifecta , may not warrant the moniker " theory " either , since they simply do n't work .
Until recently , the general consensus was that string theory was the great hope , but physicists have been rocked by the discovery that string theory still requires a bunch of fine - tuned values to get to the universe we observe .
This depressing state of affairs has led to reappearance of the anthropic principle , which , while being very deep and meaningful , also finds itself in the embarrassing position of stating the bleeding obvious .
Which leads us nicely to a paper by one Petr Ho?ava , brought to my attention and nicely explained in the Nature Physics News and Views article .
Ho ? ava takes advantage of a recent finding that , in quantum mechanics , the universe behaves as if it has four dimensions at larger scales , but this can be reduced to two dimensions as the scale is reduced .
This implies that space and time may be fractal in nature — not a new idea , but it 's always nice to have evidence to support the idea .
To summarize the reduction procedure , space and time are treated separately , which would normally cause all sorts of problems in quantum mechanics .
However , by treating space and time differently as well as separately , the infinities in the quantum mechanics equations vanish , and gravity behaves as it should .
Interestingly , space remains the same in all directions , while time does not .
This appeals to me , because it points to fabric of the universe supplying time with a preferred direction .
One of the downsides , though , is the failure of Lorentz invariance .
To understand why physicists might be loath to give up Lorentz invariance , let 's take a quick look at it .
A key idea , going way back to Galileo is that all accurate observations are equally valid and must agree .
A simple example of this is cars on a motorway .
I am cruising along at 120 km / h but , to me , my car appears to be standing still .
An overtaking car appears to me to be traveling at 20 km / h , while a person on the side of the road will see speeds of 120 km / h and 140 km / h .
Now , although we all disagree on the speed of each car , we can , given some information , understand each other 's results and reach an agreement .
These sorts of transformations , based on Lorentz invariance , are a key part of physics and are founded on a certain conception of space and time .
Ho ? ava's work is pretty exciting , and has been followed by a paper from Daniela Klammer and Harold Steinacker , which proceeds in a similar vein .
In their work , Klammer and Steinacker posit that space and time do not commute , which is a more sophisticated version of space being the same in every direction , while time is not .
They show that this sort of universe would naturally have an early inflationary period , and that the universe slips out of inflation nicely into the universe we observe .
Furthermore , unlike other explanations of the universe 's previous and current epochs of inflation , no additional fields are required — inflation falls out naturally as a consequence of the geometry .
The final win is only mentioned in passing : the stability of the mathematics depends on the existence of vacuum fluctuations , which are the signature of quantum mechanics .
Now , I must admit that these papers are nigh on unreadable to us plebs — the second paper is much easier than the first , though — and I cannot speak with any sort of authority on this .
But it appears to me that the two approaches are fairly similar and may even be compatible with each other .
If this is the case , we may find that quantum mechanics , gravity , and inflation end up sharing a house and supporting the same football teams .
In doing so , we will be eliminating at least one troublesome finely tuned constant and the anthropic principle would resume its rightful place as a forgotten statement of the bleeding obvious .

In meting out the maximum sentence , Judge Chin pointed out that no friends , family or other supporters had submitted any letters on Mr. Madoff ’s behalf that attested to the strength of his character or good deeds he had done .
Mr. Madoff returned to his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan while federal prison officials determine where he will serve his sentence .
The defense has 10 days to decide whether to appeal the sentence .
Although Judge Chin suggested that Mr. Madoff be assigned to a prison in the Northeast , at the request of the defense , the judge said the Bureau of Prisons would decide what kind of facility will become his permanent home .
No members of Mr. Madoff ’s immediate family were in court .
In his statement , Mr. Madoff acknowledged the “ legacy of shame ” he has created for his family .
His wife , Ruth , later released a statement  her first since her husband ’s arrest  expressing her grief for the victims and her sense of shock and betrayal when she learned of the crime .
Mrs. Madoff has not been charged in the crime and insists that she did not know of it until her husband told her just before his arrest .
But she acknowledged that her silence , imposed by lawyers protecting her own interests , “ has been interpreted as indifference or lack of sympathy for the victims . ”
That , she added , “ is exactly the opposite of the truth . ”
She said she felt “ devastated ” by the harm her husband had done .
“ I am embarrassed and ashamed .
Like everyone else , I feel betrayed and confused , ” said Mrs. Madoff , who has forfeited all but $ 2.5 million in assets .
“ The man who committed this horrible fraud is not the man whom I have known for all these years . ”
Note :
The following post is a guest blog submitted to Microsoft Subnet by a security expert who wished to remain anonymous .
Joanna Rutkowska recently released her new security whitepaper and exploit code entitled Attacking SMM Memory via Intel CPU Cache Poisoning .
The thing that struck me about her research is just how easy this is to do .
There is nothing super fancy or complex about the exploit code .
Due to its simplicity , the odds are very high that this attack vector has been in use , even before this research published last month .
Still , because this attack is so stealthy , we would n’t necessarily have been able to detect it .
Here 's how the attack works in layman ’s terms .
First off , we need to set the stage a bit .
The exploit code was only written for Intel ’s DQ35 motherboards .
The DQ35 is one of their modern boards .
According to Joanna ’s paper , Intel reported that their newest motherboards ( DQ45 ’s for example ) are not vulnerable to this attack .
An exact list of affected motherboards was not offered in the research , nor any mention if AMD systems are affected as well .
The goal of the attack is to gain access to the normally very well protected SMM ( system management mode ) space .
From there you would be able to load your SMM rootkit into SMM space giving you full control over the hypervisor or operation system .
Another benefit is that your rootkit would be almost undetectable by the operating system .
According to the whitepaper : " The memory controller offers dedicated locks to limit access to only to system firmware ( BIOS ) . "
The exploit uses a form of Intel cache poisoning to get access to the SMM space that is supposed to be only accessible from system BIOS .
Caching is used to increase performance of your computer .
The CPU will use cached data first if it exists .
So if you can replace the cache data with your own malicious data then you can be assured that it will be used in favor of the real data .
I should note that this particular exploit requires that the attacker already have admin or root privileges on the box .
So this is not an attack that would be used to gain root access but rather a new way to hide your rootkit , key logger , or whatever code from detection on boxes you already " own " .
( We ’ll have to wait and see if someone figures out a way to do a privilege escalation using this technique . )
With the stage set here is a high level view of the three steps used by the exploit .
Notice the simplicity of this exploit .
1 ) Attacker modifies system MTR registers to change the SMM memory space from uncacheable to cacheable with type Write - back .
The MTRR ( Memory Type Range Registers ) , according to Wikipedia , are registers that provide the system software with control of how accesses to memory ranges by the CPU are cached .
It uses a set of programmable model - specific registers ( MSRs ) , which are special registers , provided by most modern CPUs .
Any type Write - back writes to the CPU ’s cache are marked dirty .
This will force their contents to be written to memory later .
2 ) The attacker now can write code into the memory space that is normally reserved only for SMM functions .
The attackers accesses to this memory space are now written to the CPU cache because of the changes made in step one .
Normally SMM space is marked uncacheable and the chipset will discard any attempts at access except from system BIOS .
3 ) Now the attacker code is in the CPU cache memory normally reserved only for SMM .
To execute the code the attacker issues an SMI .
This triggers a CPU preempt that transfers execution control over to SMM code .
The CPU will execute the SMM code but it will fetch it from the cache before DRAM .
The attackers data is in cache ( step 2 ) so it is executed .
The code now runs with full SMM privileges .
Remember that SMM is the most privileged on the box , more so than the operating system or any hypervisors .
The proof of concept exploit includes the code for doing this on a Linux operating system with an Intel DQ35 motherboard with 2 GB of memory .
It turns out that Linux allows the root user to access MTR registers incredibly easily .
With Windows it can still be done but requires much more work and skill .
No Windows exploit code was released .
This attack is hardware specific so if you do n’t have the exact setup the exploit runs on it will not work .
You would have to first figure out the SMM memory space location on your system .
The whitepaper offers this as a workaround :
" Intel has informed us that they have been working on a solution to prevent caching attacks on SMM memory for quite a while and have also engaged with OEMs / BIOS vendors to implement certain new mechanisms that are supposed to prevent the attack .
According to Intel , many new systems are protected against the attack .
We have found out , however , that some of Intel ’s recent motherboards , like the popular DQ35 , are still vulnerable to the attack .
Additionally , the workarounds that Intel has mentioned to us are not yet officially documented , but Intel told us that they will be updating the CPU documentation shortly . "

Now that the attack has been released what are your thoughts on it ?
Do you think it has merit ?

LOS ANGELES  Signaling that California is slipping deeper into financial crisis , the state ’s controller said Wednesday that his office would soon be forced to issue i.o.u.’s to scores of the state ’s creditors , as lawmakers failed at their first attempt as a body to close the state ’s multibillion - dollar shortfall .
If the i.o.u.’s are issued as threatened , it would be the first time since 1992  when Gov. Pete Wilson paid roughly 100,000 state employees with them  that the warrants were used to hold over those to whom the state owed money .
Before that budget crisis , California last issued the warrants during the Depression .
“ Next Wednesday we start a fiscal year with a massively unbalanced spending plan and a cash shortfall not seen since the Great Depression , ” the controller , John Chiang , said in a written statement .
He added , “ Unfortunately , the state ’s inability to balance its checkbook will now mean short - changing taxpayers , local governments and small businesses . ”
The issuing of the i.o.u.’s would reflect the state ’s lack of cash flow and its Legislature ’s inability to agree on a way to close the roughly $ 24 billion budget gap , as tax revenues have continued to fall .
President Obama swept to office on the promise of a new kind of politics , but then how do you explain last week 's dismissal of federal Inspector General Gerald Walpin for the crime of trying to protect taxpayer dollars ?
This is a case that smells of political favoritism and Chicago rules .
A George W. Bush appointee , Mr. Walpin has since 2007 been the inspector general for the Corporation for National and Community Service , the federal agency that oversees such subsidized volunteer programs as AmeriCorps .

DHARAMSALA , India ( Reuters ) - The Dalai Lama has encouraged Tibetans in exile to embrace the democratic system of electing a leader , saying it was essential to keep step with the larger world and to ensure the continuity of their government .

In a video clip shown to hundreds of monks , nuns and lay people in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamsala late on Saturday , the 73 - year - old also said it was no longer essential to thrust spiritual and political leadership on one person .
“ The Dalai Lamas held temporal and spiritual leadership over the last 400 - 500 years .
It may have been quite useful .
But that period is over , ” the Nobel Prize winner said in the clip , according to a translated transcript .
“ Today , it is clear to the whole world that democracy is the best system despite its minor negativities .
That is why it is important that Tibetans also move with the larger world community , ” he said .
The Dalai Lama has suggested before it is up to Tibetans whether they continue with the spiritual institution after he dies , and could order an election among Tibetans abroad .
The Dalai Lama could also choose a successor himself from members of his government - in - exile , or a college of senior lamas could pick someone from within its ranks , removing the mysticism of the traditional selection process .
“ When we put the whole responsibility in the person of the Dalai Lama , it is dangerous ... it is appropriate that a democratically elected leader lead a people ’s movement , ” he said .
“ In reality , a change is happening in the responsibility of the Dalai Lama as the temporal and spiritual leader .
This , I think , is very good ... a religious leader having to assume political leadership , that period is over , ” he said .
SENSITIVE ISSUE
The Dalai Lama ’s succession is a sensitive issue as he ages and his health declines .
Many Tibetans fear that the death of the Dalai Lama , who has lived in exile in India since fleeing a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 , could create a leadership vacuum that Beijing could exploit to tighten its grip .
China has said the Dalai Lama must follow “ historical conventions , ” including an endorsement from Beijing .
According to Beijing , the Dalai Lama ’s incarnation must be chosen by drawing lots from a gold urn given to Tibetans by the ethnic Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty .
But the Dalai Lama has suggested his incarnation might be found outside China , or even that Tibetans themselves could order a vote on whether to continue an institution that once gave one monk both spiritual and temporal sway over Tibet .
He has also called for more democratic systems : Tibetans in exile first elected a prime minister , or Kalon Tripa , in 2001 , which the Dalai Lama called a “ magnificent achievement . ”
The current prime minister , Samdhong Rinpoche , a Tibetan monk and a Buddhist scholar , has served two terms , and the Dalai Lama has often said he was in “ semi- retirement ” as a political leader , asking Rinpoche to take the lead in interacting with Tibetans .
“ As election takes place every five years , irrespective of whether the Dalai Lama is there or not , the exiled political system will remain secure , stable and sustainable in the long term , ” he said in the clip broadcast on Saturday .
How about a bit of reality ?
Not the ridiculous promises from Washington , the absurd talk of “ green shoots ” while unemployment soars and investment falls , the silly guarantees that GM has a bright future even as its stock price falls to less than the price of a Snickers bar , the nonsense about how if we spend more and inflate more , recovery will come tomorrow morning .
The war on recession is a flop .
Fail , fail , fail .
The full - scale war on recession began in January 2008 .
Unemployment was climbing and house prices were falling , and George Bush , whose entire persona was the war mode since 2001 , decided he would n’t tolerate declining economic conditions .
That ’s when the Fed started pushing down interest rates to ridiculous lows and started gunning the money supply as much as possible .
Bush put on his solemn / determined face and started talking to the American people about how he was going to destroy this recession monster in its crib .
Now , there are things politicians can do in the face of trends they do n’t like .
If kids are n’t learning to read , bureaucrats can cobble together carrots and sticks and gin up the scores a bit for a while .
They can have their hirelings shoot consumers of illegal substances and bomb foreigners who do n’t love America .
They can pass out goodies to friends and take them away from enemies .
From time to time , they can experience moderate success in these actions .
But the economy ?
Now , here is a force too big even for the biggest government in the history of the world , which is the U.S. government .
That ’s because economic trends are embedded in the structure of the material world and operate according to laws akin to gravity .
They are social laws , if you will , features of the world that operate in all times and all places , and they are generated by the implacable fact of scarcity and the need for a system of production and allocation .
In other words , economic trends are finally beyond the control of the political class .
This is the great lesson that economics has been teaching for some 700 years , generation after generation .
As Bastiat wrote , economic laws “ act on the same principle whether we take the case of a numerous agglomeration of men or of only two individuals , or even of a single individual condemned by circumstances to live in a state of isolation . ”
They are unavoidable features of the world , ones which the political class is forever attempting to override .
The economy had been on a false foundation for some years , and the housing sector in particular had become wildly overbuilt and rested on bad debt .
What can politicians do about this ?
Absolutely nothing .
Economic foundations are built by private investment .
Government has no resources of its own to build a foundation .
It can only rob people of their property and thereby divert resources from where they belong to where they ought not to be .
When prices of houses started falling , we began to see only the most conspicuous sign of the rot underneath it all .
But the political class blamed the symptom instead of the disease , and started trying to prop up prices , which is probably the stupidest thing these birds could ever attempt .
It is utterly futile to attempt to change the direction of prices .
It is about as successful as attempting to replace the water in one ocean with another or rearranging the order of the planets .
It is beyond their capacity .
Bastiat said of the attempts of his time : “ Modern reformers !
when I see you desiring to replace this admirable natural order by an arrangement of your own invention , there are two things ( although they are in reality one and the same ) that confound me — namely , your want of faith in Providence , and your faith in yourselves — your ignorance , and your presumption . ”
It ’s not just that the attempt to undo economic law does n’t work .
It ends up mucking up the system even more , and prolonging the suffering .
That is precisely what has happened .
There can be no question that we would have been out of this recession by now had the politicians not intervened .
But an election was coming and Bush tried to rig the system .
Not only that , but after seven years of ridiculous marauding around like King of the Universe , he was flush with power and arrogance .
$ 29 $ 25
Bush attempted to reverse the economic river by waging a war on recession , about which I was writing back in March 2008 : “ All this nonsense about digging ourselves out of recession through government intervention began with the New Deal .
But here is the amazing fact : not once has this strategy worked . ”
By the fall and winter , it became clear that the War on Recession was not working and the economy was sinking further .
Rather than give up , Bush pushed so hard that he managed to throw us all in the arms of a socialist who knows nothing about economics and has surrounded himself with big shots who affirm him in his ignorance — people like Paul Krugman , who are wedded to antique mythologies about the glories of government power .
And so we live through it again .
We see the fools trying this and that with our lives and liberty , promising glorious results around the corner .
Well , by now , we ’ve been around the corner , the next one and the next one , and it gets worse with each turn .
These people are driving us right into the abyss , and let ’s be clear that this is not the fault of private investors or savers or foreigners or stock jobbers .
It is the fault of the managers of this recession : the government , whoever is or has been in charge , and the Fed that operates on government authority .
They are strangling free enterprise just as surely as a mugger chokes his victim , and with it the capacity for the American worker and producer to do the hard work of restoring prosperity .
We are a generation that proudly shows off its accomplishments in all areas of science , and we preen about our love of facts and our detachment from mythology .
Yet our culture is imbued with the most ridiculous faith in government to turn stones into bread , to accomplish miracles with a printing press before our very eyes .
This is the age of folly .

Advertisement Ground has been broken on the construction site of Spaceport America , the world 's first purpose - built commercial spaceport .
Those behind the project say that it will help provide a new chapter in space exploration .
When finished in 18 months ' time , the facility will house Virgin Galactic 's space tourism business and other firms working in the commercial space arena .
It will cost the New Mexico government almost $ 200 m ( £ 121 m ) .
Steve Landeene , executive director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority , said : " The future is here and we are not too far off a new age of space .
" It is not just about private astronauts going up , it is about bringing the cost structure down and about new medicines , solar power in space and the entire range of scientific benefits that can come from it . "
Big space Speaking to several hundred people who had made the journey to witness the event in scorching temperatures , New Mexico governor Bill Richardson said it was " gratifying to see Spaceport America finally become a reality " .
Work will now start on a suitably space - age terminal and hangar building designed by Foster and Partners to blend in with the desert scrubland here , while housing rocket - based spacecraft and all the safety hazards that entails .
A 3,000 m ( 10,000 - ft ) runway will ensure that there is plenty of room on the tarmac for even the world 's largest planes .
When finished , Virgin Galactic - which hopes to begin regular tourist flights into space not long after the spaceport is completed - will base its headquarters and operations here , providing much of the spaceport 's business , though Spaceport America is keen to point out it will not solely rely on the company .

To impress upon those gathered at the site just how within reach the commercial space - age now is , the star attraction of the ground - breaking event was to have been a fly - by of Virgin Galactic 's WhiteKnightTwo aircraft .
But much to the disappointment of the crowd , at the last minute it was forced to turn back with technical difficulties ( although it did make an appearance at Las Cruces airport , New Mexico , on Saturday ) .
Will Whitehorn , president of Virgin Galactic , explained the craft was still in the testing stage and as such safety was of paramount importance when dealing with any problem , minor or otherwise .
He insisted that the company would not put a definite timeline on when the commercial flights would begin but that all was on track with its development plans .
WhiteKnightTwo - the aircraft which carries SpaceShipTwo to a high altitude before it launches into space - is to be publicly unveiled at the Oshkosh airshow in Wisconsin in July , while SpaceShipTwo should begin test glides in December .
If all goes to plan , the inaugural flight should carry Sir Richard Branson , his family and spaceship designer Burt Rutan on a sub-orbital ride within two years .
They will be followed by a waiting list of 300 who have all ignored the current economic climate and are willing to pay about $ 200,000 for the privilege of experiencing six minutes of weightlessness during the two - hour flight .
Testing ground
The location of the spaceport was selected for its distance from any sizable populations - only the occasional ranch and the local rattlesnakes will know it is there .
But New Mexico brings other advantages .
The state proudly boasts that it has about 350 days of sun each year , meaning that unlike Nasa at Cape Canaveral , weather should not often affect launches , and the spaceport 's neighbour - the White Sands missile testing range - ensures the air space overhead is already a no - fly zone .

Governor Bill Richardson said he felt that the economic benefits of positioning the state at the forefront of the burgeoning commercial space sector would lead to developments on many levels for New Mexico and build on its rich history of aviation and spaceflight .
New Mexicans are proud of their role in helping to foster scientific advancement from Von Braun 's work with the V2 and Redstone rockets , to nuclear power , and the many observatories that are based here .
At the ground - breaking event , Governor Richardson recalled that his predecessor Jack Campbell even wrote to John F Kennedy in the 1960s to point out New Mexico 's potential for the then nascent space industry .
He does n't want his state to miss the boat - or spaceship - a second time around .

A new poll reveals that more Americans would choose the Internet as their only news source than TV , radio and newspapers combined , and Internet reports are considered much more reliable that other media .
It also shows only 1 in 200 people surveyed believes newspapers will be a dominant source of information in 2014 .
The poll by Zogby International said as broadcast newscasts continue to lose viewers and newspapers struggle to stay alive , " the Internet is by far the preferred source for information , and … it is considered the most reliable source as well . "
The survey discovered 56 percent of adults nationwide would pick the Internet if they were allowed just one source for their news , while television , newspapers and radio earned the support of 41 percent – together .

Among Republicans , 56 percent would choose the Internet for their news , while among Democrats that figure was 50 percent .
Seventeen percent of Democrats said they would prefer newspapers as their only news source while 5 percent of Republicans made that choice .
The survey , which contacted more than 3,000 people and has a margin of error of 1.8 percent , revealed 38 percent believe news from the Internet is the most reliable , followed by television at less than half that figure – 17 percent .
Newspapers were in third at 16 percent and 13 percent chose radio .
Since a full 84 percent of American adults report having Internet access , the poll " reinforces the idea that the efforts by established newspapers , television and radio outlets to push their consumers to their respective websites is working . "
The poll said 49 percent of all respondents said national newspaper websites were very important and 43 percent said national television websites were important to them as a key source of news .
A total of 41 percent said local newspaper websites were important sources while 34 percent said local television stations were the same .
" That the websites of traditional news outlets are seen by a wide margin as more important than blog sites – most of which are repositories of opinion devoid of actual reportage – could be seen as an encouraging development for the media at large , " the report said .
And forget Facebook and Twitter : Just 10 percent consider Facebook as important for news while 4 percent said the same of Twitter .

Eighty - two percent said they believe five years from now the Internet will be the most dominant information course .
Television was second , at 13 percent .
The survey showed that only one - half of one percent – 0.5 percent – said they thought newspapers would be the most dominant source of news in five years .
It was only a few weeks ago when WND reported its own 12th anniversary .
WND began with the vision of its founders to create an Internet news source that would employ the highest standards and practices of the traditional American press in the world of the New Media .
That commitment is still reflected a dozen years later in WND 's mission statement : " WorldNetDaily.com Inc. is an independent news company dedicated to uncompromising journalism , seeking truth and justice and revitalizing the role of the free press as a guardian of liberty .
We remain faithful to the traditional and central role of a free press in a free society – as a light exposing wrongdoing , corruption and abuse of power .
" We also seek to stimulate a free - and - open debate about the great moral and political ideas facing the world and to promote freedom and self - government by encouraging personal virtue and good character . "
The ambitious undertaking was inspired by founder Joseph Farah 's 25 - year career in the newspaper business – a career that provided him with the opportunity to experience virtually every job one can do in that industry .
In 1987 , Farah got his first opportunity to serve as editor in chief of a daily newspaper in Glendale , Calif .
For the next two years , he ran the News - Press and a small chain of suburban weeklies with a combined circulation of 250,000 .
In 1990 , Farah was recruited to be editor of the historic Sacramento Union , the oldest daily west of the Mississippi and the first newspaper to hire Mark Twain – then known as Samuel Clemens .
Among its other notable alumni were Bret Harte and Herb Caen .
It was during his time in northern California that Farah became fascinated with new technologies emerging in the Silicon Valley during the pre-Internet era .
" My work in competitive newspaper markets had left me frustrated with the inherent inefficiency of delivery methods , the high cost of newsprint and the growing dominance of a few monopoly media corporations strangling out alternative voices , " he said .
" The idea of an ' electronic newspaper ' – one that could eliminate the heavy machinery and expensive supplies needed to be in the daily print world – was increasingly exciting to me .
I had seen the future of news long before the Internet came along . "
Inspired by the success of the DrudgeReport , the Farahs decided in the spring of 1997 the time to act had arrived .
After experiments with less - ambitious websites that did n't require daily updates , WorldNetDaily was launched , without fanfare , May 4 , 1997 .
The news site quickly emerged as one of the most popular in the world – voted so , in fact , every week for nearly two years running between 1999 and 2001 on the independent , European - based Global100.com .
Since then , WND – as it is becoming known to its millions of unique visitors – has broken some of the biggest , most significant and most notable investigative and enterprising stories in recent years .
( See " WND Scoops " for a comprehensive list of major WND exclusive reports that first saw the light of day in these pages . )
German literary giant , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , who lived during the time of the founding of the United States , articulated “ None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who think they are free . ”
We the people must face that reality if individuals want true freedom .
The Declaration of Independence states that all human beings have the inalienable right to pursue happiness .
It does not say that individuals have a right to happiness , just the right to seek it out however the individual defines happiness .
The Declaration of Independence also states that the only purpose for the existence of government is to make sure all individuals have this right secured , i.e. no one initiates force on another interfering with their right to pursue happiness .
What all this means is that individuals do not need any permission from their government to pursue their happiness .
They may need permission from other individuals or private businesses , but individuals do not need permission from their government .
One just cannot go into McDonald ’s and grab themselves a hamburger .
The individual must secure permission from McDonald ’s by giving McDonald ’s money in order to obtain the desired hamburger .
Likewise , one cannot just go to his neighbor and take the neighbor ’s calculator .
The individual must secure permission from the neighbor to obtain the desired calculator .
In neither case is the individual required to secure permission from a government official .
The reality in which the individual finds himself today is something quite different .
Today , the individual must secure permission from government in order to go into business , get a job , build a house , buy and keep property , and get married among many other activities .
As a matter of fact , there really is not much that an individual can do today without having to first obtain permission from a government official .
Although the individual is free to choose to purchase a hamburger from McDonald ’s , Burger King , and a slew of other sources , for the individual to buy the hamburger from McDonald ’sor others , McDonald ’s had to first receive permission from government officials to offer the hamburger to the public in the first place .
Had it not received that permission , the individual would never have been able to pursue his happiness through the purchase of a McDonald ’s hamburger .
One can apply this same scenario to any other business activity .
Individuals must even obtain permission from government to own property .
Private property rights really do not exist .
However , the greatest permission slip that must be obtained by the individual from his government takes place every year on April 15 .
This is the day when the individual must receive permission from his government to keep whatever portion of the income deemed appropriate by government officials that is earned by the individual .
We the people must recognize that today ’s reality is not what is described in the Declaration of Independence .
What exists today is not freedom .
It is enslavement .
“ None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who think they are free . ”
At least the following three activities must occur if America is to return to the tenants of the Declaration of Independence and individual liberty .
One , the Federal Reserve System and the income tax must both be abolished .
Government officials must be restricted from forcefully taking an individual ’s income indirectly through inflation , which is caused by the Federal Reserve System and excessive government spending , and directly through the forceful extraction of the individual ’s income through the income tax .
By defunding government the individual will then be able to keep all of his income to decide for himself how that money ought to be spent in his inalienable right to pursue his happiness .
Two , we the people must educate ourselves in the ideas of liberty learning and understanding the principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution .
Doing so will help recognize when government officials overstep their authority granted to them .
Finally , we the people must stop requesting , begging , demanding , and accepting any government funding not authorized by the United States Constitution .
Government has no money to give anyone except money that has already been taken from the individual in the first place .
Government does not create wealth .
Government redistributes the wealth created by the individual .
By not requesting , begging , demanding , and accepting government funding individuals increase their ability to exercise their inalienable right to pursue happiness .
Individual liberty means the individual is free from having to obtain permission from his government to seek out his happiness .
The price of individual liberty is eternal vigilance on the part of the individual to be sure that government officials do not interfere with the peaceful life of the individual ; a small price to pay to avoid tyranny .
ONCE routine , now often thought unkind , the cut may also be illegal .
Parental consent might not be enough to protect the circumcisers of baby boys from later legal action .
In a rare legal analysis of the medical procedure , the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute found that criminal and civil law lacked certainty , and that circumcision might abuse the rights of a child .
No specific laws currently regulate the removal of the penile foreskin in Australia , and there are few clear answers in general law , according to an institute researcher , Warwick Marshall .
" What is clear is that the current laws were not framed with male circumcision in mind , " he said in an issues paper released yesterday .
About 12 per cent of newborn boys are believed to be circumcised in Australia , down from 90 per cent in the 1950s .
The open source PHP language is seeing its first major update in two years courtesy of today 's release of PHP 5.3 , along with a long list of new features designed to expand its capabilities and accelerate performance .
The PHP 5.3 release is a bigger release than developers first intended , and takes on some features that were originally intended for PHP 6 .
The new release also comes as the open source language continues to face competitive challenges from multiple technologies including Ruby , Java and .net .
" I think that the 5.3 release ended up being much more comprehensive in terms of new features and functionality then anyone had envisioned , largely due to the delay of PHP 6 , " PHP developer Ilia Alshanetsky told InternetNews.com .
" Therefore it took quite a bit of time to release , much longer , then I think anyone had anticipated for it to take .
That said , I think the extra time was well worth it and 5.3.0 is a very impressive work by many developers . "
" As is usual for most substantial PHP releases , this version introduces a number of enhancements that make it possible to develop applications easier , making solving problems with PHP that much simpler , " said Alshanetsky , an active core developer of the PHP language and the release master for the previous PHP 5.2 release .
One of the ways that PHP 5.3 will make application development easier is with the new namespace support , which is a way to encapsulate classes and other PHP items .
Alshanetsky said that in his view , namespaces will allow for cleaner code and simpler naming conventions for PHP developers .
" At the present time , most library authors are forced to prefix their class and function names with the library names to avoid naming conflicts , which sometimes creates rather unwieldy names , " Alshanetsky said .
" This also should simplify utilization of multiple libraries that do n't necessary follow careful naming conventions of prefixing their class / function names within a single application . "
MySQL
PHP is often used in tandem with the MySQL open source database as part of the LAMP ( Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP ) stack for Web applications .
PHP 5.3 adds in a new feature called MySQLInd that replaces for the current libmysql library for connecting PHP with MySQL and holds the potential to optimize MySQL performance and memory utilization .
" When it comes to databases , in most cases the speed of the interface to the database is not the main bottleneck -- rather , the database operation are , " Alshanetsky said .
" There are definitely speed improvements of using MySQLInd over the standard libmysql , however I doubt that would substantially speed up most applications .
That said people with highly tuned MySQL applications may see improvement , due to faster , specialized interface . "
Overall , Alshanetsky expects that with PHP 5.3 , users should see a modest 5 to 15 percent performance increase in most workflows , compared to the current 5.2 release .
He added that some specialized workflows may see even higher benefits .
E_DEPRECATED
While adding new features is a key part of any new technology release , PHP 5.3 also does something different -- it makes it clearer which features may soon be disappearing .
The release provides for a new error code called E_DEPRECATED , which lets developers know where certainly functionality is set to be removed from the language .
" One of the issues we 've had before is that we did n't have an explicit error code for deprecated functionality and may have been difficult for people on an error - code level to determine what functionality may eventually be removed , " Alshanetsky said .
" By creating a dedicated error code for this , it would make it easy through the use of PHP 's error - logging facility to identify which aspects of your code base are using functionality that may eventually be removed , so that they can make the appropriate adjustments . "
The ability to mark features as being up for removal in a future version of PHP is coming as core PHP development continues on PHP 6 , the next evolution of the PHP language .
The PHP 5.x series has been available since 2004 .
" The general consensus of the PHP 's development team is many things currently marked as E_DEPRECATED will be removed in PHP 6 , so making things that are about to go away very apparent is very important , " Alshanetsky said .
HOLLYWOOD , Calif. , June 15 ( SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE ) —
God sometimes uses a surprise to get people ’s attention .
For Moses it was a burning bush that was not consumed .
In Los Angeles there is a Bible teacher and Pastor of a church that believes marijuana is for the healing of all nations .
This pastor who recently ran for Mayor of Los Angeles was arrested three years ago and sentenced to nearly five years in jail , but has yet to serve a day .
On Fox ’s Good Day L.A. with Jillian Barberie , Pastor Craig X Rubin , of Beverly Hills Green Cross , admitted , “ Yes , the City of Angels has spent millions of dollars trying to send me to jail . ”
This weekend was no different .
Rubin attended the world ’s largest marijuana expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center .
The event was put on by the Pastor ’s family and brought jobs and millions of dollars to the Los Angeles ’ sagging economy , but the event was marred by law enforcement ’s desperate attempt to send Rubin to jail .
Rubin who played the owner of Showtime ’s Weeds medical marijuana club and worked as a consultant on the show is on probation for opening a church that provided legal medical marijuana .
Rubin has stated repeatedly and publicly that the owner of the official travel agency for High Times Magazine ’s Cannabis Cup and the winner of a recent Cannabis Cup allegedly worked with law enforcement to have him arrested .
Bret Bouge owner of Apothecary Travel can be seen on video surveillance footage arriving with 25 pounds of marijuana and what appear to be the police officers who arrested Pastor Rubin at Temple 420 .
“ Eyewitnesses allegedly place Bouge going in and out of a private door belonging to legalzoom.com at exact time of the arrest .
We know that door was used by law enforcement agents all day on the day of our arrest from video surveillance . ”
Rubin went on , “ Robert Shapiro , spokesman for legalzoom.com , then called pretending to want to represent me .
There are simply too many coincidences and it is obvious to me by the footage and eyewitness accounts that Bouge was working with law enforcement that day . ”
In court during the trial Rubin alleged that the majority of marijuana he was arrested for came from Bouge and his brother who can be seen in the videos communicating with what appear to be the agents who arrested Rubin .
On May 20 , 2009 Rubin was granted permission to leave L.A. County for the first time in years and he took the first opportunity he could to leave town and attend a Bible prophecy conference in St. Louis with Evangelist Perry Stone .
He flew back to speak his family ’s cannabis expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center only to be confronted by Bouge as he spoke from stage .
Things were going fine for Pastor for the first two days of the convention as Rubin promoted the Lord and his film career taking photos with fans and signing autographs .
Rubin has appeared in the films : Haunted House of Chronic , Super High Me , American Drug War , Totally Baked and The Union and numerous television shows .
However when Rubin was as guest speaker at the Oaksterdam University ’s main stage at 4:20 PM speaking about his lifetime effort to end cannabis prohibition Bret Bouge allegedly began to harass “ Mrs. X , ” Rubin ’s wife .
“ From the stage I saw Bouge acting in a hostile manner with his face less than three inches from my wife ’s .
I wanted to jump off stage and deal with it , but made a commitment to Oaksterdam to be positive while on their stage . ”
After Rubin got off stage there was a confrontation between his entourage and Bouge .
“ If I have a problem or get in any trouble I go to jail for five years because I am still on probation , so I believe Bouge was there to create a problem , but we just walked away from him , ” claimed the pastor .
Lead singer of Los Marijuanos Pony Boy stated , “ Todd McCormick , one of the event organizers , was kicking Bouge out of the event until he offered to buy a booth for $ 1,500 just hours before the event was over . ”
Bouge paid the large sum in cash just to attend the final hour or two of the event and then never attempted to open the booth he paid for at the show — it did n’t appear that he came to promote his company , says Rubin .
Rubin believes the only reason Bouge paid the $ 1,500 cash was to start a confrontation and have the pastor jailed prior to this months hearing on the seizing of Rubin ’s life savings .
Rubin and his wife had invested their life ’s savings into opening Temple 420 where they taught the Ten Commandments and preached the testimony of Christ to marijuana users .
Rubin has since been given permission by the court to do the exact same thing and has opened a new location called the Beverly Hills Green Cross , a church that provides medical marijuana rather than a temple .
Rubin ’s forfeiture case will be heard this month in front of Judge Leslie Ann Swain ; the same judge who signed the arrest warrant for Rubin .
and refused to see him as a pastor , as required by law under Penal Codes 1524 and 1525 .
On the arrest warrant officers wrote that “ people are screened prior to being able to purchase marijuana . ”
Judge Swain crossed out that line and initialed it prior to the warrant be served .
At trial Rubin was not allowed to mention medical marijuana , the U.S. Constitution or the Bill of Rights because in the trial judge ’s words , “ It could confuse the jury . ”
On May 20th Rubin was asked by Judge Swain , after he informed the court that he now owned and operated a medical marijuana club , “ Is n’t that exactly what you were arrested for ? ”
Rubin replied , “ Yes , your honor , but I have judge ’s permission to own and operate a medical marijuana club ( facility ) . ”
Rubin then approached the bench and showed the judge his written minute order allowing him to do exactly what he is now convicted of and the reason his family ’s life savings was seized by the government three years ago .
Rubin ’s next court date will be June 25 , 2009 where he and his attorney Brett Rubin ( no relation ) will not only attempt to get back his money that was seized , but an additional $ 9,000 that law enforcement never reported .
During the campaign for mayor Rubin complained of the “ unholy alliance ” between Police Chief Bratton , who in the pastor ’s opinion runs a “ corrupt ” Narcotics Division , and the mayor who the Chief endorsed in an unprecedented way .
The pastor feels the City of Angels should be run by a godly person rather than a man who cheats on his wife .
He lambasted the mayor on Fox News for being an adulterer , which has been proven true again as the still - married Mayor just admitted to yet another affair with another local Los Angeles reporter , KTLA anchor Lu Parker , who covered the mayor during this past campaign .
Rubin thinks KTLA ’s reputation has been compromised because during his campaign for mayor KTLA used footage of him from a film saying it was real life .
I think the reporter should be fired and the mayor should simply resign before judgment is brought upon our city for his immoral behavior .
The pastor stated , “ God has n’t changed and if he punished the cities of Biblical leaders for their adultery he ’ll do the same to our city .
Especially since we are known as the City of Angels . ”

Steve Ballmer says he is willing to invest 5 % - 10 % of Microsoft 's operating income over the next five years on search .
That 's a boatload of money .
Specifically , assuming Microsoft 's operating income stays constant ( it will likely grow ) , it 's $ 5.5 - $ 11 billion .
So , is Steve making a smart $ 5.5 - $ 11 billion bet ?
In our opinion , no .
Even for a company as cash - rich as Microsoft .
Microsoft has been investing hundreds of millions a year in its Internet business for more than a decade and that investment has yet to generate a single dollar of return .
If you add up all the losses investment , in fact , you get a number that is similar to what Microsoft plans to invest over the next 5 years : $ 8 billion .
In other words , Steve has already been investing about 5 % - 10 % of Microsoft 's operating income on the Internet for the past decade , and he has nothing to show for it :
But this time it will be different ?
We doubt it .
Look at it this way :
Imagine that your stockbroker came to you and told you that there was a great new IPO you had to buy .
It was a company called " BING . "
Bing was not a new company .
Bing had been in business for about 15 years , during which time it had lost a cumulative $ 8 billion .
But Bing had a new product -- a search engine -- and this product , unlike all of Bing 's previous products , was going to be a huge success .
Of course , it was going to cost a bit to make the new product a success .
In fact , it was going to cost about $ 8 billion .
In five years , though , after Bing had invested $ 8 billion , it was going to mint money .
How much was Bing going to " mint " ?
Well , there was another company in the industry , Google , that had already become so successful that it was now generating $ 8 billion of free cash flow per year .
So if Bing eventually became as successful as Google , it would generate $ 8 billion a year !
So , Google was going to lie down and let Bing roll right over it ?
Well , no , probably not .
So maybe it was n't realistic to assume that Bing would have the same free cash flow as Google ?
Well , no , probably not .
In fact , maybe it would be more realistic ( but not actually very realistic at all ) to assume that Bing might make a lot less than $ 8 billion a year -- say , $ 1 - $ 2 billion a year , if it was very successful .
Or that , more realistically , once Google saw that Bing was actually making some headway , it might decide to spend some or all of its own $ 8 billion of free cash flow a year to protect its franchise , given that Bing seemed intent on destroying it .
And that , because Google already had 65 % market share of the search market versus Bing 's 10 % and had weathered all of Bing 's previous attacks , it might very well succeed in defending itself .
Well , okay , that might be more realistic .
So if Bing was super - successful , it might end up running a distant No. 2 to the market leader , Google , and always be only a fraction as profitable ?
Like , say , Yahoo .
So would you buy that IPO ?
We would n't .
Especially once we remembered that the reason Bing had lost $ 8 billion over the previous decade was that it had been trying desperately to catch up with other industry leaders -- namely , AOL and Yahoo - - and that it had tried and failed to do this despite hemorraging money while both of those companies coined it .
Search just is n't strategic to Microsoft , no matter how obsessed Steve Ballmer is with beating Google .
Microsoft can't do everything -- no company can -- and winning the search war is not critical to Microsoft 's long - term survival .
Protecting its operating system and office suite monopoly is critical , however , and that business is also under attack .
We think Steve Ballmer will lose his search bet , no matter how much he spends .
Given the relatively unimpressive returns we think we 'll get if he wins , moreover , plus all the other things he has to worry about , we 'd rather he just did n't make it .

has been shooting “ ” for the last few months and it already has a lot of early buzz , even though it ’s not scheduled to hit theaters until July of next summer .
Shyamalan ’s upcoming movie is based on the hit Nickelodeon cartoon series “ . ” “ Avatar ” is being dropped from the title in favor of just “ The Last Airbender ” so as to avoid the confusion with James Cameron ’s movie “ Avatar .
” The film is set in a fantasy world where the four elements of earth , air , water , and fire can be controlled through martial arts called bending , and the ruthless flame - manipulating Fire Nation is waging war to control the other nations of the world .
/ enlarge images below /
At the same time a young boy named Aang , the last surviving wind manipulator or Airbender and is also the Avatar , the physical incarnation of the world itself who possesses the ability to manipulate all four elements , is on a quest to stop the Firebenders and save the world , with his friends Katara , a water - manipulating Waterbender from the South Pole , and her brother Sokka .
But the skilled and vicious Prince Zuko , the banished Prince of the Fire Nation , is on the trail of the Avatar , seeking to regain his lost honor by capturing him .
Shyamalan has found a very young cast for his film . , a 12 - year - old first - time actor from Texas , will take on the lead role as Aang , the Avatar ( the spirit of the planet manifested in human form ) , the last surviving Airbender and a monk of the Air Nomads , a race of people with the unique ability to manipulate the air around them .
He is assigned with the task of keeping the Four Nations at peace . , “ ” star , who replacedstars as the evil prince Zuko. ’s Jasper Hale ) plays Aang ’s friend Sokka , a warrior of the South Pole ’s Southern Water Tribe , a race of people who can control and manipulate water .has been cast as Sokka ’s fourteen - year - old sister Katara .
will play the Earth Kingdom ’s rep named Suki andstars as Uncle Iroh .
Shyamalan is planning to develop a trilogy of Airbender films , with this first one hitting theaters on July 2nd , 2010 .
If you are looking for an easy way to make your life a little greener , try making your own stick of deodorant .
Homemade stick deodorant is an inexpensive , safe and natural alternative to the harsh chemicals and irritating fragrances found in store - bought deodorants .
This recipe uses a natural moisture absorber ( cornstarch ) , a natural deodorizer ( baking soda ) , and a natural anti-bacterial / anti-fungal oil ( tea tree oil ) to keep you feeling fresh and smelling good .
Apply this deodorant in the same manner you would the store - bought kind .
A little goes a long way , so use a lighter hand than you usually would .
Make sure the base is twisted all the way down to the bottom .
It may seem soft at first , but should set up after a few days .
The tea tree oil is for scent only .
You can replace it with any other essential oil .
If you have no essential oils on hand , you can opt out of the scent completely .
I would suggest you do n't , as it plays a big part in the deodorant .
You should be able to find it in your local grocery store , or order it online .
Otherwise , it might be better to just buy deodorant .
Yes , make sure it is clean before you put the deodorant in it , though .
It also might be helpful to have one that twists up and down .
If you have used deodorant before and have run out of it , wash it out and use that as the container .

Dear Websites , Please Follow These 10 Rules .
Dear websites !
Here are some general rules I ’d like you to follow .
Please , just to make me happy .
It ’s not that hard !
Open pop-unders .
Pop-ups were those additional advice windows containing helpful information or contests allowing you to grab music players for free .
Since a while , evil browser vendors hide them from my view .
( Firefox does not want you to have a free iPhone . )
However , clever programmers out there found a technology that still gets me the information I want when I want it : pop-unders that are triggered on click .
Use them !
Come on , bundle it with a little extra !
You know those boring programs you can download that do n’t exceed your expectations ?
They just do what you believed them to do .
One word : boring .
When I download an app , I want it to come with a bonus that shows customer ’s king and all .
Programs like Java , which by default comes spiced up with the really helpful and neat Yahoo Toolbar , are reasonable distribution patterns your app should follow too .
Long click paths help us relax .
Do n’t let me get to your product or offering too fast – make it a multi- part route .
Have you ever heard of mandalas ?
That ’s the ancient art of sandpainting that helps us humans get into trance .
Well , if you put your download or order form right on that first page where I ’m looking for it , how do you think I ’m going to reach the next spiritual level ?
It ’s like producing a mandala using a laser color printer : fast , yeah .
Trance , meditation , finding the meanings of life – no !
Use smallish , protected images when we zoom in .
We all hate to click on a thumbnail of a product , or a pic on some blog , only to discover there ’s a really hi-res photo of that pic opening on us .
Why ?
Because most of the time , that squelches our imagination and disillusions us .
Instead , as a webmaster , ensure you ’re opening a picture that ’s basically the size of the thumbnail plus around 6 - 8 pixels .
Extra tip :
Put a fat watermark over the zoomed pic , and when we right - click it , show the message “ Do n’t steal this pic , ’ cause if you do it will be gone and no one else can look at it . ”
( And sheesh , if by any chance you have a Creative Commons license on any of your content , get rid of it ... that stuff is worse than communism . )
Make that Captcha harder .
When you solve a picture to submit a form , you ’re expecting a riddle worth your attention .
No patronizing please , we can handle it .
Rule of thumb for captchas :
If you can read it , it ’s probably too easy .
Websites in the last years made great progress in this area – follow their lead .
Spread the article across several pages .
Have you ever come across a news article or blog post that had all of its content on a lengthy , scroll - intensive , single web page ?
That sucks , for obvious reasons : the mouse scroll wheel hurts our fingers ; the page takes longer to load ; we only get exposed to one blinking banner .
So , rule number 6 : please put your article on around 5 - 7 pages , depending on length .
You ’ll probably wanna shoot for around 2 paragraphs per page .
( Note the loading time between the individual pages should give people time to reflect on what they just read ... around 10 - 15 seconds should be fine . )
Inform me via email !
When you have a website , please email me about it – even if I did n’t opt in to that .
After all , how should I have opted in at your site ?
I did n’t even know it existed !
As a general guideline , people are most interested in steel abs , buying cialis , replica design watches , and dubious business offers from other countries , so if your website is about any of those , bring it on .
Use PDF files .
HTML is a lousy format to transmit information .
It does not properly fix the layout on the receiving end , allowing us to mess it up in all the wrong ways .
Instead of freezing the browser for a bit it loads too quickly , ruining all excitement .
It contains ugly brackets , like this one > and this one <.
The PDF format solves all these problems , so please , use it wisely , i.e. wherever you can .
Be the mystery guy .
This one is for all the blogs out there who have their Contact and About info just a click away from every page : please .
Stop it .
No one cares about you , and by revealing who you are , you ’ll spoil the mystery .
Have you ever read a Sherlock Holmes book that would start by showing us who ’s behind the killings ?
Have you ever watched a Columbo episode that starts by revealing who the murderer is ?
Lie .
That last one may be obvious , but I ’m listing it here anyway , for completeness : lie .
Do n’t tell me all the nasty details about your service .
Do n’t let me know about the secret program running in the background of the program I installed .
Do n’t disclose who ’s paying you .
Do n’t keep to your privacy policy .
( Note : if you ca n’t lie straightaway , then at least stretch the truth a little , bend reality , be a tad dishonest , or keep quiet about the stuff I would like to know .
It ’s not ideal , but better than no lying at all . )
Without lies , life would be boring indeed : a game of poker where all cards are on the table .
Who wants to play like that ?

Being a stay - at - home mom has many benefits , but intellectual stimulation is not one of them .
I spend two to three hours a day cooking and cleaning and an hour or more driving or walking - in other words , a lot of time where my mind is left to solitary wandering .
Sometimes I wish I had some feedback to my wandering thoughts , so I thought I 'd occasionally start doing some rambling on the weekends , just to get the thoughts out there to someone besides my husband and maybe provoke some conversation as well .
I would love to hear your comments , but I do n't like being told I 'm being an idiot , even if I am .
So please keep your comments respectful .
This week , I was thinking about JessTrev 's suggestion that the government should offer tax incentives for conscientious waste disposal , and also an article I read that said San Francisco was going to start fining people for not recycling .
It reminded me of a debate class I took in college where I debated about waste disposal .
My argument was that a program should be implemented in Kentucky ( where I was living at the time ) allowing people a certain number of trash bags a week , and if they went over that amount , they should be fined .
This kind of system would encourage people both to recycle and to use less in general .
But I lost the debate because all of my evidence to support my argument came from case studies and examples in California rather than Kentucky , and according to my professor , if you say the program should be implemented in Kentucky , you have to show evidence that it would work in Kentucky .
Personally , I thought that was totally stupid because no one had ever proposed it in Kentucky so of course there were no studies showing how it would work there .
But anyway ...
Thinking about all of these things , I had the following thoughts :
What if we were responsible for disposing of all of our waste ?
If something could be recycled , you would be rewarded for disposing of it , or maybe you would n't get anything , but if you had to landfill it , you would be fined .
Would that kind of system encourage people to buy more responsible and quality products , since they would n't want to pay a fine ?
Or would people just end up illegally dumping a lot of things ( which was one of the arguments of the other side in my debate class ) ?
Would knowing that they were responsible for disposal encourage people to buy less in general ?
If people were responsible for the dispoal of their own products , how would that influence the marketplace ?
Should the responsibility for waste disposal lie with consumers or producers ?
If producers were responsible for waste disposal , would they just end up cutting corners , sending things to countries where there are less strict laws ?
So these are thoughts I was having this week ... Any comments ?
Meetings have been taking place on Wednesday into evaluating damage to the pressure pane on Atlantis ’ number 5 window , after a work light knob was observed to be embedded between the pane and the dashboard panel .
The damage can only be fully assessed once the knob is removed , with the threat of a six month schedule impact to STS - 129 noted , should the damage prove to be unacceptable for flight .
STS - 129/ Atlantis Processing Latest :
Recently returned to the home comforts of her Orbiter Processing Facility ( OPF 1 ) after the successful STS - 125 mission , Atlantis is being processed for the November 12 NET ( No Earlier Than ) launch date for STS - 129 .
The final mission of 2009 will see Atlantis deliver the Express Logistics Carriers 1 & 2 ( ELC - 1 and ELC - 2 ) , along with SASA and MISSE ( Materials on International Space Station Experiment ) 7A and 7B , to the Space Station .
Processing is proceeding to plan , with functional testing and post flight deservicing and troubleshooting currently taking place .
“ The Aft Propulsion System ( APS ) pod functional checkout continues through next week , ” noted Wednesday processing information on L2 .
“ Waste Management System post flight servicing is complete less post ops .
The Star Tracker Lightshade inspection was rescheduled from yesterday to today .
S - band trouble shooting ( IPR - 0014 ) begins today . ”
Engineers are also working one issue noted with the orbiter cooling system , specifically the Freon Coolant Loop ( FCL ) 1 Radiator Flow Control Assembly ( RFCA ) , which “ failed to get into radiator flow on orbit . ”
However , engineers have been unable to recreate the issue inside the OPF .
“ Functional testing resulted in nominal operations , ” added the processing update .
“ The RFCA was cycled eight times without an anomaly .
Data will be reviewed with JSC ( Johnson Space Center ) and the vendor . ”
As per normal in an orbiter ’s flow , all of the vehicle ’s windows are being inspected for potential damage to the thermal pane – the outward facing pane – due to the usual occurrence of small MMOD impacts .
These panes can be replaced reasonably easily .
“ Window 1 Loctite application began yesterday and is scheduled to complete today , ” added Wednesday ’s update , following last week ’s installation of a replacement thermal pane on that window .
However , it was during those inspections where potential damage to the inward facing pressure pane was observed on Window 5 .
Window 5 Evaluations :
“ Quick shoe mount knob from a crew work lamp was found wedged between pressure pane 5 and dashboard panel .
Knob must be removed to evaluate pane condition before flight , ” noted one of two expansive presentations , dated June 24 , and created for high level managerial overviews – both presentations are available on L2 .
Several attempts have already been made to remove the knob by applying dry ice in the hope the knob would shrink , thus allowing for it ’s removal without causing additional damage to the pane .
However , those attempts have been unsuccessful .
“ The Shuttle expands when on orbit .
While on orbit , a knob got stuck between the window and the frame on Window 5 ( Pilot window ) , ” added another memo on Wednesday ( L2 ) .
“ They have tried a number of tricks to remove it with no joy so far .
“ If they have to remove the window , there is a schedule hit .
Initial estimates are long , but initial estimates always are long before they sharpen their pencils . ”
Those estimates speak of up to and over six months being added to the processing flow of Atlantis , which would have a major impact to the overall manifest that already has a full five flight schedule in 2010 .
Even if Atlantis was retired as a result of a half year - plus processing hit – one absolute worst case scenario noted by one engineer on Wednesday – two orbiters could complete the manifest .
However , due to LON ( Launch On Need ) requirements , a manifest stretch deep into 2011 would be the fallout .
Such discussions will not take place unless unacceptable damage is found on the pane after the knob is finally removed .
Inspections of knob have been carried out via borescope inspections .
Photography shows the mounting plate appears to be dug into close - out panel .
Further inspections will be required ahead of potential plans to remove the knob without causing additional damage .
Unique engineering plans would have to be drawn up in the event of unacceptable damage being found on the window , given a pressure pane has never been replaced at the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) over the history of the shuttle program , and ferrying Atlantis to Palmdale is obviously no longer an option – after the Orbiter Major Modification ( OMM ) facility at Plant 42 was shut down over six years ago .
The bottom line is Atlantis would not be allowed to fly – in the event of the pane breaching unacceptable damage criteria – due to the risk of the window failing during her next mission , which would result in a LOV/C ( Loss of Vehicle and Crew ) event .
“ Knob wedged between pressure W5 and dashboard could have caused damage to pane and its currently loading the pane at two points .
Removal of knob is required to evaluate condition of pane for flight , ” added one presentation .
“ ‘ Fly as is ’ is not an option , unknown damage and loads to the glass could result in failure during the flight , with no redundancy ; dynamic failure could result in redundant pane failure .
“ Induced damage of the knob being wedged between the glass and the dashboard closeout panel structure , or from removal of the knob could result in unacceptable damage .
“ Consequences of unacceptable damage to the glass pane : Replacing the pressure pane would result in a significant impact to ground schedule ( potential 6 + month impact ) .
Requires de-configuring dashboard structure and instrumentation to remove window assembly for refurbishment .
Windshield pressure pane removal has never been performed at KSC .
“ Knob removal must be performed carefully ; exhausting all risk free options first , then attempting more intrusive ( higher risk ) options , if others fail . ”
Damage to the pane is confirmed in the main overview presentation .
Although the full extent wo n’t be known until the knob has been removed .
“ Photos show evidence of existing damage to the pane .
Cannot be assessed until knob removal .
Glass is an aluminosilicate tempered pane ( t=0.65 ) .
Tempered layer 21 percent of thickness or around 0.13 inch .
Tempered glass has a built in residual stress , tempered layer penetration will result in failure . ”
As far as unacceptable window damage criteria , ding depth greater than 0.0015 ” and / or coating scratches with a width greater or equal to 0.050 ” are listed , along with “ no acceptable criteria for bruises or chatter checks . ”
The redundant pane – which is located between the thermal and pressure pane – is also considered an inadequate redundancy for pressure pane failure .
“ Analysis shows up to 70 percent negative margin of safety on redundant panes as a result of a dynamic failure at cabin pressure .
Energy from pressure pane failure may be enough to break redundant pane Constitutes a catastrophic failure for the mission as thermal pane is not certified to hold cabin pressure . ”
As to how the knob managed to find its way into the area between the dashboard closeout panel – which is the extension of the glare shield – and the window pane , changes in pressure for pre-launch to orbit operations , leading to the expansion of the orbiter ’s skin , is once again deemed as the root cause .
“ Crew module skin expands while in orbit due to 14.7 psi internal pressure ; flight deck floor deflection may also contribute to the relative movement between the console ’s dash and the CM window area , ” added one presentation .
“ Gap between the dashboard closeout panel and the window may have opened wider while in orbit ( to accommodate the knob ) .
Additional 7 psid and vibration from ferry flight might have wedged knob further .
Gap reduced when CM ( Crew Module ) internal pressure reduced ( descending ) .
Knob is exerting a preload on pressure pane and closeout panel . ”
An array of techniques have been listed as potential methods for removing the embedded knob from between the window pane and the console dashboard , although most are classed as holding risk of causing additional damage to the window – and are thus classed as last resorts .
“ Pressurize Crew Module and use dry ice on knob : DeltaP from pressurization would be much less than seen on orbit ( ~3 psid instead of 14.7 psid ) .
De-configure dashboard / console and instrumentation to free up knob .
Use an air bladder between window and dash , ” the presentation added .
“ Cut knob enough to yield part .
Cut out part of dash where knob is wedged :
Would damage dash likely requiring repair .
Cutting vibration could induce further damage to window .
Use pry bar to deflect dash down : Viewed as the riskiest removal method for all hardware involved .
“ Further damage could increase the potential for unacceptable damage , resulting in significant schedule impacts . ”
The options relating to the application of dry ice to shrink the knob have already been attempted , and failed .
However , the same method , along with a pressurization of the Crew Module , may be enough to free the knob from its lodged position .
The only problem is the amount of pressurization that can be conducted in the OPF is far less than the pressure that played a part in allowing the knob to become embedded in the first place .
“ Pressurize crew module and dry ice on knob to TBD ( To Be Determined ) pressure .
Pro’s : Could allow for uniform structural deflection to increase gap between pressure pane and dashboard ; enough to free up the knob non-destructively .
Less potential for inducing further damage to the pane .
** UPDATE :
The above option was selected on Thursday as the opening process for an attempt to remove the knob .
The cabin will be pressurized to 3 psid , before an engineer will apply dry ice to the knob .
This option is not deemed to be a likely solution , but more so the opening option that avoids additional damage to the window .**
New article , click here :
http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/06/atlantis-window-pane-begins-longerons-damaged-accident/
“ Con ’s : Maximum allowable pressure might be limited by crew module equipment and systems May not be able to exceed 3 psid ; as compared to 14.7 psid nominal ( orbit ) .
May not be enough pressure to dislodge the knob . ”
Removing dashboard and console components to free the knob from below the window is another option , but would lead to a large schedule impact for Atlantis ’ OPF flow .
“ Pro ’s : Less potential for inducing further damage to the pane .
If damage is found to be unacceptable , console is partially de-configured to continue with window assembly removal .
“ Con ’s : De-configuring console and instrumentation could represent a significant schedule impact .
Influence of panel removal on the knob are not known at this time . ”
A pressurized air bag method – involving one ( or several ) air bladders between window and the dashboard closeout panel adjacent to knob – could be used to apply pressure to deflect the dashboard enough to free knob .
However , without knowing allowable local pressure that can be applied , this technique could also result in additional damage to the window .
“ Con ’s : Risk of inducing additional window damage ( TBD by Stress Group ) , not quantifiable .
Current load on glass is unknown , additional load from air bladder may result in additional stresses to the glass .
“ Not enough open surface adjacent to the knob for bag contact .
Pressure may not be enough to deflect hardware and release the knob .
Possible to inflict permanent deformation to dash secondary structure . ”
A visit by the Dentist may prove to be a solution for Atlantis , via cutting the knob with a high rpm/low amplitude dental drill , just enough to allow for the knob to be freed from its current location .
However , the vibrations from the drill may transfer to the window pane and again increase sustained damage .
“ Pro ’s : Method can be accomplished quickly .
Does not involve manipulating window or dash hardware .
“ Con ’s : Potential for tool vibration to be transferred through knob into window induce additional window damage .
Debris release from cutting .
Knob would only be cut enough for tech to yield the piece . ”
Vibration concerns are also cited for another option relating to cutting out part of dashboard structure where knob is wedged , while another option of using a pry bar to deflect dashboard structure down ; enough to release the load imparted by the knob on the glass , again threatens further damage to the window pane .
Once the knob is finally removed – which has to be carried out – engineers will use their predefined criteria to hopefully clear the window for flight .
“ After knob removal , will assess / evaluate window damage .
Inspectors will inspect window per MT0501 - 514 requirements .
Mold impressions , visual examination , etc .
“ Stress evaluation will be required if surface damage reported is beyond the acceptable criteria 0.0015 ” for tempered panes or if bruising of glass has occurred .
Unacceptable damage will require a window assembly R&R , significantly affecting the flow schedule .
Bruised pressure pane will result in an automatic scrap .
“ NOTE : Damage is in an area difficult to reach ; if window inspectors are unable to assess the flaw , engineering is not able to perform an evaluation .
Access to the lower region of the pane is limited and removal of crew module dashboard and panel structure may be required for proper assessment . ”
For the interim , engineers will continue to meet , in order to discuss the best forward plan on removing the knob , before moving forward with the option that holds the least amount of risk of causing additional damage to the window .
“ Removal of the knob is necessary in order to evaluate the condition of the glass for flight .
Some of the options being considered involve risk to the hardware , ” concluding the main overview presentation .
“ Knob removal attempts should be performed by exhausting least risk options first .
More evaluation is required .
“ Forward Plan of Action : Will continue to evaluate and further develop these options and other feasible options in order to remove the knob with the least amount of impact to the hardware . ”

WOULD you like to own this little piece of the moon ?
Depending on which time zone you happen to be in , 20 or 21 July 2009 sees the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing .
Our competition to celebrate that historic event offers a rare and fabulous prize for the winner : a scrap of genuine moon rock .
The competition is simple to enter .
You will doubtless know the words relayed from Neil Armstrong when he stepped off Apollo 11 ’s lunar module and onto the moon itself : “ One small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . ”
Can you think of something better for him to have said – something even more memorable , or perhaps something funnier ?
How to enter
Your entry should be no more than 75 characters long ( including spaces ) .

It wo n’t be used for any purpose other than the competition .
The winning entry will be chosen from entries received by 5 pm GMT on 29 June .
It will be published in the 18 July issue of New Scientist , along with the best runners up .
The editor ’s decision is final .
Please read the Terms and Conditions before entering
The prize
The piece of moon rock is part of a lunar meteorite found by French collector Luc Labenne , in the Dhofar region of Southern Oman , on the eastern border of Yemen .
“ It ’s not a too tiny piece , and the end cut is the favourite part of the collectors when they can afford it , ” said Labenne .
“ So you have the cut part , which is flat , and the opposite part , which is the natural exposed part of the lunar meteorite during the entry to our atmosphere . ”
Our little piece of rock weighs almost 1.4 grams .
Typically , they are worth around $ 1000 per gram .
The piece has been authenticated as a lunar meteorite by researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles .
But before handing it over , we wanted to find out first - hand just how tricky it can be to distinguish a fragment of moon rock from a common - or - garden meteorite .
So we handed it over to Colin Pillinger at the Open University , in the UK , who worked on the original Apollo 11 moon samples .
“ It is more difficult to tell a lunar rock from a terrestrial one than any other , ” said Pillinger .
“ They are more valuable to collectors , even than Mars meteorites , but they are harder to be sure about . ”
With the help of Richard Greenwood , Andy Tindle , Ian Franchi , Michelle Higgins and Diane Johnson , it was subjected to a battery of tests .
Alas , it fractured into two pieces in the process , which is described in detail in Moon rocks and how to spot them .
But we are now confident that our moon rock is genuine .
We will present the moon rock to the winner in an engraved Perspex mounting : the ultimate prize to mark the anniversary of the great Apollo 11 adventure .
Due to the unprecedented interest in this competition , we have had to close entries on this page .

Overturn the ban and allow Internet gambling .
No .
Keep the ban and do n't allow Internet gambling .
View results
The federal government ’s recent seizure of millions of dollars from bank accounts used to process online poker transactions is sending shock waves through the Internet gambling community .
But insiders , including gaming giants poised to capitalize on the potential legalization of Internet wagering , disagree on how the action this month by the Justice Department will affect a controversial activity with millions of American participants .
The seizures , which follow other federal efforts to crack down on Internet gambling sites accepting bets from Americans , are among the most aggressive government actions to date involving poker sites .
Critics of the seizure say it wo n’t stop people from playing poker on the Internet and will fuel state and federal legalization efforts .
“ I have not heard one person saying , ‘ I am through with online poker , ' ” said one industry official in Las Vegas , who declined to be named .
“ It ’s just making people more militant and bitter against the government . ”
But others think it will make players think twice about gambling online .
“ If I begin to lose players because they ’re afraid to deposit with me , then I lose games and the rake they generate , ” said Christopher A. Krafcik , editor of the trade publication IGamingNews .
“ If I was a player , I ’d consider taking my money elsewhere . ”
Online gambling companies advertise extensively in the United States and generate billions of dollars from American gamblers , but are generally based in foreign countries .
Their operators believe U.S. laws criminalizing gambling do n’t apply to them .
By targeting payment processors , the Justice Department — which has long maintained that all forms of Internet gambling are illegal — aims to cut off the sites ’ money supply .
Until recently , many operators and players believed their money was safe from federal meddling because it was handled by foreign companies and held in offshore accounts .
American banks and credit card companies have generally exited the business of processing credit card transactions for online bets , which can be traced by merchant codes .
That void has been filled by debit card transactions and third - party payment processors , which maintain domestic bank accounts subject to U.S. laws .
On June 2 , a federal judge signed a warrant issued by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York to seize the assets in a Wells Fargo account in San Francisco held by Account Services Inc. , a company that processes transactions for major online poker sites that accept U.S. bets .
Details of the seizure were filed under seal , and the U.S. attorney and Justice Department have declined to comment .
The U.S. attorney also sent a subpoena to Allied Wallet , another third - party payment processor , to appear before a grand jury in New York on June 18 .
The subpoena requested documents including correspondence , records of financial transactions and contracts between Allied Wallet and Internet gambling companies dating to 2001 as well as information on owners and employees .
Both documents cite alleged violations of Title 18 , Section 1955 , of the U.S. Code , which prohibits “ illegal gambling businesses ” operating in violation of state laws .
The subpoena also cites Section 1956 , which prohibits financial transactions with unlawfully obtained proceeds .
The feds reportedly seized or froze more than $ 30 million in online gambling funds at multiple banks doing business with major sites , including Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars .
This is n’t the first seizure of its kind .
Last year , the Justice Department seized more than $ 20 million in U.S. bank accounts linked to Bodog , a major online gambling site that operates in Antigua .
The seizure included $ 9.9 million deposited in Las Vegas at Nevada State Bank .
This followed the 2006 arrest of BetOnSports.com CEO David Carruthers and the extraction of $ 105 million in fines from online gambling giant Party -
Gaming , which has admitted to breaking the law and has exited the U.S. market .
PartyGaming ’s co-founder also surrendered $ 300 million .
Internet poker supporters have downplayed the significance of such actions , saying the sites invited prosecution by offering sports betting , a major target for the feds .
Poker enthusiasts have argued that online poker involves a great deal of skill and therefore ca n’t be viewed as illegal gambling , which would involve games of chance .
Some add that their sites are n’t conducting gambling themselves and are merely hosting bets that occur among players — an argument similar to that made by music file - sharing Web sites that attempted to skirt federal copyright laws .
Such arguments are no match for the will and means of the Justice Department and its associates in the FBI and IRS , said Sanford Millar , chief financial officer and general counsel of Centaurus Games , a Las Vegas company that hosts free and subscription - only poker tournaments online .
“ The Department of Justice has never agreed with those arguments , ” said Millar , a Los Angeles - based tax lawyer who teaches law at California State University , Northridge .
“ If they think they are going to outmaneuver the U.S. government they are out of their minds . ”
The Poker Players Alliance , a lobbying group , thinks the Justice Department has overstepped its authority and is gathering a team of legal experts to assist the poker sites .
In a letter to its members Tuesday , the Alliance said some of the seizures were made “ without the benefit of proper warrants ” and show “ an almost shocking trampling of due process . ”
The feds seized money that belonged to players rather than the Web sites , and no federal law makes it a crime for a player to gamble online , the Alliance contends .
The laws cited by the feds come into play only after other violations of law , which may be tough to establish given that only a few states have made it a crime to gamble online , said I. Nelson Rose , an Internet gambling law expert who teaches at Whittier Law School in Southern California .
On the other hand , players whose accounts have been credited the amount of any seized funds do n’t have much of a claim against the feds , leaving that role to offshore companies , which are unlikely to come forward and stake a claim , Rose said .
Players or Web sites would have to identify themselves to make their case , giving the IRS an opportunity to demand tax records and any unpaid taxes , Millar added .
Rather than put up a fight , Bodog forfeited the money .
According to the poker alliance , major poker sites have credited the accounts of players whose money was seized and are “ completely committed to staying the course and remaining in the U.S. market . ”
Bricks - and - mortar casinos — which are no doubt concerned about opening the door to new competition , especially in a downturn — have remained largely silent .
One exception is Harrah ’s Entertainment , which is backing a bill by Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank to have the feds regulate online gaming .
The company recently created a Montreal - based interactive division to promote the company ’s World Series of Poker - branded tournaments worldwide .
Harrah ’s spokesman Gary Thompson calls the seizure of funds a “ nonevent ” that wo n’t slow online gambling or the company ’s lobbying efforts .
“ The fact that there are some zealots in the Justice Department that are cognizant of the support for legalizing Internet gambling in the United States and want to try to make a name for themselves before there ’s some legislation that passes and some rational approach toward this in this country wo n’t deter us , ” he said .
While federal regulators have framed their dislike of Internet gambling as a national security problem , Millar believes their primary concern is a social and financial one .
Gambling at home presents a bigger risk to Americans ’ homes and life savings , he says , than schlepping to the casino down the street — or across the country .
Based on the Bodog case , the feds appear to be creating a roadmap that will allow them to more quickly and effectively dry up gambling sites ’ bank accounts , Millar said .
“ This seems like an amazing waste of judicial resources when you ’ve got multi- billion - dollar scandals to worry about , ” Rose said .
And yet , this follow - the - money strategy , which has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars for the Justice Department , could pay off big .
Preamble :
Germany : better cars , better sausages , better beer .
England : better heavy metal bands , marginally better Christmas television schedule , better minute - by - minute reports on underage football tournaments .
So you see , it 's a draw so far .
The clincher could be which country produces the better international football teams and , well , we know the answer to that .
But tonight could bring proof , or at least hope , that the tide is turning .
If nothing else , the U - 21 European Champions crown would certainly be something for Blighty to crow about , if , indeed , Blighty needs an excuse to crow .
The omens are not good .
The fact that England could have prevented the Germans from making it this far by fielding a full - strength team rather than reserves when the sides meant in the group is something that can reasonably be expected to come back and taunt Stuart Pearce .
The fact that England will not have a specialist striker due to the monumentally silly suspension incurred by Frazier Campbell does n't augur well either , and Gabby Agbonlahor and Joe Hart 's omission are n't very encouraging either .
But at least it means we 'll likely see Theo Walcott in a central striking role , a position that many believe he could excel in if he could perfect his finishing .
As for Germany , well , I have n't seen them so all I can tell you is that they 're managed by Horst Hrubesch , the man who scored the decisive penalty kick against France in that epic World Cup semi-final in 1982 .
As such , he can be said to embody evil .
Teams :
England : Loach ; Cranie , Richards , Onuoha , Gibbs , Muamba , Cattermole ; Noble , Milner , Adam Johnson , Walcott
Germany : Neuer ; Beck , J. Boateng , Höwedes , Boenisch ; Hummels ; Johnson , Castro , Khedira , Özil ; S. Wagner
7:31 mins : Seconds into Sky 's punditry and Alan Curbishley has warned that Germany are " efficient " and " disciplined " .
I hope he was n't contrasting that to any supposed English flamboyance because Pearce 's team are functional pragmatists as per the Teutonic cliche .
Solidity , set - pieces and a dash of speed is what they 're all about .
Not particularly precise in possession they 're geared mainly towards the counter - attack .
7:36 pm : " Yes Paul , you are right , " bellows Roger Theberge .
" I can still feel the gut - churning injustice watching Germany go through in 1982 : Battiston being assaulted and that GUTLESS ref giving a yellow card for such bloody murder .
It hurt and I am not even French . "
Damn straight , except that as far as I recall , Schumacher did not even get a yellow !
I could be wrong about that , bitterness may have distorted my memory .
It happens to me a lot .
7:41 pm : The camera has just focused on the Dutch ref and I have to say he looks quite weak .
The English could have him for breakfast .
And not just because his name is Kuipers .
Actually , that is the only reason I said that .
1 min : England , in white to Germany 's red , get the game underway and immediately work it back to Loach , who punts it forward .
A sound early touch for the stand - in keeper .
2 mins : Johnson skins two German defenders down the left before being upended .
Milner swings in a deep freekick that Cranie heads over at the far post .
4 mins : Now that was a nifty move by England !
Muamba dinked a deft reverse pass to Cattermole , who slipped a dainty ball behind the German defence in anticipation of a surge by Walcott .
That surge duly came and the Arsenal youngster opted for a first time shot from the edge of the box with the outside of his boot .
It floated just over the bar .
6 mins : After England 's vibrant start Germany are trying to take control .
They 're holding on to t he ball all right , but no sign of them penetrating yet .
Or even approaching the English box .
" I must be going through a severe mid-life crises , " confesses John Thompson .
" Yesterday I was in my " British Pub " in Portland Oregon watching and supporting USA USA USA playing Brazil , and now I 'm at work following and supporting England U21s – and did I mention , I'm Scottish ! "
Well , you can't dine out on the Kirin Cup forever .
8 mins : Muamba - England 's player of the tournament in my book - wins back possession with a splendid crunching tackler on Castro .
The German had nearly got away from him .
Castro came close , you might say , but got no cigar .
11 mins : That was less smart by Muamba .
In attempting to get to the ball before Castro , he pushed the German to the ground .
That gives the sons of the Fatherland a freekick from about 29 yards .
It cannons off the wall ... and an England counter - attack is curtailed by a magnificent tackle on Walcott by Hummels .
" I ca n't see England winning international tournaments until we start picking players based on their intelligence to some degree , " lectures Steve Clowes .
" That tattoo is a bit off putting . "
Perhaps ,
Steve , you could give us an example of an intelligent tattoo ?
14 mins : Neat build - up by Germany , who cut England apart until Richards hurls himself in front of an Ozil shot to concede a corner .
" It 's as good as won , " declares Robot Boy .
" Germany were incredibly , ridiculously lucky to beat Italy .
They are not a match for the England team . "
Perhaps , but it could also be said that England were mighty lucky to beat Sweden .
The sides look evenly matched so far : England are faster and more direct , albeit mostly on the counter , while Germany are more inventive and cohesive .
16 mins : Another Milner freekick from the left wing arcs wide .
19 mins : Textbook shove in the back by Richards on Hummels leads to a corner for England .
Germany clear .
" You wanted an example of an intelligent tattoo , " recaps Matt Heath .
" I offer Carl Zimmer 's emporium of science tattoos . "
20 mins : Another example of direct , tricky running from Adam Johnson .
Right up to the bit where he fell over on the edge of the German box .
21 mins : Walcott on the rampage !
But Hummels rides to the rescue again .
" So does Steve Clowes equate having a tattoo with having limited intelligence ? " demands - to - know Phil Sawyer .
" Or does he have a sliding scale ?
I have a first class honours degree and a tattoo of the classic symbol for an atom on my arm .
Is this acceptable or will he be sending the tattoo police around with their wire scrubbers ? "
GOAL !
England 0 - 1 Germany ( Castro 23 ' )
Lovely goal .
Ozil ran through the heart of England 's midfield and then slipped a perfect ball between Onouha and Cranie .
Castro darted on to it and poked it past the out - rushing Loach .
" If you want to know what an intelligent tattoo is , you should read " Farewell Horizontal " by KW Jeter , " blathers Peter Remmington .
Thanks Peter , but I do n't have the time right now as I 'm commentating on a football match .
Care to offer a 50 - word synopsis .
26 mins : Cattermole rolls the ball out to Milner on the right .
He chugs forward a little and then attempts to direct a 20 - yard shot into the far corner .
Misses by a yard .
27 mins : Milner on the gallop again , but Boateng strides across to bring his progress to an end at the edge of the area .
" Ooooh , thanks for that link , Matt Heath , " gusges Phil Sawyer .
" I 'm wandering around the Science Tattoos Emporium like a kid in a sweet shop ... "
29 mins : Ozil is causing England plenty of problems .
He 's wandering all over the final third and no one is managing to shackle him .
Just now he snuck into the box undetected and was picked out by a good ball from the right - back .
Fortunately for England Ozil was , for once , incontinent in terms of control .
31 mins : Lots of gusto from England but little guile so far .
Johnson fires a shot well wide from 25 yards .
34 mins : Boenisch cracks one wide from out on the left wing .
" Say Paul , how come you do n't have that fancy automatic updater thing that are on the Wimbledon pages ? " groans Jon Whiting .
" Now I 've had to pull my F5 button out of retirement after years of overuse . "
German " That 's a darn good question , Jon , and one I shall put to our resident boffins along with my fist .
36 mins : Milner has come more central in a bid to get more involved - and the immediate effect is that he wins a freekick after being clattered .
England whack the freekick towards Onuoha at the back post and that 's meat and chemical - free beer to the Germans .
38 mins : Cranie swings in a dangerous cross from the right but England did n't have enough players in there - only little Walcott , to be precise .
Milner retrieved it on the opposite wing and his cross was nodded clear .
England are going to have to muster something more imaginative than this , you feel .
Well , I feel , at least .
41 mins : Germany briefly threaten on the counter as Beck feeds Johnson down the left .
But Muamba scampers back to tidy up .
42 mins : Another masterful tackle by Muamba .
He really is handy when it comes to sabotaging the opposition 's moves .
44 mins : As Germany probe menacingly around the England box , Richards loses his patience and barges a forward off the ball .
Freekick to Germany about 24 yards out .
Ozil curls it inches over the bar .
About 386 inches , that is .
But hold on , the ref reckons it took a nick off the wall , so Germany are given a corner .
Which they waste .
Still , the ball is at the end they would wish it to be at : not much sign of an English comeback so far .
45 mins : Right on cue , the ref blows for a half - time .
" Would it be fair to say that Wagner is running Rings around the England defence ? " chortles Simon Fullwood .
" Ho ho ho . "
Listen Simon , any more high - brow Wager puns and I 'll have to have a serious , hart - to - hart conversation with you .
Half - time chitchat : " So Horst Hrubesch can be said to embody evil , right ? " scoffs Wulf Englert .
" We are talking about a man who wrote a book about his passion for angling , for crying out loud .
How evil can he possibly be ? "
A fish slayer you say ?
Why am n't I surprised ?
The verdict so far : Mark Noble , theoretically England 's main central creator , has been insignificant and Theo Walcott too isolated .
And when England have sought to feed the Arsenal youngster it has usually been via crosses from out wide .
Let 's face it , that 's not exactly playing to Walcott 's strengths , is it ?
Germany have been more varied and canny in possession .
Though England have probably had the majority of the platy , Germany look the more likely to create another goal .
A set - piece or a mistake look like England 's most likely route to the net .
" If Phil Sawyer can use his tattoos to come through his exams with a first - class honors , then who are we to judge the intelligence of footballers by their use of the ink ? " chirps Justin Kavanagh .
" Say what you like about David Beckham , but he wo n't be forgetting the names of his kids when he 's ninety ( and still playing for England , no doubt ) . "
England substitution : Onuoha off , Mancienne on .
46 mins : Within seconds of the restart Boateng trips Walcott to concede a free by the left corner flag .
Milner 's delivery is good but Johnson 's miscued his attempted volley , allowing Boateng to clear from the edge of the six - yard box .
" Any update on the F5 situation ? " hollers Jim Harris .
" Maybe keeping in theme with tonight 's commentary , you could tatoo said boffin with ' I must never forget to enable auto - refresh again ' on his forehead ( backwards obviously , so he can read it in the mirror ) .
But will said tatoo increase or decrease his intelligence though ? "
GOAL !
England 0 - 2 Germany ( Ozil 48 ')
Oh dear .
Poor young Scott Loach .
Ozil has just beaten him with a freekick from about 35 yards .
It swirled a bit but was in the middle of the goal and the keeper got his hands to it but allowed it to squirm away from him and into the net .
A blunder , no two ways about it .
" The moment Germany scored , Andy Murray 's game picked up .
I 'll say no more , " promises Gary Naylor .
Let 's see how long he keeps his word for , eh .
51 mins :
The problem is palpable : England are athletic but ponderous .
There is little variety , invention or unpredictability to their game .
Now where have you heared that before ?
53 mins : Loach , in fairness , is determined not to let that goal get to him and reacted smartly to dash off his line and intercept another cute through - ball from Hummels .
55 mins : Boateng heads a freekick over the bar .
England need to find two goals but at the moment they can't get the ball .
By the way , did you know that if Germany win tonight they will then hold the European U - 21 , U - 19 and U - 17 titles ?
That 's never been done before .
Is a German football renaissance under way ?
Any chance of an English one any time soon ?
57 mins : Stuart Pearce has to do something because as things stand there is no chance of England getting back into this game .
Rodwell should come on for Cattermole , I reckon .
Germany will still win , mind .
" I remember the Seville game about as well as you can expect for it having been 27 years ago , " recalls Doug Green .
" The game that turned me into an avowed fan of the French and an avowed enemy of German football .
You 're right , the incredibly feeble referee ( a Dutchman , Charles Corver - which I admit to having Googled ) did n't even give the thug a yellow card .
I 've always thought Schumacher should have done time for that , never mind get a card . "
58 mins :
That 's an improvement .
Mancienne strode into midfield and knocked t he ball to Milner , who took it forward and thwacked a fine effort inches over the bar .
60 mins : Oh-oh .
Here 's another freekick to Germany , in exactly the same position that the last goal was scored from .
Fortunately Loach was not called upon to do his David James impression this time , as Ozil blasted his effort into the wall .
62 mins : Oh so close !
Milner did brilliantly to slalom to the by - line before cutting a ball back to Johnson , who met it at the near post just three yards out !
His connection was decent but Beck performed heroically to scoop it off the line !
" U - 21s , U - 19s , U - 17s , " snorts Oliver Dennis , who is just unable to resist adding the following : " Let 's not forget U - boats .
The Germans have also done very well in them . "
64 mins : Pearce almost charges on to the pitch to protest at a brutal foul by Boenisch on Milner .
The German is booked .
Speaking of brutal fouls : " If it is any consolation I did hear that Schumacher was roundly booed at all of his away league games in ( West ) Germany for a season or so after that incident , " chips in Colin Johnston .
66 mins : England have cranked up the tempo and starting to Germany a little .
But they are undermining their attacks somewhat by resorting to long balls to Richards , who is now venturing forward with regularity .
Germany are not entirely sitting back , though , and still look menacing at times .
And certainly slicker than England .
67 mins : England still can't get a grip on Ozil - not even from a corner .
They allow him sneak over to receive the ball short and fire a fierce effort into the sidenetting .
69 mins : Germany change : Johnson off , Schwaab on .
" This is not one of those games which arouses great passion in my English heart - unlike the Lions v Eye - Gpugers , with a scratch side bridging gulfs of class and nation to almost pull it off , " fumes Fred Lane , who , you will note , is following this game all the same .
71 mins : Another clearance off the line by Beck !
This time it was from a glancing header by Cattermole after a Milner corner .
" It 's just so depressing this whole situation , " sobs Angus Chisholm .
" Stuart Pearce has done a decent job with the U21s from a certain point of view .
The point of youth football , though , should be striving for improvement and technical development .
Is that what we 're seeing here , at the highest level of pure youth football in Europe , from England ?
No .
It 's maddening .
Why have n't they learned their lesson ?
Crosses and long balls to Walcott are just stupid .
There 's no other word for it .
If Pearce can't talk that out of his charges and introduced a bit of multidimensionality to their play then it 's just bad coaching pure and simple .
Should n't we expect better from these players , many of which play for premier league clubs ?
The U21s of late have served their purpose in some instances .
They were somewhat important in Walcott 's earlier development when he was more of a bit part player at Arsenal , and they 're having a similar effect on Gibbs now , but English youth football is in a poor way and it needs to improve .
Where is the emphasis on technique ?
At all levels of the game , most of the time , technique and good ball players will triumph above nebulous concepts like ' bottle ' and ' guts ' , and agricultural concepts like high , aimless long balls .
Even if England win from here it would surely be a rather hollow victory .
England deserve better and I'm Australian for Christ 's sake . "
I was with you until you said England deserve better : performances like this are precisely what is deserved for the reasons you allude to .
73 mins : Germany taking the winds out of England 's sails with some patient passing .
" Paul , I remember that France v West Germany game so well because my junior school had a sweepstake on it ( is that even legal ? ) , " rambles Tony Long .
" I had France and would have won 50 quid if they won .
I was gutted , I might have finished a Panini album if I had won that .
Anyway the Schumacher assault was n't even deemed a foul .
A goal kick was given . "
You are absolutely right .
Top memory .
75 mins : Noble takes down the ever - influential Ozil , conceding a freekick about 25 yards out , wide on the left .
It 's crossed towards the back post , where Richards rises well to nut it away .
76 mins : England try to mount a snappy counter - attack , but once again it 's brought to and end by Hummels , who intercepts a well - intentioned Johnson ball just before Walcott could collect .
77 mins : Germany tear down the other end and Scwhaab fires just over from the edge of the box .
78 mins :
That should have been victory for Germany !
A lovely ball from midfield found Ozil wide on the left and he served it on a plate to Wagner , who somehow failed to get a proper touch on the ball from three yards out !
79 mins : England substitution : Muamba off , Rodwell on .
Richards has now taken up permanent residence up front .
GOAL !
England 0 - 3 Germany ( Wagner 80 ' )
A simple , wickedly incisive move on the counter .
The outstanding Ozil was again at the bug of it , romping through the middle before slipping a well - timed pass into the path of Wagner , who , this time , tucked the ball expertly under Loach from 10 yards .
" By the way , Wagner is Germany 's Emile Heskey , " scrawls Clarke Whitney with poor timing .
82 mins : Germany are toying with England now .
They have been superior all night - defter and cuter - and they 're rubbing it in now .
" Surely it 's a good thing that our young players are getting to lose to the Germans at youth level ? " propounds Oliver Dennis .
" That sort of experience will definitely prepare them to progress to the England senior team . "
83 mins : Germany change : Hummels - who also played splendidly tonight - is replaced by Aogo .
" At least England are young and have only let in three , " poops Mark Ireland .
" I 'm 40 and have just go back from being run off the park by a bunch of 20 somethings .
It was a " married " v " unmarried " game .
The unmarried men won 8 - 1 , showing that being married does n't mean you can score whenever you like .
In fact you 're lucky to score at all . "
GOAL !
England 0 - 4 Germany ( Wagner 84 ' ) Germany 's Emile Heskey , mein Arsch !
Wagner has just collected the ball wide on the left , sauntered forward and curled a sumptuous shot past Gardner and Loach and into the far corner .
Shades of Norman Whiteside at Wembley all those years ago .
87 mins : England , featuring a team of Premier starlets , have been totally outclassed .
And Germany want a fifth .
" U - Boats , that 's some 70 years ago , " frowns Oliver Driesen .
" Schumacher , almost 30 .
May I suggest that you Brits try hating us for Pope Ratzinger who is still in charge .
89 mins : Germany change : Ozil off , to tremendous acclaim , and on comes Schmelzer .
This Ozil chap will surely graduate to the senior mannschaft sometimes real soon .
By which , of course , I mean , add to the one cap he got a few months ago .
( Thanks Clark Whitney ! )
" I thought we 'd manage to get through the full 90 minutes without any national stereotypes , " admits the oh so naive Phil Sawyer .
" But Chris Waddle on 5 Live has just played the ' ruthlessly efficient ' card .
So could I counter with a ' tactically inept ' regarding England ?
Or is a simple ' hopeless ' more appropriate ? "
Tactically and technically inept , I would say .
89 mins : Germany spraying the ball around like F1 winners with champagne , k and England will be lucky not to lose 5 - 0 here .
Despite the introduction of Gardner for Cranie with seconds to go .
Full - time : England are put out of their misery .
Germany were far superior , tactically and technically .
It 's hard to imagine that the presence of Agbonlahor , Campbell and Hart would have made much difference .
Though Hart would probably have done better for that second goal .
The stats show England had 60 % of the possession but they did n't know what to do with it .
Germany were far more clever and cutting , as shown by their 17 shots to England 's eight .
And , of course , their four goals to England 's zero .
" Who the heck is Wagner ? " shouts Wulf Englert .
" Never heard of him before and just had to look him up on Wikipedia .
Second league club MSV Duisburg might be in for a bonanza .
Come on Man City , you know you want him ... "
Danke schon , dear readers , and auf wiedersehen .
Ja ?
P.S. The delighted victors are doing a lap of honour , carrying a large , pre-printed banner saying " thank you very much , Sweden " - in Swedish .
Just as during the match , the Germans have a lot of class .
" Congratulations to the English team for trying , " froths tonight 's final contributor , Dr Peter Beringer .
" And all the best to the young chap who said that England winning was a foregone conclusion .
And to Mr. Driesen let me say : the English probably appreciate us for Ratzinger .
They also appreciate us for U - Boats and all the other Dreck .
They hate us for beating them up at football .
Well , we have less money in the Bundesliga .
We are no masters of the universe with billions of borrowed money to throw about .
But 80 million Germans make for a better base than 50 million English .
In the opening match of soccer 's World Cup Friday , German midfielder Torsten Frings scored an amazing goal from 40 yards out .
The ball started off straight and then tailed sharply to the right in the last 10 yards or so .
It was an unstoppable shot , but with a different ball it might have been a simple save .
A scientist has explained why a new ball being used in this year 's World Cup is frustrating goalies .
The new Adidas Teamgeist football , as it is called , has 14 panels instead of the 26 or 32 that traditionally create the hexagonal pattern .
Fewer panels means fewer seams , which will make the ball behave more like a baseball , says Ken Bray , a sports scientist at the University of Bath in the UK .
Complex whirls of air cause a spinning ball to drift toward the side that 's spinning away from the ball 's direction of movement [ learn why ] .
A ball that 's not spinning can bounce around unpredictably .
Pitchers rely on this physics when throwing knuckleballs .
A good knuckleball is crazy because the ball rotates lazily in the air and the seams disrupt the air flow around the ball at certain points on the surface , Bray said .
" With a very low spin rate , which occasionally happens in football , the panel pattern can have a big influence on the trajectory of the ball and make it more unpredictable for a goalkeeper , " Bray said last week .
Bray suggests one way to watch for the effect on TV .
" Watch the slow motion replays to spot the rare occasions where the ball produces little or no rotation and where goalkeepers will frantically attempt to keep up with the ball ’s chaotic flight path , " he said .
