After a 16 - month investigation into the friendly fire death of former NFL player Pat Tillman , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a report Monday that is critical of what it termed a " near universal lack of recall " by top White House and Defense Department officials about events surrounding the fratricide .
The 49 - page report made the case that top Bush administration officials , including former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , had effectively stonewalled the investigation .
But it failed to issue any recommendations and effectively washed its hands of the issue .
The full committee is expected to review and vote on the report Thursday , with the possibility that committee Republicans could offer a minority view .
" It disappoints me that there is no recommendation and they are not trying to take this further , " Mary Tillman , Pat 's mother , told ESPN.com .
" What 's particularly troubling is these top officials all have convenient amnesia .
That is absurd .
Everybody in the White House can't remember ? "
The Tillman family has long believed that Tillman 's celebrity was used to prop up the war effort and was a factor in the five - week delay between his death and the Army 's acknowledgement that he had been killed by his own men .
Immediately after Tillman died on April 22 , 2004 , the family was told he'd been killed at the hands of the enemy in the rugged mountains of Afghanistan .
According to a report produced by the Army Chief of Staff 's Office of Public Affairs on April 25 , 2004 , news of Tillman 's death had helped generate the most media interest in the U.S. Army " since the end of active combat last year . "
The report also noted that " The Ranger Tillman story had been extremely positive in all the media . "
The Army did n't go public with news that Tillman had been killed by his own men until May 29 , 2004 , even though top Army officials knew that fratricide had been suspected almost immediately .
The House report depicts committee investigators as stymied at nearly every turn in their efforts to get answers from key White House and administration officials concerning who knew what about the fratricide .
According to a person close to the investigation , " Nobody remembers anything .
That is what we walked away with . "
Investigators revealed in the report that White House officials sent out nearly 200 e-mails concerning Tillman on April 23 , 2004 -- the day after his death .
Several came from staff members of President George Bush 's re-election campaign , urging the president to respond publicly to Tillman 's death .
The White House made an immediate statement , despite a Department of Defense policy intended to provide a 24 - hour period for private grieving before publicly discussing a casualty .
But in contrast to the earlier flurry of e-mail , not a single discussion of the fratricide was found by investigators in approximately 1,500 pages of e-mails between senior White House officials , as well as in other documents turned over by the White House .
" [ T ]he complete absence of any communications about his fratricide is hard to understand , " the report noted .
" Not a single written communication about the personal reactions or the substantive , political , and public relations implications of the new information was provided to the Committee . "
Tillman was on the radar of Washington leaders soon after he left a lucrative deal with the Arizona Cardinals to join the Army Rangers .
Secretary Rumsfeld sent him a personal note commending him for his " proud and patriotic " decision after his enlistment in 2002 .
Rumsfeld also dispatched a memo to the Secretary of the Army , noting that Tillman " sound [s ] like he is world - class " and saying , " We might want to keep our eye on him . "
As for when he learned that the Army 's prize soldier had been killed by his own men , Rumsfeld testified at the second of two committee hearings , " I do n't recall when I was told and I do n't recall who told me . "
Investigators found that Gen. Richard Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , called then - NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue a day after Tillman 's death to alert him of the incident .
But Myers told the committee he could n't recall whether he informed Rumsfeld or the president about the possible fratricide .
The report said that investigators interviewed seven key White House officials about the response to Tillman 's death , noting : " Universally , these officials said they could not recall when they learned about the fratricide or when the President learned . "
" That is not believable to me that in every situation with regards to this administration and all of them , everybody has collective amnesia , " Mary Tillman said .
" There is something suspicious about that .
It is ridiculous and very suspicious . "
In that context , the report of the committee , chaired by Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , is n't far out of step with the Tillman family , concluding : " If the testimony the Committee received is accurate and if the documents submitted are complete , then the intense interest that initially characterized the White House 's and Defense Department 's reaction to Corporal Tillman 's death was followed by a stunning lack of curiosity about emerging reports of fratricide and an incomprehensible carelessness and incompetence in handling this sensitive information .

Like every web developer I ’ve spent a lot of time using the Firebug extension to Firefox in my day - to - day development .
I ’ve found it interesting to see how my development methodologies have changed with access to that tool .
Unsurprisingly , my personal development style mirrors much of the general web dev public .
But what I find most interesting is to try and track trends in web development that Firebug has single - handedly revolutionized .
Firebug Advances
Performance Profiling
Prior to Firebug there was only rudimentary analysis of JavaScript performance ( using tricks like injecting timers and computing the difference ) .
Firebug brought us the ability to analyze all function calls during a period of execution , see how they each affected each other and , probably most important , see the difference in the sub- millisecond range .
Previously none of these techniques were possible with pure - JavaScript techniques – having the ability to tap into the JavaScript engine ( which Firebug does ) is fundamentally important to getting good analysis .
You can see an immediate interest , by JavaScript library authors , in the performance of their code bases around the time of Firebug ’s introduction of profiling .
Console logging with object introspection
Logging statements has always been possible with JavaScript ( and , most infamously , with the alert ( ) function ) however Firebug gave us something significant :
The ability to click and introspect into logged objects .
This includes the ability to click DOM nodes ( and see their properties and methods ) and even normal objects ( like Arrays or Object literals ) .
Firebug has to maintain a lot references to point to where these objects exist – and it would n’t be possible in pure - JavaScript without introducing an excessive number of memory leaks .
Current Styles / CSS Rules
There had existed some tools for examining the current CSS style values of a DOM element ( such as its dimensions and positioning ) but Firebug brought a whole new level of inspection :
The ability to see which stylesheet rules were introducing specific styling on an element .
Not to mention the ability to edit the rules in - line ( along with disabling them outright ) .
This level of inspection completely overhauled Web Design – and has been able to detach many web designers from their IDE - of - choice into a more agnostic view of CSS design .
Absolutely the biggest short - coming of this feature is its inability to work cross - browser ( although , that argument can certainly be used for most Firebug features ) .
Network Performance
Firebug ’s network tab gave developers the ability to see – in very real terms – two things :
1 ) How long a resource was taking to load and 2 ) How the loading of that resource was blocking the loading of other resources .
# 2 is especially important , seeing that the execution of JavaScript blocks other actions from occurring can be an eye - opening experience to most developers .
Or even seeing how a slow - loading stat tracking script can prevent the further display of the page .
XMLHttpRequest Inspection
While XMLHttpRequest use existed prior to the existence of Firebug it was horribly hard to debug – it was rarely obvious where errors were occurring – on the client - side ? on the server - side ? in the transmission ?
The ability to see how the requests occurred – and very importantly – how long they took ( and even how frequently they occurred ! ) has done much to improve the overall quality of Ajax use on web pages .
JavaScript Debugging
I would ’ve said that JavaScript Debugging was a piece of that equation , as well , however Venkman definitely lead the way , in that respect ( and has been a de- facto debugger for quite some time ) .
I ’d argue that these trends would n’t be where they are right now if it were n’t for Firebug – and that tools are the primary reason for a development strategy ’s success .
As a corollary look at the relative success of web standards – I ’d argue that adherence to HTML or CSS would n’t be where it is today without the tools to verify a page ’s compliance .
How to Improve
The question now becomes :
What are the next set of tools that Firebug can introduce that will revolutionize its respective areas of development ?
I ’d like to propose a couple , possible , areas of interest :
JavaScript Library Analysis
As it stands Firebug ’s JavaScript function analysis is , perhaps , too finely - grained to provide help in many instances – especially when the use of JavaScript libraries is at play .
For example , when using jQuery , you ’re generally more concerned with finding out how fast , or slow , a particular method is – or a selector – not the performance of all the individual internal methods of jQuery .
I began some of this analysis with my Deep Profiling jQuery Apps experiment but that ’s really only a test .
Smart integration of JavaScript library knowledge into Firebug can provide significant details about how your code should be performing .
Visual Performance Profiling
Application performance profiling is rather clumsy right now , we have a number of disparate resources ( network performance , rendering performance , script performance ) that we need to mentally merge to create a full picture of what ’s happening .
To counter this I ’d like to propose a way of visually viewing how components of a site affect its overall performance .
Perhaps a way to break things down like this :
Header : 300ms : 20 ms Transmission + 20 ms Parsing + 60ms CSS + 200 ms JavaScript
Google Ad : [ BLOCKING RENDERING ] 600ms : 20 ms Transmission + 20 ms Parsing + 20ms CSS + 240 ms JavaScript + 300 ms Frame Loading
Sidebar : 400 ms : 40 ms Transmission + 40 ms Parsing + 80ms CSS + 240 ms JavaScript
The YSlow Firebug plugin already provides some level of analysis on your site – but it ’s much more holistic ( giving you generic tips for files and pieces of code ) .
Whereas a more specific approach would be greatly appreciated .
Ajax Improvements
We currently have the ability to view XMLHttpRequests as they occur , which is great , but some additions could be made that would serve to be quite helpful , such as :
The ability to manipulate a request and re-submit it .
If you ’re attempting to see how different inputs will affect your site , this would be a great way to play back requests or see how they can be best improved .
Right now Firebug only lets you know the basic textual output that ’s coming from the server - side .
Having it be able to tell you if incoming XML , JSON , or even HTML is syntactically correct ( and even being able to navigate the resulting structures – as the browser would see them ) would be a huge boon .
As it stands it can be quite frustrating to receive a slightly - malformed response from a server and be stuck trying to figure out what ’s going wrong .
Better JSON / JSONP integration is essential .
There are a large number of Ajax requests being done through dynamic script tag injection – and those are completely unmonitored by Firebug ’s XMLHttpRequest tracking .
Being able to see what requests and responses look like – and where errors may be occurring – would be immensely useful .
Rendering Performance Analysis
While we have fantastic tools for digging in to the performance of JavaScript – CSS is a complete unknown .
How much overhead do our stylesheets provide ?
How many elements does this CSS rule affect ?
Does this rule cause a costly reflow to occur ?
and how many times ?
How long does it take to render a particular portion of a page ?
Would changing the structure of my page help to improved perceived rendering speed ?
Virtually all of these questions are un-answered and we need a tool to help provide a solid response .
Security Analysis
Security is one area that has seen virtually no attention in the respect of user tools .
Most developers have no idea how secure their web site is or how vulnerable it may be to attacks .
There needs to be easily - accessible tools for testing :
SQL Injection attacks
XSS Injection
Susceptibility to Spoofing ( Data Encryption )
At the very least .
The problem here is that while these tools will be incredibly useful for developers to improve their web sites – it ’ll also encourage malicious behavior .
Although , arguably , those that wish to be malicious already have the tools to do so .
Standards Integration
Inline support for analyzing the standards - compliance of a page .
Being able to see notes next to specific elements , attributes , CSS rules , etc. that show information on how they do n’t comply with particular standards – or even how they could be improved to match standards .
This includes inline strictness warnings for JavaScript ( produced by the JavaScript engine ) .
I think that compliance should go a step further , as well , and look to provide information on Microformat and RDFa compliance – pointing out specific errors and helping sites to become better formatted .
Finally – RSS and Atom standards compliance .
Notifying a developer that their site ’s RSS / Atom feed is malformed would allow them to immediately make a more compliant feed ( a common area of mistakes ) .
Internet Explorer Support
The final , and perhaps most difficult , item that should occur would be a port of Firebug over to Internet Explorer .
Both Safari and Opera have web developer tools integrated into their browsers – however Internet Explorer still consumes a majority market share and there ’s no good tools in sight .
( I , personally , use CompanionJS but it ’s still a far cry from the full suite of utilities that Firebug provides – especially in the realm of DOM / CSS . )
This could probably be remedied if there was a really good pure - JavaScript Firebug ( although the overhead associated with many of Firebug ’s features would lead to an astronomically - sized implementation ) .
The current “ Firebug Lite ” is something of a joke – only vaguely functioning in modern browsers .
Not only do I want to see Firebug improve – it ’s imperative that Firebug continue to improve , for the sake of web developers everywhere .
If it simply stalls and works into a stasis of bug fixes then web developers will be stuck with the current set of tools for quite some time .
While other browsers are improving at a rapid pace , it ’ll still be quite some time before they are able to match the current feature - set of Firebug .
Since so much of web development ecosystem is currently linked to the health of a single tool advances have to be made now and they have to be made quickly in order for the web to flourish and survive as a development medium .
Controversial Rachael Ray Dunkin ' Donuts Ad Pulled ( Photo )
recently shot a Dunkin ' Donuts commercial and a firestorm has erupted to the point where the ad has been pulled .
That 's right - DD could n't take the heat and decided to get out of the kitchen .
The company canceled an ad in which RR was wearing a scarf that has been identified by her critics as a keffiyeh .
For many it symbolizes terrorism .
Particularly vocal was ultra conservative Fox News commentator Michelle Malkin who pushed for a Dunkin ' Donuts boycott and wrote in her syndicated column :
The keffiyeh , for the clueless , is the traditional scarf of Arab men that has come to symbolize murderous Palestinian jihad .
Popularized by Yasser Arafat and a regular adornment of Muslim terrorists appearing in beheading and hostage - taking videos , the apparel has been mainstreamed by both ignorant and not - so - ignorant fashion designers , celebrities , and left - wing icons . "
In a recent online ad , Rachael Ray is wearing a black - and - white silk scarf with a paisley design .
It was selected by her stylist for the advertising shoot .
Absolutely no symbolism was intended .
However , given the possibility of misperception , we are no longer using the commercial . "
At first the donut empire let the complaints go unheeded but eventually bowed to public pressure and released this statement :
Check out other keffiyeh examples below .
The iTunes Store is accessible once again from China , following local internet police moving to block access to the media service last week in a spat over a pro-Tibet album sold through iTunes .
It 's an odd example of censorship despite that - the web page for downloading the pro-Tibet album , which is suspected of prompting the crackdown , remains unavailable on the service , claims SFGate .
i Tunes users in China - including athletes in the Olympic village , 40 of which downloaded the album before the censors interrupted sales - began having iTunes access problems last week .
It 's thought it was an attempt to censor sales and awareness of a pro-Tibet compilation album , " Songs for Tibet , " an album released by the Art of Peace Foundation in support of Tibetan independence .
The interesting new twist comes in the form of an article on a Chinese government website which claims the album had " ignited strong indignation " among Chinese web users .
That report even threatened a future boycott of Apple products , including the iPhone .
Whether Apple CEO Steve Jobs - known for his life - long interest in Buddhism - will listen to this threat is impossible to speculate .
Have you ever experienced a freezing sensation after eating an ice cream cone ?
You ’re with a group of friends eating the dessert , and suddenly you have a severe headache that lasts for a brief amount of time .
You ’re not alone because billions of individuals have endured this common reaction called sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia .
It ’s also known as brain freeze or ice cream evoked headache .
Why does even the simplest discomfort get a scientific name ?
But in all seriousness , what exactly happens to the body when one experiences a brain freeze ?
Diagnosis : Sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia
Symptoms : Head pain , sharp freezing sensation , toothaches
Causes : Consumption of ice cream , popsicles and other icy treats
Treatment : Drink warm fluids or wait ( self - limiting )
Prevention : Eat cold foods at a slower pace !
There are two possible explanations behind pain and its association with a quick , big gulp of slushies , slurpees or Italian ice .
1 ) Blood vessel phenomenon :
It is known that blood vessels constrict when the body experiences cold temperature and dilates when in hot temperature .
This simple fact can be applied to the biological cause of brain freeze .
Upon contact with ice , the blood vessels in the roof of the mouth begin to constrict , making the vessels in the head to expand , and thus creating a headache .
2 ) Trigeminal nerve factor :
The trigeminal nerve is primarily responsible for the sensation of the face , also known as the fifth cranial nerve ( CN - V ) .
As a result of eating cold foods , the trigeminal nerve in the palate of the mouth becomes overstimulated .
Stimulation of the nerve causes neurons to fire pain signals to the brain , producing a headache .
Brain freeze is one of those common occurrences that bring the curiosity out of us .
Curiosity stems from human nature .
What other topics have made you ask , why and how ?

Fayez Annan turns the silver key to start the power , pushes the green button on the standard industrial jog - run - stop switch on the dashboard , and eases the white Peugeot 205 into the main east - west shopping street in Gaza City .
With traffic abnormally sparse , thanks to the acute fuel shortages caused by the Israeli blockade , he soon reaches the distinctly un-urban and pedestrian - scattering speed of 37 miles per hour ( 60 kph ) .
But then Mr Annan is proudly trying to make a point that , while it might be electric , this Peugeot is no milkfloat .
" It can do 100 kph ( 62 m ph ) , " he says with a grin , as our knuckles whiten in the passenger seats .
Whether or not Mr Annan 's friend Hesham Abu Sido , an electrical consultant , is justified in describing the electric vehicle as a " genius idea " which is " the most fantastic thing that has happened in Gaza " , it is certainly a case of turning adversity into opportunity .

It also proves that Gaza 's famous entrepreneurial spirit has not yet been snuffed out by the draconian economic blockade imposed by Israel after the Palestinian militant group Hamas seized full control of the Strip by force a year ago tomorrow .
Since then , Gaza has seen continuing conflict , ever - deepening poverty , shortages , unemployment and despair .
Against that background , the white Peugeot has become a symbol of Gaza 's suppressed potential .
" People who have seen it are even happier than we are , " says Mr Annan .
" They see it as something to be proud of in Gaza , which they have n't had in a long time . "
Six months in the conception and making , this prototype conversion of the French saloon into Gaza 's first electric car – powered by an AC induction motor and 38 12 - volt batteries under the bonnet and in the boot – is an engineering triumph in a city starved of almost every commodity , including spare parts .
It is not just a dramatic improvement on the smelly , heavily polluting and motor - corroding substitution of cooking oil for diesel that increasing numbers of desperate drivers are opting for here .
For as Gaza plunges back in time and into what economists call de-development , with many people swapping their cars for donkey carts because of fuel shortages , it could just be that its best electrical minds have seen the future – and it works .
The electric Peugeot is the brainchild of Mr Annan , 42 , whose family owns a white goods business , and his friend Wasseem Al Khazendar , 48 , who runs the largest company in Gaza selling electrical motors and switchgear to industry .
" I had been wanting to do something like this for a long time , " said Mr Khazendar .
" I wanted to make a car which was environment - friendly .
Even if you are n't adding cooking oil , diesel is bad for the environment and an electric car is much cheaper to run . "
As indeed it is .
With desperately scarce petrol costing about £ 1 per litre – and more than three times that on the black market – a six or seven - hour charge provides enough power to cover 110 miles at a cost of just over 90 p .
And all you need to charge the batteries is a simple mains plug .
" It is like charging your mobile , " says Mr Annan .
" You can do it anywhere – even while you are shopping . "

But , explains Mr Khazendar , it was the current situation that spurred him to action .
The blockade paradoxically provided a double incentive .
Growing fuel shortages sharpened interest in alternative forms of transport and , with the shutdown of industry and therefore no demand for Mr Khazendar 's products , there was , he bluntly explains " no work " .
Both he and Mr Annan , who had been Gaza head of Palestine TV , the pro-PLO broadcaster shut down by Hamas after it seized power , had time on their hands .
Essentially , he says , " the idea is very simple – to take out the mechanical motor and put in an electrical motor " .
As he explains , the car uses the same brakes , gearbox and clutch but the difficult part came when , after three months , the two men chose to ditch the DC motor for a cheaper , less bulky and easier to maintain AC one , even though it meant powering it by a DC battery .
It took them just three months to crack the technical problems .
You might think Mr Khazendar had more pressing – and local – worries than the future of the planet .
But he closely followed the saga of General Motors ' EV1 electric car programme , which was cancelled in 2003 and which he believes was the victim of pressure from the major oil companies .
He is conscious that , having surged above $ 130 a barrel , the high price of oil could still help to make his proposition a commercial one , if and when fuel flows normally into Gaza again .
" After 100 years we will have no petrol , " he adds .
" We should start now to try and deal with that , not wait until it happens . "
The electric car is ideal for the Gaza Strip , a flat coastal territory which is about 45 kilometres long and eight kilometres wide .
Not surprisingly , there has been brisk demand from Gazans – about 400 so far – seeking similar conversions at an average estimated cost of $ 2,500 , depending on the size of vehicle .
The men behind the innovation argue that the initial outlay is swiftly recoverable because of the lower running costs .
The two friends are confident they can make similar conversions of lorries and buses .
They say that an Italian non-governmental organisation which provides school transport in Gaza has already registered interest in having its buses electrified .
For now , however , most of their would - be customers will have to wait .
To turn the conversions into a business proposition , they will first have to apply to the Hamas - controlled transport ministry for a licence , which they hope will not be too difficult .
But then they need new electrical motors – instead of the used industrial one they have put into their prototype – and higher powered , lighter batteries which place less strain on a car 's axles .
But that will be impossible as long the economic blockade lasts .
For Mr Annan , this demonstrates how people in Gaza " have the brains and capability but do n't have the materials " .
Over coffee in Mr Khazendar 's store , the men only talk politics when prompted .
As a prominent Gaza businessman who often travelled in Israel before the intifada , Mr Khazendar is the gloomiest .
" I know the Israelis , " he says .
" I have been visiting Tel Aviv for a long time .
I do n't believe they want a strong Palestinian government .
Whether it is Fatah or Hamas , they want a weak one . "
But while Mr Annan is also highly critical of Israel , he does not acquit Hamas , whose regime ( and frequent rocket attacks from Gaza ) Israel has blamed for the closure of Gaza 's borders .
" Hamas has given Israel the excuse to pressure us , " he says .
" When Hamas won the elections , they should have stayed in control of the Palestinian Legislative Council [ parliament ] but not gone into government .
We need normal people in government who will look after the needs of the people . "
But all three men , including Hesham Abu Sido , who largely shares Mr Annan 's analysis , and certainly his desire for peace with Israel , want to see Hamas and Fatah working together rather than against each other .
" Hamas and Fatah have to come together , " says Mr Annan .
We are paying the price [ for the split ] . "
For Eyad Sarraj , the Gaza psychiatrist prominent in the campaign against the economic siege , and a fierce opponent of all forms of violence from both sides , the electric Peugeot is no surprise .
" There is a lot of talent here , " he says , " so much desire and yearning to build in this place .
Look what happened between 1994 and 2000 when there was so much development .
Give people the right [ political ] environment and you will have the right people . "
Explaining the motives behind his project , Mr Khazendar says : " The pressure and hard times make you think all the time about how to exit out of this problem , politically and economically . "
Does he see the electric Peugeot not only as a way of rising to the challenge of a year - long blockade but also as a kind of resistance ?
" Let 's not call it that , " he replies .
" Let 's calling it ' finding solutions ' . "
12 months of Hamas rule
By Donald Macintyre
Hamas took full control of Gaza , by force , exactly a year ago tomorrow .
It was previously elected – in polling pronounced clean and fair by international monitors – in January 2006 but a short - lived coalition with Fatah dissolved in bloody fighting which ended in Hamas 's victory on 14 June .
President Mahmoud Abbas immediately sacked Hamas 's Ismail Haniyeh ( below ) as Prime Minister and Israel closed the crossings to all except basic humanitarian supplies .
In September Israel 's cabinet declared Gaza a " hostile entity " .
In the year since the Hamas takeover , 564 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza according to Btselem , an Israeli human rights agency , including 209 who " were not taking part in hostilities " at the time .
Ninety - two deaths were of children .
The Israeli military says more than 4,200 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza .
Seven Israeli civilians and seven soldiers have been killed by militants in Gaza , all in 2008 .
Most of Gaza 's 3,900 factories have shut down for lack of materials .
Officials estimate about 100,000 people have lost their jobs since June .
Power cuts are common , and fuel prices have soared due to acute shortages .
On Gaza 's black market , a litre of diesel increased fivefold over the past year to 25 shekels ( £ 3.90 ) .
A refrigerator has doubled in price and a bottle of cooking gas costs up to 100 shekels compared to 43 before the blockade – partly because many people now run cars on it .
Food is still widely available – though some prices have sharply increased .
Most construction projects , including some funded by the UN , have stopped due to materials shortages .
Shortages of power and fuel have resulted in 75 million cubic litres of untreated waste being dumped into the Mediterranean every day .
Hamas 's pre-takeover armed force of 3,000 has swollen to 13,000 , split between five branches .
The Hamas armed wing , Izz el - Deen al - Qassam , claims it numbers over 25,000 .
Internal security in Gaza has increased , and the streets appear much safer than during factional fighting .
But rights groups say Hamas security forces have made political arrests and use torture in jails , also saying Fatah security forces in the West Bank have taken similar action against Hamas adherents .

Buyer ’s Guide
It is not enough to just know the right products to pick or the right brands to consider .
It is equally important to have at your fingertips , some of the must - consider factors when buying a carpet .
That ’s exactly what we cover in this section .
Loops and Cuts
The basic qualities of a carpet are greatly dependant on its construction .
The pile can either be looped , cut or both looped and cut .
The loops of cut - pile carpets are trimmed off such that yarn ends poke upward .
This creates a luxurious look .
Saxony carpets belong to the cut - pile family .
They have densely - packed , short , level tufts .
Loop carpets , on the other hand , have complete yarn loops that stand upright .
They generally wear better than cut - pile carpets since the yarn tips are never exposed .
In this case , yarn wears on the sides and not the ends .
The twist is also automatically maintained .
Carpet Padding and Cushion
In most cases , the residential carpets are installed over separate carpet pads also known as cushions .
These make the carpets softer in addition to reducing the noise .
It also provides a little thermal insulation and a prolonged carpet life .
At all costs , you must avoid installing a quality carpet over the top of a marginal carpet cushion .
Carpet Fibers
The performance and appearance of a carpet is greatly affected by the fibers used to make its face .
In most cases , manufacturers use nylon , polyester , triexta , acrylic , wool , or olefin to make quality carpets .
You should be sure to choose the one that serves the best of your interest .
Desistance
Everything matters from the brand you choose to the fibers used in making your preferred carpet .
Henceforth , choosing a carpet should never be that challenging as you already have all the necessary information .
Go ahead and place your next order confidently .
Bernardo sez ,
I read in Dispatches From the Culture Wars about Scott Conover , who was arrested for taking a picture of a policeman during a traffic stop .
Conover quotes the police officer as saying " … you took a picture of me .
It 's illegal to take a picture of a law enforcement officer … if you do n't give it to me , you 're going to jail " .
The arrest was , technically , for pointing a laser at a police officer ( the officer claims he thought Conover was pointing a laser at him , but he arrested Conover even after discovering that it was a cell phone , which , y' know , looks a lot like a laser , dunnit ) .
A commenter on the Dispatches blog points out how " The law they charged him under is 39 - 13-605 , which requires that ' the photograph … was taken for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification of the defendant ' . " …
Seems like a bit of a stretch .
The police officer 's affidavit also makes for entertaining reading .
Where insanity happens .
Trying to judge the impact of last summer ’s Tim Donaghy scandal , I recently called around to assess the reaction of the congenitally suspicious core audience . . . the gamblers .
It turned out there was no impact .
The Donaghy blockbuster , the latest story that seemed to presage The Death of the NBA , quickly faded away in what turned out to be a great season for the league .
Advertisement
“ My gut feeling , ” says Bruce Marshall , associate editor of the Gold Sheet , “ is it did n’t change NBA betting one way or the other . ”
In other words , it looks as if gamblers accepted the notion that Donaghy was what the league insisted he was , a rogue .
However , there was one wrinkle that was pure NBA .
One local bookmaker , asking to remain anonymous since bookmaking is illegal , said a lot of NBA bettors grumble about conspiracies -- while continuing to bet on NBA games .
Advertisement
“ They ’re betting on games they think may be fixed ? ” I asked .
“ They ’re trying to figure out which way the league is fixing it , ” the guy said , laughing .
This just confirms what I ’ve always known :
Everyone connected with the NBA from the league office to the owners , coaches , players , entourages , mascots , fans and , of course , press people , is out of his gourd .
Advertisement
Just how this ongoing conspiracy theory attaches itself specifically to the NBA -- and only the NBA -- has never been explained .
NFL officials are part - timers who can call holding on any play .
Baseball umpires have personal strike zones .
College basketball is almost as hard to officiate as the NBA game and , as its history of point - shaving scandals shows , easier to corrupt .
All have ongoing conflict with officials . . . but only in the NBA is it perceived as part of a wider conspiracy .
Every baseball team has umpiring crews it hates .
Managers kick the ground , remove the bases and get ejected , but the next day everyone starts over without any talk of a plot .
Advertisement
The skepticism with which the NBA is perceived stems from the league ’s image as a perennial mutt .
In the ‘ 50s it was derided as a “ YMCA league , ” in the ‘ 60s as “ bush . ”
In the ‘ 70s , it was the league that was obliged to try to market predominantly African American players to white fans .
Then after race declined as an issue in the NBA ’s golden age with Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the ‘ 80s and its zenith with Michael Jordan in the ‘ 90s , along came hip - hop , the Internet and worldwide tabloid journalism .
Advertisement
The assumption is always that the NBA is endangered and has to get the best matchup .
Worse , it ’s assumed by all participants , coaches , players , etc. , who never stop working the referees . . . even as they insist , as Lakers Coach Phil Jackson and Celtics Coach Doc Rivers did Wednesday , the system is totally honest .
Actually , the NBA has long been on solid footing , now getting $ 925 million in annual rights fees from its network partners to baseball ’s $ 670 million .
The most famous urban myth is the “ frozen envelope ” in the first NBA lottery in 1985 , supposedly enabling Commissioner David Stern to deliver Patrick Ewing to the hometown New York Knicks .
Advertisement
Amid annual speculation that young stars would be sent to glamour teams , David Robinson then went to San Antonio , Shaquille O’Neal to Orlando , Tim Duncan to San Antonio , Yao Ming to Houston , LeBron James to Cleveland and Greg Oden to Portland .
The Knicks , the league ’s tattered flagship franchise , never again drew a pick higher than No. 5 .
The NBA actually bends over backward to avoid even the appearance of doing anything wrong . . . amid ever - increasing accusations it ’s fixing everything .
Let ’s put it this way :
If it is fixing anything , it ’s doing a really lousy job .
Advertisement
Small - market teams from San Antonio , Utah and Indiana have appeared in seven of the last 12 Finals along with crowd - pleasers such as the Detroit Pistons ( twice ) , New Jersey Nets ( twice ) and Cleveland Cavaliers .
Meanwhile , the league was proving its impartiality by taking draconian action against glamour teams .
In 1997 with the Knicks leading their second - round series with Miami , 3 - 2 , Stern suspended so many of them after the Heat ’s P.J. Brown tackled Charlie Ward , they had to sit out in shifts to have enough players for Games 6 and 7 .
Four Knicks -- Ewing , Allen Houston , John Starks and Larry Johnson -- were suspended just for leaving the bench .
Advertisement
The Knicks lost .
Not to suggest the learning curve is n’t all you could hope for , all around , but it just happened again last spring .
The Phoenix Suns , who had just won in San Antonio to tie their second - round series , 2 - 2 , saw Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw suspended for leaving the bench during a “ fight ” that was actually just players milling around after the Spurs ’ Robert Horry hip - checked Steve Nash into the scorer ’s table .
The high - scoring Suns , the most entertaining team in the NBA , then lost Game 5 at home , got their players back and lost Game 6 in San Antonio .
Advertisement
It ’s hard for me to imagine the league rigging a matchup .
On the other hand , I ’m not in the business of assuming what can happen but of trying to learn what did .
What I ca n’t believe is that the NBA could fix something like that and get away with it .
Legal whizzes that these guys are , they ’re not that slick .
We hear a lot about what goes on in the office . . . like it was n’t Stern who suspended Stoudemire and Diaw but NBA vice president Stu Jackson , after which Stern noted that people were always telling him not to micromanage everything and look what happened .
Or that second - guessing of the referees after Game 4 of the Lakers - Spurs series this season came from Stern , not Jackson , part of the new “ transparency . ”
Advertisement
Now we ’re in the throes of the usual lemmings rush into the sea after Donaghy ’s latest allegations of referees manipulating Game 6 of the 2002 Lakers - Kings playoffs series in the Lakers ’ favor , or as ESPN.com headlines had it , “ Season Shaken . . . Finals Shadow . . .
League is inviting suspicion . ”
Of course , if Donaghy does n’t have something more tangible than a Lakers - Sacramento box score from 2002 and a directive to watch moving screens in the Dallas - San Antonio series in 2005 , this could go away as fast as it did last summer .
I still love this game , even if it ’s hard to watch while waiting for the sky to fall .

I get the impression from reading impeachment articles on OpEdNews that many of you believe that if we could achieve the impeachment of Cheney or Bush that it would improve our standing in the international community tremendously .
We agree and also do not think we will ever begin to control the war mongers in either party unless we cause one to be impeached very soon , before the November election .
And why have n't we caused impeachment ?
We 've marched , protested , fasted , are holding strikes , vigils , sit-ins , die-ins and god knows what else to no avail whatsoever as long as Congress ignores us .
The media , wanting access and good treatment from Congress , will also ignore us as long as Congress does .
What can we do that is different and radical enough to get action by Congress ?
Perhaps realizing that Congress itself is the current clear and present danger to the Constitution will help .
If Congress takes an oath to defend the Constitution and does not , it is the enemy of both the Constitution and the people .
I am not proposing rebellion , but how are we to get their attention ?
In Colorado we have done over 110 impeachment events in 14 months , all of which have been ignored by our Colorado Congressmen .
We have tried to learn from that and come up with a plan that could cause our Congressmen to pay attention .
Our conclusion was that we need to find the Democratic Congressmen who are running for re-election or for the Senate and are in tight races and campaign against them primarily on the point that they are a traitor to their oath when they do not rise to the defense of the Constitution and call for Impeachment Hearings .
If they wo n't defend the Constitution they probably wo n't do a good job of defending the rights of the voters .
You get the idea .
We are campaigning against Rep . Udall using harsh language .
We also say he is betraying and diminishing the power of Congress itself if he does not defend it against the executive branch .
Our Colorado Congressman Udall is running for the Senate .
According to a recent poll there is 2.6 % between him and his Republican opponent .
We need only move the public 's perception of him by 1.31 percent to get his attention
than trying to persuade Congressman from " safe districts " to impeac
A prominent local member of the Colorado peace and justice community asked me recently why we are going after Udall saying that surely we do n't want the Republican to win the Senate seat .
I replied No , we do n't want Schaffer over Udall , but if pressuring Udall within a hair of losing the election will get one or more of our Colorado Congressmen to come out for impeachment , we 'll take the risk . "
Getting the US House to hold impeachment hearings would go a long way to putting some steel in their collective spine for our other goals and would help restore much needed influence of the peace and justice / anti-war community .
We think it is worth the risk of losing one or two Democratic Congressmen across the country .
We think that the Democrats will add to their majorities in the House and Senate no matter what pressure we activists put on them .
It is more a matter of affecting the extent of that increased majority .
No Congressman wants to be the one to lose by a few votes and that could happen to Udall .
And more importantly , no senior Congressman wants to lose a Chairmanship they have enjoyed for the first time in 10 years , or if they are anticipating gaining a Chair , having it snatched away at the last minute by rabid protesters .
We think it is possible to build on all Congressmen 's fear of losing by attacking the weaker candidates .
It is not just about one candidate 's race but about the percentage of Democrats in Congress .
We can worry all of them by challenging that percentage .
The Colorado plan is to pressure the weaker Democratic Congressional candidates , the ones in tight races for either House or Senate .
We think that will put pressure on both the " tight race " Democratic Candidates themselves and the " safe seat " Dems as well to support impeachment hearings .
It is to Rep. DeGette 's advantage to have a higher number of House seats held by Democrats , it affects Committee assignments and senority , and her power and influence .
We have been protesting at our Congressman Udall 's state campaign headquarters , at public appearances , at even Republican events where we can get our point about Udall noticed .
We even protest against Udall at the offices of other Colorado Democratic Congessmen like Rep. DeGette .
Since we have started down this path the honking at our impeach protests has easily quadrupled .
We think the voters are aware that the problem really is our Democratic Congressmen and they are glad that we are doing something about it .
We recently had feedback from the Udall campaign via a well known local Democratic blogger and rabid Udall supporter asking us to back off .
The plan is working here .

We ’ve all wondered at some point or another what mysteries our Solar System holds .
After all , the eight planets ( plus Pluto and all those other dwarf planets ) orbit within a very small volume of the heliosphere ( the volume of space dominated by the influence of the Sun ) , what ’s going on in the rest of the volume we call our home ?
As we push more robots into space , improve our observational capabilities and begin to experience space for ourselves , we learn more and more about the nature of where we come from and how the planets have evolved .
But even with our advancing knowledge , we would be naive to think we have all the answers , so much still needs to be uncovered .
So , from a personal point of view , what would I consider to be the greatest mysteries within our Solar System ?
Well , I ’m going to tell you my top ten favourites of some more perplexing conundrums our Solar System has thrown at us .
So , to get the ball rolling , I ’ll start in the middle , with the Sun .
( None of the following can be explained by dark matter , in case you were wondering … actually it might , but only a little … )
10 . Solar Pole Temperature Mismatch
Why is the Sun ’s South Pole cooler than the North Pole ?
For 17 years , the solar probe Ulysses has given us an unprecedented view of the Sun .
After being launched on Space Shuttle Discovery way back in 1990 , the intrepid explorer took an unorthodox trip through the Solar System .
Using Jupiter for a gravitational slingshot , Ulysses was flung out of the ecliptic plane so it could pass over the Sun in a polar orbit ( spacecraft and the planets normally orbit around the Sun ’s equator ) .
This is where the probe journeyed for nearly two decades , taking unprecedented in - situ observations of the solar wind and revealing the true nature of what happens at the poles of our star .
Alas , Ulysses is dying of old age , and the mission effectively ended on July 1st ( although some communication with the craft remains ) .
However , observing uncharted regions of the Sun can create baffling results .
One such mystery result is that the South Pole of the Sun is cooler than the North Pole by 80,000 Kelvin .
Scientists are confused by this discrepancy as the effect appears to be independent of the magnetic polarity of the Sun ( which flips magnetic north to magnetic south every 11 - years ) .
Ulysses was able to gauge the solar temperature by sampling the ions in the solar wind at a distance of 300 million km above the North and South Poles .
By measuring the ratio of oxygen ions ( O6+/ O7 + ) , the plasma conditions at the base of the coronal hole could be measured .
This remains an open question and the only explanation solar physicists can currently come up with is the possibility that the solar structure in the polar regions differ in some way .
It ’s a shame Ulysses bit the dust , we could do with a polar orbiter to take more results ( see Ulysses Spacecraft Dying of Natural Causes ) .
9. Mars Mysteries
Why are the Martian hemispheres so radically different ?
This is one mystery that had frustrated scientists for years .
The northern hemisphere of Mars is predominantly featureless lowlands , whereas the southern hemisphere is stuffed with mountain ranges , creating vast highlands .
Very early on in the study of Mars , the theory that the planet had been hit by something very large ( thus creating the vast lowlands , or a huge impact basin ) was thrown out .
This was primarily because the lowlands did n’t feature the geography of an impact crater .
For a start there is no crater “ rim . ”
Plus the impact zone is not circular .
All this pointed to some other explanation .
But eagle - eyed researchers at Caltech have recently revisited the impactor theory and calculated that a huge rock between 1,600 to 2,700 km diameter can create the lowlands of the northern hemisphere ( see Two Faces of Mars Explained ) .
Bonus mystery : Does the Mars Curse exist ?
According to many shows , websites and books there is something ( almost paranormal ) out in space eating ( or tampering with ) our robotic Mars explorers .
If you look at the statistics , you would be forgiven for being a little shocked : Nearly two - thirds of all Mars missions have failed .
Russian Mars - bound rockets have blown up , US satellites have died mid-flight , British landers have pock - marked the Red Planet ’s landscape ; no Mars mission is immune to the “ Mars Triangle . ”
So is there a “ Galactic Ghoul ” out there messing with our ‘ bots ?
Although this might be attractive to some of us superstitious folk , the vast majority of spacecraft lost due to The Mars Curse is mainly due to heavy losses during the pioneering missions to Mars .
The recent loss rate is comparable to the losses sustained when exploring other planets in the Solar System .
Although luck may have a small part to play , this mystery is more of a superstition than anything measurable ( see The “ Mars Curse ” : Why Have So Many Missions Failed ? ) .
8. The Tunguska Event
What caused the Tunguska impact ?
Forget Fox Mulder tripping through the Russian forests , this is n’t an X - Files episode .
In 1908 , the Solar System threw something at us … but we do n’t know what .
This has been an enduring mystery ever since eye witnesses described a bright flash ( that could be seen hundreds of miles away ) over the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Russia .
On investigation , a huge area had been decimated ; some 80 million trees had been felled like match sticks and over 2,000 square kilometres had been flattened .
But there was no crater .
What had fallen from the sky ?
This mystery is still an open case , although researchers are pinning their bets of some form of “ airburst ” when a comet or meteorite entered the atmosphere , exploding above the ground .
A recent cosmic forensic study retraced the steps of a possible asteroid fragment in the hope of finding its origin and perhaps even finding the parent asteroid .
They have their suspects , but the intriguing thing is , there is next - to - no meteorite evidence around the impact site .
So far , there does n’t appear to be much explanation for that , but I do n’t think Mulder and Scully need be involved ( see Tunguska Meteoroid ’s Cousins Found ? ) .
7. Uranus ’ Tilt
Why does Uranus rotate on its side ?
Strange planet is Uranus .
Whilst all the other planets in the Solar System more - or - less have their axis of rotation pointing “ up ” from the ecliptic plane , Uranus is lying on its side , with an axial tilt of 98 degrees .
This means that for very long periods ( 42 years at a time ) either its North or South Pole points directly at the Sun .
The majority of the planets have a “ prograde ” rotation ; all the planets rotate counter - clockwise when viewed from above the Solar System ( i.e. above the North Pole of the Earth ) .
However , Venus does the exact opposite , it has a retrograde rotation , leading to the theory that it was kicked off - axis early in its evolution due to a large impact .
So did this happen to Uranus too ?
Was it hit by a massive body ?
Some scientists believe that Uranus was the victim of a cosmic hit - and - run , but others believe there may be a more elegant way of describing the gas giant ’s strange configuration .
Early in the evolution of the Solar System , astrophysicists have run simulations that show the orbital configuration of Jupiter and Saturn may have crossed a 1:2 orbital resonance .
During this period of planetary upset , the combined gravitational influence of Jupiter and Saturn transferred orbital momentum to the smaller gas giant Uranus , knocking it off - axis .
More research needs to be carried out to see if it was more likely that an Earth - sized rock impacted Uranus or whether Jupiter and Saturn are to blame .
6. Titan ’s Atmosphere
Why does Titan have an atmosphere ?
Titan , one of Saturn ’s moons , is the only moon in the Solar System with a significant atmosphere .
It is the second biggest moon in the Solar System ( second only to Jupiter ’s moon Ganymede ) and about 80 % more massive than Earth ’s Moon .
Although small when compared with terrestrial standards , it is more Earth - like than we give it credit for .
Mars and Venus are often cited as Earth ’s siblings , but their atmospheres are 100 times thinner and 100 times thicker , respectively .
Titan ’s atmosphere on the other hand is only one and a half times thicker than Earth ’s , plus it is mainly composed of nitrogen .
Nitrogen dominates Earth ’s atmosphere ( at 80 % composition ) and it dominates Titans atmosphere ( at 95 % composition ) .
But where did all this nitrogen come from ?
Like on Earth , it ’s a mystery .
Titan is such an interesting moon and is fast becoming the prime target to search for life .
Not only does it have a thick atmosphere , its surface is crammed full with hydrocarbons thought to be teeming with “ tholins , ” or prebiotic chemicals .
Add to this the electrical activity in the Titan atmosphere and we have an incredible moon with a massive potential for life to evolve .
But as to where its atmosphere came from … we just do not know .
5. Solar Coronal Heating
Why is the solar atmosphere hotter than the solar surface ?
Now this is a question that has foxed solar physicists for over half a century .
Early spectroscopic observations of the solar corona revealed something perplexing : The Sun ’s atmosphere is hotter than the photosphere .
In fact , it is so hot that it is comparable to the temperatures found in the core of the Sun .
But how can this happen ?
If you switch on a light bulb , the air surrounding the glass bulb wont be hotter than the glass itself ; as you get closer to a heat source , it gets warmer , not cooler .
But this is exactly what the Sun is doing , the solar photosphere has a temperature of around 6000 Kelvin whereas the plasma only a few thousand kilometres above the photosphere is over 1 million Kelvin .
As you can tell , all kinds of physics laws appear to be violated .
However , solar physicists are gradually closing in on what may be causing this mysterious coronal heating .
As observational techniques improve and theoretical models become more sophisticated , the solar atmosphere can be studied more in - depth than ever before .
It is now believed that the coronal heating mechanism may be a combination of magnetic effects in the solar atmosphere .
There are two prime candidates for corona heating : nanoflares and wave heating .
I for one have always been a huge advocate of wave heating theories ( a large part of my research was devoted to simulating magnetohydrodynamic wave interactions along coronal loops ) , but there is strong evidence that nanoflares influence coronal heating too , possibly working in tandem with wave heating .
Although we are pretty certain that wave heating and / or nanoflares may be responsible , until we can insert a probe deep into the solar corona ( which is currently being planned with the Solar Probe mission ) , taking in - situ measurements of the coronal environment , we wo n’t know for sure what heats the corona ( see Warm Coronal Loops May Hold the Key to Hot Solar Atmosphere ) .
4. Comet Dust
How did dust formed at intense temperatures appear in frozen comets ?
Comets are the icy , dusty nomads of the Solar System .
Thought to have evolved in the outermost reaches of space , in the Kuiper Belt ( around the orbit of Pluto ) or in a mysterious region called the Oort Cloud , these bodies occasionally get knocked and fall under the weak gravitational pull of the Sun .
As they fall toward the inner Solar System , the Sun ’s heat will cause the ice to vaporize , creating a cometary tail known as the coma .
Many comets fall straight into the Sun , but others are more lucky , completing a short - period ( if they originated in the Kuiper Belt ) or long - period ( if they originated in the Oort Cloud ) orbit of the Sun .
But something odd has been found in the dust collected by NASA ’s 2004 Stardust mission to Comet Wild - 2 .
Dust grains from this frozen body appeared to have been formed a high temperatures .
Comet Wild - 2 is believed to have originated from and evolved in the Kuiper Belt , so how could these tiny samples be formed in an environment with a temperature of over 1000 Kelvin ?
The Solar System evolved from a nebula some 4.6 billion years ago and formed a large accretion disk as it cooled .
The samples collected from Wild - 2 could only have been formed in the central region of the accretion disk , near the young Sun , and something transported them into the far reaches of the Solar System , eventually ending up in the Kuiper Belt .
But what mechanism could do this ?
We are not too sure ( see Comet Dust is Very Similar to Asteroids ) .
3. The Kuiper Cliff
Why does the Kuiper Belt suddenly end ?
The Kuiper Belt is a huge region of the Solar System forming a ring around the Sun just beyond the orbit of Neptune .
It is much like the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter , the Kuiper Belt contains millions of small rocky and metallic bodies , but it ’s 200 - times more massive .
It also contains a large quantity of water , methane and ammonia ices , the constituents of cometary nuclei originating from there ( see # 4 above ) .
The Kuiper Belt is also known for its dwarf planet occupant , Pluto and ( more recently ) fellow Plutoid “ Makemake ” .
The Kuiper Belt is already a pretty unexplored region of the Solar System as it is ( we wait impatiently for NASA ’s New Horizons Pluto mission to arrive there in 2015 ) , but it has already thrown up something of a puzzle .
The population of Kuiper Belt Objects ( KBOs ) suddenly drops off at a distance of 50 AU from the Sun .
This is rather odd as theoretical models predict an increase in number of KBOs beyond this point .
The drop - off is so dramatic that this feature has been dubbed the “ Kuiper Cliff . ”
We currently have no explanation for the Kuiper Cliff , but there are some theories .
One idea is that there are indeed a lot of KBOs beyond 50 AU , it ’s just that they have n’t accreted to form larger objects for some reason ( and therefore cannot be observed ) .
Another more controversial idea is that KBOs beyond the Kuiper Cliff have been swept away by a planetary body , possibly the size of Earth or Mars .
Many astronomers argue against this citing a lack of observational evidence of something that big orbiting outside the Kuiper Belt .
This planetary theory however has been very useful for the doomsayers out there , providing flimsy “ evidence ” for the existence of Nibiru , or “ Planet X . ”
If there is a planet out there , it certainly is not “ incoming mail ” and it certainly is not arriving on our doorstep in 2012 .
So , in short , we have no clue why the Kuiper Cliff exists …
2. The Pioneer Anomaly
Why are the Pioneer probes drifting off - course ?
Now this is a perplexing issue for astrophysicists , and probably the most difficult question to answer in Solar System observations .
Pioneer 10 and 11 were launched back in 1972 and 1973 to explore the outer reaches of the Solar System .
Along their way , NASA scientists noticed that both probes were experiencing something rather strange ; they were experiencing an unexpected Sun - ward acceleration , pushing them off - course .
Although this deviation was n’t huge by astronomical standards ( 386,000 km off course after 10 billion km of travel ) , it was a deviation all the same and astrophysicists are at a loss to explain what is going on .
One main theory suspects that non-uniform infrared radiation around the probes ’ bodywork ( from the radioactive isotope of plutonium in its Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators ) may be emitting photons preferentially on one side , giving a small push toward the Sun .
Other theories are a little more exotic .
Perhaps Einstein ’s general relativity needs to be modified for long treks into deep space ?
Or perhaps dark matter has a part to play , having a slowing effect on the Pioneer spacecraft ?
So far , only 30 % of the deviation can be pinned on the non-uniform heat distribution theory and scientists are at a loss to find an obvious answer ( see The Pioneer Anomaly : A Deviation from Einstein Gravity ? ) .
1. The Oort Cloud
How do we know the Oort Cloud even exists ?
As far as Solar System mysteries go , the Pioneer anomaly is a tough act to follow , but the Oort cloud ( in my view ) is the biggest mystery of all .
Why ?
We have never seen it , it is a hypothetical region of space .
At least with the Kuiper Belt , we can observe the large KBOs and we know where it is , but the Oort Cloud is too far away ( if it really is out there ) .
Firstly , the Oort Cloud is predicted to be over 50,000 AU from the Sun ( that ’s nearly a light year away ) , making it about 25 % of the way toward our nearest stellar neighbour , Proxima Centauri .
The Oort Cloud is therefore a very long way away .
The outer reaches of the Oort Cloud is pretty much the edge of the Solar System , and at this distance , the billions of Oort Cloud objects are very loosely gravitationally bound to the Sun .
They can therefore be dramatically influenced by the passage of other nearby stars .
It is thought that Oort Cloud disruption can lead to icy bodies falling inward periodically , creating long - period comets ( such as Halley ’s comet ) .
In fact , this is the only reason why astronomers believe the Oort Cloud exists , it is the source of long - period icy comets which have highly eccentric orbits emanating regions out of the ecliptic plane .
This also suggests that the cloud surrounds the Solar System and is not confined to a belt around the ecliptic .
So , the Oort Cloud appears to be out there , but we cannot directly observe it .
In my books , that is the biggest mystery in the outermost region of our Solar System …
General who probed Abu Ghraib says Bush officials committed war crimes
Warren P. Strobel | McClatchy Newspapers

WASHINGTON – The Army general who led the investigation into prisoner abuse at Iraq ’s Abu Ghraib prison accused the Bush administration Wednesday of committing “ war crimes ” and called for those responsible to be held to account .
The remarks by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba , who ’s now retired , came in a new report that found that U.S. personnel tortured and abused detainees in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , using beatings , electrical shocks , sexual humiliation and other cruel practices .
“ After years of disclosures by government investigations , media accounts and reports from human rights organizations , there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes , ” Taguba wrote .
“ The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account . ”
Taguba , whose 2004 investigation documented chilling abuses at Abu Ghraib , is thought to be the most senior official to have accused the administration of war crimes .
“ The commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture , ” he wrote .
A White House spokeswoman , Kate Starr , had no comment .
Taguba did n’t respond to a request for further comment relayed via a spokesman .
The group Physicians for Human Rights , which compiled the new report , described it as the most in - depth medical and psychological examination of former detainees to date .
Doctors and mental health experts examined 11 detainees held for long periods in the prison system that President Bush established after the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks .
All of them eventually were released without charges .
The doctors and experts determined that the men had been subject to cruelties that ranged from isolation , sleep deprivation and hooding to electric shocks , beating and , in one case , being forced to drink urine .
Bush has said repeatedly that the United States does n’t condone torture .
“ All credible allegations of abuse are thoroughly investigated and , if substantiated , those responsible are held accountable , ” said Navy Cmdr. J.D. Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman .
The Defense Department responds to concerns raised by the International Committee for the Red Cross , he said , which has access to detainees under military control .
“ It adds little to the public discourse to draw sweeping conclusions based upon dubious allegations regarding remote medical assessments of former detainees , now far removed from detention , ” Gordon said .
The physicians ’ group said that its experts , who had experience studying torture ’s effects , spent two days with each former captive and conducted intensive exams and interviews .
They administered tests to detect exaggeration .
In two of the 11 cases , the group was able to review medical records .
The report , “ Broken Laws , Broken Lives , ” concurs with a five - part McClatchy investigation of Guantanamo published this week .
Among its findings were that abuses occurred – primarily at prisons in Afghanistan where detainees were held en route to Guantanamo – and that many of the prisoners were wrongly detained .
Also this week , a probe by the Senate Armed Services Committee revealed how senior Pentagon officials pushed for harsher interrogation methods over the objections of top military lawyers .
Those methods later surfaced in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld did n’t specifically approve of the worst abuses , but neither he nor the White House enforced strict limits on how detainees would be treated .
There was no “ bright line of abuse which could not be transgressed , ” former Navy general counsel Alberto Mora told the Senate committee .
Leonard Rubenstein , the president of Physicians for Human Rights , said there was a direct connection between the Pentagon decisions and the abuses his group uncovered .
“ The result was a horrific stew of pain , degradation and … suffering , ” he said .
Detainee abuse has been documented previously , in photos from Abu Ghraib , accounts by former detainees and their lawyers and a confidential report by the International Committee for the Red Cross that was leaked to the U.S. news media .
Of the 11 men evaluated in the Physicians for Human Rights report , four were detained in Afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 , and later sent to Guantanamo .
The remaining seven were detained in Iraq in 2003 .
One of the Iraqis , identified by the pseudonym Laith , was arrested with his family at his Baghdad home in the early morning of Oct. 19 , 2003 .
He was taken to a location where he was beaten , stripped to his underwear and threatened with execution , the report says .
“ Laith ” told the examiners he was then taken to a second site , where he was photographed in humiliating positions and given electric shocks to his genitals .
Finally , he was taken to Abu Ghraib , where he spent the first 35 to 40 days in isolation in a small cage , enduring being suspended in the cage and other “ stress positions . ”
He was released on June 24 , 2004 , without charge .

It will be useful ( even necessary ) for the reader of this article to be familiar with my series " Who Wrote the Bible , " as well as " Truth or Lies , " both of which address many of the issues of religions and how they are created and imposed on the masses as means of control .
A good synopsis of the problem is Henry See 's article on Belief Systems .
It is also extremely useful to read my review of Burton Mack 's " The Book of Q and Christian Origins . "
Mack 's conclusions regarding the importance of the " event of mythicization of " Jesus " on our world are quite startling considering what has transpired on the world stage since he wrote this book .
The question now is whether the discovery of Q has any chance of making a difference in the way in which Christianity and its gospel are viewed in modern times ?
The question is quite serious , because neither the university , nor among knowledgeable people in our society , nor among the Christian churches , have the results of biblical scholarship ever made much of a difference . [...]
The discovery of Q effectively challenges the privilege granted the narrative gospels as depictions of the historical Jesus .
The difference between the narrative gospels and modern retellings of the story can no longer lie in the distinction between history and fiction .
The narrative gospels are also products of mythic imagination . [...]
Myths , mentalities , and cultures go together . [...]
Christian myth and Western culture go together . [...]
To acknowledge publicly that [ the American Dream ] may owe something to the legacy of western Christian culture is , on the other hand , taboo .
The exception to this general rule occurs , interestingly enough , when pressure on public policy and patriotism results in exaggerated expressions of those values for which our nation stands .
We have a history of such platitudes : new world , new land , new people , righteous nation , manifest destiny , city set on a hill , liberty enlightening the world , a beacon for the homeless , one nation under God , moral majority , defenders of the free world , and new world order .
These truisms signal a messianic mentality . [...]
The recent history of what we have done with our technology and power throughout the world is troubling , as are the human cries for help from around a world grown small and yet too large to handle .
The list of concerns has run off the page , and we seem to be overloaded with unsolvable problems and strife , and ecological responsibility .
For thoughtful people , the issues have to do with assessing the chances for constructing sane and safe societies in a multicultural world while understanding the conditions for predation and prejudice , power abuse , and violence .
In either case , it is irresponsible not to engage in public discussion of our own system of cultural values . [...]
In order to understand ourselves and register reasons for our social options , cultural analysis will have to include a comparative evaluation of mythologies .
And that means having a close look at our own mythology .
Q should help with this analysis by breaking the taboo that now grants privilege to the Christian myth .
That is because the story of Q gives us an account of Christian origins that is not dependent upon the narrative gospels .
...
Christian mythology can now be placed among the many mythologies and ideologies of the religions and cultures of the world .
The Christian myth can be studied as any other myth is studied .
It can be evaluated for its proposal of ways to solve social problems , construct sane societies , and symbolize human values . [...]
The effect of Christian mythology has not always been humanizing .
The Captain America Complex , a book by Robert Jewett has traced our zealous nationalism to its biblical roots .
Others have reflected deeply on the Christian persuasions that have under girded colonial imperialism , the taking of the West , the Indian wars , and the slave trade .
Still others have studied the relationship of the gospel story to the profile of the American hero , the American dream , and the destructive politics of righteousness wherever we have intervened in the affairs of peoples around the world .
The conclusion seems to be that the Christian gospel , focusing as it does on crucifixion as the guarantee for apocalyptic salvation , has somehow given its blessing to patterns of personal and political behavior that often have had disastrous consequences . [...]
Q's challenge to Christians is therefore an invitation to join the human race , to see ourselves with our myths on our hands ...

The reader may also want to pick up copies of Gershom Gorenberg 's book The End of Days : Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount , and " Forcing God 's Hand : Why Millions Pray for a Quick Rapture and Destruction of Planet Earth . by Grace Halsell .
These two books have provided much of the material reviewed in this article .
Gershom Gorenberg is an associate editor and columnist for The Jerusalem Report , a regular contributor to The New Republic , and an associate of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University .
He lives in Jerusalem , where he has spent years covering the dangerous mix of religion and politics .
Grace Halsell served President Lyndon Johnson as his speech writer for three years .
She covered both Korea and Vietnam as a journalist .
She was the author of 14 books , including " Prophecy and Politics : Militant Evangelists on the Road to Nuclear War . "
The facts that these two authors , one Christian and one Jewish , bring forward , are that the Armageddon theology of the New Christian Right is being propagated by numerous TV evangelists , including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , along with Hal Lindsey 's widely read The Late Great Planet Earth , and Tim LaHayes ' " Left Behind " series , and that this theology is influencing millions of human beings worldwide to not only believe that the world is going to end soon , but that it is their duty to hasten the event in any way they can .
It is in this context that we gain greater understanding of the politics of George W. Bush , though both of these books were written long before Bush effected a coup d'etat in 2000 .
Halsell interviewed fundamentalists , all of whom believed that it is their duty to fulfill the biblical prophecy of fighting World War III preparatory to Christ 's Second Coming .
Most disquieting is her discussion of an alliance of the New Christian Right and militant Zionists who share a common belief and enthusiasm for a global holocaust .
Alarming , too , is the extent of the political influence of the above mentioned tele - evangelists , the Israeli lobby and the fact that the policies of George W. Bush are largely subject to his alleged belief in the inevitability of a God - willed nuclear war .
I suspect that Bush , behind the scenes , is not truly Christian , even in his own mind , but rather follows the ideas of Machiavelli which posit that a leader must appear to be religious in order to induce the masses who are believers to follow him .
On the other hand , Bush and much of Congress may very well believe in this Armageddon Theology .
Both Gorenberg and Halsell detail and document the history of the alliance between militant Zionism and Christian fundamentalism and expose the purpose of the alliance which is the return to Israeli control of all of Palestine and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem on the site where the Al - Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock now stand .
For the religious Zionist , these actions are the prerequisite to the Messiah 's FIRST coming .
For the Christian fundamentalists , it is prerequisite to Armageddon and Messiah 's SECOND coming .
Reclamation of Israel from the Palestinians who have lived there for over 5000 years , and establishing Jewish hegemony , including the use of nuclear weapons ( Armageddon ) are seen as events to be earnestly desired and supported .
Armageddon is seen by Christian fundamentalists as " nuclear and imminent " , waiting only for proper orchestration from American political leaders .
The Zionists , naturally , do NOT include Armageddon in their messianic aspirations .
This conflict of interests at a higher level is exposed in Gorenberg 's book .
Gorenberg 's book was written before 9 - 11 and , in this sense , was extremely prescient .
The reader who wishes to understand what is at the root of the current conflict that threatens to engulf our planet will find his history of those 35 disputed acres of the Temple Mount to be crucial .
Gorenberg makes clear what is at the root of the volatile relationships between Arabs , Jews and Christians in Israel .
He pays special attention to carefully documenting and analyzing the actions and beliefs of fundamentalist groups in all three religions .
Jewish messianists and Christian millennialists both believe that building the Third Temple on the site where both Solomon 's and Herod 's temples are alleged to have stood is essential for their respective prophetic scenarios to take place ( never mind that they seem to both be using each other and each believe that the other is just a dumb tool ) , while the Muslim believers fear that efforts to destroy Al - Aqsa mosque to make way for the Third Temple will prevent fulfillment of the prophecy about Islam 's Meccan shrine migrating to Jerusalem at the end of time .
Gorenberg calls Temple Mount " a sacred blasting cap " .
The problem is , of course , as I show in Who Wrote the Bible , there probably never was a FIRST " Temple of Solomon , " and the Old Testament is NOT a true " history of the Jews . "
So , the problem is : if Islam is predicated on two " manufactured " religions , what does that say about the faith of the Islamic fundamentalists ?
The fact is :
There is an alliance between America and Israel in the war on Islam .
They are both determined to establish Israeli control over Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple where the Dome of the Rock now stands and the Palestinians are in the way .
This is the core issue behind the current " War on Islam " disguised as a " War on Islamic Terrorists " and more recently , " War on those who hate our civilization . "
And just as Christians and Jews are quite willing to sacrifice their own people for this monstrous agenda , so are Muslims undoubtedly raising up terrorists to do as much damage to the " infidels " as possible so as to save their holy site .
But to really get a grip on the explosive situation , we have to lay the major share of the blame for Islamic terrorism in the current day where the power has resided for a very long time : in the West , the Christian West :
There 's a new religious cult in America .
It 's not composed of so - called " crazies " so much as mainstream , middle to upper - middle class Americans .
They listen - and give millions of dollars each week - to the TV evangelists who expound the fundamentals of the cult .
They read Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHaye .
They have one goal : to facilitate God 's hand to waft them up to heaven free from all trouble , from where they will watch Armageddon and the destruction of Planet Earth .
This doctrine pervades Assemblies of God , Pentecostal , and other charismatic churches , as well as Southern Baptist , independent Baptist , and countless so - called Bible churches and mega-churches .
At least one out of every 10 Americans is a devotee of this cult .
It is the fastest growing religious movement in Christianity today .
-- Dale Crowley Jr. , religious broadcaster , Washington D.C.
The " Rapture of the Church " is an idea popularized by John Darby , a nineteenth - century British preacher .
The word " Rapture " describes the joy of the believers while the rest of humanity is facing apocalyptic terror , seven years ' worth , before God 's kingdom on earth is established .
Tim LaHaye - with his ghost - writer Jerry B. Jenkins - has produced a series of books that seek to make that terror real , to depict the " Rapture " in the world of jumbo jets and IMacs .
LaHaye 's books are REAL to people living in frightening times .
For the true believer , LaHaye 's books are not just accurate descriptions of how it is all going to actually happen , they provide satisfyingly delicious scenarios of being proven RIGHT .
The non-believers are treated to long and drawn - out descriptions of what is going to happen to them on earth after the Rapture .
One of the key elements of the " Rapture " theory is the Antichrist .
This individual signs a seven - year peace treaty with Israel - which includes rebuilding the Temple .
Jews are expected to unanimously support this project and Muslims also will agree to move the Dome of the Rock to " New Babylon . "
The rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem is required in the scenario because the Antichrist must desecrate it half way through the Tribulation which is supposed to include war , earthquakes , and locusts .
All of this is to be hoped for as a necessary preliminary to establishing God 's kingdom on Earth .
The theory demands something else : that Jews will convert to Christianity in masses so that they can then become " witnesses " or converters of more gentiles .
Darby 's theory insists that God 's promises to the people of Israel must be read literally as applying to literal Jews .
Therefore , the Jews WILL convert ( because it is in the eschatological screenplay ) .
At the " End of the World , " the believers of three faiths will watch the same drama , but with different programs in their hands .
In one , Jesus is Son of God ; in another he is Muslim prophet .
The Jews messiah is cast in the Muslim script as the dajjal - another name for the Antichrist , the deceiver predicted by Christian tradition .
The infidels in one script are the true believers of another .
If your neighbor announces that the End has come , you can believe him , even if he utterly misunderstands what is happening .
It makes sense : Christianity 's scriptwriters reworked Judaism and Islam rewrote both .
David Cook notes that from the start , apocalyptic ideas moved back and forth between the faiths ; the global village is older than we realize .
Some of the early spokesmen of Islamic apocalyptic thinking were converted Jews and Christians ; they arrived with histories of the future in their saddlebags .
What 's more , a story 's end is when the truth comes out , the deceived realize their mistake .
The deep grievance at the start of both Christianity and Islam is that the Jews refused the new faith - so the Jews must appear in both religion 's drama of the End , to be punished or recognize their error .
And the setting of the End is also shared .
The crucial events take place in or near Jerusalem .
After all , the script began with the Hebrew prophets , for whom Jerusalem was the center not only of their world but of God's , and everyone else worked from their material .
Isaiah 's announcement of the End of Days comes directly after he laments that the " faithful city [ has ] become a harlot . "
That sets up the contrast :
In the perfected age , " the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established as the top of the mountains " and " out of Zion shall go forth the law . "
The messiah 's task is to end the Jews ' exile and reestablish David 's kingdom - in his capital .
Christianity reworked that vision .
Jesus , says the New Testament , was not only crucified and resurrected in the city , he ascended to heaven from the Mount of Olives - and promised to return there .
Without the Jews ' national tie to the actual Jerusalem , Christians could allegorized such verses .
The Jerusalem of the end could be built on other shores , and countless millennial movements have arisen elsewhere .
But the literal meaning is there to be reclaimed , particularly in a time of literalism , such as our own .
Most striking of all is Islam ’s adoption of the same setting .
For Muslim apocalyptic believers , Jerusalem is the capital in the messianic age .
At the end of time , say Muslim traditions , the Ka'ba - Islam 's central shrine in Mecca - will come to Jerusalem .
The implication is that in Islam , speaking of the apocalypse at least hints at Jerusalem - and a struggle over Jerusalem alludes to the last battle .
Curiously , academic experts often say that Islam assigns scant space to apocalypse .
In the religion 's early centuries , believers attributed a vast body of contradictory traditions to the Prophet .
Early Islamic scholars winnowed the sayings , establishing which were most reliable .
Meanwhile , Islam became the faith of an empire , and it was time to talk softly of overthrowing the given order .
So the authors of books containing the " most accurate " traditions , the pinnacle of the canon , said little of the End .
" High " Islam appears un-apocalyptic .
[ Gorenberg ]
Thus , we see that , for those Christians who believe in Armageddon Theology , the only thing to do is to promote the well - being of Israel with money , arms , and other kinds of support , so that the Temple can be rebuilt ; never mind that it is going to be desecrated and that Israel is supposed , in the scenario , to be utterly destroyed in the process of establishing God 's kingdom !
What a double - cross !
I 've listened to Muslim sheikhs explain how verses in the Koran foretell Israel 's destruction , and to American evangelical ministers who insist on their deep love for Israel and nevertheless eagerly await apocalyptic battles on Israel 's soil so terrible that the dry river beds will , they predict , fill with rivers of blood .
I also came to realize that the center of my story had to be the Temple Mount .
What happens at that one spot , more than anywhere else , quickens expectations of the End in three religions .
And at that spot , the danger of provoking catastrophe is greatest . [...]
Melody , the cow that could have brought God 's kingdom on earth , or set the entire Middle East ablaze , or both , depending on who you ask , has her head stuck between the gray bars of the cowshed and is munching hay and corncobs . [...]
Melody 's birth in August 1996 seemed to defy nature :
Her mother was a black and white Holstein .
In fact , [ Gilad Jubi , dairyman of the Kfar Hasidim agricultureal school ] says he'd had trouble breeding the dairy cow , and finally imported semen , from Switzerland , he thinks , from a red breed of beef cattle .
But " red " cows are normally splotched .
An entirely crimson one is extraordinary : The Mishneh Torah , Moses Maimonides twelfth - century code of Jewish law , records that just nine cows in history have fit the Book of Numbers ' requirements for sacrificing as a " red heifer . "
Yet the rare offering was essential to maintaining worship in the Temple in Jerusalem .
The tenth cow , Maimonides asserts , will arrive in the time of the messiah .
That 's when Jewish tradition foresees the Third Temple being built on the Temple Mount . [...]
Finding a red heifer is one precondition to building the Temple .
Another , it 's generally assumed , is removing the Dome of the Rock from the Temple Mount . [...]
The next day , a newspaper broke the story .
[ Adir Zik , an announcer on the settlers pirate radio station known for his fiery rhetoric ] spoke about the red heifer on his radio show .
The madness about Melody had begun . [...]
Press photographers arrived .
The rabbi , sans calf , appeared on national TV .
The Boston Globe 's man did a story , and other American correspondents followed .
... A CNN crew made a pilgrimage to the red heifer , as did crews from ABC and CBS , and from Japan , Holland , France .
If much of the world 's media reported on Melody in a bemused tone , as a story about the strange things people believe , not everyone saw the cow as a joke .
On the opinion page of the influential Israeli daily Ha'aretz , columnist David Landau argued that the security services should see the red heifer as a " four - legged bomb " potentially more dangerous than any terrorist .
Landau ... understood the expectations of building the Temple that the cow could inspire among Jewish religious nationalists , and its potential for inciting war with the Muslim world .
" A bullet in the head , " he wrote , " is , according to the best traditions , the solution of security services in such cases ... "
Too shrill ?
As Landau alluded , the nameless agents of Israel 's Shin Bet domestic security force , caught off guard by the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak rabin in November 1995 , had underestimated the power of faith in the past .
At Kfar Hasidim , Melody was moved from the cowshed to " solitary confinvement " in the school 's petting zoo , where she could be kept slightly safer from the visitors arriving daily .
A dog was posted to guard her .
It could n't guard against sprouting white hairs .
[ Which Melody did , disqualifying her and saving her from being turned into cow toast . ]
Unquestionably , the reactions to Melody seem bizarre .
But there are three very solid reasons for the fears and hopes she engendered : the past , the present , and most of all the future .
Numbers 19 is one of the most apaque sections in scripture .
A red heifer , " faultless , wherin is no blemish , and upon which never came a yoke , " is to be slaughtered , and its body burned entirely to ash .
Paradoxically , this sacrifice must be performed outside the Temple , yet the heifer 's ash becomes the key to the sanctuary :
It alone can cleanse a man or woman tainted by contact with human death .
For , says the biblical text , anyone who touches a corpse , or bone , or grave , anyone who even enters the same room as a dead body , is rendered impure , and must not enter the Temple .
Yet proximity to death is an unavoidable part of life , and sacrifice was how Israelites served God .
So to free a person of impurity , says Numbers , mix the heifer 's cinder with water , and sprinkle the mixture on him .
As Jewish tradition read those verses , the heifer really had to be faultless .
Two white hairs would disqualify it .
The rarest possible beast was essential to purify a priest who'd attended his own father 's burial , or to allow any Israelite who'd been in the presence of a corpse to share in the sacrificial cult . [...]
The last ashes of the last red heifer ran out sometime after the Romans razed the Temple in Jerusalem in the year 70 .
Every Jew became impure by reason of presumed contact with death which , practically speaking , did n't matter much because there was no sanctuary to enter and sacrifice had ceased being the center of Judaism .
The tenth heifer logically belonged to the imagined time of the messiah because a rebuilt temple also did .
Except that today , the absent ashes of the red heifer have a new function .
They are a crucial factor in the political and strategic balance of the Middle East .
Over nineteen hundred years have passed since the Temple 's destruction , but its location - give or take a few crucial meters - is still a hard physical reality . [...]
In principle , Temple Mount remains the most sacred site in Judaism . [...]
But the Mount itself is n't in ruins .
As Al - Haram al - Sharif , the Noble Sanctuary , it is the third - holiest site in Islam . [...]
A glance at the Mount testifies that any effort to build the Temple where it once stood - the one place where Jewish tradtion says it can be built again - would mean removing shrines sacred to hundreds of millions of Muslims , from Morocco to Indonesia .
An attempt to dedicate even a piece of the enclosure to Jewish prayer would mean slicing that piece out of the Islamic precincts .
On June 7 , 1967 , the third day of the Six - Day War , Israeli troops took East Jerusalem , bringing the Temple Mount under Jewish rule for the first time in almost 2,000 years .
Israel 's leaders decided to leave the Mount , Al - Haram al - Sharif , in Muslim hands .
The decision kept the ingredients for holy war apart , just barely . [...]
Yet a separation made by the civil government would not have worked without a hand from Jewish religious authorities .
From the Six - Day War on , Israel 's leading rabbis have overwhelmingly ruled that Jews should not enter the gates of the Mount .
One of the most commonly cited reasons ... is that under religious law , every Jew is presumed to have had contact with the dead .
For lack of a red heifer 's ashes , there is simply nothing to be done about it : no way for Jews to purify themselves to enter the sacred square , no way for Judaism to reclaim the Mount , no way to rebuild the Temple .
Government officials and military leaders could only regard the requirement for the missing heifer as a stroke of sheer good fortune preventing conflict over the Mount . [...]
In 1984 , the Shin Bet stumbled onto the Jewish settler underground 's plot to blow up the Dome of the Rock .
One of the group 's leaders explained that among the " spiritual difficulties " that kept them from carrying out the attack was that it is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount because of impurity caused by contact with the dead - that is , they lacked the ash of a red heifer .
In a verdict in the case , one judge wrote that if the plan had been carried out , it would have " exposed the State of Israel and the entire Jewish people to a new Holocaust . "
The danger has n't gone away :
The Temple Mount is potentially a detonartor of full - scale war , and a few people trying to rush the End could set it off .
[ Gorenberg ]
According to Gorenberg , between a fifth and a quarter of all Americans are evangelicals .
In Latin America , the number of Protestants subscribing to these beliefs has climbed from 5 million in the late sixties to 40 million in the mid-nineties .
" One reason for the rise [ was ] the campaign of John Paul II against the leftist faith of liberation theology .
Denied a tie between religion and hope for a better world , Latin American Catholics have been more open to the catastrophic hopes of premillennialism . "
South Korea 's apocalyptically oriented Protestants have gone from 15 percent of the total population to 40 percent during the seventies and eighties .
The old stereotypical image of the apocalyptic believers as tramps on street corners carrying signs saying " The End is Nigh " no longer stands .
Today 's adherents of the Rapture theory wear suits in boardrooms and stride the corridors of power .
Reverend Irvin Baxter , a Pentecostal minister from Richmond , Indiana , made Melody the cover story in his " Endtime " magazine , which provides " World Events from a Biblical Perspective , " then published a follow - up article when he was able to come and visit himself .
To his 40,000 Christian subscribers , he explained Maimonides ' view that the tenth red heifer would be offered in the messiah 's time - and then noted that under the diplomatic schedule then in effect for the Oslo accords , " the final status of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount is to be settled by May of 1999 .
It 's in 1999 that Melody will be three years of age ... "
In other words , the calf , the medieval Jewish sage , and the Israel - PLO peace agreement all proved that the Temple would be in place for the End Times to begin by the millennium 's end .
Televangelist Jack Van
Impe likewise noted that " scripture requires the red heifer be sacrificed at the age of three , " and asked breathlessly , " Could Melody 's ashes be used for Temple purification ceremonies as early as 2000 ? " [... ]
[ In ] 1999 , I [ Gorenberg ] dropped in at the offices of the Al - Aqsa Association ... to see Ahmad Agbariay [ who ] is in charge of the association 's efforts to develop the mosques at Al - Haram al - Sharif . [...]
The Jews , he told me , " intend to build the Third Temple " Was there a target date ?
I asked .
" All I know is that three years ago they said a red heifer had been born ... and that in three years they 'd start building .
Three years will be up in August 1999 . " [...]
The folks with the cow have a star role on the stage of the End . [...]
[ Rabbi Chaim Richman , a proponent of Religious Zionism ] ... asserts that human beings are acting to bring the world 's final redemption .
Jews returning to their land and building a state is a piece of that .
[...]
Reverend Clyde Lott knows cows ...
Knowledge of what rabbis want in a cow has come more recently . [...]
At the end of the 1980s , Lott recalls , " there was a wave of prophecy preaching going through Mississippi , and the question was when is Israel going to build the Temple . "
For that , Lott knew , a red heifer was needed . [...]
The question weighed on him for months .
Until one day , when he was working in the field and a piece of equipment broke down and Lott got in his car to head for town , the car took him instead to the state capital of Jackson , where he strode uninvited into the office of Ray Manning , international trade director for the State of Mississippi .
...
The bizarre meeting eventually produced a letter to the agriculture attache at the U.S. embassy in Athens , responsible in his specialty for the entire Middle East .
Manning explained that he'd been approached by a cattle producer who'd made this offer : " Red Angus cattle suitable for Old Testament Biblical sacrifices , will have no blemish or off color hair , genetically red ... also excellent beef quality . "
What Lott did has a logic .
Cattle - raising today is biotech .
It was his life 's work .
But did it mean anything ?
Lott is n't the only technical person pulled to the vision of Temple - building because it promises that a technical skill is essential to the world 's salvation .
Nor is he the only one in our technological age to read the Bible itself as a tech manual , installation instruction for the final , fantastic upgrade of the universe . [...]
Lott 's name was getting out , people who'd never met him were inspired by his plan , in one significant swath of American society he was not nuts but cold sane . [...]
The " restoration of Israel " - the term Christians concerned with the End have used for generations to refer to the prophesied return of the Jews to their land - must also , he decided , be the " restoration " of Israel 's livestock industry .
[ Gorenberg ]
In 1994 , Rabbi Richman visited Lott in Mississippi where he was shown four heifers .
One caught his attention and he examined it for fifteen minutes or so .
Then he declared :
You see that heifer .
That heifer is going to change the world . "
It was the first cow in 2000 years to satisfy Numbers 19 .
Lott had " proved he could deliver . "
However , Richman wanted a heifer born in Israel to insure that it was " legally unblemished . "
Lott gave up his family farm .
At a Nebraska ranch , he began raising Red Angus bred to the highest standards , which means , he explains , " marbling in the meat , white flakes through the flesh ... easy calving , hardiness ... longevity . "
To further the effort , the Association of Beef Cattle Breeders in Israel set up a professional board whose members included Lott , Richaman , and several Israeli Agriculture Ministry officials . [...]
In the spring of 1998 , Canaan Land Restoration of Israel , Inc. , a nonprofit body dedicated to bringing cattle to Israel , was established , with pastors scattered from California to Pennsylvania as officers and advisory board members .
Lott appeared at churches , raising funds , and on Christian TV .
Donation cards , adorned with sepia photos of grazing cows , allowed supporters to sponsor the purchase of " 1 red heifer - $ 1,000.00 , " a half - heifer or quarter , or " 1 air fare ( 1 cow ) at $ 341 .
A fundraising letter exhorted , " Remember , Gen 12:2 - 3 : " I will bless those who bless you , and whoever curses you , I will curse " a verse often cited by evangelicals as a reason to support Israel . [...]
Guy Garner ... pastor of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church of Porterdale , Georgia [ gave up his tire sales business ] to commute to Israel to handle Canaan Land 's affairs . [...]
The cows ,
Guy stresses , are " a giveaway to the Jewish people . "
The growers get them and the calves they produce free of charge , with just two obligations :
After a number of years they must provide Canaan Land with the same number of young cows as they received originally .
And , along the way , Canaan Land has the right to examine every newborn calf , and to take any it judges to be " special " - likely to qualify as a red heifer and speed establishment of the Temple . [...]
Yet who is supposed to reap the real benefit of bringing red heifers to Israel ?
Garner 's certainty he is helping Israel is sincere .
But he has humbly cast himself as a bit character in an Endtime drama whose script is somewhat rougher on Jews than on born - again Christians .
In fact , the Christians will safely exit to the wings , while on stage , the Jews will find themselves at the center of the apocalypse ....
" It 's not a pleasant thing to think about , " Garner says glumly , " but God 's going to do what He 's going to do . " [...]
[ Lott says ]
" God has been waiting for six thousand years to share with mankind to prove to the world who He is .
And he 's chosen people just like us to be a part of the greatest Endtime plan that mankind could ever have experienced . "
[ Gorenberg ]
In 1998 , Rabbi Richman broke his connections to Canaan Land after learning that Lott had been filmed at a Florida church talking about converting the Jews to Christianity .
Gorenberg notes that this was symbolic of the state of the much wider alliance between the Christian Right and Israel .
It is " an alliance in which each side assumes that the other is playing a role it does n't understand itself , in which each often regards the other as an unknowing instrument for reaching a higher goal . "
Richman speaks astringently of the " doormat theology " of Christians who see Israel as a stepping - stone to an apocalypse from whose horrors only Christians will be saved .
...
On the Christian side are those who want to " bless " Israel , and provide it with what they believe is the fuse for Armageddon .
And perhaps also to convert the Israelis , another " blessing " since only the converted will make it through the Last Days . [..]
In letters after the breakup [ of Richman and Lott ] Richman said that " the Temple Institute has its own plans with regard to red heifers . " [...]
Prophecy , Guy Garner explains , is " history written in advance . "
He 's not unusual in thinking so .
[ Gorenberg ]
The question we need to ask is :
Why does faith look for a finale ?
What power does this idea hold over humanity .
Why can't modern people put the religions of Judaism , Christianity and Islam in the museum of religious concepts alongside Zeus and Ishtar ?
Gorenberg proposes a partial answer : A true believer in God ( be he Jew , Christian or Muslim ) , is highly invested in both the power and GOODness of his god .
God MUST be good .
And for an individual raised in a particular faith , who had no choice about his social , cultural and religious conditioning , this necessity for god to be good has very deep roots in his or her psyche .
Being convinced that the " faith of our fathers " is GOOD is natural and powerful .
BUT , here is the rub : bad things happen in this world that do NOT fit with the concept of a GOOD and All - Powerful god .
And so , to be a believer means to exist in a state of dissonance that must be resolved .
Human beings struggle with this problem daily ; trying to find answers that will solve the issues of death , disease and destruction ; trying to fit their experiences with their faith in a Good God .
Gorenberg gives an example of a clergyman who preaches endless sermons about men whose lives were saved because they gave to charity when the fact in the background was that his own daughter died at the age of twenty of cancer .
And so , the most daring idea of all is to assert that the world is broken and needs to be fixed .
Of course , God - being omnipotent and omnipresent - MUST know that the world is broken , and being Good , he plans to fix it someday .
And so , the answer of the millennialist is " desperately honest " : there IS something wrong with the creation of the Good and All - Powerful God , and in the same moment , the despair about the situation , the cognitive dissonance of the Good God who lets bad things happen - is rejected because God is going to make everything alright .
Naturally , your vision of the repair will depend on what you think is broken . [...]
The picture of God 's kingdom follows accordingly , but there is also the matter of how badly broken things are , of whether God acting through men and women is already fixing the world , or whether there is no choice but to wait for the Repairman to come to smash and break down and rebuild the world the way He always meant it to be .
[ Gorenberg ]
Throughout their growing up years , people are told that when something good happens , that is god acting , and when something bad happens , that is Satan who got in the door because the person 's faith was n't strong enough .
With that kind of conditioning , it 's no wonder that people are powerfully invested in maintaining the " goodness " of their god .
To insist that a messiah or saviour is " yet to come " is , essentially , a rejection of NOW , of Response - ability .
The Millennialists hang on to their beliefs for dear life because the alternatives are to either accept the world as it is , and reject the " good god hypothesis , " or to abandon the world completely , both of which would bankrupt their faith .
The power of Millennialism is enormous !
The problem that the religions face , however , is how to keep that hope burning , keep dangling that carrot , without letting it explode in their faces .
Because , when people give signs to know when the Time has come , and others discover that the signs have been fulfilled and that the day is near , and others say the day IS here , the irresistible force of enthusiasm inevitably smashed into immovable reality :
The world does n't end .
And it 's nothing but rivers of blood everywhere .
Every time .
" God does not look on all of His children the same way , " said Dr. John Walvoord , president of Dallas Theological Seminary , mentor to Hal Lindsey .
God , he tells me , had plans for Jews and Christians , but not for the others - unless they became Christians .
God , he said , had a heavenly plan for Christians , and an earthly plan for Jews .
And , I ask , the earthly plan for Jews ?
" To re-create Israel . " [ Halsell ]
What is not widely reported , but is well known among these fundamentalists circles is that , once Israel has done what the Christians want it to do : re-create itself and re-build the Temple , then they are finished .
Those that do not convert will be destroyed .
It 's that simple .
Christians can love and support Jews NOW , encouraging them and praising them and sending them money and everything they need to " get the job done . "
But , once that is accomplished , do not think for a minute that this love and support will continue as long as the Jews remain Jews .
In early 1999 , members of a Denver , Colorado dispensationalist group called Concerned Christians were arrested by Israeli police , handcuffed , jailed as common criminals and deported back to the States .
Israeli police accused them of planning a " bloody apocalypse " to hasten the Second Coming of Christ .
It was suggested that they plotted the destruction of Jerusalem 's most holy Islamic shrine .
In a fervent wish to replace the mosque with a Jewish temple , the Denver cult members are no different from other dispensationalists who believe God wants this done .
As I learned from Christians on a Falwell - sponsored tour , they hold this idea quite sacred .
A retired Army major named Owen , who lives in northern Nebraska , seems typical .
I spent much time with Owen , a widower , who is slightly built and about five feet , five inches tall .
He stands erect and has a pleasant smile .
Well dressed and with a full head of sandy hair , he looks younger than his age .
He had served in Europe during World War II and later for a number . of years in Japan .
One day , as I am walking alongside Owen , our group moves toward the old walled city .
As we enter Damascus Gate and pass along cobblestone corridors , I easily imagine Jesus having walked a similar route .
In the midst of a rapidly changing environment , the old walled city , guarding layer - upon layer of history and conflict , provides the stellar attraction for tourists and remains home for 25,000 people .
As the Palestinian Muslim Mahmud had told me earlier , throughout its long history , Jerusalem has been predominantly and overwhelmingly Arab .
We approach Haram al - Sharif , or Noble Sanctuary , which encloses the Dome of the Rock and Al - Aqsa Mosque — sites which I had visited earlier with Mahmud .
Both these edifices , on raised platform grounds , generally are called simply " the mosque " and represent Jerusalem 's most holy Islamic shrine .
We stand on lower ground below the mosque and face the Western Wall , a 200 - foot - high and 1,600 - foot - long block of huge white stones , believed to be the only remnant of the second Jewish temple .
" There — " our guide said , pointing upward toward the Dome of the Rock and Al - Aqsa mosque — " we will build our Third Temple .
We have all the plans drawn for the temple .
Even the building materials are ready .
They are hidden in a secret place .
There are several shops where Israelis work , making the artifacts we will use in the new temple .
One Israeli is weaving the pure linen that will be used for garments of the priests of the temple . "
He pauses , then adds : " In a religious school called Yeshiva Ateret Cohanim ­the Crown of the Priests — located near where we are standing , rabbis are teaching young men how to make animal sacrifice . "
A woman in our group , Mary Lou , a computer specialist , seems startled to hear the Israelis want to return to the rites of the old Solomonic sacrificial altar of the temple .
" You are going back to animal sacrifice ? " she asks .
" Why ? " " It was done in the First and Second Temples , " our Israeli guide says .
" And we do not wish to change the practices .
Our sages teach that neglecting to study the details of temple service is a sin . "
Leaving the site , I remark to Owen that our Israeli guide had said a temple must be rebuilt on the Dome of the Rock site .
But he said nothing about the Muslim shrines .
" They will be destroyed , " Owen tells me .
" You know it 's in the Bible that the temple must be rebuilt .
And there 's no other place for it except on that one area .
You find that in the law of Moses . "
Did it seem possible , I ask Owen , that the Scripture about building a temple would relate to the time in which it was written — rather than to events in the current era ?
" No , it is related to our era , " Owen says .
" The Bible tells us that in the End Times the Jews will have renewed their animal sacrifice . "
In other words , I repeat , a temple must be built so that the Jews can resume their animal sacrifice ?
" Yes , " said Owen , quoting Ezekiel 44:29 to prove his point .
Is Owen convinced that Jews , aided by Christians , should destroy the mosque , build a temple and reinstate the killing of animals in the temple — all in order to please God ?
" Yes , " he replies .
" That 's the way it has to be .
It 's in the Bible . "
And does the building of the temple , I ask , fit into any time sequence ? " Yes .
We think it will be the next step in the events leading to the return of our Lord .
As far as its being a large temple , the Bible does n't tell us that .
All it tells us is that there will be a renewal of sacrifices .
And Jews can do that in a relatively small building . "
Is n't it atavistic , I ask , to go back to animal sacrifice ?
And what about a multitude concerned with animal rights in our modern age ?
" But we do n't care what they say .
It 's what the Bible says that 's important , " Owen stresses .
" The Bible predicts a rebuilding of a temple .
Now the people who are going to do it are not Christians but Orthodox Jews .
Of course the Old Testament made out a very specific formula for what the Jews must follow regarding animal sacrifice .
They can't carry it out without a temple .
They were observing animal sacrifice until 70 A.D.
And when they have a temple they will have some Orthodox Jews who will kill the sheep or oxen in the temple , as a sacrifice to God . "
As Owen talks of reinstating animal sacrifice — a step he feels necessary for his own spiritual maturity — he seems to block from his awareness the fact that Muslim shrines stand on the site where he says God demands a temple be built .
That evening , after dinner , Owen and I take a long walk .
Again , I voice my concerns about the dangers inherent in a plot to destroy Islam 's holy shrines .
" Christians need not do it , " Owen says , repeating what he told me earlier .
" But I am sure the shrines will be destroyed . "
But , I insist , this can well trigger World War III .
" Yes , that ' s right .
We are near the End Times , as I have said .
Orthodox Jews will blow up the mosque and this will provoke the Muslim world .
It will be a cataclysmic holy war with Israel .
This will force the Messiah to intervene . "
Owen speaks as calmly , as softly as if telling me there 'd be rain tomorrow .
" Yes , " he adds , as we return to our hotel .
" There definitely must be a third temple . "
Back home in Washington , D.C....
I talked with Terry Reisenhoover , a native of Oklahoma , who told me he raised money to help Jewish terrorists destroy the Muslim shrines .
Reisenhoover — short , rotund , balding and a Born Again Christian blessed with a fine tenor voice — told me he frequently was invited during the Reagan administration to White House gatherings of dispensationalists , where he was a featured soloist .
Reisenhoover spoke freely to me of his plans to move tax - free dollars from American donors to Israel .
In 1985 he served as chairman of the American Forum for Jewish - Christian Cooperation , being assisted by Douglas Krieger as executive director , and an American rabbi , David Ben - Ami , closely linked with Ariel Sharon .
Additionally , Reisenhoover served as chairman of the board for the Jerusalem Temple Foundation , which has as its sole purpose the rebuilding of a temple on the site of the present Muslim shrine .
Reisenhoover chose as the foundation 's international secretary Stanley Goldfoot .
Goldfoot emigrated in the 1930s from South Africa to Palestine and became a member of the notorious Stern gang , which shocked the world with its massacres of Arab men , women and children .
Such figures as David Ben-Gurion denounced the gang as Nazis and outlawed them .
Goldfoot , according to the Israeli newspaper Davar , placed a bomb on July 22 , 1946 , in Jerusalem 's King David Hotel that destroyed a wing of the hotel housing the British Mandate secretariat and part of the military headquarters .
The operation killed some 100 British and other officials and , as the Jewish militants planned , hastened the day the British left Palestine .
" He 's a very solid , legitimate terrorist , " Reisenhoover said admiringly of Goldfoot .
" He has the qualifications for clearing a site for the temple . "
Reisenhoover also said that while Christian militants are acting on religious fervor , their cohort Goldfoot does not believe in God or sacred aspects of the Old Testament .
For Goldfoot , it 's a matter of Israeli control over all of Palestine .
" It is all a matter of sovereignty , " Goldfoot deputy Yisrael Meida , a member of the ultra right - wing Tehiya party , explained .
" He who controls the Temple Mount , controls Jerusalem .
And he who controls Jerusalem , controls the land of Israel . "
Reisenhoover told me he had sponsored Goldfoot on several trips to the United States , where Goldfoot spoke on religious radio and TV stations and to church congregations .
Reisenhoover helped me secure a tape cassette of a talk Goldfoot made in Chuck Smith 's Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa , California .
In soliciting donations for a temple , Goldfoot did not tell the Christians about plans to destroy the mosque .
Reisenhoover had given me several names of persons who knew Stanley Goldfoot , among them George Giacumakis , who for many years headed the Institute for Holy Land Studies , a long established American - run evangelical school for studies in archaeology and theology .
On one of my visits to Jerusalem , I made an appointment with Giacumakis , a Greek American with dark eyes and cultivated charm .
Might he , I asked , after we had visited casually over coffee , help me arrange an interview with Goldfoot ?
" Oh , no , " Giacumakis responded , dropping his head into both hands , as one does on hearing a disaster .
" You do n't want to meet him .
He goes back to the Irgun terrorist group ! "
Raising his head and waving an arm toward the King David Hotel , he added , " Stanley Goldfoot was in charge of that operation .
He will not stop at anything .
His idea is to rebuild the temple , and if that means violence , then he will not hesitate to use violence . "
Giacumakis paused , then assured me that while he himself did not believe in violence , " If they do destroy the mosque and the temple is there , that does not mean I will not support it . "
It was also Terry Reisenhoover who helped me get acquainted with the Reverend James E. DeLoach , a leading figure in the huge Second Baptist Church of Houston .
After we had talked a few times on the telephone , DeLoach volunteered he would be in Washington , D.C.
He came by my apartment , at my invitation , and I set my tape recording running — with his permission .
" I know Stanley very very well .
We 're good friends , " he said .
" He 's a very strong person . "
Of Reisenhoover , DeLoach said , " He 's very talented — at raising money .
He 's raising $ 100 million .
A lot of this has gone to paying lawyers who gained freedom for 29 Israelis who attempted to destroy the mosque .
It cost us quite a lot of money to get their freedom . "
And how , I ask , did he and the others funnel the money from U.S. donors to the aid of the Jewish terrorists ?
" We 've provided support for the Ateret Cohanim Yeshiva . "
The Jewish school , I asked , that prepares students to make animal sacrifice ?
" Yes , " he agreed .
And Christian donors are paying for that ?
" It takes a lot of training , " he said .
Then , quite proudly : " I 've just hosted in my Houston home two fine young Israelis who study how to do the animal sacrifice in the temple to be built . "
[ Grace Halsell ]
Indeed , the Torah devotes a lot of words to animal sacrifice , yet Judaism has survived without such barbarity for nearly two thousand years .
Sometime during the Roman siege of Jerusalem , Yohanan ben Zakkai escaped the city and established a new center of Jewish learning in the town of Yavneh .
Ben Zakkai was a revolutionary posing as protector of tradition .
Before , the ram 's horn had been blown on Rosh Hashanah only in the Temple ; he ruled that it could be blown elsewhere .
He did not say the same of sacrifices .
His successors instituted prayers that took the place of burnt offerings , in part by praying for the Temple 's restoration . [...]
In nostalgia , Jews idealized the Temple ; it stood for a lost utopia where God and human beings enjoyed a perfect relationship , a lost childhood .
Its destruction symbolized loss of innocence .
Judaism became a religion of the intellect , with study as the central religious act .
It superseded sacrifices by remembering them .
The modern denominations of Reform and Conservative Judaism altered their liturgy to diminish that memory .
Except that sometimes a culture 's old memory can come suddenly back to life , like a recessive gene that has waited generations .
For its part , Christianity regarded the razing of the Temple as proof that God had moved his covenant from the old Israel who ’d rejected Jesus to the new Israel of the Church .
Second - century Christian philosopher Justin Martyr lumped sacrifices together with the Sabbath , circumcision , and all the other commandments that , he said , were irrelevant after Jesus .
Besides , Christians argued , Jesus ' crucifixion was the last atonement by blood - a thesis that both accepted the idea of sacrifice ( even human sacrifice ) and rejected it .
[ Gorenberg ]
A pamphlet for tourists tells us :
The beauty and tranquility of Al - Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem attracts thousands of visitors every year .
Some believe it was the site of the Temple of Solomon , peace be upon him ... or the site of the Second Temple ... although no documented historical or archaeological evidence exists to support this .
There is something to be said for this as the reader will know from reading " Who Wrote the Bible . "
Archaeologists have been digging up the " Holy Land " since the nineteenth century and , so far , there has been not a shred of evidence to support the " Temple of Solomon " story , nor much of anything else in the Bible " as history . "
Nevertheless , Temple Mount IS standing there , taking up nearly a sixth of the walled Old City of Jerusalem .
It is certainly true that Herod built a Temple in the vicinity that replaced the earlier temple built by Jews returning from exile in the fifth century BC .
Those , in turn , claimed that they were building the Temple on the spot where the former " Temple of Solomon " had stood .
As we discover in Who Wrote the Bible. , the so - called " Temple of Solomon " was very likely a pagan Temple that had existed for some time in Jerusalem and had fallen into disrepair and was restored by King Hezekiah as part of his religious reform project .
But , even the Temple Mount is a matter of stories and not facts .
Medieval philosopher , Moses Maimonides says that not only was Adam born where the altar stood , but Cain and Able made their sacrifices there and Noah did the same after the flood ( never mind that he supposedly landed on Mt. Ararat in Turkey ) .
Abraham was told to go to " Mount Moriah " to sacrifice his son Isaac and Mount Moriah is where the Second Book of Chronicles informs us Solomon built the Temple .
As noted in Who Wrote the Bible , Second Chronicles is a late rewrite of Jewish royal history and it is altogether likely that the redactor took the name " Moriah " and assigned it to where the Temple that was refurbished stood in order to affirm its sanctity .
Another curious point that Gorenberg makes is the fact that the word " Jerusalem " occurs hundreds of times in the Bible , but NOT in the Torah .
The closest is " Salem " , possibly an early , pagan name for the city .
Archaeologists tell us that Jerusalem was a sacred center long before the alleged time of David and Solomon .
The Temple was supposedly built on a " threshing floor , " which may indicate that the religion practiced in the region , and the temple that actually stood there already , was devoted to fertility gods and goddesses .
In our own more recent history , Christian Spaniards who conquered Cordoba turned its Great Mosque into a cathedral and the Ottoman sultan who vanquished Constantinople in 1453 converted the church of Hagia Sophia to a mosque .
Central Asia 's oldest standing mosque in Bukhara , north of Afghanistan , stands on layers that archaeologists have shown reveal the prior existence of both a Zoroastrian temple and a Buddhist temple .
The temple that was in Jerusalem - which was NOT Solomon's - was destroyed in 586 BC by the Babylonians .
Seventy years later , the returning exiles were tasked with building a new Temple " on the site " of the old one .
The big question is : after so many years , did they actually build on the right spot ?
Did they even know what was the place where the former temple in Jerusalem stood ?
For that matter , is what is now known as Jerusalem really the place that was known as Jerusalem before the exile ?
Gorenberg points out that it's hard to understand why any city stood there at all .
" It 's on the edge of a desert ; the soil is rocky ; the sole spring is grade C ; the trade routes cross to the north . "
It seems that the temple built by the returning exiles from Babylon was little more than a human - built platform on top of the mountain , achieved by moving a lot of earth to accommodate the crowds that came to witness the sacrifices .
It was on this earthwork platform that Herod built the temple that remains in the memory of the Jews .
Josephus described Herod as " brutish and a stranger to all humanity .
He married the last princess of the Hasmonean dynasty and murdered her and her sons and another of his sons by a different wife .
But he certainly did build the most magnificent temple that Jerusalem had ever seen .
The purpose of the temple , according to various sources , was to make money .
The building project attracted pilgrims by the thousands - " customers for faith , the only product Jerusalem has ever had to sell . "
Herod 's temple did n't last long .
It was razed in the summer of 70 AD by Titus and sixty years later , the emperor Hadrian rebuilt the city as " Aelia Capitolina , dedicated to Jupiter , Juno , and Minerva .
It is very likely that the " Wailing Wall " so revered by Jews as the last remnant of Herod 's Temple , is actually part of the Temple of Jupiter built by Hadrian .
[ see Tuvia Sagiv ]
Nevertheless , the troops of the caliph Umar , second commander of the faithful after Mohammed , conquered Aelia Capitolina in 638 .
At that time , the city 's Christian patriarch , Sophronius was asked to show him where the Temple had formerly stood .
A Byzantine account tells us that , when the patriarch saw Umar there , he knew the world was ending ( but remember , at that time the idea of rebuilding the temple was not part of the Christian theology ) , and so he pointed out the mount which had become a heap of rubbish .
Umar cleared away the rubbish and built a mosque that was the forerunner of the Dome of the Rock which was built by Caliph Abd al - Malik ibn Marwan in 691 , and stands nearby .
The problem is , historians can't really explain why the Caliph wanted to create a " holy site " there since Mecca was already " The Holy Site " of Islam .
Gorenberg suggests that the Byzantine building indicates strong Christian influence in its design .
It does , in fact , somewhat resembles the later Templar style of church and one might be justified in thinking that there was a strong Islamic influence on the Templars both in terms of architecture as well as esotericism .
A clue to this esoteric stream is revealed inside where a mosaic inscription from the Koran addresses " The People of the Book , " an Islamic designation for Christians , saying :
Do not say things about God but the truth !
The messiah Jesus , son of Mary , is indeed a messenger of God ...
So believe in God and all the messengers , and stop talking about a trinity ...
Verily God is the God of unity .
Lord Almighty !
That God would beget a child ?
Either in the Heavens or on the Earth ? "
And , for the Jews , there was also a message in the structure itself :
The Dome stands where everyone knew the Temple did , and therefore , it can be seen that Islam is the culmination of Judaism and Christianity .
Many of the popular ideas about the location of the Temple in Jerusalem are due to the work of Sir Charles Warren .
Lieut .- General Sir Charles Warren was born at Bangor , North Wales , on 7th February 1840 .
His early education took place at the Grammar Schools of Bridgnorth and Wem , and at Cheltenham College .
He then entered the Royal Military College at Sandhurst , and from that passed through the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and received a commission as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 23rd December 1857 .
After the usual course of professional instruction at Chatham , Warren went to Gibraltar , where he spent seven years , and , in addition to the ordinary duties of an Engineer subaltern - looking after his men and constructing or improving fortifications and barrack buildings - he was employed on a trigonometrical survey of the Rock , which he completed on a large scale .
He constructed two models of the famous fortress , one of which is now at the Rotunda at Woolwich , and the other at Gibraltar .
He was also engaged for some months in rendering the eastern face of the Rock inaccessible by scarping or building up any places that might lend a foothold to an enemy .
On the completion of his term of service at Gibraltar he returned to England in 1865 , was appointed Assistant Instructor in Surveying at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham , and a year later his services were lent by the War Office to the Palestine Exploration Fund .
The object of the Palestine Exploration Fund was the illustration of the Bible , and it originated mainly through the exertions of Sir George Grove , who formed an influential committee , of which for a long time Sir Walter Besant was secretary .
Captain ( afterwards Sir ) Charles Wilson and Lieut .
Anderson , R.E. , had already been at work on the survey of Palestine , and , in 1867 , it was decided to undertake excavations at Jerusalem to elucidate , if possible , many doubtful questions of Biblical archaeology , such as the site of the Holy Sepulchre , the true direction of the second wall and the course of the first , second , and third walls , involving the sites of the towers of Hippicus , Phaselus , Mariamne , and Psephinus , and many other points of great interest to the Biblical student .[...]
It was Warren who restored the ancient city to the world ; he it was who stripped the rubbish from the rocks and showed the glorious temple standing within its walls 1,000 feet long , and 200 feet high , of mighty masonry : he it was who laid open the valleys now covered up and hidden ; he who opened the secret passages , the ancient aqueducts , the bridge connecting the temple and the town .
Whatever else may be done in the future , his name will always be associated with the Holy City which he first recovered . ' [...]
It was on his way to Kimberley from Cape Town via Port Elizabeth ... that he had the late Mr. Cecil Rhodes as his traveling companion .
As they were driving over the brown veldt from Dordrecht to Jamestown , Warren noticed that Mr. Rhodes , who sat opposite to him , was evidently engaged in learning something by heart , and offered to hear him .
It turned out to be the Thirty - nine Articles of the Church of England .
In the diary of this journey , also published in ' Good Words ' of 1900 , Warren relates ` We got on very well until we arrived at the article on predestination , and there we stuck .
He had his views and I had mine , and our fellow - passengers were greatly amused at the topic of our conversation - for several hours - being on one subject .
Rhodes is going in for his degree at home , and works out here during the vacation . '
Sir Charles Warren was later appointed Metropolitan Police Commissioner in London , a post he held at the time of the famous Jack the Ripper murders .
Warren never made any statements about who he thought the killer might be but in a report to the Home Office on Oct 17 1888 he wrote " I look upon this series of murders as unique in the history of our country . "
Michael Hoffman wrote in 1996 :
The most recent Palestinian uprising , this past September , began in the wake of the opening of Jerusalem 's " Hasmonean Tunnel , " which runs adjacent to the Haram al - Sharif , Islam 's Third Holiest Shrine , is the former site of the Temple of Herod , destroyed in A.D. 70 by Roman legions commanded by Titus .
Though the media repeatedly discounted it at the time , the Palestinians were enraged due to their fear that the opening of the Tunnel was the beginning of the end for the Al - Aqsa Mosque and the start of the rebuilding of the Third Temple , which is the fabled goal to which most of the esoteric secret societies of the West and most especially the orders of Freemasonry , are oriented ( indeed , masonic iconography is obsessed with a rebuilt Temple ) .
The establishment media , in a remarkable demonstration of the uniformity and power of their monopoly control of large scale communications , were able to stifle any substantial reporting in September , providing evidence that Palestinian fears on this subject had some justification .
In what James Shelby Downard terms a " cryonic process " ( after the method by which Walt Disney 's mortal remains are supposedly preserved ) -- the freeze - wait - thaw operation -- the truth about the intense concentration of the resources of both esoteric Zionism and esoteric Freemasonry on this " Temple Mount " complex , was frozen while the riots raged .
When they subsided , a waiting period ensued as the crisis left the front pages and moved slightly to the rear of the consciousness of the group mind of the masses .
After the waiting period , came the thaw , when the truth was taken out of the deep freeze and presented to the public . [...]
The opening of the tunnel in September , 1996 , with its ritual bloodshed , a precursor of the sacrificial blood ordained to flow if the Temple is rebuilt , was orchestrated in 1867 .
It was then that the future General Sir Charles Warren , England 's Commissioner of Police and co-conspirator in the occult ritual murder known to history as " Jack the Ripper , " had been dispatched on yet another masonic mission , to lay the groundwork for the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem .
And so it was that in 1867 , one of England 's most important Freemasons , a member of its " research lodge " ( Ars Quator Coronatorum ) , " rediscovered " the claustrophobic , 500 - yard tunnel .
The " implements " of the old Temple , according to the Talmud , were hidden on the Temple Mount before the destruction of the Second Temple .
With Warren 's Tunnel now open , the " treasure hunt " begins , as the establishment media admitted , between the lines , during its mid-October " thaw . "
In the second week in October , Zionist zealots involved in crimes of terrorism linked to the hoped - for destruction of Al - Aqsa mosque , suddenly entered stage center from their establishment - imposed positions of obscurity .
In the processing of the group mind , chronology is everything .
Hence , mid October was the time designated for slowly pulling the curtain back and revealing the actual game afoot .
At this juncture the establishment media unveiled Mr. Yehuda Etzion , head of Hai Vekayam , spearhead of the drive to rebuild Herod 's Temple upon the ruins of Islam 's revered Al - Aqsa mosque .
As if on cue , seven Hai Vekayam " activists " were arrested by Israeli police when they tried to force their way onto the Dome of the Rock in October .
Also on cue , a petition was presented to the Israelis in October , dotting every " i " and crossing every " t " of every Palestinian fear about what the Zionists intend with their " tunnel . "
The petition , put forth by the Temple Mount Faithful organization , a group financed by deep - pockets Judeo - Churchian fundamentalists in the U.S. and shadowy , international Zionist and masonic moneybags , calls for the removal of the mosque from the Temple Mount .

[ Michael Hoffman ]
With all the things that have happened since 1996 , with all that Halsell and Gorenberg have uncovered , Hoffman does n't sound so nutty , now does he ?
Fact is , after his expedition , Warren wrote a book entitled " The Land of Promise , " a book arguing that Britain 's East India Company should colonize Palestine with Jews .
The idea was quite popular in England for two reasons : 1 ) it promoted British imperial interests and 2 ) it fit Bible prophecy .
These two factors would motivate the Balfour Declaration of 1917 in favor of a Jewish Homeland .
Certainly , the British had territorial interests in Palestine , but one cannot ignore the issue of religion and millennialist aspirations about the British .
Yes , Imperial logic would say that Britain should take Palestine because it was the gateway to the Ottoman empire and to Africa as well , but notice what Gorenberg writes :
On November 2 , 1917 , two days after General Edmund Allenby 's Egyptian Expeditionary Force took Beersheba from the Ottoman Turks and prepared to march north toward Jerusalem , the British government announced an entirely different rationale for the campaign : Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent a letter to British Zionist leader Lord Rothschild , informing him that the cabinet had approved " a declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations :
His Majesty 's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people ... "
Five weeks later , Allenby 's army took Jerusalem .
For two days after the actual conquest , the general ’s arrival was meticulously planned .
...
Christian armies were returning to the city for the first time since the Crusades .
Allenby arrived at Jaffa Gate riding a white horse , with the pomp of a king .
Then , before he entered the Old City , he dismounted and walked .
A standard account of the general 's reason : His Savior had entered this city on foot , and so would he .
[ Gorenberg ]
Allenby 's action makes sense of the Balfour Declaration : Conquering Jerusalem had to not only be considered strategically , it had to be accomplished " according to prophecy . "
The British logic was rooted in their fervor for the Old Testament and the hope for the millennium .
That logic was derived from the cultic teachings of the Christadelphians and John Darby 's premillennialist Plymouth Brethren , as well as the hopes of mainstream Anglicans .
It was their desire to convert the Jews and return them to their homeland .
Barbara Tuchman writes of these passions about the influential Earl of Shaftesbury , that " despite all his zeal on the Jews ' behalf , it is doubtful if Lord Shaftesbury ever thought of them as a people with their own language and traditions ...
To him , as to all the " Israel - for - prophecy 's sake school , the Jews were simply the instrument through which Biblical prophecy could be fulfilled .
They were not a people , but a mass Error that must be brought to Christ in order that the whole chain reaction leading to the Second Coming ... could be set in motion . "
Neither Balfour nor Lloyd George was a millennialist , but they were products of an England suffused with such belief , and of the ardor it produced for the Old Testament .
Balfour defended his declaration to Parliament by arguing that Christendom must not be " unmindful of the service [ the Jews ] have rendered to the great religions of the world . "
Lloyd George commented that when he discussed Palestine with Weizmann , Zionism 's apostle to the British government , Weizmann " kept bringing up place names that were more familiar to me than those of the Western front . "
The two statesmen could regard restoring the Jews to their land as a British task because English millennialism had made this a reasonable project , even for those who were n't thinking about the millennium .
Except that once England actually ruled Palestine , the simple commitment of the Balfour Declaration slammed into the real world .
[ Gorenberg ]
August 16 , 1929 , the day that the Palestine Mandate burst into flames , predictably , as Gorenberg notes .
The day before , on the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple , hundreds of Jews had demonstrated along the Western Wall , demanding rights to the spot .
A surviving photograph of the demonstrators is interesting because it shows some of them in shorts and regular shoes .
Why is this interesting ?
Because as a sign of mourning on such days , religious Jews do not wear leather shoes on a fast day .
This means that the protesters were not demanding rights to the Western Wall for religious reasons , but for nationalistic and territorial reasons .
They raised the Zionist flag and sang the Zionist anthem .
So , the next day , Muslim protestors came and beat up the pious Jewish worshippers who had nothing to do with the demonstration of the day before .
The following Friday , tensions had increased to such an extent that Arabs began assaulting Jews in the old city , armed with clubs and knives .
Within an hour , the attacks had spread to other areas of the city and the British police force was so undermanned it could do nothing .
The violence spread and on the second day ( 24 August ) , in Hebron , rioters moved from house to house murdering and looting .
Sixty - seven Jews were killed , including a dozen women and three children .
Most of the town 's Jews were saved by their Arab neighbors .
One historian records that Jews went well beyond self defense .
In one instance , in retaliation , Jews broke into a Mosque and destroyed holy books .
A Palestinian version of the events tells us that the people of Palestine reacted to the provocation of Jewish religious extremists at the holy site , which seems to be what actually happened .
In a week and a half of terror , 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed .
From any point of view , the event was a turning point in the struggle for control of Palestine .
The fact is that there was , at this early stage , a great opposition of Palestinians to the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine , and it 's easy to understand .
Palestine was basically " given to the Jews " by Britain .
But , many in Britain began to think that the Balfour Declaration 's promise of a " national home " for the Jews had been a mistake .
The facts are : two national groups were struggling for one piece of land .
One of the groups had been there for a very , very long time , and the other group intended to come and take over what they were convinced was theirs either by right of the British mandate , or by right of their god .
The British plan to settle the Jews in Palestine was a disaster and they ran with their tails between their legs , leaving the Palestinians and the Jews to duke it out on their own .
But the fight was not equal .
The desire among the Christian West for the Jews to remain in Palestine , to re-create Israel , to re-build the Temple , and to fulfill prophecy was behind the Jewish presence .
The Palestinians did n't have a chance from the beginning .
Avraham Stern was a rebel even among rebels , too extreme for the average extremist .
A Polise - born Jew who admired Mussolini , he'd been a member of the Irgun Tzva'i Le'umi ( National Military Organization ) , the right - wing Jewish underground in Palestine .
In the late '30s , Palestine 's Arabs revolted against British rule ; attacks on Jews were common .
The Irgun rejected the mainstream Haganah policy of restraint and launched revenge attacks on Arabs : gunfire at a bus here , a bomb in a market there , the murder of innocents as payment for the murder of innocents .
From there it went on to battling the British , who sought to satisfy the Arabs by restricting immigration even as desperate Jews were trying to get out of Europe .
But when World War II broke out , the Irgun declared a truce : Fighting Germany was more important than driving out the British .
Such zigzagging was n't for Stern :
In spring 1940 , he and his followers left the Irgun to create a more radical group that would keep fighting the British .
They robbed banks , tried to assassinate mandatory officials .
In Hebrew the group was called Lehi ... the English called it the Stern Gang , even after police ferreted Stern out in a Tel Aviv apartment in 1942 and shot him dead .
The group 's ne leaders included Yitzhak Yezernitzky , who later changed his name to Yitzhak Shamir and decades later became Israel 's prime minister . [...]
In a newspaper called The Underground , Lehi published its eighteen principles of Jewish national renaissance .
Number 18 read : " Building the Third Temple , as symbol of the era of the Third Kingdom . "
After Israeli independence , the group 's veterans republished the principles , with an emendation .
Now number 18 said : " Building the Third Temple as a symbol of the era of otal redemption . "
Historian Joseph Heller explains that " Third Kingdom " sounded too close to " Third Reich " - a sensitive point since Lehi was stained by having unsuccessfully offered its services to the Axis against Britain in 1941 .
The emendation make the point clearer : " They were a messianic movement , especially under Stern , " says Heller .
[ Gorenberg ]
Gorenberg tells the story of David Shaltiel who was commander of the Haganah , the Jewish militia - turned army .
Shaltiel had been raised in an Orthodox home in Hamburg .
He claimed that , at the age of thirteen he walked out of the synagogue on Yom Kippur and ate pork and waited for God to strike him down . "
When nothing happened , he was finished with religion .
Shaltiel went on to join the French Foreign Legion and later became and arms buyer for Haganah in Europe .
In 1936 , the Gestapo arrested him in Aachen .
He is said to have been Dachau and Buchenwald and " another sixteen prisons " .
Somehow , he was released before World War II began and returned to Palestine where he became a Haganah officer .
In November of 1947 , after WW II ( which must certainly have profoundly affected Shaltiel ) , the United Nations ( which also was profoundly affected by WW II , as was the entire world ) voted to partition Palestine between a Jewish and an Arab state .
You might even say that this vote was a direct result of the events of WW II and many people have suggested that there was Zionist complicity in the murder of millions of Jews for the express purpose of generating guilt and sympathy for the Jewish people , to put them in a position of unassailable " moral right " to Palestine .
In any event , the Arabs were opposed to partition ( not a surprise ) and were battling Jews even as the British pulled out leaving Palestine in a shambles .
On May 28 , 1948 , two weeks after the Zionist leadership proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel , the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem fell to Jordanian forces .
At dawn on July 17 , a U.N. cease - fire was due to go into force .
Shaltiel , the guy who had ceremonially eaten pork on Yom Kippur so many years ago , now decided that - before he had to stop fighting upon the execution of the cease - fire - he was going to be a hero and re-take the Old City as his last Hurrah .
The Old City did n't have any strategic value , but apparently , its symbolic significance was enormous to the Jews .
Shaltiel had the help of the Irgun and Lehi forces , as well as a special explosive charge designed by a physicist .
So confident of victory was Shaltiel that he had a lamb ready to sacrifice on Temple Mount .
Shaltiel died in 1969 and no one knows if he expected the resumption of animal sacrifice as a regular practice , but it is certain that he thought that sacrificing a lamb was the proper way to celebrate the re-taking of Jerusalem .
Shaltiel probably would not have contravened David Ben-Gurion 's orders not to damage any of the Muslim shrines had he been successful in his bid to re-take the mount , but the same cannot be said for the commander of the Lehi forces , Yehoshua Zetler .
If the attack was successful , he had definite plans to raze the Muslim shrines on the Mount and he equipped his men with the explosives to do it .
As it happened , the offensive failed .
The special bomb made a black mark on the four hundred year old Muslim walls , but did n't even crack them .
At 5:00 , the cease - fire went into effect .
Yisrael Eldad wrote pornographically of his feelings about that night , later published in a memoir :
And the heart imagines : Perhaps it will break out tonight ...
If only they had a sense of history .
Oh , if only !
And precisely on this night , the night of the first destruction , the night of the second destruction , precisely on this night if only they burst through and got there - for they are capable of bursting through and getting there ...
There are enough arms , and there are young men , and there is Jerusalem , all of her desiring it , ready for a dread night like this , if only they would burst through , if only they would get there .
To the Wall , to the mourning , to what has been abandoned .
To break through and set it all aflame .
In fire it fell and in fire it will rise again .
To raze it all there , all the sanctified lies and hypocrisy .
To purify , purify , purify .
( Speaking of sanctified lies and hypocrisy , the Old Testament has to be the mother of them all . )
But it did n't happen : the Jewish State was born without the Old City which remained in the hands of the Palestinians who had lived there for 2000 years .
Many of them are probably descended from original Jews who converted .
In his 1996 book " Beginning of the End : The Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the Coming Antichrist " , Texas pastor John Hagee recalls sitting with his father when news came over the radio that Israel was a new nation .
His father told him : " We have just heard the most important prophetic message that will ever be delivered until Jesus Christ returns to earth . "
For the millennialists , the Balfour Declaration had been exciting , but Israel 's " birth " produced absolute frenzies of apocalyptic ecstasy .
The prophecies of the Last Days were coming TRUE !
Except for stories I 'd heard in my childhood Sunday School , I knew little or nothing about a Jerusalem where people live everyday lives - where they are born , got to school , get married , have children , at times laugh and celebrate , at other moments cry and mourn .
Then , one day , moving to Jerusalem , I began to experience the realities of a people who have always lived there .
I walk the cobblestone streets with an Arab Muslim , Mahmud Ali Hassan , who was born in Jerusalem , bought his first pair of shoes , got his first shave from a barber , was fitted for his first suit of clothes , was married , saw all his children born and watched them grow up - all in the Old Walled City .
With Mahmud , I walk along narrow corridors within one of the few remaining examples in the world of a completely walled town .
The walls stand partially on the foundations of Hadrian 's Square , built in A.D. 135 .
they include remains of earlier walls , those of King Herod in 37 B.C , and Agrippa , A.D. 41 , and Saladin , 1187 .
And finallyt the walls were rebuilt by the Turkish Muslim , Suleiman the Magnificent , in the sixteenth century .
" This Old Walled City throughout its long history has been predominantly inhabited by Arabes , " Mahmud tells me .
" And Arab markets , Arab homes , and Arab religious sites make up about ninety percent of the Old City .
" As Arabs , we are descendants of an indigenous people , a people who never left Palestine , continually having lived within these old walls , " Mahmud continues .
" I can trace my forebears back more than ten generations .
And in the case of my father and his father and his father , our famili8es have lived in the same house for the past three hundred years . " [...]
" This is one of the oldest cities in the world , " Mahmud reminds me .
" Arabs called Amorites came here four to five thousand years ago .
they established this site as a religious foundation to honor their god .
And these early Arab worshippers of a god they called Shalem gave us the name of our Holy City , Jerusalem .
Then came others of our forebears , the Canaanites from Canaan .
They made Jerusalem an early center of worship of the One God. the Canaanites had a king named Melchizedek , and it is written that he also was a priest of God Most High .
" All this early history predates the arrival of the Hebrews by many centuries ...
And when a tribe of Hebrews , one of many tribes in the area , did arrive , they stayed for less than 400 years .
And they , too , like many before and after , were defeated .
And 2000 years ago , they were driven out . "
From Al - Aqsa , we walk a short distance toward the magnificent Dome of the Rock , one of the most beautiful shrines in all the world - often compared in its beauty with the Taj Mahal . [...]
" As Arabs , as Muslims , our quarrel has never been with Jews as Jews , or with the great religion of Judaism .
The places that the Jews and Christians revere as holy , we revere as holy .
The prophets the Jews and Christians revere as holy , we revere as holy .
My point is that everyone in history has borrowed from what went before .
No one or no one group has exclusive rights here .
There were countless batttles over Jerusalem .
And the Hebrews were in power here only sixty years . "
[ Halsell ]
A late 1998 Israeli newsletter posted on a " Voice of the Temple Mount " web site says its goal is " the liberation " of the Muslim shrines and the building on that site of a Jewish Temple .
" Now the time is ripe for the Temple to be rebuilt , " says the Israeli newsletter .
The newsletter calls upon " the Israeli government to end the pagan Islamic occupation " of lands where the mosue stands .
It adds , " The building of the Third Temple is near . "
There remains but one more event to completely set the stage for Israel 's part in the last great act of her historical drama .
This is to rebuild the ancient Temple of worship upon its old site .
There is only one place that this Temple can be built , according to the law of Moses .
This is upon Mt. Moriah .
It is there that the two previous Temples were built .
-- Hal Lindsey , The Late Great Plane Earth An anti-Semite " is someone who hates Jews more than he 's supposed to . " -- TV Evangelist Jomes Robison .
The Christian Church , throughout most of its history , has been anti-Semitic .
With the reformation , however , many Christians turned from anti-Semitism to a new kind of discrimination rampant in the world today : philo - Semitism .
This is a stance which views the Jews as practically necessary AS Jews , because they have a role to play in the salvation of Christians !
This " love of Jews " includes in its parameters the complacent sureness that the Jews ARE different and are destined for extinction once they have performed their assigned task .
Certainly , there are personal and political differences among Christians which make a generalization inaccurate and perhaps even dangerous , but the fact remains that many fundamentalists who are leading the " let 's help Israel every way we can " and " let 's go after the Muslims " charge of the present day have an established history of having taught their followers that Jews were behind all of the world 's troubles .
It was after the full horrors of Nazi Germany had been revealed that Western Christianity realized that promoting anti-Semitism a la The Protocols of the Elders of Zion could be seen as sympathizing with the Nazis .
So , those fundamentalist who were blatantly anti-Semitic backed up and regrouped .
With the birth of Israel in 1948 , the anti-Semitic Christians changed their tactics .
They were still anti-Semitic ( still ARE ) , but they acted differently on the outside ; they became " loving " and " grateful " , benign and patronizing toward Jews .
Thank goodness the Jews were NOW doing what they were supposed to do : regather in Israel so Jesus could return and blast them all to smithereens !
As this new appreciation of the Jewish role merged with dispensationalist beliefs , Western Christians became fiercely supportive of the new Jewish state .
Nothing must come between Israel and its destiny !
Anybody could criticize any other nation in the world , but NOT Israel .
Criticizing France , Germany or even the U.S. was just " political . "
Criticizing Israel was criticizing God Almighty .
At the same time that millennialists proclaim their love for Israel , they frequently reveal that they have no liking for Jews at all .
Standing , overlooking the Megiddo valley , Clyde , a traveling companion , explained to me that this was the site where Christ would lead the forces of good against evil .
" Two - thirds of all the Jews will be killed , " Clyde said , citing Zechariah 13:8 - 9 .
Pausing for some math , he comes up with nine million dead Jews .
" For two hundred miles , the blood will reach to the horses ' bridles . "
When I express concern over this scenairo , Clyde explains , " God is doing it mainly for his ancient people , the Jews .
He 's devised a seven - year Tribulation period mainly to purge the Jews , to get them to see the light and recognize Christ as their savior . "
But why , I ask , would God have chosen a people = " God 's favorite " as Clyde says - only to exterminate most of them ?
" As I said , God must purge them , " Clyde says .
" He wants them to bow down before His only son , our Lord Jeus Christ . "
But a few will be left ?
To bury their dead ?
" Yes , " Clyde tells me .
" There 'll be 144,000 who are spared .
Then they will convert to Christ . "
[ Halsell ]
Only 144,000 Jews will remain alive after the battle of Armageddon .
These remaining Jews - every man , woman and child among them - will bow down to Jesus .
As converted Christians , all the adults will at once begin preaching the gospel of Christ .
Imagine !
They will be like 144,000 Billy Grahams turned loose at once ! " -- Hal Lindsey
As long as they do n't convert , Jews are " spiritually blind . " -- Jerry Falwell Traditionally , Jews have been liberal and supportive of liberal agendas .
Having known discrimination and racism , they were allied with liberal agendas .
However , in 1967 , after Israel seized Arab lands that it did not want to relinquish , the Jewish state moved rapidly to the conservative right .
American Jews , formerly liberal supporters of the rights of others were persuaded that their number one priority was to support Israel .
Under this influence , they also moved rapidly to the right .
The Israeli Right and The Christian Right became strange bedfellows , each with a doctrine centered around Israel and a cult of land .
Nathan Perlmutter of the ADL explained why American Jews support the Christian Right in America : First he says , he feels himself a somewhat typical American Jew in that he weighs every issue in life by one measure : " Is it good for the Jews ?
This question satisfied , I proceed to the secondary issues . "
American Jews support Jerry Falwell because he supports the expansionist aims of Israel .
Perlmutter knows that evangelical - fundamentalists interpret Scripture as saying all Jews eventually must accept Jesus or be killed .
But , meanwhile , he says , " We need all the friends we have to support Israel ...
If the Messiah comes , on that day we 'll consider our options .
Meanwhile , let 's praise the Lord and pass the ammunition . "
Irving Kristol urges American Jews to support such as Falwell telling them that " in the real world " Jews are better off to back the Right , those that are strongly pro-Israel .
To be sure , he adds , yes fundamentalists preachers will say that God does not hear the prayer of a Jew .
But " after all , why should Jews care about the theology of a fundamentalist preacher when they do not for a moment believe that he speaks with any authority on the question of God 's attentiveness to human prayer ?
And what do such theological abstractions matter as against the mundane fact that the same preacher is vigorously pro-Israel ? "
Douglas Krieger , an evangelical lay leader of Denver , Colorado , closely connected with Terry Reisenhoover in raising money to eradicat the Al - Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem , early on urged Israel to work with and totally embrace evangelical - fundamentalist issues in exchange for their support of Israel .
In a lengthy anaysis paper prepared for Israeli and American Jewish leaders , Krieger points out that as a consequence of its wars of aggression , Israel faced two choices : to seek peac by withdrawing from " territory acquired by war , " or to continue reliance upon even greater military strength , i.e. the Christian Right controlled U.S.
If the Israelis took the second choice , which Krieger urged them to do ( as a millennialist he very much wants them to re-take all of Palestine and re-build the Temple ) , then the Israelis and American Jews would face the danger of an outbreak of anti-Semitism .
Because of Israel 's military seizure of Arab lands , " a rise of anti-Semitism could possibly surge in the West . "
This could be prevented , however , Krieger said , through its alliance with the New Christian Right .
He pointed out that Israel could use the evangelical - fundamentalists to project through their ( the Jews ' ) vast radio and television networks an image of Israel that Americans would like , accept and support .
Moeover , Krieger said , " The Religious Right could sell the Americans on the idea that God wanted a militant , militarized Israel .
And that the more militant Israel became , the more supportive and ecstatic in its support the U.S. Right would become .
Militant Zionist Jews and fundamentalist Christians have therefore formed an alliance that embraces the same dogma .
This dogma has nothing to do with spiritual values or living a good life as either a Christian or a Jew .
The alliance is about political power and worldly possessions .
It 's about one group of people physically taking sole possession of land holy to three faiths , occupied for two thousand years by a people that certainly resist their lands , their rights , and their lives being taken from them .
It is a dogma centered on a small political entity - Israel .
Both Israeli leaders and the Christian Right make ownership of land the highest priority in their lives , creating a cult religion - and each group is doing so cynically , for their own selfish reasons , expecting the other to be destroyed by their own hubris .
Dispensational beliefs reduce " the complex and diverse societies of Africa , Asia and the Middle East to walk - on roles as allies of Gog in God 's great end - time drama ... the consensus was clear : prophetic imperatives required the elimination of Arabs not only from ( Jerusalem ) but from most of the Middle East ...
They stood in the way of God 's promises to the Jews . " -- Paul Boyer , When Time Shall Be No More The Evangelical New Right ... systematically seized control of the leadership of the southern Baptist Convention , the largest Protestant denomination ... altering long - held theological positions for political advantage .
-- Sidney Blumentahal in The New Republic I do not know how many future generations we can count on before the Lord returns .
-- James Watt , U.S. secretary of the interior speaking before the House Interior Committee , in an apparent refutation to arguments for conserving natural resources .
President Reagan represented a dispensationalist view that since " Christ is at the door , " spending on domestic issues should not be taken too seriously .
" Most of Reagan 's policy decisions , " said James Mills , a former California state official , were based on his " literal interpretation of biblical prophecies . "
This led to Reagan 's idea that there was " no reason to get wrought up about the national debt if God is soon going to foreclose on the whole world . "
George W. Bush apparently has the same view .
Reagan 's support of gung - ho neo-conservatives can only be understood in the light of the president 's millennialist thinking .
" Why waste time and money preserving things for the future ?
Why be concerned about conservation ?
It follows that all domestic programs , especially those that entail capital outlay , can and should be curtailed to free up money to wage the War of Armageddon .
The Dispensationalists who preach Armageddon Theology are a relatively new cult - less than 200 years old .
There are four main aspects of their belief system :
1 ) They are anti-Semitic .
They profess a fervent love for Israel .
Their support of Israel does not , however , arise out of a true love for the Jews and their sufferings .
Rather , their " love and support " is based on their wanting Israel " in place " for the " Second Coming of Christ , " when they expect most Jews to be destroyed .
2 ) The Dispensationalists have a very narrow view of God and the six billion people on the planet .
They worship a tribal god who is only concerned with two peoples : Jews and Christians , who said tribal God intends to pit against one another for His favor .
The other five billion people on the planet are just not on this God 's radar except to be killed in the final battle .
3 ) The Dispensationalists are certain right down to their bones that they understand the Mind of God .
They provide a scenario , like a movie script , theat unfolds with time sequences , epochs or " dispensations " all ending happily with an end - time escapism called the Rapture - for a chosen few like themselves .
They appeal to those who want to feel that they are on the " inside " of a " special group " with secret , profound knowledge .
This desire for certitude causes millions of the followers of Dispensationalism to trust their leaders to an extraordinary degree .
4 ) Fatalism is the fourth aspect of Dispensationalists .
The world , they say , is getting steadily worse and we can do nothing , so there is no point in doing anything .
The teachers teach about the wrath of a vengeful god and declare that God does not want us to work for peace , that God demands that we wage a nuclear war : Armageddon that will destroy the planet .
The frightening by - product of these beliefs is that , since the Cult is in Power in the United States , it is so easy to create the very situations which are described , thus ensuring the fulfillment of the ideas of the Dispensationalists : the Cult that wants to Create Armageddon and needs 5 billion people on the planet to go willingly to the sacrificial altar , and the Muslims have been chosen to be first .
This is the the Most Dangerous Cult in the World .
You are visitor number .
Stellarium , a new planetarium software , enables users to view a realistic image of the night skies .
Apparently , Stellarium is more accurate than other similar programs , and since it is an open - source software , can be installed and used for free .
Those who are interested in astronomy as a hobby will probably enjoy the new software , as it offers a wide variety of sky views with an interactive interface .
Although more advanced users might require a more sophisticated program , Stellarium is a good option for beginners .
Those who have never looked at the sky through a telescope may even find the experience exhilarating .
After downloading a relatively small installation file ( about 9MB ) , users can effortlessly install the program and set up their global location using a virtual atlas or by entering the user ’s latitude and longitude .
Next , the users can set the level of detail to be displayed , at which point the real advantage of the program is revealed .
Stellarium uses a photo - realistic view , meaning that the display changes as the day goes by ; at noon , the user sees a photographed countryside horizon , with blue skies above and the Sun correctly positioned .
For instance , when looking to the south at midday , the Sun is situated directly in front of the user .
Other optional views include the Cardinal points ( North , South , West , East ) , drawings and names of constellations , and the Azimuthal and Equatorial grids – all of which can be toggled , of course .
A unique option enables toggling an ‘ atmosphere ’ , simulating a gradual darkening of the sky that causes the stars to “ come out ” .
The photo of the horizon , although very impressive , can be removed as well .
All these changes are very simple to make and one keystroke can easily change each parameter .
Another nice touch is the twinkling of the stars , which can also be set to a desired level .
Various objects displayed on the screen can be found by moving a set of cross hairs over an object and clicking on it .
The basic information about the chosen object appears in the top left corner of the screen and includes its name , the Hipparchus catalogue number , the RA , Dec , and magnitude .
If you click on a Messier object the M number ( the NGC number ) , the RA , the Dec , and the magnitude are displayed .
Unfortunately , the astronomical category of each object is not displayed ( cluster , nebula , galaxy , etc ) .
The realistic skies are rendered in real time using the openGL Protocol .
This open - source standard was developed alongside the implementation of GoTo systems , but there is no interface between the program and the collection of GoTo systems on the market .
Although some might consider this to be a disadvantage , it definitely does not affect the experience itself , as the high - quality photos seem very realistic .
TFOT recently covered Microsoft ’s WorldWide Telescope , which offers similar functions as Stellarium .
We have also reported on the detailed worldwide survey of candidate astronomical sites for the thirty - meter telescope .
Other related TFOT stories include a report on the 3D photo of Mars ’ Hebes Chasma and the IceCube , the largest telescope in the world , which was built under hundreds of feet of Polar ice .

Australian police will re-examine 7,000 crimes solved through DNA proof after a mistake forced detectives to free a suspect wrongly accused of murder .

REUTERS / Victoria Police / Handout
Police in the southern city of Melbourne withdrew charges against Russell John Gesah , accused in July of the 1984 murders of a 35 - year - old mother and her nine - year - old daughter .
“ It ’s obviously an embarrassment and we would rather not be in this position , ” Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Simon Overland was quoted as saying in Australian media on Thursday .
DNA is supposed to be the most accurate method of proving guilt through evidence samples taken at crime scenes , with the likelihood of matching genetic markers among people said to be around one in 7 billion or greater .
Police last month said a DNA sample taken from the murder scene , where Margaret Tapp was strangled and her daughter Seana raped and later killed , matched Gesah after comparison with 400,000 other DNA profiles on a national database .
Gesah was arrested and faced court , but a later check found the DNA evidence used against him was taken elsewhere and mistakenly tested with samples from the Tapp murder scene .
Overland said every crime solved by DNA in the state since the testing technology was introduced 20 years ago would now be reviewed to check no other bungles had occurred .
“ We need to refine our processes and our practices , and that is now happening as a result of this case , ” he said .
Victorian Law Institute spokesman Michael Brett Young said Gesah had been wrongfully painted as a villain because of police mistakes , possibly damaging public faith in the legal system at a time when corruption scandals were already undermining authorities .
“ Really he ’s been convicted in the court of public opinion due to the actions of the police and the media , ” Young said on Thursday .
Criminal lawyers said the mistake would almost guarantee future challenges to the accuracy of police DNA evidence .

You may not like the gift wrapping but the contents are what you wrote on your wish list : End the War , Bring the Troops Home Now , No War For Oil , No War For Israel .
Do Not Attack Iran , Restore The Constitution and The Rule of Law , No to The Patriot , Homeland Security , Military Commissions Acts and No to The Homegrown Terrorism Act , No To Torture , Rendition and Illegal Military Prisons and there 's even some extras that most of us would n't mind seeing like putting an end to the Illegal Federal Reserve and doing away with the illegal personal income tax on wages .
That all of these goodies happen to be the essence of Congressman Ron Paul 's , Republican Presidential candidate from Texas , campaign platform is surely a shock to any leftist 's / progressive 's system .
Ah be careful what you wish for , you just might get it ...
The only question is will you accept this gift ?
Perhaps the wrapping paper is n't right , perhaps there are some extra things in the box that do n't fit your political criteria but hey , it 's the thought that counts , is n't it ?
Even Dennis Kucinich seems to think so , there is so much buzz in cyberspace about the possibility of a Dennis Kucinich / Ron Paul ticket , it is stunning .
Dennis has even raised the prospect himself as has his wife Elisabeth .
Who ever thought we 'd see the day ?!
There is a larger point to be made here and perhaps the most important one and that is there is n't a whole lot of difference between the wants , needs and desires of the anti-war traditional conservatives and the anti-war leftists and progressives .
We just all need to get over ourselves .
If Dennis Kucinich would consider Ron Paul as a running mate is n't it time for the anti-war movement to dig a little deeper to see what is going on here ?...
( I have always supported Dennis Kucinich , whenever possible but after the 2004 Convention and his failure to stand up at the Convention against the war and support the peace activists who were hauled off the convention floor , with their anti-war signs , and given his inability to run a strong campaign , I can no longer back him .
I do respect his positions on many issues . )
A few radicals like myself have crossed over to support Ron Paul but far too many others have not .
Far too many from the left , far too many progressives and liberals and far too many anti-war activists have not .
We have so much in common but many on the left , progressives and liberals ridicule Ron Paul and his supporters .
They are so stuck in their positions , they do not see the monumental things we have in common .
For many on the left it is Ron Paul 's stance on abortion , or his stance on health care and the list goes on ...
But as we face another election year and perhaps the most critical and important election year , I ask what cause can be more important than the cause of PEACE ?
Without it , we have no chance at all .
For years , since the Bush regime stole power , we have all been looking for a Peace Candidate and now we have one .
The democrats have been co-opted and fail us at every turn .
The third party has been decimated , largely due to the democrats in 2004 and their fear mongering tactic of " vote democrat or else " .
And here we are again , facing another Presidential election at the most critical time of our country 's history and indeed the world and what have we to choose from ?
The same damn pot that calls the kettle black and they all want the same thing , they all have the same agenda and we are left with voting for the lesser of evils or not voting at all .
But what if all of the disenfranchised people got together , pulled their forces , their energy and supported a true candidate for Peace ?
Would Peace not then be possible ?
Are we to forever be held back by issues , such as abortion or even National Health Care , an issue that never gets delivered in the first place ( we are no closer now than we were way back when ) ?
These issues are by design .
Abortion keeps us divided .
National Health care keeps us hoping .
This is no ordinary election year .
This is our last real chance to try and get our country back on track and to prevent a third world war .
Will any of us risk losing this chance over our own personal issues versus the common purpose and the Universal good ?
We need to start somewhere and Ron Paul is a good place to start .
For me , supporting and voting for Ron Paul is the most ' radical ' thing I have ever done in my political life .
It is something I do with comfort and good conscience .
I support peace and I can only vote for a candidate who wants to stop this war and prevent a larger war from happening .
He has a tremendous groundswell of grassroots support , people from all walks of life , people from all over our country , giving of their time , their money , their hearts and their energy to support this man .
I have never seen nor experienced anything like this in my life !
I encourage leftists , progressives and the anti-war movement to check Ron Paul out for yourselves , Google him , watch his YouTube videos , listen to what he has to say and how he says it .
Ron Paul is the Peace candidate we 've all been looking for .
He answers to the people , not corporate or political lobbies .
Perhaps the Ron Paul Revolution is best defined in his own words :
He is honored to be a part of our revolution .
I appeal to all of you to consider this .
To think about it , process it , digest it , meditate on it do whatever but above all find the higher meaning .

Enthusiast compositions of the Huygens images 16 january 2005
Since the images of the Cassini - Huygens probe -- descending to Titan ( moon of Saturn ) -- have been published on the net , the people in IRC channel # space on irc.freenode .
net have processed these raw images into amateur compositions and mosaics , rendering an image of Titan .
Note that , since we are enthusiasts and not professionals , we are not responsible for the correctness of these images .
This page summarizes the initial enthusiast results ( click the thumbnails for full sized versions ) .
For more recent , higher quality compositions , visit the web site of Rene Pascal .
More enthusiast compositions are available from Daniel Crotty and Christian Waldvogel .
NASA , ESA and JPL have more pictures of Titan , Saturn , and the Cassini - Huygens mission .
All images are copyrighted ESA , NASA , JPL , university of Arizona and their respective compositors .
These images are here to give you an impression of Titan , and are not suited to be adopted as a scientific basis .
Please mirror the images when you want to include them in your forum , blog , web page ...
We do not allow deep linking .
Fully stitched panoramas
Christian Waldvogel created full panoramas of the Titan surface , one normal and a polar view .
This submission is really awesome !
( added Jan 15 2005 22:05 CET , colored version added Jan 16 2005 18:54 )
Composite of a 360 - degrees view during descent , using 11 of the raw images .
the raw images were corrected in brightness , scale and perspective and then stitched together .
Missing areas on dark bottom and sky were completed with two - color - gradients .
No information was added .
Colors in the colored version were adjusted according to the ESA / NASA 's colored surface view .
Cartesian - to - polar - coordinate converted version of the composite panorama .
This image shows a fish - eye - like 360 degrees view , as if the probe was looking downwards with a very wide lens .
There are numerous reports online of the correctness of the panoramas released by ESA / NASA , as can be seen for example here .
I 'm sure better panoramas will be published during the press conference ESA is giving on Friday morning .
René Pascal has been working on aligning the images , that make up the panoramas , correctly in order to make the most correct panorama to date .
Make sure you have a look at his site , with all the information .
Mosaics of views looking straight down
Big mosaics
Jakub Friedl combined the mosaics from below to create a full map of the environment where Huygens landed .
Currently , the mosaic lacks some details , and is not completely correct , but hints of what there is to come from ESA .
The biggest problem in stitching the two mosaics from below together was the accumulation of errors when creating those two mosaics , which did n't allow them to fit in nicely .
The current result is , however , very interesting , as it shows a lot of detail , and very differing lanscape terrain in each other 's neighborhood .
You may want to compare this mosaic with ESA 's mosaic of the landscape ) and find the differences .
( added Jan 17 2005 04:32 CET )
Ricardo Nunes sent in a big mosaic ( partly based on the images below ) of the area where Huygens has landed ( added Jan 16 2005 15:30 CET )
Daniel Crotty also created a big mosaic , and he 's working toward connecting these two mosaics ( added Jan 16 2005 16:52 CET )
Daniel also started fromscratch working on a more correct mosaic of the environment , creating a new mosaic which consists of 40 images
River systems by the shoreline
Mosaics by Daniel Crotty of descent images , showing a shoreline and a strange delta or river system ( it does n't seem like a delta as the flow seems to go the other way ) .
The pictures are taken from about 16 kilometers altitude .
The smallest visible features have a size of about 40 meters .
It is assumed that the dark region is a " sea " or " lake " of some kind , and the lighter surface is not .
Howeverm we are currently not aware if there is any knowledge of the composition of either lighter and darker plains .
( added Jan 15 2005 03:50 CET )
I have bumpmapped the image for clearer details : ( the " craters " you might see are photographing artefacts that only seem to be craters ) ( added Jan 15 2005 04:32 CET )
Marco Papi created a rendering of the delta structure .
( added Jan 16 2005 14:23 CET )
Context of the river system
Context of the delta , also by Daniel ( added Jan 15 2005 03:50 CET )
Rupert Scammell bump mapped the above image to better show the features .
( added Jan 15 2005 04:08 CET )
Detail and context combined
I have combined these two images into one , insetting the detailed into the context .
( added Jan 15 2005 09:42 CET )
Panoramic mosaic
Mosaic by Kevin Dawson , I have enhanced it for color / brightness ( added Jan 15 2005 03:29 CET )
We are wondering about the " airstrip " on the left
The " airstrip " feature can be seen from pictures from above too , and shows how the " airstrip " is part of a river system ( added Jan 16 2005 13:13 CET )
Points of reference between panoramic and mosaics
Kevin found references between the mosaic and the panoramic view , as indicated by the following image ( added Jan 15 2005 04:23 CET )
Titan rendered
Mike Zawistowski has created a 3D rendering of Titan to provide us with an approximate rendering of what Titan might look like , based on the actual data , created with Terragen .
Note that the coloring in the following image is a complete guess , the 3D terrain is based on the Titan data .
( added Jan 16 2005 13:52 CET )
The following is a second attempt , with a better , more realistic color scheme ( added Jan 17 2005 00:06 CET )
The viewpoint used in these images is given by the following image ( added Jan 17 2005 00:06 CET )
The following rendering has a different viewpoint ( added Jan 19 2004 22:32 CET )
Stereo images
Stereoptic
Kevin also noticed that some of the images have been taken within a short time interval .
He has selected two images that you can use to view Titan in stereo .
Look at the following image , but focus your eyes such that the images collide into a new , 3d image .
You 'll see that the dark mountain range in the middle of the image sits in front the of the other mountains behind it .
( added Jan 15 2005 06:30 CET )
3D red /blue anaglyph
An anonymous submitter has sent in the following anaglyph , so you can view titan with red / blue glasses , in stereo : ( added Jan 15 2005 10:46 CET )
Animations
Animation of images of the surface
This animated gif flicks through the images of the surface of Titan and contains some strange artefacts .
Near the end of the loop a vague " blob " jumps into camera view .
We can only guess at what it is .
Maybe a rain drop .
Or snow .
Or it 's an artefact of the compression algorithms used .
Maybe the space agencies know what it is , and tell us at their press conference .

About
How ?
This work has been done by amateurs with no extensive scientific background , publishing the first images in under 8 hours .
We 'll have to wait for ESA / NASA / U of Az to deliver us the correct images , so please , take the resulting images on this page with a grain of salt ( that was a disclaimer ) .
We have shown , however , to be able to bring composited images online earlier than ESA / NASA / U of Az !
It was an amazing night , these results have been gathered in about 8 hours time starting with the raw images and having no idea of what to expect , or what goals to reach .
The images that have been used are the same images that ESA / NASA / U of Az is using , and we expect that the resulting images created by the professionals will be more extensive than those on this page , but they will be based on the same quality raw images as used in the pictures below , so do not expect higher resolutions from ESA / NASA / U of Az .
The images have been taken with a 660 nm - 1000nm filter , with the DISR ( Descent Imager / Spectral Radiometer ) experiment on board Huygens during descent and after touch down .
No other information was available that could have been entered into the results below .
ESA / NASA / U of Az can combine these results of various experiments .
Mosaics and compositions created by ESA / NASA / U of Az can be found here .

ESA and open source
In an article of Der Spiegel Online , a spokesperson of ESA confirms that this publication of raw images , to allow open source editing and compositing , is part of a study by ESA to see if the publication of the raws is indeed a good strategy .
NASA has been successfully publishing raw images of the MER project online , and ESA is now testing this " open culture " too .
I have contacted the organizations for their stand point this topic , and as long as copyright notices of ESA / NASA / JPL / University of Arizona are kept , this work is legit .

The likelihood that the U.S. is in a recession appeared to increase Friday , following weeks of hopes that the country might be skirting one .
Unemployment rose sharply and payrolls shrank for the fifth consecutive month .
The economy news came on a day that oil surged to record prices , the dollar weakened and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 400 points .
The deteriorating job numbers led markets to scale back the odds that the Federal Reserve will boost short - term interest rates this fall to ward off inflation .

We have n't mentioned it on the site , but air quality throughout the state of California is really bad right now .
There is a thick brown haze due to the enormous number of fires up and down the state , making it difficult for asthmatics like me to breathe easily , and it 's been this way for weeks .
Naturally , the wildfires came up during the Governator 's interview with George Stephanopoulos on This Week and Ahnold took the opportunity to criticize two Republican administrations and praise Jimmy Carter for his foresight on developing an energy independence program and efficiently negated McCain 's offshore drilling advocacy as a lot of hooey .
SCHWARZENEGGER : ( I ) t just really means basically this administration did not believe in global warming , or they did not believe that they should do anything about it since China is not doing anything about it and since India is not willing to do the same thing , so why should we do the same thing ?
But that 's not how we put a man on the moon .
We did not say let everyone else do the same thing , then we will do it .
We said we want to be the pioneers , we want to be out there in front . [ snip ]
Anyone that tells you that drilling , nuclear power , alternative fuels , fuel cells , solar , all of those things will bring down the price right now , I think is pulling wool over your eyes , because we know that all of those would take at least 10 years .
But that should not mean that we should not do those things , because here is the important thing .
What 's the biggest problem in America ?
It 's not that we do n't have any ideas .
It 's just that we are not consistent , that we have Jimmy Carter in the late ' 70s that came in with a great energy policy , talked about shale oil exploration , giving tax credits for people that were investing in windmills and in solar and all of those things .
Then President Reagan came in and scrapped the whole thing , because the oil price came down and says , " Well , this does n't make any sense financially . "
There were many countries all over the world that stayed with the program , that said , " We are going to continue , " even thought the oil price comes down .
In Germany with solar , for 30 years they 've been working on that , and they 're now number one in solar , number one .
I think that 's what we need to do .
We need to stay the course .
Full transcript below the fold
SCHWARZENEGGER : This is an extraordinary kind of a situation .
We have never had 1,728 fires in one given time , because of the lightning and because of the -- you know , that struck down on various different areas in California , and because of very dry weather , a lot of wind and tremendous heat .
All of this is kind of the perfect storm for those kinds of fires .
So we had fires up and down the state , and , of course , we 're prepared to fight maybe 30 - 40 fires at any given time , which we have done in the past successfully , but not 1,700 fires .
That 's why we have asked the federal government right away for help .
We have gotten great cooperation from the federal government , but we have told them that this is not a temporary thing , that if you 're not anymore for the sprint , we are now there for the marathon , because we see that fire season that used to be from the end of summer through fall now is an all year round fire season .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
How much of that is due , do you think , to global warming , to climate change ?
SCHWARZENEGGER : Well , it 's very hard to say .
I mean , one thing we know for sure , and that is we have had a drought for two years in a row now .
We have a lack of water here in California , which is very important , why we need to redo our infrastructure and rebuild our water system again in California .
And I think that we just have to be aware of those changes .
I 'm sure , partially , that it has something to do with global warming , also , because we have just now broken a record .
I think that in modern history in California , we have never had this kind of size of fire and up and down , 725,000 acres of land has burned so far .
This is the most ever .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And yet we read front page of the Washington Post this morning , President Bush 's EPA is going to take no more actions this year during his presidency to stop global warming emissions .
SCHWARZENEGGER : Well , to be honest with you , if they would have done something this year , I would have thought it was bogus anyway .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Why ?
SCHWARZENEGGER : Well , because you do n't change global warming and you do n't really have an effect by doing something six months before you leave office .
I mean , that is ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : Does n't every bit help ?
SCHWARZENEGGER : No , it does n't sound to me believable at all .
The sincerity is not there .
I think that the way they have done it is much better , because it just really means basically this administration did not believe in global warming , or they did not believe that they should do anything about it since China is not doing anything about it and since India is not willing to do the same thing , so why should we do the same thing ?
But that 's not how we put a man on the moon .
We did not say let everyone else do the same thing , then we will do it .
We said we want to be the pioneers , we want to be out there in front .
And we are out there in front when it comes to stem cell research .
We 're out there in front when it comes to high technology and biotechnology , with our university systems .
I think we have a good opportunity to do the same thing , also , with fighting global warming .
And that 's why I 'm very happy that California is in the forefront on that .
We are very aggressive .
We have made a commitment to roll back our greenhouse gas emissions to the 1990 level .
And because of it being the most important state in the union , we were able to reach out and to get a lot of partners to join us , and we have had many other states join us , even provinces of other countries like Canada and so on join us , and now we 've made agreements with European countries .
We did n't wait for Washington .
I just felt that the administration and the federal government have been terrific partners in a lot of things for us and we have worked together very well .
But environmental issues was not one of them .
STEPHANOPOULOS : President Bush is out today .
He 's at the Department of Energy today , saying we have to be out in front on finding more energy resources here in the United States .
BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH : One of the things we just went through is a briefing from Secretary Bodman and Secretary Kempthorne about the vast potential of crude oil reserves on offshore lands , as well as in Alaska , as well as in oil shale in the western part of our country .
END VIDEO CLIP )
SCHWARZENEGGER : I have no interest in offshore drilling off the state of California .
People can do it wherever they want , and I think that that 's what McCain made clear when he talked about it , that he would give the rights to the state .
And he can give the rights to the states , but we in California say , " Thank you for giving us the rights , but , no , we have no interest in doing offshore drilling , " because we want to protect our coasts .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And that 's more important than bringing down the price of gas , bringing down the price of oil .
SCHWARZENEGGER : First of all , let me just make it clear .
Anyone that tells you that drilling , nuclear power , alternative fuels , fuel cells , solar , all of those things will bring down the price right now , I think is pulling wool over your eyes , because we know that all of those would take at least 10 years .
But that should not mean that we should not do those things , because here is the important thing .
What 's the biggest problem in America ?
It 's not that we do n't have any ideas .
It 's just that we are not consistent , that we have Jimmy Carter in the late ' 70s that came in with a great energy policy , talked about shale oil exploration , giving tax credits for people that were investing in windmills and in solar and all of those things .
Then President Reagan came in and scrapped the whole thing , because the oil price came down and says , " Well , this does n't make any sense financially . "
There were many countries all over the world that stayed with the program , that said , " We are going to continue , " even thought the oil price comes down .
In Germany with solar , for 30 years they 've been working on that , and they 're now number one in solar , number one .
I think that 's what we need to do .
We need to stay the course .
We 've got to go and say , " Here 's the plan .
This is how we get energy independent . "
We need to have renewables .
We need to have nuclear power , we need to do the drilling , we need to do the alternative fuels .
All of those kind of things , let 's do research and all this , but let 's never go off course , no matter who the administration is and what the oil price is .
Let 's stay on course .
That is the big problem in America .
Decision on Michigan , Florida delegates
Democratic Party establishment lines up behind Obama
By Patrick Martin
2 June 2008
A panel of Democratic Party leaders came down on the side of Barack Obama , the frontrunner for party ’s presidential nomination , in a battle with supporters of Hillary Clinton over how to seat delegates to the presidential nominating convention from two contested states .
The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee voted to seat full delegations from Michigan and Florida , but to give each delegate only half a vote rather than a full vote , the penalty imposed because the two state parties violated national party rules by scheduling their primaries too early .
The agreement to seat the Michigan and Florida delegations with half - votes means that 4,235 delegate - votes will be cast at the Democratic convention , raising the total required for a majority from 2,026 to 2,118 .
After the allocation of the two states delegates , Obama had 2,057 to Clinton ’s 1877 , leaving him only 61 delegates short of the nomination .
While Clinton won Sunday ’s primary in Puerto Rico easily , taking two - thirds of the vote in an extremely low turnout , Obama picked up at least 14 more delegates there , out of a total of 55 .
He is expected to win a narrow majority of the 31 delegates to be selected Tuesday in South Dakota and Montana , and enough votes from as - yet - uncommitted superdelegates to claim the nomination by Wednesday .
Clinton ’s principal spokesman on the rules committee , campaign adviser Harold Ickes , denounced the Michigan decision bitterly and declared that Clinton reserved the right to challenge the action at the national convention in Denver .
However , Howard Wolfson , a top Clinton advisor , suggested to the New York Times that the campaign has no stomach for taking the fight to Denver .
“ Our focus is on securing the nomination for ourselves in the near term , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think anybody is looking toward the convention to end this process . ”
The Democratic Party establishment by - and - large rallied to Obama .
After the committee meeting , a parade of top Democrats announced their support for its decisions , including DNC chairman Howard Dean and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Pelosi suggested that Obama would likely clinch the nomination June 3 .
There was an enormous degree of political posturing over the rules committee hearing .
All of the Democratic presidential candidates had supported the national party in the dispute and agreed not to campaign in either state .
Clinton declared last fall that any votes cast in either state primary “ would not count , ” but she reversed herself after falling behind Obama in the race for delegates in February .
Clinton had won both states , taking 50 percent of the vote in Florida compared to 33 percent for Obama and 16 percent for John Edwards , who was still in the race at the time of January 29 primary .
She won 55 percent of the January 15 vote in Michigan , while 40 percent voted for an unpledged slate , the only alternative available for Obama or Edwards supporters since both candidates had taken their names off the ballot .
Under rules approved by the Democratic National Committee last year , the two state parties were to be penalized by the loss of all their delegates to the convention , 300 pledged and 67 unpledged , for a total of 367 .
Each state party appealed and the Rules and Bylaws Committee heard arguments on Saturday and then made its decision .
In each case , the state party organizations proposed a penalty of the loss of half their votes — the same penalty imposed by the Republican National Committee on its Michigan and Florida delegations — rather than a reduction to zero .
The Obama campaign backed this approach , since it cut Clinton ’s delegate margin in the two states by half .
Clinton supporters initially sought to seat the Florida delegates with full votes , eliminating any penalty , but this was defeated by a 15 - 12 vote on the Rules and Bylaws Committee .
This was followed by a unanimous 27 - 0 vote to seat Florida with half votes , with the delegates divided among Clinton , Obama and Edwards according to the primary results .
The case of Michigan produced protracted wrangling over how to divide up the state ’s 128 pledged delegates ( who will cast 64 total votes ) , because Obama ’s name was not on the ballot .
There were three different plans .
The Clinton campaign demanded 73 delegates based on its share of the popular vote , with the remaining 55 delegates unpledged rather than awarded to Obama .
The Obama campaign proposed an even split of the delegation , 64 for each campaign , essentially arguing that the primary was invalid .
The Michigan state party — where Clinton ’s supporters outnumbered Obama ’s — proposed a compromise between the two , with 69 delegates for Clinton and 59 for Obama .
This was the plan adopted , by a 19 - 8 vote of the rules committee .
Since 13 of the members of the rules committee are publicly committed to support Clinton for the nomination , this result was a debacle for her campaign .
At least five of her own supporters refused to back her position on Michigan .
According to several members of the rules committee , Obama supporters on the committee actually had a narrow majority for their plan to split the Michigan delegation 50 - 50 , but decided to make an overture to the Michigan state party by accepting its plan instead .
The decisiveness of Clinton ’s defeat is indicated in the following figures : Clinton ’s initial demand , for full votes for both states and denying the uncommitted Michigan vote to Obama , would have given her a net gain of 111 delegates .
Obama ’s initial position , half votes for both states , and a 50 - 50 split in Michigan , would have left Clinton a net gain of 19 delegates .
The actual result hewed very closely to the Obama position , giving Clinton a net gain of only 24 delegates , far too little to change the outcome of the race .
The prominent Democrats on the rules committee who sided with Obama Saturday included former national chairman Don Fowler of South Carolina , a Clinton supporter ; former Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman ( in the Bill Clinton administration ) , who chaired the committee ; James Roosevelt , grandson of President Franklin Roosevelt , the committee co-chair ; and Donna Brazile , the campaign manager for Al Gore in 2000 .
The last three are still formally uncommitted .
The usually obscure rules panel met under conditions of unprecedented media attention , largely because of the spurious and demagogic effort by the Clinton campaign to suggest that enforcing party rules to which she herself had agreed was the equivalent of the Republican Party ’s theft of the 2000 presidential election in Florida .
In a series of campaign appearances in Florida leading up to the rules committee hearing , Clinton outlandishly compared her demand for delegates to the civil rights movement , the nineteenth century struggle for the abolition of slavery , and the current political crisis over the presidential election in Zimbabwe .
The only similarity between the 2008 primary dispute and the 2000 presidential vote is the geographic accident that Florida is involved in both cases — a fact that was flogged endlessly by the same Democratic politicians who capitulated spinelessly to the electoral coup by the Supreme Court and the Republican Party in 2000 .
Moreover , Clinton was using the “ every vote counts ” mantra to justify a primary election in Michigan in which Democratic voters had no alternatives because her main rivals were not even listed on the ballot .
There were no issues of democratic principle involved in this internecine conflict , which simply confirms Clinton ’s defeat and the coalescing of the Democratic Party apparatus behind the Obama campaign .
@ Fierock :
The minimalist movement did a very similar thing claiming art in the most simplistic of ideas .
Marcel Duchamp's " Fountain " was merely a urinal in a new location ( an art exibition ) and the only change he made to it was to sign it !
I love art ... but I have to admit the minimalist movement has always irked me just a bit .
Actually make something that is art worthy !
Pick up a brush ... actually send a gps tracked package all over the world and see what you come up with !
but at least take it beyond the idea .
The World of Western RPGs
Introduction
This article is a sequel of sorts to the previous RPG article , by Oleg Roschin , which covered the Asian RPGs .
In this article I try to paint a picture of the evolution of Western RPGs , using only a handful of games , which I describe in some detail to see what game introduced what to the genre .
If you are for some reason a hardcore fan of some obscure title from the 80's that was made by a poor , blind , black kid from Oklahoma , a game so innovative that it had Porcs instead of Orcs , and that poor blind , black kid then died in poverty all alone and forgotten , with only two copies of his game known to exist , you will hate this article .
Lame attempts at jokes aside , it was not my goal to write the most detailed RPG article out there .
Rather think of it as a self - help book : " Things that you need to know about RPGs when surrounded by evil nerds intent on defending their knowledge with a 20 - sided dice . "
But first – what is an RPG ?
Well to be honest , RPG is a fuzzy term - like immersion , next - gen or mature - that can be used to describe almost anything .
In almost any game , players take on a role .
There is a lot of confusion surrounding the term , to the point where some people out there believe Halo 3 is an RPG .
It is just that throughout the history of RPGs , a wide variety of different games ( different on a fundamental level ) have used the term .
This is also actually something that differentiates Japanese RPGs and Western RPGs for me .
Maybe I am blind but Japanese RPGs usually are rather similar – compare any recent JRPG like Lost Odyssey to the first Dragon Quest and you will probably see more similarities that differences – while with Western RPGs you have dungeon crawlers , story RPGs and simulated worlds that all are fundamentally different from each other .
Take any Bethesda or any BioWare game and it is clear that these two major developers of today 's WRPG world offer something strikingly different – the first one concentrates on exploration in open - ended worlds while the other presents epic stories with good and evil choices .
And so it has been since the early days .
As I said , I am going to paint my picture of the evolution of RPGs , meaning that I will generalize and subjectively select facts ( though I will mention when I am about to deny the existence of something ) and the point of this article is really to help the reader acquire knowledge on the history of the genre .
But what made me pick these particular games ?
Especially considering that the term " RPG " is so fuzzy that it could mean anything .
Well , I speak with the dead .
So stop asking stupid questions .

Future Combat Systems , an Army initiative entailing a vast combat - gear overhaul whose total cost could exceed $ 200 billion , “ must continue to demonstrate its value for the types of irregular challenges we will face , ” as well as for the full - blown land warfare for which it was designed , Mr. Gates said .
The secretary defended his order to accelerate production of heavily armored mine - resistant troop transports for use in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Even at $ 1 million each , he said , the vehicles have proved their value by saving lives of American military personnel from improvised explosives and suicide bombings , which Mr. Gates described as “ the weapon of choice for America ’s most dangerous and likely adversaries . ”
Addressing those who question whether the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan has left the Army stretched to the breaking point and the nation unprepared for other conflicts , he acknowledged that “ it is true that we would be hard pressed to launch a major conventional ground operation elsewhere in the world at this time . ”
But he warned any adversary against thinking that the United States had dropped its guard , saying that while the Army and the Marines carried the brunt of the nation ’s current combat effort , the Air Force and the Navy would be “ America ’s main strategic deterrent ” against potential adversaries like Iran , North Korea and China .
He called for careful spending to modernize and expand both of these services .
Mr. Gates ’s views may not prevail beyond the end of the Bush administration , but the next president will face the same competing military priorities , while the services can be expected to renew their push for their favorite weapons programs .
While disagreeing on what to do about the war in Iraq , Senators Barack Obama and John McCain have both said they would expand the number of soldiers and marines , and ensure that ground forces are properly equipped and trained for fighting insurgencies and terrorists .

House leader Rangel calls for ethics probe on himself Nick Langewis
Published : Wednesday July 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Charles Rangel ( D - NY ) , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , has an ethics complaint ... against himself .
As promised Tuesday , Rangel requested that the House open a probe into whether he " inadvertently failed to comply with House Ethics Rules regarding the use of congressional letterhead " in June 2005 and March 2007 to arrange talks with charity leaders and the business community regarding possible donations to the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York .
Rangel , 78 , secured a $ 1.9 million earmark , with the ultimate fundraising goal being $ 30 million , last year .
" Rangel , who is unbeatable ( if not untouchable ) in his district , hopes to use the Democrat - led Ethics Committee probe to clear his name in the aftermath of a [ July 16th ] Washington
Post article that raised questions about the matter , " the New York Daily News charged Wednesday .
" Was my hope that these meetings would result in making financial donations to this important project with such an important public purpose ? "
Rangel wrote .
" Of course . "
The letter , nine pages in all , is considered by Public Citizen 's Craig Holman to be a possible smokescreen to distract the House ethics committee from Rangel 's use of a rent - controlled apartment in Harlem 's Lenox Terrace building as office space , a violation of city regulations .
Rangel has a total of four rent - controlled apartments in New York City , and most citizens are n't allowed more than one .
" If members of the ethics committee opt to investigate only the contents of Rangels letter , they will not be doing their jobs , " Holman told The Hill .
" This is far more serious than the misuse of congressional office materials , because it shows a pattern , on the part of the owners of the apartment complex , of giving out gifts to public officials as a means of influence - peddling . "
The mission of the Charles B. Rangel Center is to attract youth from varying racial and economic backgrounds into careers within government and non-profit organizations .
While about 30 % of the United States population is non-white , the Center 's mission statement reads , studies indicated that 14 % of top positions in federal agencies were held by non-white people , as were 17 % of senior leadership positions in legislative branch agencies .
" The Charles B. Rangel Center at City College , " the statement goes on , " is committed to helping ensure that those who run our nation will better reflect our citizenry . "
As the Center will also serve as an archive for records from Rangel 's political career as well as provide him with office space after he retires , donations could be considered a personal financial gain for him .
A group of researchers led by Hongjie Dai , Professor of Chemistry at Stanford University , have developed a new technique for making transistors out of carbon nanoribbons .
The new “ field - effect transistors ” are a critical component of computer chips and are made with graphene that operates at room temperature .
Previous graphene transistors , fitted with wider nanoribbons or thinner films , required much lower temperatures , which called for constant cooling .
These transistors could someday be integrated into high - performance computer chips to increase their speed and generate less heat , which can damage today ’s silicon - based chips .

Dai ’s group made an important breakthrough when they succeeded in making graphene nanoribbons less than 10 nanometers wide .
These thin graphene nanoribbons can operate at higher temperatures than previous grapheme chips .
As silicon chips shrink all the time ( according to Moore ’s Law , the number of transistors on a chip will double every two years ) , researchers predict that they will reach their maximum shrinking point within the next decade .
This has prompted a search for materials to replace silicon , and graphene is one of the more popular materials being considered .
Researchers , including Dai himself , have expressed the opinion that graphene could supplement but not replace silicon , helping meet the demand for ever - smaller transistors and faster processing .

Additionally , researchers , including those in Dai ’s own group , have shown that carbon nanotubes outperform silicon in speed by a factor of two .
The problem is that not all of the tubes , which can have 1 - nanometer diameters , are semiconducting , according to Dai .
On the other hand , Dai ’s team demonstrated that all of their narrow graphene nanoribbons made from their novel chemical technique are semiconductors .
“ This is why structure at the atomic scale – in this case , width and edges – matters , ” he said .
TFOT recently covered IBM ’s advanced graphite processor technology as well as graphene paper and a nano switch that may hint at future chips .

DEAR FELLOW feminists ,
Yes , I qualify .
Like some of you , I grew up in an era where a woman president was an impossibility , where there were no women doctors , few women in positions of power , no women professors .
I went to a coeducational college , where , although women got higher grades than men , we never directed plays , edited the newspaper , or were allowed to lead an organization .
We washed dishes regularly in our dorms , while our fellow male students had maids clean their rooms for them .
We had male professors who openly derided the idea of women scientists .
We graduated and became secretaries ; the men graduated and became reporters for The New York Times .
I raised my son when there was no child care , was raped before there were rape crisis centers or anyone to talk to .
I get it .
I marched for women 's rights , helped found the first feminist group in Cambridge , and like some of you , danced for joy when Geraldine Ferraro was nominated for vice president .
But I also grew up in an era when an African - American president was an impossibility , when African - Americans in the South were shot for having the temerity to vote .
I worked for civil rights , registered black voters .
Later , I witnessed busing in Boston , where angry white mobs stoned school buses filled with terrified black children , where people of color were never in power .
I get it .
I support Barack Obama for president .
It 's OK that you have supported Hillary Clinton .
I get it , I really do .
What I do n't get , ca n't get , is seeing some of you riled up Clinton supporters threatening to vote for McCain .
Let me get this straight ; you consider yourself a Democrat and a feminist .
Yet rather than vote for a man who supports a woman 's right to choose , children 's healthcare , and an end to the war in Iraq , you would vote for a man who voted against all of these things .
You would vote for a man who is promising to nominate far - right activists for the Supreme Court , a man who votes consistently against choice , affirmative action , and workers ' rights .
You would vote for a man who supports President Bush on most major issues vs. a man whose positions are quite similar to Clinton's .
I just do n't get it .
Obama followed the rules , took his name off the ballot in Michigan , and did n't campaign in Florida or the Great Lakes State when his party told him not to .
Meanwhile Clinton , who said at the time that those votes " should n't count " ended up yelling that they should .
Obama has generally taken the high road ; he has criticized some of Clinton 's policies , but never sunk to the level of personal attack as her campaign has done , playing on race and questioning his patriotism .
He never mentioned that the Clintons consulted the Rev. Jeremiah Wright over their marital problems , at a time when she was attacking him for his association with Wright .
He started out with less money , less support from party insiders , less name recognition , and he won .
Yet you are so angry at him , you would rather vote for a man who would deny health insurance to your children ?
A man who would send your children to die in an endless war ?
OK , you would dance in the streets to have a woman president .
I would dance in the streets to have a woman or an African - American president .
Both of these would show us something dramatically changed about America .
Most of all , I want a president with integrity , and to me , Barack Obama is that candidate .
OK , you 're deeply aggrieved that your candidate , who you think is entitled to the nomination , seems to have lost to someone who played fair and won .
I say , get over it .
Sometimes your candidate loses .
( My candidates almost always lose ) .
Then , you vote for the next best candidate .
You do n't pout and whine and vote for somebody you really do n't believe in .
You do n't stamp your feet and refuse to vote .
In short , you grow up .

Robert Sapolsky discusses physiological effects of stress
' We ’ve evolved to be smart enough to make ourselves sick '
Lisa Share Robert Sapolsky carries a tranquilized baboon .
Why do humans and their primate cousins get more stress - related diseases than any other member of the animal kingdom ?
The answer , says Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky , is that people , apes and monkeys are highly intelligent , social creatures with far too much spare time on their hands .
" Primates are super smart and organized just enough to devote their free time to being miserable to each other and stressing each other out , " he said .
" But if you get chronically , psychosocially stressed , you 're going to compromise your health .
So , essentially , we 've evolved to be smart enough to make ourselves sick . "
A professor of biological sciences and of neurology and neurological sciences , Sapolsky has spent more than three decades studying the physiological effects of stress on health .
His pioneering work includes ongoing studies of laboratory rats and wild baboons in the African wilderness .
Sapolsky discussed the biological and sociological implications of stress at a Feb. 17 lecture at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco and in a recent interview with Stanford Report .
Stress response
All vertebrates respond to stressful situations by releasing hormones , such as adrenalin and glucocorticoids , which instantaneously increase the animal 's heart rate and energy level .
" The stress response is incredibly ancient evolutionarily , " Sapolsky said .
" Fish , birds and reptiles secrete the same stress hormones we do , yet their metabolism does n't get messed up the way it does in people and other primates . "
To understand why , he said , " just look at the dichotomy between what your body does during real stress — for example , something is intent on eating you and you 're running for your life — versus what your body does when you 're turning on the same stress response for months on end for purely psychosocial reasons . "
In the short term , he explained , stress hormones are " brilliantly adapted " to help you survive an unexpected threat .
" You mobilize energy in your thigh muscles , you increase your blood pressure and you turn off everything that 's not essential to surviving , such as digestion , growth and reproduction , " he said .
" You think more clearly , and certain aspects of learning and memory are enhanced .
All of that is spectacularly adapted if you 're dealing with an acute physical stressor — a real one . "
But non-life - threatening stressors , such as constantly worrying about money or pleasing your boss , also trigger the release of adrenalin and other stress hormones , which , over time , can have devastating consequences to your health , he said : " If you turn on the stress response chronically for purely psychological reasons , you increase your risk of adult onset diabetes and high blood pressure .
If you 're chronically shutting down the digestive system , there 's a bunch of gastrointestinal disorders you 're more at risk for as well . "
In children , the continual release of glucocorticoids can suppress the secretion of normal growth hormones .
" There 's actually a syndrome called stress dwarfism in kids who are so psychologically stressed that growth is markedly impaired , " Sapolsky said .
Studies show that long - term stress also suppresses the immune system , making you more susceptible to infectious diseases , and can even shut down reproduction by causing erectile dysfunction and disrupting menstrual cycles .
" Furthermore , if you 're chronically stressed , all sorts of aspects of brain function are impaired , including , at an extreme , making it harder for some neurons to survive neurological insults , " Sapolsky added .
" Also , neurons in the parts of the brain relating to learning , memory and judgment do n't function as well under stress .
That particular piece is what my lab has spent the last 20 years on . "
The bottom line , according to Sapolsky : " If you plan to get stressed like a normal mammal , you had better turn on the stress response or else you 're dead .
But if you get chronically , psychosocially stressed , like a Westernized human , then you are more at risk for heart disease and some of the other leading causes of death in Westernized life . "
Baboon studies
In addition to numerous scientific papers about stress , Sapolsky has written four popular books on the subject —
Why Zebras Do n't Get Ulcers , The Trouble with Testosterone , A Primate 's Memoir and Monkeyluv .
Many of his insights are based on his 30 - year field study of wild African baboons , highly social primates that are close relatives of Homo sapiens .
Each year , he and his assistants follow troops of baboons in Kenya to gather behavioral and physiological data on individual members , including blood samples , tissue biopsies and electrocardiograms .
" We 've found that baboons have diseases that other social mammals generally do n't have , " Sapolsky said .
" If you 're a gazelle , you do n't have a very complex emotional life , despite being a social species .
But primates are just smart enough that they can think their bodies into working differently .
It 's not until you get to primates that you get things that look like depression . "
The same may be true for elephants , whales and other highly intelligent mammals that have complex emotional lives , he added .
" The reason baboons are such good models is , like us , they do n't have real stressors , " he said .
" If you live in a baboon troop in the Serengeti , you only have to work three hours a day for your calories , and predators do n't mess with you much .
What that means is you 've got nine hours of free time every day to devote to generating psychological stress toward other animals in your troop .
So the baboon is a wonderful model for living well enough and long enough to pay the price for all the social - stressor nonsense that they create for each other .
They 're just like us :
They 're not getting done in by predators and famines , they 're getting done in by each other . "
It turns out that unhealthy baboons , like unhealthy people , often have elevated resting levels of stress hormones .
" Their reproductive system does n't work as well , their wounds heal more slowly , they have elevated blood pressure and the anti-anxiety chemicals in their brain , which have a structural similarity to Valium , work differently , " Sapolsky said .
" So they 're not in great shape . "
Among the most susceptible to stress are low - ranking baboons and type A individuals .
" Type A baboons are the ones who see stressors that other animals don't , " Sapolsky said .
" For example , having your worst rival taking a nap 100 yards away gets you agitated . "
But when it comes to stress - related diseases , social isolation may play an even more significant role than social rank or personality .
" Up until 15 years ago , the most striking thing we found was that , if you 're a baboon , you do n't want to be low ranking , because your health is going to be lousy , " he explained .
" But what has become far clearer , and probably took a decade 's worth of data , is the recognition that protection from stress - related disease is most powerfully grounded in social connectedness , and that 's far more important than rank . "
Coping with stress
What can baboons teach humans about coping with all the stress - inducing psychosocial nonsense we encounter in our daily lives ?
" Ideally , we have a lot more behavioral flexibility than the baboon , " Sapolsky said , adding that , unlike baboons , humans can overcome their low social status and isolation by belonging to multiple hierarchies .
" We are capable of social supports that no other primate can even dream of , " he said .
" For example , I might say , ' This job , where I 'm a lowly mailroom clerk , really does n't matter .
What really matters is that I 'm the captain of my softball team or deacon of my church '— that sort of thing .
It 's not just somebody sitting here , grooming you with their own hands .
We can actually feel comfort from the discovery that somebody on the other side of the planet is going through the same experience we are and feel , I 'm not alone .
We can even take comfort reading about a fictional character , and there 's no primate out there that can feel better in life just by listening to Beethoven .
So the range of supports that we 're capable of is extraordinary . "
But many of the qualities that make us human also can induce stress , he noted .
" We can be pained or empathetic about somebody in Darfur , " he said .
" We can be pained by some movie character that something terrible happens to that does n't even exist .
We could be made to feel inadequate by seeing Bill Gates on the news at night , and we 've never even been in the same village as him or seen our goats next to his .
So the realm of space and time that we can extend our emotions means that there are a whole lot more abstract things that can make us feel stressed . "
Pursuit of happiness
The Founding Fathers probably were n't thinking about health when they declared the pursuit of happiness to be an inalienable right , but when it comes to understanding the importance of a stress - free life , they may have been ahead of their time .
" When you get to Westernized humans , it 's only in the last century or two that our health problems have become ones of chronic lifestyle issues , " Sapolsky said .
" It 's only 10,000 years or so that most humans have been living in high - density settlements — a world of strangers jostling and psychologically stressing each other .
But being able to live long enough to get heart disease , that 's a fairly new world . "
According to Sapolsky , happiness and self - esteem are important factors in reducing stress .
Yet the definition of " happiness " has less to do with material comfort than Westerners might assume , he noted : " An extraordinary finding that 's been replicated over and over is that once you get past the 25 percent or so poorest countries on Earth , where the only question is survival and subsistence , there is no relationship between gross national product , per capita income , any of those things , and levels of happiness . "
Surveys show that in Greece , for example , one of Western Europe 's poorest countries , people are much happier than in the United States , the world 's richest nation .
And while Greece is ranked number 30 in life expectancy , the United States — with the biggest per capita expenditure on medical care — is only slighter higher , coming in at 29 .
" The United States has the biggest discrepancy in health and longevity between our wealthiest and our poorest of any country on Earth , " Sapolsky noted .
" We 're also ranked way up in stress - related diseases . "
Japan is number one in life expectancy , largely because of its extremely supportive social network , according to Sapolsky .
He cited similar findings in the United States .
" Two of the healthiest states are Vermont and Utah , while two of the unhealthiest are Nevada and New Hampshire , " he noted .
" Vermont is a much more left - leaning state in terms of its social support systems , while its neighbor New Hampshire prides itself on no income tax and go it alone .
In Utah , the Mormon church provides extended social support , explanations for why things are and structure .
You can't ask for more than that .
And next door is Nevada , where people are keeling over dead from all of their excesses .
It 's very interesting . "
Typically , observant Mormons and other religious people are less likely to smoke and drink , he noted .
" But once you control for that , religiosity in and of itself is good for your health in some ways , although less than some of its advocates would have you believe , " Sapolsky said .
" It infuriates me , because I 'm an atheist , so it makes me absolutely crazy , but it makes perfect sense .
If you have come up with a system that not only tells you why things are but is capped off with certain knowledge that some thing or things respond preferentially to you , you 're filling a whole lot of pieces there — gaining some predictability , attribution , social support and control over the scariest realms of our lives . "
New research
From a neuroscience perspective , Sapolsky pointed to several exciting new areas of research .
" It 's becoming clear that in the hippocampus , the part of the brain most susceptible to stress hormones , you see atrophy in people with post - traumatic stress disorder and major depression , " he said .
" There 's a ton of very exciting , very contentious work as to whether stress is causing that part of the brain to atrophy , and if so , is it reversible .
Or does having a small hippocampus make you more vulnerable to stress - related traumas ?
There 's evidence for both sides . "
He also cited new studies suggesting that chronic stress causes DNA to age faster .
" Over time , the ends of your chromosomes fray , and as they fray your DNA stops working as well , and eventually that could wind up doing in the cell , " he said .
" There are now studies showing that chromosomal DNA aging accelerates in young , healthy humans who experience something incredibly psychologically stressful .
That 's a huge finding . "
According to Sapolsky , the most important new area of neuroscience research may be the effort to understand differences in the way individuals respond to stress .
" This gets you into the realm of why do some people see stressors that other people do n't , and why , in the face of something that is undeniably a stressor to everybody , do some people do so much worse than others ? " he said .
" Genes , no doubt , have something to do with it , but not all that much .
However , there is evidence about development beginning with fetal life — prenatal stress , stress hormones from the mom getting through fetal circulation — having all sorts of long - term effects .
" We 're now about 70 years into thinking that sustained stress can do bad things to your health .
The biggest challenge for the next 70 years is figuring out why some of us are so much more vulnerable than others . "
In the meantime , Sapolsky suggested that people do whatever they can to reduce stress in their daily lives .
" Try stress management , change your priorities or go into therapy , " he said .
" It takes work .
Some people clearly never can overcome it .
But the same things that make us smart enough to generate the kind of psychological stress that 's unheard of in other primates can be the same things that can protect us .
We are malleable . "

These selections lay out my views of the proper role of government , namely that it should serve only to protect the life and property of its citizens .
I respect the Constitution not because of a nostalgic attachment to an anachronistic document , but because the Founders knew the danger in allowing government to overstep its legitimate functions .
It is unfortunate that many Americans today do n't understand the Founders ' wisdom in framing our government on the principles of federalism and republicanism — as opposed to " democracy . "
A free society can only work when its members agree that there are certain things left to the discretion of individuals — no matter what a temporary majority might think .
In practice this means the government must respect private property and the rule of law , or what is also called free - market capitalism .
Current Political Philosophies ' Errors to Result in Political and Economic Crisis
Congressional Record — US House of Representatives September 20 , 1984
Mr. Speaker , I have a deep concern for the direction in which our country is going .
I have expressed this concern by pointing out the political and economic contradictions that surround us and have suggested that these contradictions merely are manifestations of philosophic errors made by our intellectual leaders .
Although the country currently is more or less in a euphoric mood , I am convinced the errors we are making today will eventually result in a severe political and economic crisis .
I do n't believe anyone precisely knows the future , yet we all make projections as to our expectations .
It 's impossible to know exact events and their timing but trends are known to us and certain policies do have specific consequences .
Economically definable laws do exist and cannot be repealed .
For what it 's worth , I would like to make a few comments about what we can expect if our current beliefs about government 's role are not changed .
The odds of a significant change in attitude occurring in Washington in the near future are utterly remote .
Repealing the welfare - warfare state may be popular with a growing number of frustrated American citizens , but that attitude is not yet reflected in Washington .
The constituency for the monolithic state is alive and well in the US Congress .
When disagreement exists in areas such as welfare versus warfare , the poor versus the rich , labor versus business , compromise is always reached and both sides receive an increase in funding .
This is a policy of utter folly and is tragically locked in place .
Government is literally out of control .
Spending , taxes , regulations , monetary inflation , invasion of our privacy , welfarism to both the rich and the poor , military spending , and foreign adventurism around the world will one day precipitate a crisis that will truly test our will to live in a free society .
If government were not so much out of control , would not the most conservative president of the last 50 years be able to do something about the runaway deficits ?
The deficits have tragically only gotten very much worse under Reagan .
All the problems we face , high interest rates , inflation , deficits , vicious business cycles with accelerating unemployment are serious problems indeed , but the real threat under the conditions to come will be the potential loss of our personal liberty .
Without liberty , prosperity is lost and equality of poverty prevails .
We have a cancer in the land — the malignant growth of big government — and we can ignore it , treating only the symptoms , hoping they are not reliable signs that a horrible disease has struck our nation .
But if we do , we are treating our problems as some foolishly deny the early signs of cancer , by taking aspirin and hoping the pain to be only that of inconvenience and that the symptoms will go away in the morning .
Instead , the pain gets worse requiring more and more narcotics to numb the pain .
Magic cures are sought and tried .
Although big government is the disease , attempts to solve all the problems by making government even bigger and more intrusive in our lives are continually tried .
This will soon end .
We cannot forever ignore the root causes .
It 's highly unlikely that we 'll reach the 1990s without a convulsion of our economic or political system .
Although nothing goes up or down in a straight line , we can be sure the long term will bring us ever - increasing interest rates — higher with each cycle and over 20 percent before this cycle completes itself in 1986 or 1987 .
Without the introduction of a commodity money , one with quality — as well as limitation on its quantity — we will never see the return of long - term fixed low interest rates .
The reform will come eventually , if we 're to continue to have even a relatively free society .
I just hope we do n't wait too long .
Price inflation , although difficult to predict on a month - to - month or even year - to - year basis , will reach unbelievable heights in this decade .
Currency destruction , through the insatiable desire to create massive new fiat monetary units , eventually brings higher prices .
Wage and price controls will return regardless of whether a Republican or a Democrat occupies the White House .
Free - market rhetoric will do nothing to protect us from the pressure the administration will receive to " do something , " even if it 's the wrong thing .
Nixonian Keynesianism will continue to dominate , and abusive people - control in the form of wage , price , currency and credit controls will return , more vicious than ever before .
There will come a day that the world financiers will rush from dollars just as they have recently rushed into dollars , causing even worse chaos in the international financial markets .
Without a stable monetary unit , the speculation will continue and worsen .
Overreaction is now becoming more commonplace , but this is a predictable consequence of a world gone mad with fiat currencies , debt creation , and overspending .
Massive debt liquidation will come .
The early stages have already started .
It will occur with old - fashioned defaults , threats of deflation , and further currency destruction through monetary inflation and liquidation of debt with a depreciating dollar .
Whether or not the liquidating debt collapse will be dominated by deflation or inflation of the money supply is yet to be determined since that will depend on government actions and many market forces .
An inflationary collapse is a more likely scenario — knowing the special interests , the Congress , the administration , and the central bankers ' unwillingness to face up to the reality of cutting spending , balancing the budget , and curtailing the supply of money .
So in spite of all the tough talk , we can expect the Fed to accommodate and reverse any trend toward deflation .
Without a significant change in attitude by the American people and Congress as to the purpose of government , the choices are horrible ; an inflationary collapse or a deflationary one .
The form and timing of the collapse is yet to be determined ; the event itself is certain .
This crisis will come , as others have , because we refuse to face up to reality and live within our means .
The people 's insatiable appetite for the goods of life without providing a commensurate amount of work and effort needed to produce them ( while demanding that politicians deliver the loot ) guarantees the process will continue .
But a penalty will have to be paid .
That penalty — a major banking , currency , economic , and political crisis — will hit this nation and the western world , most likely before the 1990s .
The economic hardship , of which we had a taste in 1981 and 1982 , will be much worse .
That in itself is bad enough news , but historically , when a nation debauches its currency international trade breaks down — today 40 percent of international trade is carried out through barter — protectionist sentiments rise — as they have in Congress already — eliciting hostile feelings with our friends .
Free - trade alliances break down , breeding strong feelings of nationalism — all conditions that traditionally lead to war ; a likely scenario for the 1990s , unless our economic policies and attitudes regarding government are quickly changed .
Many who concede we are moving in this direction of war , carelessly believe that the lack of military spending is the problem and insist on new massive military spending as the solution .
This only serves the inflationists , the internationalists , the banking elite , and industrialists who benefit from the massive manufacture of military weapons .
It ignores the important fact that most military conflicts throughout history have been the consequence of economic events .
Economic events , when combined with a foreign policy void of wisdom and fraught with folly , sets the stage for needless war .
Conservatives are quick to correctly point out that guns do n't cause crime , criminals do , but fail to see that weapons , or the lack of massive weapons , do n't cause war , politicians ' bad policies do .
This is a good reason why the current conservative administration should have stopped subsidizing trade and foreign assistance to the Soviet bloc nations and to Red China , which includes nuclear and military technology , instead of increasing it .
This is sheer madness .
Massive military spending to stop the spread of communism , which our own taxpayers are also required to finance , contributes to the economic problem of deficits , inflation , and high interest rates .
In addition it justifies , in the political world of compromise , increased domestic spending , higher deficits , accelerating inflation and higher interest rates — all compounding the economic problems that started the trouble in the first place
Depression and war are the needless consequences of politicians ' folly .
They are prevented by limiting government power , not by expanding it .
Today , campaign rhetoric is frequently heard about balanced budgets and reducing the size of the government ; witness the success of conservatives in 1980 ; yet nothing ever happens .
The spending , the regulations , the taxing , and the deficits continue .
Time is running short , the frustration running high .
Hiding from reality wo n't help ; kidding ourselves wo n't do .
The sooner we admit , " you ca n't get blood from a turnip , " the better off we 'll be .
Solution
What is the solution ?
Most importantly , a new attitude about the role of government is necessary if we expect to solve our problems .
As long as we , as a nation , accept the notion that government is the ultimate provider and world policeman , implementing the elusive concept of liberty will be impossible .
The degree to which governments are permitted to exert force over the people determines the extent to which individuals retain their liberty as well as the chances for peace and prosperity .
Historically , governments have always initiated force against the people with disastrous results .
America is the best example of what can happen if that force is restrained , thus maximizing individual freedom and prosperity .
Yet today , that wonderful experiment is all but abandoned .
We must once again clearly reject the idea that government force and threat of force can be carelessly administered .
Voluntary contracts must be permitted .
The trend toward government dominance , interference , and altering of voluntary contracts is prevalent and a most dangerous sign .
Responsibility to care for one 's self is necessary for a free society to function , and trust that individuals will look out for their own self - interest , even if imperfectly , is required and should be achieved through contractual arrangements .
Government interference in voluntary agreements between two parties must be strictly prohibited .
Enforcement of those contracts in event of a violation invites the government 's participation in settlement of the dispute .
This limited involvement of government in voluntary contracts is necessary in a free society .
The strict limitation of government power imposed by the Constitution must be respected .
We must accept the principle that government 's function is not to regulate and plan the economy , protect us from ourselves , arbitrarily attempt to make us better people , or police the world by interfering in the internal affairs of other nations .
Its proper function in a free society is to protect liberty and provide for a common defense .
When that proper role is assumed , our problems will vanish .
To bring about real changes , we first need to recognize that the politician , per se , is a lot less important than he appears .
He is basically a puppet of public opinion that reflects the prevailing ideas of the intellectual and thought leaders .
John Maynard Keynes , in one of his more lucid moments , said :
Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence , are usually the slaves of some defunct economist .
Madmen in authority , who hear voices in the air , are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back .
Media opinion is critical in establishing popular views just as that same media may support or destroy certain political careers .
Having accepted the philosophy of economic interventionism and political pragmatism , our society grants political knighthood to the highly paid lobbyists who represent the powerful special interests .
But we must remember the lobbyists are the result , not the cause , of our problems .
The politician is the puppet of the opinion makers .
Political success is the single goal that drives participants in our political system .
No invitations to participants are sent to men of principle , upholders of equal rights , and defenders of the Constitution .
Determined political aspirations under today 's circumstances are key to achieving a successful political career — the career being an end in itself .
We must be aware that this system of politics is not conducive to bringing about changes necessary to solve our problems .
The legislative and political intrigues that control the system for the benefit of the special interests must one day come to an end if personal liberty is to be restored .
The resort to power to control people and the economy must be rejected .
Also violence to bring changes beneficial to liberty serves no purpose ( unless exerted in true defense under reprehensible conditions ) .
The illicit use of power , even with noble intentions , has created history 's dung heap of human misery .
True change will come through persuasive intellectual influence .
If the people refuse to listen , mere recording of significant movements in history will be the limited result of the effort .
Yet , not making the effort to persuade the thought leaders to accept freedom and total nonviolence of the state , guarantees that the perpetuation of organized force — the tyranny of the state — will flourish and the suffering will continue for all of us .
Ideas do count ; all government action is a result of ideas .
It 's incorrect to suggest that freedom ideas must be rejected because they are idealistic — the planned economy is also a result of an idea .
It 's only a choice between good and bad ideas .
The job of the true believer in liberty is to convince the majority of our leaders that freedom ideas are superior to the ideas of government coercion .
Never can we relax by hoping that the good intentions of the big government proponents will protect us from the evils of government power that intimidate us all .
All politicians , from total statists — Marxists and Fascists — to average conservatives and liberals of today 's Congress , devoutly promise that all their actions are based on good intentions .
But it does n't matter : bad ideas regarding the nature and role of government breed bad results and suffering occurs nevertheless .
Twisted logic , Machiavellian justifications , excuse making , and short - run benefits can never justify the removal of one iota of liberty from any one person if we intend to live in a free society .
Once the role of government is agreed upon , and government initiation of force is rejected as a legitimate function , the consequences will quickly occur — all positive .
Individuals will reclaim their moral and natural right to their lives and liberty as granted to them by the Creator .
The state will be put in its proper place as the protector of equal rights , not the usurper .
That in itself should be enough reason to institute a system of limited government , but the benefits go far beyond the moral justification of true liberty .
Prosperity will abound and the chance for war will be greatly reduced .
If this is done , the welfare - warfare state is repealed and spending by the federal government reduced by 80 percent .
Special interest politicians will not be served and will vanish .
Lobbyists will become mere petitioners for liberty .
The budget will be immediately balanced and the debt repaid .
No more wealth will be transferred to the poor , the rich , the foreigner , the bankers , or arms manufacturers .
Military spending will once again be used for defense and not for the domination of an unofficial American empire .
Money will be honest , the unit precisely defined , and its integrity guaranteed by government or by voluntary contracts .
Counterfeiting privileges of the Fed will be abolished and relegated to notorious underground figures .
Honest money will allow credit to be freely created in the market and not by the privileged banking cartel , yet controlled by the integrity of the market and the convertibility of the dollar .
The economic benefits of low long - term fixed interest rates will be welcomed by all , since credit can then fuel true long - term economic growth .
This scenario sounds utopian , yet it 's more practical than the ill effects of the planned society financed by fiat money and debt creation .
It 's difficult to understand the persistence in following the impractical ideas of runaway government coercion .
The philosophy of the free market , sound money , private property ownership , and equal rights , offers the only real " compromise " to the impasse existing in Washington where only token attempts are made to cut the deficit .
A truly practical approach to this dilemma can be immediately implemented .
I suggest six points :
First , instead of debating forever over whether or not the cuts should be made in domestic welfare or military spending , the answer is simple : cut both , and quit arguing — that is , if anyone is serious about his declared hostility toward massive deficits .
Second , all votes on spending should be tradeoffs .
Welfare to the poor versus welfare to the rich ; domestic aid versus foreign aid ; aid to friends versus aid to Communists ; water projects in the United States versus water projects in Africa ; subsidized loans for steel plants in the United States versus those in South America .
Sure , many projects will still exist inconsistent with a truly free market but these projects would only be financed by dropping expenditures elsewhere .
Third , centralized planning fails everywhere else so we can expect it to fail with centralized control over bank credit .
Sound money , and breaking up the credit / bank cartel , will solve the problem of high interest rates and long - term financing .
Fourth , talks with the Soviets need not stop — only be redirected .
But all subsidies to all Communists must end .
We can discuss ways to enhance free trade and voluntary cultural exchanges .
True friendly unsubsidized relations with even the apparent enemy go a long way toward reducing the chances of war .
A nonaggressive purely defensive foreign policy which would prompt troop and missile withdrawals from Europe and elsewhere would be actions much stronger than all the political rhetoric heard surrounding disarmament conferences .
Fifth , equal rights must be guaranteed and enforced regardless of circumstances of race , color , or creed .
Equal rights cannot , however , be defined vaguely to include demands on another 's life or property .
The goal of freedom must surpass our obsession with material wealth and its forced redistribution .
Sixth , prosperity with freedom for the individual is the only humanitarian system ever offered that prevented mass starvation and suffering .
Refusal to accept the free market based on a natural - rights philosophy is the most impractical thing we can do .
A system that provides sound money , low interest rates , the removal of the bankers ' monopoly over credit , and peace and prosperity will restore trust in the politicians , the money , the future , and in ourselves .
More government cannot possibly offer the solution to the problems we face .
Big government is the cause ; freedom is the answer .

The Post -'70s Economic Framework
Business and the New Visa Hassles
A Period of Erratic Policies
Economics from Mao to Hu
A Government in Crisis
Internal Crises vs. the Economy
Something extraordinary is happening in China , and we are not talking about the Olympics .
Rather , Chinese officials have been clamping down on visa applications and implementing bureaucratic impediments to new and renewed visa applications under the guise of pre-Olympic security .
In some ways , Beijing 's plan for a safe and secure Olympics appears based on the premise that if no one shows up , there can be no trouble .
But placing restrictions on the movement of managers and employees of foreign businesses operating in China , even if for a limited time as Chinese officials have been at pains to reassure , makes little sense from the standpoint of gaining political and economic benefits from hosting the Olympics .
Something just is n't right .
Since China 's economic reform and opening in the late 1970s , China 's economic policy — and thus the basis for the overall development of the nation — has been based on a simple two - part framework .
First , draw in as much foreign investment as possible and use the money and technology to strengthen China while using the subsequent economic leverage to secure China .
And second , encourage growth for growth 's sake to ensure an ever - increasing flow of money through the system to provide employment and social services to a massive and urbanizing population .
Key to this policy has been creating a very open environment for foreign businesses , which bring money , technology and expertise and use their influence with their own governments to keep stable international relations with China — hence reducing international and economic frictions and increasing the efficiency of the supply chain .
For more than two decades , Chinese national strategy has thus revolved around the principle of encouraging investment , joint ventures and wholly - owned foreign enterprises in China .
There have been two foundations for this strategy : the evolution of financial facilities for transferring and controlling foreign money with a level of transparency nearing international standards , and the ease of movement of personnel in and out of China .
It is this latter point that recently has been hit the hardest .
Over the past several months as the Beijing Olympics drew nearer , the Chinese government has effectively frozen up most financial reform plans .
It also has issued a raft of new security measures not entirely unlike other host cities in the post 9/11 security environment .
But China has gone several steps further than its predecessor hosts , placing official and bureaucratic impediments on visa applications .
This not only has targeted potential " troublemaking " rights advocates , it has also impacted foreign businesses ranging from invited guests to the Olympic games to managers and employees of foreign companies in China .
The visa restrictions in particular have been a source of angst for foreign businesses and business associations .
Many smaller operations may circumvent Chinese regulations and travel on tourist visas ( provided they can still obtain them ) .
And there are ways around the tighter regulations or bureaucratic hurdles if one has the right connections or the willingness to apply several times or from different locations .
But multinational corporations are less willing to jeopardize their operations by skirting the laws .
Instead , they are making their concerns known to Beijing and hoping that restrictions are eased in September , as Beijing has rumored and hinted will occur .
In general , these visa restrictions have been brushed aside by foreign observers as simply paranoia on China 's part regarding protests or terrorist attacks during the Olympics .
In many ways , however , this makes little sense .
First and most obvious , the Olympics were supposed to highlight the opening of China — not restrict the very people who have made China a key part of the global economy .
Second , imposing tight restrictions in Shanghai , the center of the Chinese foreign - domestic economic nexus , makes little sense on grounds of Olympic security since Shanghai is playing only a minor role in the games compared to Beijing and Qingdao .
( Think shutting down visas to New York during the Atlanta games in the name of security , though Shanghai admittedly is hosting some soccer matches . )
Shutting down business visas to keep terrorists out makes little sense anyway — it is hard to imagine Uighur militants traveling on business visas as representatives of foreign multinationals .
Furthermore , by restricting business visas — even if not across the board in a coherent fashion —
China is putting a massive strain not only on the ability of businesses to trust Chinese regulations and business relations with the government , but also on the fluidity of the global supply chain .
Shutting down or impeding visas affects much more than delaying the movement of a single individual into China ; it impacts the ability of multinational corporations to move , replace or supplement managers and dealmakers in China .
A delayed visa applications of just three months still represents an entire quarter that multinational corporations cannot reliably manage their businesses operations in China , and that does n't take into account the visa backlog when restrictions are loosened or lifted .
Disrupting an integral part of the global economy for a full quarter because of an international exposition makes little sense .
The Germans in 1936 did n't do it , the Russians in 1980 did n't — no one has .
One does n't simply shut down international business transactions for three months or more to stop a terrorist — and particularly not China , which depends on foreign direct investment .
This is not simply an inconvenience for some people :
It is the imposition of friction on a part of the system that is supposed to be frictionless .
And it is not merely individuals who are affected , but the relations between mammoth companies .
China 's behavior has been erratic for several months now , if not for the past few years , with the implementation of new and often contradictory security and economic policies .
These have all been brushed aside as somehow related to preparation for the Olympics .
But they are in fact anomalous .
China 's behavior is not that of a country trying to show its best side for the international community , nor that of a nation simply concerned about potential terrorist or public relations threats to the Olympic games .
In another two months , after the Olympics and Paralympics have ended , it will become clearer whether this was a spate of excessive paranoia or a reflection of a much more significant crisis facing the Chinese leadership — and the evidence increasingly points toward the latter .
As mentioned , China 's economic policies in the reform and opening era have been based on the idea of growth .
This in many ways simply reflects the Asian economic model of maintaining cheap lending policies at home , subsidizing exports , flowing money through the system and focusing on revenue rather than profits .
In essence , it is growth for the sake of growth .
This was the policy of Japan , South Korea , Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand .
And it led each of those countries to a final crisis point , striking Japan first in the early 1990s and the rest of the Asian tigers a few years later .
But China managed to avoid each of the previous Asian economic crises points , as it was on the lagging end of growth and investment curves .
Following the Asian economic crisis , China fully recovered from the international stigma of Tiananmen Square and became the global economic darling .
By the time the 21st century rolled around , China was already taking on the mantle of the Japanese and other Asians .
It began to be labeled both an economic miracle and a rising power ; a future challenge to U.S. economic dominance with all the political ramifications that brought .
Were it not for 9/11 , Washington would have squared off with Beijing to prevent the so - called China rise .
The reprieve of international pressure that came when U.S. attention turned squarely toward Afghanistan and then Iraq freed China 's leaders from an external stress that could have brought about a very different set of economic and political decisions .
With the United States preoccupied , and no other major power really challenging China , Beijing shifted its attention to domestic issues , and its review quickly revealed the stresses to the system .
These did not primarily come from " splittist " forces like the Tibetans or the Falun Gong , but rather from the economic policies that had brought China from the Third World to the center of the global economic system .
Beijing is well - aware that should it continue with its current economic policies , it will face the same risk of crisis as Japan , South Korea and the rest of Asia .
It is also aware that growing internal challenges — from the spread and invasiveness of corruption to geographic economic imbalances , from rising social unrest to massive dislocation of populations — are causing immediate problems .
Mao Zedong built a China designed to be self - sufficient and massively redundant .
Every province , every city , every factory was supposed to be a self - contained unit , making the country capable of weathering nearly any military attack .
Deng Xiaoping did n't get rid of these redundancies when he opened the economy to foreign investment .
Instead , he and his successors encouraged local officials to work to attract foreign investment and technology so as to raise China 's economic standard more rapidly .
By the time Jiang Zemin was in power it had become clear that the regionally and locally driven economic policies threatened to throw China back into its old cycle of decentralization — and , ultimately , competing centers of power .
Attempts by Jiang to correct this through the Go West program , for example , came to naught after meeting massive resistance in the wealthy coastal provinces .
The central government accordingly backed off , shifting its attention to reclaiming centralized authority over the military .
Hu Jintao has sought once again to try to address the problem of the concentration of economic power in China 's coastal provinces and cities through his Harmonious Society initiative .
The idea is to redistribute wealth and economic power , regain central authority over the economy , and at the same time reduce redundancies and inefficiencies in the Chinese economy .
With minimal external interference ,
Hu was able to test policies that by their very nature were going to sacrifice short - term social stability in the name of long - term economic stability .
Growth was replaced by sustainability as the target ; longer - term redistribution of economic growth engines would replace short - term employment and social stability .
This was a risky proposition , and one that met strong resistance in China .
But the alternative was to sit back and wait for the inevitable economic crisis and the social repercussions thereto .
In some ways , Hu was suggesting that China risk stability in the short term to preserve stability in the long run .
But
Hu did n't anticipate the massive surge in global commodity prices , particularly of food and oil .
This was compounded by increased international scrutiny over China 's human rights record ahead of the Olympics , natural disasters hitting at the availability and distribution of goods , a rise in domestic social unrest triggered by local government policies and economic corruption , several attempted and successful attacks against China 's transportation infrastructure , and the uprising in Tibet .
Thus , the already - risky policies the central government was pursuing suddenly looked more destructive than constructive from the point of view of continued rule by the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) .
The global economic slowdown was the external impetus China feared — something that could undermine the flow of capital and leave Beijing unable to control the outcome of a reduction in the inflow of capital .
At the same time , the internal social tensions triggered both by Hu's attempts to reshape the Chinese economy and by the slow pace of those changes created a crisis for the Chinese leadership .
It was hard enough internally to control a measured economic slowdown to reshape the economic structure of China , but quite another thing altogether to have such a slowdown imposed on China from outside at the very moment social stability was in a critical state at home .
China 's rapid and contradictory economic and security policies , rising social tensions , and seemingly counterproductive visa regulations appear to be signs of a government in crisis .
They are the reactionary policies of a central leadership trying to preserve its authority , stabilize social stability and postpone an economic crisis .
At the same time , we see signs that the local governments , and even organs of the central government , are putting up steady resistance to the announcements coming from Beijing .
Slapping restrictions on foreign businessmen may make little sense from a broader business continuity sense , but if the point is to begin breaking the backs of the local governments — whose strength lies in their relations with foreign businesses — then the moves may make more sense .
If the central government has reached the point that it is willing to risk its international business role to rein in wayward local officials , however , then the Chinese leadership sees a major crisis looming or already under way .
It is one thing to toss out a few local leaders and replace them , quite another to undermine the structure of the Chinese economy for the sake of regaining control over local officials .
But if Chinese history since 1949 ( and really quite a ways before ) is any guide , the core of the CPC leadership is willing to sacrifice social and economic stability to preserve power .
One need only look at the Great Leap Forward , the Cultural Revolution or the crackdown at Tiananmen Square for evidence of this .
Revolution is not , after all , a dinner party , and maintaining CPC control is paramount to the government .
After each major revolution or crisis , China eventually has recovered .
The Cultural Revolution was followed by diplomatic relations with the United States , Tiananmen Square was put aside as China joined the World Trade Organization and surged ahead in gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Certainly , there was change among the leadership and in the way the party dealt with policies at home and abroad .
But if there is the likelihood of loss of control due to an impending economic crisis , better to have some role in shaping the crisis to preserve the chance of maintaining a role in the future political structure than to sit by and try to clean up as things fall apart .
The Party in fact has a long history of taking a self - generated crisis / revolution over an externally or domestically initiated one .
It may be that the contradictory policies Beijing is tossing around these days will simply fade away after September and things will get back to " normal . "
But already , Chinese officials are downplaying the previously hyped political and economic benefits of the Olympic games .
They are now warning that economic conditions may not be so strong in the future , and at least internally discussing the distinct possibility that at least certain regions of China are facing the same economic crises faced by their mentors Japan , South Korea and the Asian tigers .
A recent article in the Global Times , a paper that addresses myriad topics of domestic and international significance and is read among China 's leaders , discussed how economics is not the best measure of strength .
It referred to the overall comparative GDP and the size of China 's military in the late 1800s .
Then , China was considered at its weakest , but from an economic or military perspective it could have been considered comparable to the global powers of the day .
This hints at the deeper internal debate in Beijing , where true national strength and the role of the economy is under discussion .
Assumptions that China is only focused on continued good economic ties with the world should n't be taken as gospel — China has a track record of shutting down external connections when internal crises brew .
Numerous polices are being thrown around in firefighting fashion , including blocking or at least hindering foreign business movement in and out of the country and tightening the flow of foreign capital in both directions .
They are coming in reaction to flare - ups in economic , environmental , public relations and social arenas .
Energy policies are making less sense , imbalances in supply and demand are growing and seemingly contradictory policies are being issued .
Social unrest , or at least local media coverage of such unrest , seems to be increasing ; either is a sign of weakening control .
Local officials are still failing to fall in line with central government edicts .
Strategic state enterprises like China National Petroleum Corp. , China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. and the China Development Bank are all defying state - council orders — and the State Council itself is apparently going head - to - head with major policy bodies long given control over economic policies .
Something extraordinary is happening in China .
And while not everyone may want that to be the case , and so have sought to use the Olympics to explain things away , the easy explanation simply does n't make enough sense .

July 16 , 2008
The 4th of July that recently passed was , as usual , a mixed bag for me .
It was one of my favorite days of the year as a kid .
I 've loved fireworks and explosions ever since I was young -- my friend next door had a massive stockpile of illegal fireworks when I was growing up ; frankly , it 's a miracle I reached adulthood with two eyes and ten fingers .
As I 've grown older , however , I 've come to find the day increasingly melancholy and hollow .
As is often the case , I spent part of the day wondering , what went wrong ?
How did we reach the point of having the megastate we have today ?
People will often argue that America is freer because equal legal rights have been extended to women and non-whites .
That 's good to the extent it 's true .
What 's left out of that is how much less that equality means today in many ways .
We 've greatly expanded the number of people who are entitled to the full rights of a citizen , but the full rights of a citizen are in many ways a mutilated remnant of what they were .
Why ?
The 4th of July gained a greater poignancy for me when I realized it was commemorating not just a hope that had failed , but one that never could have been .
Some would point to the existence of flaws or loopholes in the U.S. Constitution , and there is something to that .
One major issue is that the writers and supporters of the Constitution were badly mistaken on certain fundamental issues of how large - scale republican governments actually work .
Now , they did n't have a whole lot of previous continent - spanning federal republics to draw lessons from , and it's not fair to blame people in the 18th Century for not being up to date on Public Choice theory .
Still , while you can say they had no way of knowing better , on many of these issues there were Anti-Federalists who did know better .
Reading the debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists is fascinating .
The Anti-Federalists , who we are today generally taught to consider fools and paranoiacs , make all sorts of eerily accurate predictions on the effects of adopting the Constitution ; indeed , when they err , it is usually because they are not pessimistic enough .
The Federalists ' response often seems to be to blithely insist that no , of course the government wo n't be able to do the things the Anti-Federalists are warning about , because we 'll have a piece of paper telling the government not to .
More concrete explanations of why the Constitution would work as advertised fare little better : the celebrated Federalist 10 , in which James Madison explains why the exploitation of the general public by ' factions ' ( special interests ) will not be a problem under the Constitution , must surely rank among one of the most badly botched predictions in American history .
The problem runs deeper than that , however , to the very idea of constitutionally limited government .
Generally speaking , for all their healthy distrust of power - seekers , I think the supporters of the Constitution just did n't appreciate how clever people can be at twisting words .
They recognized that the world is full of ambitious , greedy , tyrannical , or just plain wicked men , and they saw that it was desirable for the government as a whole and its constituent offices to have their power checked , and so they created a governmental structure and legal limitations to provide those checks .
However , having created a set of rules that would keep each player within his proper place , they often seemed to assume that the players would henceforth continue using those rules .
People might try to break them , but the constitutional structure would assist everyone else in bringing would - be usurpers into line .
They did n't seem to much anticipate people subverting the constitutional framework itself in the way it has happened historically : that the Supreme Court would declare growing food on your own land for your own consumption to be commerce ' among the several states , ' that vast hordes of sophists would insist that ' the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed ' is a reference to the National Guard ( established in 1903 ) , that the power to take property for ' public use ' would encompass seizing people 's homes so that multibillion dollar corporations can have a more profitable store location , that the existence of the words ' general welfare ' would be taken to mean that the government could do anything whatsoever that is not expressly forbidden by the Constitution , or that the 10th Amendment would just sort of vanish .
The supporters of the Constitution understood and feared human ambition , but badly underrated human cleverness .
While the Framers can be blamed for creating a document with so many weak points for would - be usurpers to chip away at , I do not think their particular mistakes in constitutional design were a necessary condition for the growth of the American Leviathan .
Indeed , I do n't think any mistakes are necessary .
There were a number of things that led me from minarchist constitutionalism to anarchocapitalism -- moral arguments , reading works about the possible functioning of things like private defense firms , the government 's utter failure in what is supposedly its most fundamental function on 9/11 -- but one big one was the conclusion that no constitutional framework is adequate to restrain the state .
The Framers could have done everything right , and they still would have failed .
Limited government is not a viable long - term solution .
There will always be government officials who want more power and influence , ideologues seeking to dominate others , private interests seeking to enrich themselves through privilege , and sophists to give weapons to all three .
And as long as there is a state to gain control of , they will always succeed -- in the presence of a monopoly government , the natural inclinations of opinion - makers , the incentives facing potential exploiters versus those faced by the productive masses of people , and the psychological baggage of a species that evolved as subsistence hunter - gatherers in small kin groups all work against the goal of keeping a state constrained .
The anarchist vs. minarchist debate among libertarians often focuses on whether anarchocapitalism would be stable ; it 's a question that minarchists , and anyone who supports a government of strictly limited powers , should ask of their own system more often .
It is not the anarchist who is guilty of wishful thinking .
Those who believer that a single institution can be given a monopoly on force , the right to be the judge in cases against itself , and the sole right to interpret the laws binding itself , and then be expected to behave because of a piece of paper -- they are the ones indulging in utopian fantasies .
Over the last few years I have keenly followed the rise of Bitcoin from its early days trading at around $ 8USD .
I watched with interest when it made its sharp rise to $ 1200USD and then felt dismay with more recent decline back to around the $ 200USD mark .
As a whole …
Chelsea appear set to sign the Milan playmaker Kaka for a world - record € 100 m ( £ 79.3 m ) after discussions took place this week , with both clubs and the Brazil international keen for a deal to go through .
Sources at Stamford Bridge have confirmed that Chelsea are targeting the 26 - year - old and it is understood that Milan are inclined to accept a bid of € 100 m tabled this week .
Initially reluctant to depart , Kaka now believes the transfer , which would smash the record of £ 46 m
Real Madrid paid for Zinedine Zidane in 2001 , is in everyone 's interests .
His contract does not expire until 2012 but he is eager to play for Luiz Felipe Scolari , who gave him his international debut against Bolivia in 2002 and included him in the Brazil squad for that year 's World Cup finals despite him being only 20 years old .
The current world and European player of the year also believes Chelsea are the most attractive destination in European football .
Chelsea sent a representative to Milan this week to present a bid to the Italian club .
Far from rejecting the offer out of hand as is normal practice and as they did with approaches from Real Madrid last summer , Milan sent a delegation to London and negotiations have continued .
Discussions have also taken place with the player 's camp over personal terms , with Kaka , who has scored 22 goals in 59 games for his country , set to earn a significant rise on his salary as well as a € 15 m signing - on fee .
He will arrive in Milan today after spending the summer recovering from arthroscopy on his knee at Sao Paulo 's training centre in Brazil .
" Real Madrid offered €90 m last summer and Milan did not even think about the bid , " said Kaka 's personal assistant and closest adviser , Diogo Kotscho .
" This time is different .
This is the first time we feel that a deal will definitely happen .
Because of the [ financial ] situation Milan are in at the moment , the deal is good for all parties involved .
" The move would represent a significant increase in Kaka 's salary , on top of the 10 % transfer fee that goes straight to the player anyway - some € 15 m .
Chelsea are the club to be at right now .
They are building a team to win everything . "
Given their current financial difficulties , Milan can ill afford to reject such a huge bid .
Having failed to qualify for the Champions League , they have had to cut costs at the same time as embarking on the renewal of an ageing squad .
They continue to seek a striker and the sale of Kaka would enable them to follow through on their interest in Arsenal 's Emmanuel Adebayor , despite their vice - president Adriano Galliani 's claim that Ronaldinho would be their final signing of the summer .
Meanwhile , the arrival of the former Barcelona player - and the tumultuous reception he was given - has persuaded them they can release Kaka , safe in the knowledge that they have a glamour signing in his place .
Kaka believes he has shown his loyalty to Milan by staying last season , despite Madrid 's interest .
He has not demanded a transfer this season either , with the impetus coming from the two clubs .
However , he does not want to continue at a club that will not play in this season 's Champions League .
Kaka 's relationship with Galliani and the club's owner Silvio Berlusconi has also been strained by Milan 's refusal to allow him to represent Brazil at the Olympics .
Milan said Kaka was " tired " - a claim he publicly denied .
Worse still , Ronaldinho has been allowed to go to Beijing .
If the deal can be completed it would virtually destroy the chances of the Real Madrid forward Robinho completing his " dream " move to Stamford Bridge .
The La Liga champions are unwilling to sell until they can sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United .
Last night Sir Alex Ferguson insisted the Portugal winger would still be at Old Trafford next season .
Congress has been awash in corruption scandals , the latest being the indictment of long - serving Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska , but prospects for legislation to make questionable practices like Stevens ’ alleged acceptance of gifts illegal in their own right appear grim .
A year after a bipartisan group of senators proposed giving the Justice Department important new clout in pursuing official misconduct , the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements
Act is apparently blocked in Congress .
The legislation is aimed at stanching the stream of perks that lobbyists and companies give to members of Congress that fall short of outright bribes by making it a felony for lawmakers to accept gifts valued above those permitted by Senate rules and that are given to them because of their official status and access to power .
It would appear to cover the sort of gifts that Stevens stands accused of getting from a powerful oil industry figure in Alaska -- more than $ 250,000 in improvements to his home near Anchorage and gifts including a Viking gas grill and a Land Rover , according to an indictment handed down Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Washington .

Stevens is scheduled to make his first appearance in the case today in federal court in Washington .
Supporters said the legislation might also cover mortgage breaks that some lawmakers and administration figures reportedly received recently from companies linked to the subprime mortgage debacle .
“ We want public servants to meet with their constituents .
I do n’t think we want them accepting tickets to the Super Bowl , ” said George D. Brown , a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at Boston College ’s law school , describing the intent of the legislation .
Supporters , including the League of Women Voters and Common Cause , believe the bill would fill an important gap in federal law in cases in which bribery is not an issue and would show that Congress wants to hold itself to the highest ethical standards .
Its lead sponsors are Sens. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) .
The Justice Department strongly supports the bill .

Critics say the department already has enough powerful legal tools to pursue the corrupt , and they fear that the legislation is written so broadly that it would criminalize receipt of token gifts , such as personalized jerseys that championship sports teams always seem to be handing their chosen representatives .
Those with concerns include the ranking Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .
“ This opens a wide , wide door , ” Specter said during committee debate on the bill last year .
He said he was concerned about the already “ awesome power ” of the Justice Department to go after political figures and others .
“ There are a lot of people with big bull ’s - eyes on their backs , ” he said .
“ This bill , if enacted , would enlarge the bull ’s - eye substantially . ”

Congress approved new ethics rules last year that imposed an outright ban on gifts and other perks given to members from registered lobbyists , but they do not have the weight of criminal law .
“ The most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing our own rules , ” Leahy said .
“ Bribery and extortion are committed by people bent on getting around the rules . ”
Some legal experts said such a change in the law could be more symbolic than real , because prosecutors have already stretched other laws to make their cases .
But they also said it could add an arrow in the quiver of the Justice Department .
“ There is a big area of conduct that potentially is sort of sleazy or unethical but not criminal -- like a whole series of free dinners .
You can not link it to any particular act that the member of Congress did .
But it just looks sleazy , ” said Randall Eliason , a former federal corruption prosecutor .
Advertisement
Last year , the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the legislation by voice vote , but the objections of Specter and others make it unlikely it will be considered by the full Senate before the end of the year .
No lawmaker has offered comparable legislation in the House .
Stevens ’ indictment shows the problems prosecutors have had in framing corruption cases in recent years .
Though the lawmaker was accused of taking action on behalf of the oil firm and its chief executive , prosecutors did not charge him with bribery .
That indicates that they did not have enough evidence of a quid pro quo -- the legal term describing a gift and an official act as being linked -- to charge him with the more serious crime , former prosecutors say .
Instead , Stevens was charged with failing to report the gifts on his Senate financial disclosure forms from 2001 through 2006 .
But he was not charged with the act of accepting the gifts .
Ethics advocates say taking the gifts should be illegal in their own right and that prosecutors should not have to resort to such indirect methods that could leave the charges open to challenge .

Though accepting gifts and other “ gratuities ” used to be widely considered illegal , the Supreme Court took the opposite view in a 1999 case involving Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy .
Espy was charged with illegally receiving thousands of dollars in tickets to the U.S. Open Tennis tournament and other perks from Sun-Diamond Growers of California , an agribusiness cooperative .
Justice Department prosecutors maintained that it was illegal for corporations and their lobbyists to give any substantial gifts or money to an official who had power over their industry .
A federal jury convicted Espy .
The Supreme Court disagreed , however , ruling that the questionable gifts must be linked to an official act performed by the recipient .
Reform groups said the apprehension the bill causes among lawmakers is understandable .
“ It does strike at the very heart of how the system works , ” said Meredith McGehee , policy director at the Campaign Legal Center , a Washington - based nonprofit organization .

The study found DNA of farmers in Punjab altered New research in India suggests exposure to pesticides could have damaged the DNA of people in farming communities , leading to higher rates of cancer .
Scientists at Patiala University , Punjab state , did the study , tracking a group of farmers for several months .
But a spokesman for the crop industry trade association said a causal link between pesticide use and cancer could not be established .
There have been concerns about potential links for several years .
This new study discovered that the DNA of farmers in Punjab has been altered , making them susceptible to cancer .
' Significant change ' Professor Satbir Kaur said the study ruled out other factors such as age , alcohol intake and smoking , concluding that the probable cause of this fundamental change in the building block of life was use of pesticide sprays .
" We found significant change in the DNA , so the cancer risk is greatly increased when the extent of DNA damage is very high , " he said .
Salil Singhal of the industry trade association , the Crop Care Federation of India , said that this causal link could not be possible .
" There is no pesticide in use today which can cause cancer , " he said .
Mr Singhal said farmers use sprays only a few times each season .
But this correspondent found farmers who needed to use them far more than that in order to keep ahead of the pests .
One farmer , who said that he was spraying night and day , does have cancer .
As the world struggles to find its way back to securing affordable food supplies , new crop varieties have not kept up the promise of the early days of the green revolution in Asia .
Meanwhile , yields have gone down .
And these disturbing indications of a potential threat to human health raise questions over whether intensive farming like this is sustainable .

Predictions of “ ice free ” summer for first time in history completely debunked
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , August 19 , 2008
Alarmist scientists who predicted that the North Pole could be “ ice free ” this summer as a result of global warming have been embarrassed after it was revealed that Arctic ice has actually grown by around 30 per cent in the year since August 2007 .
Back in June , numerous prominent voices in the scientific community expressed fears of a mass melting of the polar ice caps , including David Barber , of the University of Manitoba , who told National Geographic Magazine , “ We ’re actually projecting this year that the North Pole may be free of ice for the first time [ in history ] . ”
“ This summer ’s forecast — and unusual early melting events all around the Arctic — serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change , ” adds the article .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
In February , Dr. Olav Orheim , head of the Norwegian International Polar Year Secretariat , told Xinhua , “ If Norway ’s average temperature this year equals that in 2007 , the ice cap in the Arctic will all melt away , which is highly possible judging from current conditions . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As per usual , the reality has failed to match the hype of the climate doomsayers .
According to collated data from the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and the University of Illinois , Arctic ice extent was 30 per cent greater on August 11 , 2008 than it was on the August 12 , 2007 .
This is a conservative estimate based on the map projection .
Blue pixels represent increased ice coverage over the North Pole in the year since August 2007 .
The video below highlights the differences between those two dates , ” reports The Register .
“ As you can see , ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer – with a large increase in the area north of Siberia .
Also note that the area around the Northwest Passage ( west of Greenland ) has seen a significant increase in ice .
Some of the islands in the Canadian Archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980 . ”
But what of the Antarctic down south ?
Figures tell us that ice coverage in the year since August 2007 has grown by nearly one million square kilometers .
As The Register article notes , “ The Arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by NSIDC and the Norwegian Polar Year Secretariat .
It did n’t even come close .
Additionally , some current graphs and press releases from NSIDC seem less than conservative .
There appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to Arctic ice loss . ”
A general cooling trend across the planet is now clearly apparent as sunspot activity , the main driver of climate change , dwindles to almost nothing .
As we reported last week , A top observatory that has been measuring sun cycles for over 200 years predicts that global temperatures will drop by two degrees over the next two decades as solar activity grinds to a halt and the planet drastically cools down , potentially heralding the onset of a new ice age .
While the mass media , Al Gore and politicized bodies like the IPCC scaremonger about the perils of global warming and demand the poor and middle class pay CO2 taxes , both hard scientific data and circumstantial evidence points to a clear cooling trend .
How man -made global warming advocates will spin this one remains to be seen – maybe they will just continue to adopt their current tactic by claiming that any geological or weather event whatsoever , be it hurricanes , earthquakes , droughts or floods , temperature increase or decrease , and even a 30 per cent growth of the polar ice cap – is a result of that evil life - giving gas that we exhale – CO2 .

Comment on this article
The average American produces 4.51 pounds of trash per day , according to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) — and only 35 % of that waste gets recycled or composted .
That 's nearly 140 million tons of waste going to landfills every year !
While most of us know to put our cans and bottles in the blue bins for recycling , disposal can get a little trickier when it comes to other items such as appliances , electronics , and old medications — which is why , when you 're getting to work on some spring cleaning , it 's so important to know how to dispose of these items properly .
Of course , before throwing something away for good , a solid first step is to always donate items ( in good , working condition ) to nonprofits and charities like Goodwill , Habitat for Humanity , the Salvation Army , or local charities ; or list them on Craigslist , eBay , or even Facebook .
But if it 's time your items really hit the curb , it 's important to know how to dispose of everything in an environmentally friendly way ; after all , even a tiny bit goes a long way when it comes to being green .
So if you 're wondering what exactly to do with those old batteries or outdated electronics you find as you 're cleaning out your house this year , here 's a handy A–Z guide on everything you can responsibly dispose of :
Batteries
Batteries of all types can be recycled .
According to Duracell , regular single - use alkaline batteries ( such as ones that power our remotes ) can safely go in the trash everywhere except California ; however , a more eco-friendly way of disposal is to recycle them at community programs , workplaces , or nearby recycling centers that accept them .
Rechargeable batteries ( such as ones in cellphones and other electronics ) , however , should not be thrown out in the trash and should be recycled , as they may contain hazardous chemicals .
To find a nearby recycling site for all types of batteries , be sure to check Call2 Recycle and Earth911.com — and before you recycle them , make sure to place non-conductive clear tape over the ends or the terminals of the battery to ensure safe recycling .
Books
If you 're trying to get rid of some unwanted books , first consider donating them — many charities , libraries , schools , and even prisons and shelters accept donations for used books year - round .
Some great organizations — many of which have nationwide drop off locations — include Better World Books , Books For Soldiers , and Books For Africa ( as well as secondhand stores like Goodwill or The Salvation Army ) .
Of course , you can also try selling them on sites like Amazon or BookScouter , especially if you have textbooks .
If your books are battered beyond hope , however , sometimes they can be recycled .
According to Earth911.com , you can recycle the entire book if it's a paperback , but if you 're trying to dispose of a hardcover book , you 'll need to remove the cover binding before recycling them .
And remember that if your book has gotten wet ( or if the papers have turned tan or brown ) , they should actually be thrown away with your regular trash instead , as this unfortunately makes the material non-recyclable .

Cleaning Products
The best way to dispose of cleaning products is to use them !
If that 's out of the question , it 's important to read the labels to figure out the right way to toss them — so be sure to check the bottle 's instructions on proper disposal .
Hint :
In most cases , water - soluble products ( like bleach ) can be flushed down the drain or toilet with running water , and solid cleaning products like bar soaps and scouring pads can go in the trash .
And of course , in recycling the bottles for any cleaning products that can be disposed down the train , be sure to empty all of the unused product and give it a rinse or two before tossing it in the recycling bin .
Coffee Pods
If you love using your single - serve machine , you can take steps to eliminate the environmental impact .
Nespresso offers capsule recycling at more than 122,000 places around the world .
Visit any Nespresso boutique or partner store ( including Sur La Table and Williams - Sonoma ) or pick up a free pod-recycling bag online that comes with a prepaid UPS shipping label .
For K - Cups , some varieties ( including the Green Mountain kind ) can get recycled , though the company is starting to transition into having all of their pods be recyclable by the end of 2020 .
Check for a # 5 recycling sign on the bottom first , before removing the foil lid and throwing that out along with the grounds ( though the filter can remain ) .
Then , recycle the empty cup — though be sure to check locally first , as K - cup pods are not yet recyclable in all communities .

Electronics
Cell Phones : Before getting rid of your old cell phone , first delete all of your personal information using a factory or hard reset option .
( Check the manufacturer 's website for info on how ) .
You 'll also want to remove or erase the SIM or SD card .
Then you can trade in , donate , or recycle your device — usually right at the store .
For example , AT&T runs the charity Cell Phones for Soldiers that donates devices to troops overseas .
You can also look for e-cycling locations in your area using this database , including private recyclers , nonprofits , and other programs .

TVs : Do n't toss your old TV or monitor in the trash !
Some old sets contain toxic materials like lead and count as hazardous waste .
Best Buy , LG , Vizio , Samsung , and Sony all offer TV recycling programs ( either in - store , event , drop - off site , and haul away options ) .
You can also try contacting your local sanitation department for guidance .

Laptops and Computers : Check out Dell Reconnect , World Computer Exchange , and eBay for Charity if you 're interested in donating your device .
Similar to TVs , you 'll want to recycle these responsibly , so get in touch with the manufacturer or retailer to see if they 'll help out .
Eyeglasses
Before tossing your old , outdated eyeglasses , first consider donating them to organizations such as OneSight , Lion 's Club , or New Eyes , which take old glasses to distribute them to those in need .
As glasses can be made up of several different materials , they are a bit challenging to recycle — so donation might actually be your best ( and most sustainable ) bet .
If you do have to dispose of them , however , make sure to separate the lenses from the frames .
If your frames are made of aluminum , you may be able to pull them apart ( and place them within a larger aluminum container ) for curbside recycling .
Of course , make sure to double check first by contacting your recycling center or local council .

Household Appliances
Washers and Dryers :
If they 're still in good working order , donate them to a shelter or home that would likely benefit .
If you 're buying new laundry appliances , ask the manufacturer whether they 're certified to recycle your old ones .

Microwaves : Some municipalities let you recycle broken microwaves as scrap metal .
( Electronics recyclers will do the same for a small fee . )
You could also bring it to a bulk items or appliance recycling day hosted by local authorities .
Kitchenware
If you 're looking to toss out your old pots and pans and other cookware , consider donating them to secondhand stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army , or even listing them on websites like Craigslist to find them a second home .
For kitchenware that 's now unusable , however , recycling is an option ; in fact , you might be able to recycle your metal pots and pans with curbside recycling if your program accepts " scrap metal . "
However , most curbside recycling programs wo n't accept these items , so you should try to find a scrap metal recycler near you to dispose of them properly .
As for kitchen utensils , those made from metal will have the same recycling options as metal cookware , but if your flatware is made from plastic , it 's important to know what type of resin they 're made of in order to determine their recyclability .
Wood spoons and other wooden flatware , however , can usually be composted with your organic waste .

Light Bulbs
Some states and jurisdictions may actually require recycling light bulbs , so check your local laws before tossing these in the trash .
As bulbs often break when they 're thrown away , they can release mercury into the environment .
Try Earth911.com for info on how to safely get rid of these ( plus other hazards , like paint and pesticides ) near you .
Mattresses
Some cities will collect your mattress if you put it out ( sealed in a plastic bag to prevent bedbugs ) with your regular garbage for bulk collection .
If you 're planning on buying a new mattress , many retailers will also haul the old one away for you .
If it 's gently used and in good condition , you could try donating it to a nonprofit ( like Habitat for Humanity , the Salvation Army , or a local homeless shelter ) .
Just double - check that health department regulations in your area allow it .
If not , try the site Bye - Bye Mattress to find a recycling center near you or hire a removal service like 1- 800 - GOT - JUNK ?
to do the dirty work for you .

Medications
It 's important to dispose of expired or unused medication as soon as possible to prevent others from accidentally taking or intentionally misusing them .
To dispose of them safely , use this DEA Diversion Control Division search engine to find a certified disposal site near you ( including some pharmacies ) .
Your local law enforcement agency may also host periodic collection days .
If you can't find one , you can also dispose of some medications in the trash following this FDA - suggested method :
Mix the medicines ( do not crush ) with an unpalatable substance like dirt , cat litter , or old coffee grounds .
Place the mixture in a sealed plastic bag .
Throw the bag in the trash .
Scratch or black out all personal information on empty pill bottles or packaging before throwing them away .
Note :
The FDA recommends flushing a few specific medicines down the toilet when a take - back option is not available due to the potentially fatal risk of someone taking them accidentally .
These include hydrocodone ( e.g. , Vicodin ) and Oxycodone , and a few others .
You can see the full list here or check the label for specific disposal instructions .
Water Filters
Many household water filters can be recycled through recycling programs from the manufacturer or retailer .
Brita encourages their filters to be sent to their recycling program with TerraCycle — just collect your used filters ( after drying them out for three days ) as well as Brita pitchers and bottles in a garbage bag , box it up , and then drop it off at a UPS location after filling out a mailing form on the Brita website to get a prepaid shipping label .
By doing so , you can even earn Brita points to be redeemed for exclusive rewards !
For other water filter brands , you can contact the manufacturer to find out if they offer a recycling program , or use the Zero Waste Box program from TerraCycle that will safely recycle all of your water filters ( as well as air filters ) for you — though you 'll have to purchase a box to ship out to their program .

Whenever economies sour , politicians blame speculators .
But on occasion , they are right to do so .
Speculators did wreak havoc in 1630s Holland , 1720s France , and in the American stock market in 1929 .
That crash led to the Great Depression and 60 years of tight controls on speculation .
Now , thanks to our 30 - year infatuation with free markets , the controls are off , and the mad gamblers are at it again .
Yesterday ’s burst bubble was housing ; today ’s expanding ones are energy and food .
True , we have major long - term energy problems that cannot be laid at the feet of speculators .
To avoid catastrophic global warming , we will be obliged to reengineer the country , from housing to transport to forests , and also to develop and export the technologies required for the rest of the world to do likewise .
Eight years of George W. Bush ’s policies have made this much harder , and during that time the world may have passed “ peak oil ” — that moment when half the recoverable reserves of conventional oil have been drained and burned — so that from now on short supplies will be endemic .
Meanwhile , demand grows , notably from China and India , which account for nearly 40 percent of the world ’s population .
But do supply and demand explain oil prices at $ 140 per barrel , with voices from Goldman Sachs projecting $ 200 for next year ( a figure that would push gas prices above $ 5 per gallon ) and Russia ’s Gazprom saying $ 250 , despite a likely US recession ?
Do they explain the historic price hikes in rice , corn , and wheat , leading to hunger in the developing world ?
Do they explain the absolutely stratospheric price of copper ?
No they do not .
Yes , Virginia , speculators can affect the price — if they are large and relentless enough to dominate a market , and especially if they can store the commodity and keep it off the market as the price rises .
Futures markets exist to permit commercial interests to hedge their business risks .
For a fee , a farmer ( or oil producer ) can put a floor under the price at which his product will sell .
The forward price is normally a bit lower than the current price , but the contract protects the farmer from a catastrophic price slump — such as may occur in ( for instance ) bumper years .
Speculators buy the futures on the chance that the market price will be substantially higher .
They make a respectable profit on what is in effect an insurance function , and a killing in years of drought , flood , and war .
This system works reasonably well so long as speculators do not actually control or manipulate prices .
For if they can drive prices way up , they can obviously cash in while the farmer ( who has presold his crop ) cannot .
Strict regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( cftc ) is supposed to prevent that .
But thanks to Phil “ nation of whiners ” Gramm — the former Texas senator who was until recently John McCain ’s top economic adviser ( see “ Foreclosure Phil “ ) — futures market regulation went to hell .
Under the “ Enron loophole ” pushed through by Gramm in 2000 , energy futures were allowed to escape all federal and state regulation .
Gramm embedded that loophole in a surprise 262 - page rider , drafted at the behest of Wall Street and Enron , in an 11,000 - page appropriations bill on a Friday evening two days after the Supreme Court handed down its Bush v. Gore ruling and as Congress was rushing home for Christmas .
In a separate bit of absurdity , in January 2006 , the Intercontinental Exchange ( ice ) of Atlanta , which trades benchmark US oil futures ( West Texas Intermediate or wti ) , came to be treated by the cftc as a British market ( the “ London loophole ” ) so that US regulators do not even track what is going on .
( Even more surreal , the cftc was going to allow trades of US oil futures on terminals located in America to be “ regulated ” in Dubai ; political pressure put an end to that idea in July . )
Worse still , Gramm ’s Commodity Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 also opened the way for growth in deregulated “ credit default swaps ” — a way in which financial institutions “ insured ” that bad loans would not cause them losses .
This , combined with other deregulatory moves by the cftc , broadened the “ swaps loophole , ” an enormous backdoor into the commodities markets , basically permitting speculators making bets off the commodities exchanges to be treated as “ commercial interests ” — like say , farmers — and hence avoid the scrutiny ( including limits on the size of their bets ) normally applied to financial players .
Thus today , when officials like Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson say that speculation is not a factor in the commodity markets , they ’re not counting hedge funds and investment banks as speculators — even though that ’s what they really are .
According to Senate testimony on June 3 by Michael Greenberger , who used to head the cftc ‘s division of trading and markets , if swaps were properly labeled , about 70 percent of the oil futures now traded on the New York exchanges would be deemed speculative , not commercial , and subjected to a high degree of regulatory scrutiny .
Okay , let ’s think this through .
First , vast sums of money are flowing through regulatory loopholes into the commodities markets , particularly for oil .
Second , spot prices ( those charged for immediate sale ) in all commodity markets have been soaring .
In particular , Americans now pay an average of $ 4 per gallon for gas .
Is it possible that these two events are unconnected ?
Is it possible that Paulson — former ceo of Goldman Sachs — is right when he says that the price of oil is being driven mainly by supply and demand ?
No , and Senate testimony in May by Michael W. Masters , a hedge fund manager , illustrates why not .
Masters points to the spectacular rise of “ index speculation , ” in which pension funds and other investors invest in the commodities futures markets according to formulas created by , among others , ( guess who ? )
Goldman Sachs .
Index speculation investments have risen from $ 13 billion to more than $ 250 billion since 2003 .
Masters calculates that the speculative demand for Texas oil futures from this source is now five times the actual 2003 stockpile ( the baseline he used ) ; for corn and aluminum the figure is about nine times ; for silver it ’s a phenomenal fourteen times .
There is of course no way that the orders represented by all those futures contracts could be met .
So the futures price goes up .
As it does , supplies actually disappear .
For instance , copper expert Frank Veneroso believes that 800,000 tons of copper has been hidden away in China , waiting to emerge closer to the market top .
For Saudi Arabia and perhaps Russia the matter is simpler :
Oil stays in the ground , and the oil not sold boosts the price of the oil that is .
As current prices soar , the index speculators obey their computer programs , which tell them to pour still more money into the commodity markets .
There may be a further element at play , according to an April speech by Attorney General Michael Mukasey : “ International organized criminals control significant positions in the global energy and strategic - materials markets .
They are expanding their holdings in these sectors , which corrupts the normal functioning of these markets and may have a destabilizing effect on US geopolitical interests . ”
To whom exactly Mukasey is referring , he does not say .
But that organized criminal interests have the motive , means , and opportunity — handed to them by Phil Gramm — to destabilize the world energy markets seems quite clear .
On these matters , there is a quick fix .
Under pressure , the cftc is closing the London loophole .
Early in the next administration , Congress must slam shut the Enron and swaps loopholes .
Index speculation should be curtailed by making such strategies illegal for regulated pension funds and by imposing limits for all traders on how much they can buy or sell .
Investment banks using credit default swaps to enter the commodities markets should be regulated to the standards that apply to speculators , not as if they were heating - oil vendors hedging against a warm winter .
Investigations now under way at the Federal Trade Commission , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , and the Department of Justice should be intensified , and criminal manipulation of the markets , if detected , should be punished .
Finally , the federal government should burn the oil speculators by selling up to 4 million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
And as economist Tom Palley has pointed out , consumers can help too .
An awful lot of gas is stored in cars .
If people stop topping off and make do with half a tank , they ’ll back up supply and lower demand .
It ’s a brilliant suggestion and definitely worth a try .
And while this is being done , and especially if all this smoke leads to fire , someone should ask , “ What did Henry Paulson know , and when did he know it ? ”

First National Bank of Nevada , Reno , Nevada , and First Heritage Bank , N.A. , Newport Beach , California ( owned by First National Bank Holding Company , Scottsdale , Arizona ) , were closed today by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) was named receiver .
The FDIC entered into purchase and assumption agreements with Mutual of Omaha Bank , Omaha , Nebraska , to take over all of the deposits and certain assets of the First National Bank of Nevada , Reno ( also operating as First National Bank of Arizona , which recently merged into it ) , and First Heritage Bank , N.A. , Newport Beach , California .
The 28 offices of the two banks will reopen on Monday as branches of Mutual of Omaha Bank .
All depositors , including those with deposits in excess of the FDIC 's insurance limits , will automatically become depositors of Mutual of Omaha Bank for the full amount of their deposits .
Depositors will continue to be insured with Mutual of Omaha Bank so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance .
Over the weekend , customers of the banks can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards .
Checks drawn on the banks will be processed normally .
Loan customers should continue to make loan payments as usual .
Of the 10 institutions that have failed over the past two years , this is the second time in which another bank acquired all of the failing banks ' insured and uninsured deposits .
Mutual of Omaha Bank 's acquisition of all deposits was the " least costly " resolution for the Deposit Insurance Fund compared to all alternatives because the expected losses to uninsured depositors were fully covered by the premium paid for the banks ' franchises .
As of June 30 , 2008 , First National of Nevada had total assets of $ 3.4 billion and total deposits of $ 3.0 billion .
First Heritage Bank had total assets of $ 254 million and total deposits of $ 233 million .
Customers who would like more information on today 's transactions should visit the FDIC's Web site at http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/fnbnv.html ( for First National Bank of Nevada ) and http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/heritage.html ( for First Heritage Bank , N.A. ) .
They may also call the FDIC toll free about both institutions at 1-866-674-8944 and 1-800-523-8089 until 9:00 p.m.
Pacific time this evening , and then 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily , thereafter .
In addition to assuming all of the deposits of the banks , Mutual of Omaha Bank will purchase approximately $ 200 million of assets from the receiverships .
Mutual of Omaha Bank will pay the FDIC a premium of 4.41 percent to assume all the deposits .
The FDIC will retain the remaining assets for later disposition .
First Heritage Bank , N.A. , Newport Beach , California , had three branches ; its clientele was comprised primarily of corporations .
First National Bank of Nevada , with 25 branches , also operated as First National Bank of Arizona .
It is not affiliated with National Bank of Arizona , Zions Bancorporation or its affiliates .
The cost of the transactions to the Deposit Insurance Fund is estimated to be $ 862 million .
The failed banks had combined assets of $ 3.6 billion , .03 percent of the $ 13.4 trillion in assets held by the 8,494 institutions insured by the FDIC .
First National Bank of Nevada is the first bank to be closed in Nevada since Frontier Savings Association , Las Vegas , on December 14 , 1990 .
The bank closed most recently in California was IndyMac Bank , F.S.B. , Pasadena , on July 11 , 2008 .
This year , a total of seven FDIC - insured banks have been closed .
# # #
Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to restore public confidence in the nation 's banking system .
The FDIC insures deposits at the nation 's 8,494 banks and savings associations and it promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions by identifying , monitoring and addressing risks to which they are exposed .
The FDIC receives no federal tax dollars – insured financial institutions fund its operations .
FDIC press releases and other information are available on the Internet at www.fdic.gov, by subscription electronically ( go to www.fdic.gov/about/subscriptions/index.html) and may also be obtained through the FDIC's Public Information Center ( 877-275-3342 or 703-562-2200 ) .

One of the greatest mysteries in science is how life began .
Now one group of researchers says diamonds may have been life 's best friend .
Scientists have long theorized that life on Earth got going in a primordial soup of precursor chemicals .
But nobody knows how these simple amino acids , known to be the building blocks of life , were assembled into complex polymers needed as a platform for genesis .
Diamonds are crystallized forms of carbon that predate the oldest known life on the planet .
In lab experiments aimed to confirm work done more than three decades ago , researchers found that when treated with hydrogen , natural diamonds formed crystalline layers of water on the surface .
Water is essential for life as we know it .
Also , the tests found electrical conductivity that could have been key to forcing chemical reactions needed to generate the first life .
When primitive molecules landed a few billion years ago on the surface of these hydrogenated diamonds in the atmosphere of early Earth , the resulting reaction may have been sufficient enough to generate more complex organic molecules that eventually gave rise to life , the researchers say .
The research , by German scientists Andrei Sommer , Dan Zhu , and Hans - Joerg Fecht at the University of Ulm , is detailed in the Aug. 6 issue of the American Chemical Society 's journal Crystal Growth & Design .
Funding was provided by the Landesstiftung Baden - Wurttemberg Bionics Network .
Another theory , called panspermia , holds that life on Earth arrived from space , as organisms rained down inside tiny meteors or giant comets .
The new research does not conclusively determine how life began , but it lends support to one possible way .
" Hydrogenated diamond advances to the best of all possible origin - of - life platforms , " the researchers contend .
At the same time , some of the geopolitical tensions that surrounded the move of oil prices toward $ 150 a barrel also showed some signs of easing .

The Bush administration said on Tuesday that it would allow a senior diplomat to attend a meeting of European and Iranian negotiators over Iran ’s nuclear program , in what would be the highest - level talks between American and Iranian representatives since 1979 .
Fears of a military strike by Israel or the United States on Iran ’s nuclear operations helped push oil prices to record highs last week .
“ Things have been looking rather glum over the past couple of days , ” said John Kilduff , an energy analyst at MF Global .
He called the news about talks with Iran and the unexpected increase in oil inventories “ a one - two punch for bears ” that could signal a deeper drop in prices in coming weeks .
Oil prices have risen more than sevenfold since 2002 as fast - growing demand in developing countries has outpaced the growth in new oil supplies .
In the past year , they ’ve more than doubled , pushing gasoline prices above $ 4 a gallon in the United States and leading to frenzied efforts in Congress to address runaway energy costs .
But as high energy prices ripple through the economy , there is growing unease at how much they are contributing to higher costs for everything from food to consumer goods .
Consumer prices have risen at their fastest pace in 17 years in June , according to a government report released Wednesday .
Businesses are also being hit hard .
Automakers and airlines like General Motors and Delta Airlines are losing billions of dollars and laying off thousands of employees .
Consumers have sharply reduced their gasoline consumption in the face of record prices .
Gasoline demand in the United States , for example , fell 5.2 percent last week , according to a nationwide survey by MasterCard , its 12th consecutive weekly drop .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters Life ! ) - America ’s obsession with beauty is posing serious problems for the health and economic well - being of women and young girls , according to a report on Monday on the pursuit of physical perfection and the rise in cosmetic surgery .

The nonprofit YWCA in the United States said women and girls are spending increasing amounts of money in their bid to look like idealized , air - brushed magazine models .
The report , Beauty at any Cost , noted U.S. women spent some $ 7 billion a year , or an average of about $ 100 each , on cosmetics and beauty products .
That $ 100 a month , if saved and invested for five years , would pay for a full year of tuition and fees at a public college , the report calculated .
“ We believe that the obsession with idealized beauty and body image is a lifelong burden that takes a terrible toll on all young girls and women in this country , ” said YWCA USA Chief Executive , Dr. Lorraine Cole .
“ What ’s really new here is the sheer extent to which women and girls are now willing to go ... to be ‘ beautiful , ’ according to standards perpetuated by a youth - obsessed media culture with literally thousands of messages , 24 hours a day , ” she said .
Nearly 11.7 million cosmetic surgical and nonsurgical procedures were performed in the United States in 2007 -- a 446 percent increase in 10 years , according to the American Society for Aesthetic Surgery .
Botox injections and liposuction are the most popular nonsurgical and surgical procedures .
The report cites other research linking smoking to attempts by women and girls to control their weight .
It notes that some ingredients in U.S. cosmetics , such as hair sprays and nail polishes , contain phthalates that have been shown to cause liver and reproductive system damage in animals .
The YWCA teamed up with the makers of a new documentary on the issue , “ America the Beautiful ” , in a bid to alert the 2.5 million women and girls the YWCA serves in the United States .
Other Internet protocols could be facing a siege from ISPs
Original image by Dirty Bunny
Rogers , one of the two major Canadian Internet Service Providers , has been busy exercising their position of power .
Again .
After having been injecting content into HTTP webpages for half a year , Rogers has moved on to hijack DNS as well , replacing “ not found ” responses with pages full of ads .
Though why stop there ?
Internet comes with many more communication protocols ; plenty of opportunities to disrupt expected responses and inject unwanted ads into someone else ’s content .
All in the name of extra profits .
This is a hypothetical visual study of possible implications .
All images below have been edited .
It is not the point to single out Rogers ; it ’s just that they ’ve started the trend that users disagree with .
The point is that users should disagree with such actions .
While not everybody might care about occasional unresolved lookups , there are other services that could be targeted next .
MSN , Yahoo , XMPP ( and other ) IM protocols
This one might be hitting a lot closer to home , for some , than seeing ads on “ missing webpage ” responses ; even though it ’s a similar concept .
Only this time in your Instant Messenger .
Every once in a while one would send a message just as the contact goes offline … more commonly it ’s busy / away / whatever status … so many options to take advantage of !
WHOIS
WHOIS is a query / response protocol used to look up information about a domain .
It would be easy to inject some plain - text advertising , along with the requested information .
While only a small subset of the internet population uses this protocol , it is also a very specific demographic to be targeted with offers regarding domains and other web - related products .
RDP — Remote Desktop
While technically the data is encrypted , as it should be , it seems that older clients might use weaker protection schemes and be vulnerable to man - in - the - middle attacks .
ISPs often happen to be in the middle .
If one ’s entire desktop is streamed over the internet , why not supplement some of the experience with sponsored offers ?
BitTorrent
Actually a lot of ISPs already treat BitTorrent traffic in a special way .
Though instead of annoying users with injected downloads and making money , ISPs often unfairly throttle this protocol , annoying users for free .
And more !
POP3 / STMP — inject ads into emails !
— inject ads into emails !
RTP — manipulate streaming audio / visual content .
— manipulate streaming audio / visual content .
IRC — similar to Instant Messaging .
The good news is that we are not there , yet .
The bad news is that not enough people seem to be aware of this creeping trend .
The worse news would be similar tactics catching on in other communication mediums .
In a way an Internet Service Provider is very similar to a Postal Office .
Their services are purchased in order to deliver data .
Now imagine Canada Post ( or FedEx or UPS ) operating in a similar manner .
It would be like reverse censorship — instead of taking content out , they ’ll be putting more in , along with your original package .
I ’ll doubt they will get away with such practices for long .
Original image by arbyreed
Is it because snail - mail letters are sealed in envelopes , that we expect a them to be delivered without tampering ( HTTP page content injection ) ?
And similarly expect a certain level of privacy , instead of getting a package full of ads on topics of “ return to sender ” mail ( DNS hijacking ) ?
And that we expect any letter , regardless of content , having paid equal postage , to be delivered at a similar level of service ( BitTorrent throttling ) ?
Perhaps we ’ll need to start placing our internet packets in envelopes as well .
Some people think we should encrypt all internet traffic .
Besides implementation and adaptation difficulties , this would also add additional strain to the networks … but at least it would help ISPs to stay more honest .
I just hope that we will not be forced to do it this way .

Blagojevich said he has n’t talked to the mayor about the issue --- he planned to call Daley --- and that the administration 's discussions are preliminary .
" I think today it 's fair to say that violent crime in Chicago is out of control , " Blagojevich said .
" That in certain communities in the city of Chicago , it 's reaching epidemic proportions . "
Seizing upon the controversy enveloping Mayor Richard Daley over Chicago gun violence and city policing , Gov. Rod Blagojevich said Wednesday he 's holding discussions with his State Police and Illinois National Guard officials about any crime - fighting role they can play .
" I'm offering the resources of the state to the city to work in a constructive way with Mayor Daley to do everything that we possibly can to help them end this violence , " said Blagojevich at a news conference in which he signed into law a measure that would increase penalties for adults who give minors guns .
The governor said one idea is to bring state troopers into the city to monitor hot spots .
Just how the State Police would play a significant role is questionable since Blagojevich has only recently begun rebuilding its ranks after union officials say the agency lost more than 10 percent of its positions from 2001 through 2005 and patrolling of many areas , particularly during nights and weekends , is spotty at best .
Blagojevich suggested that recently retired troopers might be able to come back for a few months to help out in Chicago .
The governor 's offer could be more politically embarrassing than helpful for Daley , who has been conscious of the city 's image as he tries to win the 2016 Olympic Games .
Daley spokeswoman Jackie Heard said the mayor found out about the idea through media reports .
" We 're obviously not going to turn away help on a front as important as this , " Heard said .
" At the same time , we 're a little puzzled about how it would work .
It 's unprecedented .
Obviously , help in the form of reducing the number of guns on the street go a long way to addressing the problem . "
Despite Blagojevich ’s repeated vows to help Daley ’s efforts on major gun-control legislation in Springfield , the governor has exerted little of what capital remains among rank - and - file lawmakers on an issue that still pits strong feelings between Downstate and urban voters .
The governor 's offer of assistance comes after Daley 's opposition last week to a major gambling expansion bill that would provide money to help Blagojevich create a $ 34 billion public works construction bill .
City
Hall wants a casino , but does n't want to pay the state $ 500 million for the right to have one , as Blagojevich ’s plan seeks .
The proposal has little support in the Illinois House , headed by Blagojevich nemesis , Speaker Michael Madigan .
Blagojevich and Daley have not been politically close .
Like Daley , Blagojevich has alienated many leading Democrats in the state --- Senate President Emil Jones being a strong exception --- over a style of governing that critics contend is dominated more by a personal publicity pop than putting any substance behind it .
Cancer patient kills himself day after he is told NHS Trust would not fund £ 25,000 drug
A cancer patient killed himself after being told he had been refused a wonder drug by his local primary care trust .
Albert Baxter , 77 , was terminally ill .
But he was turned down for a drug which could have prolonged his life and shrunk his tumour .
In desperation , he offered to pay for the treatment .
But he was told if he did so , he would also have to foot the bill for the rest of his treatment , which he could not afford .
Albert Baxter ( left ) , with partner Barrie Curryer .
Mr Curryer found Albert dead in the kitchen of their home
The former bus driver had been diagnosed with renal cancer in January 2007 .
His oncologist , Dr Fiona McKinna told him that the drug Sutent was his only hope .
But although she requested the treatment , costing £ 25,000 a year , in March , East Sussex Downs and Weald Primary Care Trust turned it down on the grounds of cost and clinical effectiveness .
As his condition deteriorated , his clinician launched an appeal - and Mr Baxter hoped that the decision would be overturned .
But when he went to see his consultant on June 5 , 2007 , she was unable to give him the drug .
Mr Baxter , known by his middle name John , returned to his home in Eastbourne , East Sussex .
The next day , his partner found him dead , with a bin liner over his head .
Mr Baxter had not yet found out whether the Trust would consider his appeal .
Yesterday Barrie Curryer , his partner of 30 years , said : ' What really upset him was that he worked all his life and paid into the health system and was refused treatment .
He thought it was because of his age , which I think played a part too .
' The trust people just sit in a room and read about John but do n't see the patient .
I blame the PCT because John 's oncologist and GP wanted the drug .
I think he built up his hopes of getting it .
The 70 - year - old retired nurse added : ' It was the only drug that could do any good for him , there was nothing else .
He was told it would not cure him but would give him a better quality of life .
' I can't say he was depressed , just very angry about it .
He was so weak and just could not get up the stairs so I had to get people to help me .
' He said , " Nobody is doing anything for me , they 're just letting me die " . '
I had prepared myself for his death but not under these circumstances .
Sutent facts and figures
' We offered to pay for the drug but if we had done we would have had to pay for all his treatment .
' We just could not afford that and John would not have accepted that anyway .
I just wish he had n't done it , we did n't even say goodbye . '
Friends of the couple , who ran a guesthouse together , organised a petition to get the drug but it failed to move health bosses .
An inquest into his death in April , heard that Mr Baxter 's GP , Dr Rob Wicks , also campaigned for the patient to be prescribed the drug .
He told Eastbourne Coroner 's Court : ' It would have held the progression of the disease and alleviated symptoms - improving his quality of life . '
But Lisa Compton , of the Trust , told the inquest that clinical effectiveness and cost were the two main reasons for refusing the drug .
It was one of just two rejections for the treatment out of 19 requests to the Trust since January 2007 .
Recording a verdict of suicide , East Sussex Coroner Alan Craze said : ' I do n't think his life would have come to an end precisely when it did had he been prescribed the requested drug . '
The Trust had an ' almost impossible ' job deciding on medication and there had to be a limit on resources , he added .
Sutent , is the first new treatment for advanced forms of kidney disease in 30 years .
Trials have shown that it can prolong the lives of those with advanced stages of kidney cancer by up to two years and can shrink the tumour .
It is prescribed throughout Europe and licensed for use here .
But it has yet to be approved by the Government 's drugs rationing body , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence .
In the meantime , it is up to primary care trusts to decide whether to offer patients the drug , but they are not obliged to do so .
Under Health Service rules patients are not allowed to make so - called co-payments to top up their existing NHS treatment .
If they want to pay for drugs not funded on the NHS , they must to pay privately for their entire treatment .

What is A / B Testing ?
Develop two versions of a page
Randomly show different versions to users
Track how users perform
Evaluate ( that 's where statistics comes in )
Use the better version
Why A/B test ?
A typical website converts 2 % of visitors into customers
People can't explain why they left
Small changes can make a big difference
How about +40 % ?
Google believes it works , see Website Optimizer
What Can You A /B Test ?
Removing form fields
Adding relevant form fields
Marketing landing pages
Different explanations
Having interstitial pages
Email content
Any casual decisions you care about
A /B tests do not substitute for Talking to users
Usability tests
Acceptance tests
Unit tests
Thinking
What is the G - test ?
A method for comparing 2 data sets
It was invented by Karl Pearson in 1900
It is a close relative of the chi-square test
It is our main method for evaluating A/B tests
There are alternatives
Limitations of the G- test Only answers yes / no questions ( but you pick the question )
Only handles 2 versions ( there is a workaround )
Requires independence in samples
Does not do confidence intervals
What to measure Start your A/B test
Divide your users into groups A and B
Decide whether each person did what you want
Reduce your results to 4 numbers : ( $ a_yes , $ a_no , $ b_yes , $ b_no )
Arrange your measurements
Yes No A $ a_yes $ a_no $ a B $ b_yes $ b_no $ b $ yes $ no $ total $ a_yes = # in A who are yes
$ a_no = # in A who are no
$ b_yes = # in B who are yes
$ b_no = # in B who are no
Scary Math Part 1 - Addition
Yes No A $ a_yes $ a_no $ a B $ b_yes $ b_no $ b $ yes $ no $ total $ a = $ a_yes + $ a_no
$ b = $ b_yes + $ b_no
$ yes = $ a_yes + $ b_yes
$ no = $ a_no + $ b_no
$ total = $ a + $ b ( or $yes + $ no )
Scary Math Part 2 - Expectations
Yes No A $e_a_yes $ e_a_no $ a B $e_b_yes $ e_b_no $ b $ yes $ no $ total $ e_a_yes = $ a * $ yes / $ total
$ e_a_no = $ a * $ no / $ total
$ e_b_yes = $b * $ yes / $ total
$ e_b_no = $b * $ no / $ total
Scary Math Part 3 - G - test
A basic G - test term looks like this :
2 * $ measured * log( $ measured / $ expected )
Statisticians know its distribution very well
It is connected to something called chi-square
We will discuss chi-square later
For now treat as magic
Scary Math Part 4 - Calculation
We have 4 measurements and 4 expectations .
So we have 4 G - test terms .
We add them : my $ g_test = 2 * ( $ a_yes * log ( $ a_yes / $ e_a_yes ) + $ a_no * log ( $ a_no / $ e_a_no ) + $ b_yes * log( $ b_yes / $ e_b_yes ) + $ b_no * log ( $ b_no / $ e_b_no ) ) ;
We have 4 measurements and 4 expectations .
So we have 4 G - test terms .
We add them :
Scary Math Part 5 : Interpretation use Statistics :: Distributions qw( chisqrprob ) ; my $ p = chisqrprob ( 1 , $ g_test ) ;
If the samples are all independent ... and the measured values are all at least 10 ... and the real performance of A and B is the same ... then $p ≈ prob ( G - test should be > $ g_test )
If $p is " small " , conclude # 3 likely wrong
How Small Is " Small " ?
Increased certainty needs a larger sample
You 'd have to be unlucky to be wrong when you decide ...
But you get multiple chances to be unlucky
I push for 99 % confidence :
( $p < 0.01 )
Recap of A/ B setup Develop two versions of a page
Randomly divide users into two groups
Show each group a different version
Track how those users perform
Evaluate the versions
Go with the winning version
Recap of G - test evaluation Select a yes / no question about users
Divide users in A and B into yes / no
Perform complicated G - test calculation to calculate $ p
Our confidence is 1 - $p
is Make decision if our confidence is near 100 % and we have enough samples
Enough samples is at least 10 yes and no results in each test
What if I do n't have Perl ?
Perl comes with virtually all forms of Unix , including OS X and Cygwin
You can get a native Perl for Windows from http://strawberryperl.com
With either solution you can get Statistics : : Distributions
In Unix : perl - MCPAN -e ' install Statistics : : Distributions '
In DOS : perl - MCPAN -e " install Statistics : : Distributions "
What if I do n't want Perl ?
We all have JavaScript , right ?
I ported Statistics : : Distributions to JavaScript
statistics-distributions.js comes with this talk
It is available on the same terms as Perl
Which means the Artistic License , or GPL v1 or later
It offers the same functions as the Perl version
Show Me Here is a Perl G-test Calculator for you
And a JavaScript G-test Calculator for you
I recommend installing these somewhere
Point your product managers at the web version
... so they do n't have to bug you when they want to play with hypothetical numbers
Tests are temporary
Let 's move on to considerations for developers
Developers normally want maintainable code
A /B testing calls for deletable code
code Normal code does n't die
A /B tests finish , one version wins , the others are deleted
Then you write another test ...
Streamline development
You will write a lot of A/B tests
Make the process as easy as possible
Eliminate annoying steps
Build a framework
Automate reporting
Programming API
You need a way to find what version a person gets
Setting it if need be
Should be self - documenting
Needs to support some hidden functionality
You will use this over and over again
A sufficient API my $ version = get_or_create_test_version ( $ person_id , " some test name " , [ " some version " , " another version " , ... ] , [ 4 , 1 , ... ] # optional , defaults to [ 1 , 1 , ... ] ) ;
This is enough , but a bit hackish
Cleaner to add get_test_version ( $ person_id , $ test_name ) ;
In code you find the version , show the appropriate thing
The optional argument gives relative frequencies
That is a nice to have - you do n't really need that
Behind the scenes
The first time a person comes they are not found
A random version is created , saved and returned
The next time the previous version is found and returned
So the random pick is permanent
Complications behind the scenes
There are some complications to consider
You want to use caching
Need QA hook to set person into version ( eg CGI parameter )
Need production hook to , without a code release , cause a test to only return one specific version
a code release , cause a test to only return one specific version Production hook could be database entry , property file , etc
This will be used to end tests
It is also useful if there is a bug in a test
Code outline for function sub get_or_create_test_version { my ( $ person_id , $ test , $ versions , $ weights ) = @_ ; }
Code outline for function sub get_or_create_test_version { my ( $ person_id , $ test , $ versions , $ weights ) = @_ ; my $ version = production_test_override ( $test ) || get_test_from_cache( $ person_id , $ test ) ; return $ version if $ version ; }
Code outline for function sub get_or_create_test_version { my ( $ person_id , $ test , $ versions , $ weights ) = @_ ; my $ version = production_test_override ( $test ) || get_test_from_cache( $ person_id , $ test ) ; return $ version if $ version ; $ version = get_test_from_database ( $ person_id , $ test ) ; if ( not $ version ) { } save_test_to_cache ( $ person_id , $ test , $ version ) ; return $ version ; }
Code outline for function sub get_or_create_test_version { my ( $ person_id , $ test , $ versions , $ weights ) = @_ ; my $ version = production_test_override ( $test ) || get_test_from_cache( $ person_id , $ test ) ; return $ version if $ version ; $ version = get_test_from_database ( $ person_id , $ test ) ; if ( not $ version ) { # choose_random_version should NOT use $ person_id $ version = qa_test_override ( $test ) || choose_random_version ( $versions , $ weights ) || return ; save_test_to_database ( $ person_id , $ test , $ version ) ; } save_test_to_cache ( $ person_id , $ test , $ version ) ; return $ version ; }
Naming your tests Standardize your naming scheme
Have ticket numbers in test names
That avoids accidentally reusing names ( which could mess up reporting )
Also provides way to learn more more about a test
Use self - explanatory test names
Use self - explanatory version names
Naming example Test name : 1234-image-size
Versions : thumb , full
Ticket 1234 in Bugzilla should describe the A/B test
The versions should mean what they say
In the database Only need one table
Normalized tables require database patches , complicating development and deployment
Necessary information : person_id , test_name , version_name , creation_date
Primary key is person_id , test_name
The creation date sometimes matters for reporting
Programming recap
Use good test names , and include ticket numbers
Setup and teardown of tests must be easy
Make the programming API simple
Behind the scenes need QA and production hooks
Database design should be simple
Time for reporting
We now have an A/B test running
We know who is in which version of the test
Now we need to know who did what we want
But first , what did we want them to do ?
The conversion funnel
Your conversion funnel Every company has one or more conversion funnels
You should know yours , and be actively trying to improve each step
Each step can be tracked with some metric
Most A/ B tests concentrate on one step in the funnel
Expect to run multiple A/B tests against each
Standardize these metrics
Examples of metrics Sessions , sessions with registration
People who searched , who viewed detail page , contacted , leased
People who saved favorites , started a cart , completed purchase
People who saw at least 3 pages , clicked on an ad
Anything measurable and important to your business
Too many metrics ?
You may have many metrics
High confidence on one may be chance
Believe if it was the metric you tried to change
Believe if very high confidence
Believe if metrics agree
Conflicting metrics require business decision
Reporting is work Developing reports takes time
Running reports takes time , and interrupts programmers
Run reports once a day , from cron
Run a standard set of metrics against every A/B test
Minimize custom reporting
Simplify custom reporting log_test_activity ( $ person_id , $ test_name , $ test_version , $ action ) ; Many A/B tests need custom reporting
Log the actions you want to report on
Actions are things like " followed this link " or " hit this page "
Have a cron job turn these logs into a set of metrics
Takes care of most custom reporting needs
Also good for registration tests
If you have a data warehouse A/B test results are slow to generate
People often want to access them
This is a perfect fit for a data warehouse
For each metric , by test , by day entered the test , by day the activity happened , how many users entered that test the first day and became a yes on this metric for the second
This summary is reasonably compact , and is very valuable
valuable Expect it to take a lot of time to set up
Is that it ?
You now know enough to run a successful A/B test !
If you do everything right
If you do it wrong you wo n't know
You 'll just get random answers
And believe them
Compare apples to apples Traffic behaves differently at different times
Friday night ≠ Monday morning
First week in month ≠ last week in month
Last week 's visitors have done more than this week 's
Do not try to compare people from different times
Be careful when changing the mix A and B can receive unequal traffic
But do not change the mix they get
change the mix they get Wrong Change ( 90/10 ) A vs B to ( 80/20 )
Change ( 90/10 ) A vs B to ( 80/20 ) You are implicitly comparing old A's with new B's
Right Change ( 10/10/80 ) A vs B vs Untested to ( 20/20/60 )
Change ( 10/10/80 ) A vs B vs Untested to ( 20/20/60 )
This comes up repeatedly
What is wrong with this ?
Suppose you are A/B testing a change to your product page
You log hits on your product page
You log clicks on Buy Now
You plug those numbers into the A/B calculator
Is this OK ?
Beware hidden correlations !
Correlations increase variability , and therefore $ g_test
Some people look at many product pages
Their buying behaviour is correlated on those pages
This increases the size of chance fluctuations
Leading to wrong results
Guarantee independence Whatever granularity ( session , person , event ) you make A/B decisons on ...
Needs to be what you test on
In this case measure people who hit your product page
who hit your product page Measure people who clicked on Buy Now
who clicked on Those are the right statistics to use
This comes up repeatedly
People do n't like UI changes A/ B tests change how things work
People may need time to adapt
This can cause the new version to lose
If you think this is likely to be an issue ...
Only enter new users into the test
I can't predict how common this is
Schedule Compression Suppose you are A/B testing sending a reminder at 5 vs 10 days
A does better than B for people between 5 days and 10 days
This makes A look better than it is
Solution : look at results for people who entered the test more than 2 weeks ago
This comes up occasionally
Wrong metric
At Rent.com we changed the title of our lease report email
The new email had improved opens and clicks
That was because it interested people who were still looking for a place to live
for a place to live
That email needed to interest people who had already found a place to live
a place to live
We looked at the wrong metric , and it cost us millions
This mistake is fairly rare
That 's it !
Those are the big mistakes that I 've seen
You now know how to do an A / B test
... and should have good odds of getting it right
Of course there is more to know
But this is the core
A simpler example
We want to know how long A/B tests take
We 'll start with a simpler example
Proving that a coin is not 50/50 heads / tails
We have a test that a coin is fair
Here is what an unfair coin might do
Here is a longer look
Coin observations Errors happen early
If chance and bias coincide , decide fast
If they oppose , decide very , very slowly
There is a very large range
A /B test simulation I ran multiple simulations of 100,000 parallel A/B tests
Each simulation had a known real difference , and ran to a known confidence level
Each step of the simulation added a person to A and B , then tested statistical significance
Here are the results ...
Best Case Example
A's conversion rate : 55 %
B 's conversion rate : 50 %
So 10 % improvement on a good conversion rate
Errors
Completion
Low Conversion Example A's conversion rate : 11 %
B 's conversion rate : 10 %
So 10 % improvement on a bad conversion rate
Errors
Completion
Low Lift Example
A's conversion rate : 51 %
B 's conversion rate : 50 %
So 2 % improvement on a good conversion rate
Errors
Completion
A /B test simulation conclusions Confidence does not mean odds of being right
Mistakes are made early
Time to finish is extremely variable
10,000 trials is enough for many useful A/B tests
How long that takes depends on your website 's volume
Tests may take much , much longer than that
More conclusions
Tests run faster with more volume
Tests run faster with higher converting questions
Your highest volume is at the top of the conversion funnel
Your highest conversion is from one step to the next in the conversion funnel
Plan your tests accordingly
Running multiple tests A/ B tests can take a while to finish
We have many A/B tests that we'd like to run
It would be nice to not have to wait
I have good news for you
You DON 'T have to wait !
Running multiple tests at once
As long as people are randomly assigned to tests
And no combination of test cases is really bad
Each test 's influence on the others is a random factor
But there are other random factors ( eg age , gender , income ... )
Does n't matter to the statistics
Random assignment is essential
The test version should be chosen with rand ( )
Programmers often want to assign by $ person_id mod 2
That guarantees a perfectly even distribution of A and B
But it also synchronizes one test with another
Causing one test to affect the results of another
You need those interactions to be random
Bad combinations are a lesser concern Test 1 : displaying 24 vs 96 images at a time
Test 2 : displaying thumbnails vs larger pictures
96 larger pictures may be a bad experience
So you would n't want to test these at the same time
This kind of conflict is rare
Tip :
Do many small tests
Suppose you have 5 changes between A and B
You will get one yes / no answer
Some changes might be good , some bad , you have no insight
5 parallel tests is far more informative
And finishes about as fast
A/B/ C... testing the wrong way
We often want to test more than 2 versions against each other
Statistics books say g-test ( and its relative chi-square ) works for more than 2x2
With $n versions , and $m possible answers , you can set up the table like we did ...
versions , and possible answers , you can set up the table like we did ... do the same calculations ( with more variables ) ...
and $p = chisqrprob ( ( $ n - 1 ) * ( $ m - 1 ) , $ g_test )
Why is this wrong ?
The statistics books are right ...
but you can't interpret your answer !
You know that there is a difference , but not what it is
a difference , but not it is That 's not good enough for us
We need a winner
Extreme example Suppose we have 10 million versions
Half convert at 51 % , half at 49 %
At 21 samples each you know they are different
But you can't tell the 51 % versions from the 49 % versions !
A/B/ C... testing take 2
Try to show that the best is better than the worst
So compare the best with the worst using the g-test
We get a probability $p of our result for a random pair
of our result for a random pair
But we expect the best and worst to be different
So a low $p is more likely than chisqrprob says
is more likely than chisqrprob says
We need a fudge factor to correct
Finding the right fudge factor
There are $ n * ( $ n - 1 ) / 2 pairs of versions
pairs of versions
Therefore a low $p could happen this many ways
could happen this many ways
That 's a lower bound on $ p
Let 's verify by simulating a million A/B tests
Here are the resulting graphs
$ n*( $ n - 1 ) / 2 is indeed a close estimate at the point where we want to make decisions
A/B/ C... testing the right way Run your A/B test with $n versions
versions Compare the best with the worst
Multiply $p by an appropriate fudge factor
by an appropriate fudge factor
If $p is small enough , drop the worst version
is small enough , drop the worst version Repeat until you have found your winner
Back to theory
The G - test is a very powerful tool
However there are things it can't do
Plus we should look at a couple of things more deeply
For that we need some more theory
Some basic terms
Let X be a random variable
be a random variable The expected value , E ( X ) , is what you expect the arithmetic average of many samples to be
, is what you expect the arithmetic average of many samples to be The variance , Var ( X ) , measures variability .
It is defined as E ( ( X - E ( X ) ) 2 ) = E( X 2 ) - E(X ) 2
, measures variability .
It is defined as The standard deviation , Std ( X ) , is sqrt( Var ( X ) )
Distribution of the fair coin
Let 's consider the case of a fair coin
Heads we call it 1 , tails is 0
The expected value is 0 * p ( 0 ) +
1 *p(1 ) = 0*0.5 + 1*0.5 = 0.5
The variance is ( 0 - 0.5 ) 2 * p ( 0 ) + ( 1 - 0.5 ) 2 * p ( 1 ) = 0.25*0.5 + 0.25*0.5 = 0.25
The standard deviation is sqrt( variance ) = sqrt( 0.25 ) = 0.5
Basic properties
Let X and Y be independent random variables , and k be a constant
Then the following hold
E( X+Y ) = E( X ) + E( Y ) , and Var ( X+Y ) = Var ( X ) + Var(Y )
, and E ( k+X ) = k + E( X ) , and Var( k+X ) = Var(X )
, and E ( k* X ) = k * E( X ) , and Var( k* X ) = k2 * Var(X )
Estimating E( X ) and Var(X ) Suppose x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n are independent observations of a random variable X
are independent observations of a random variable
Then the arithmetic average is an estimate of expected value
E ( X ) ≈ ( x 1 + x 2 + ... + x n ) /
n
If m is the arithmetic average
Var (X ) ≈ ( Σ i=1 n(x i - m ) 2 ) /( n - 1 )
The normal distributions
The standard normal is the classic " bell curve "
Statistics : : Distributions and statistics - distributions.js tell you everything you need to know about the standard normal with udistr ( $p ) and uprob ( $x ) .
and .
There is a normal distribution for any given expected value and variance
If X is a standard normal , then a +bX is a normal distribution with expected value a and variance b 2
is a standard normal , then is a normal distribution with expected value and variance Conversely if Y is a normal distribution then ( Y - E ( Y ) ) / Std(Y ) is a standard normal
Central Limit Theorem Suppose x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n are independent observations of a random variable X
are independent observations of a random variable Then x 1 + x 2 + ... + x n has approximately a normal distribution with expected value n*E ( X ) and variance n* Var(X )
has approximately a normal distribution with expected value and variance
This is one of the most important theorems in math
This is the most important theorem in statistics
most important theorem in statistics
This is why people care about normal distributions
100 coin flips
Let 's return to the fair coin , with expected value 0.5 , variance 0.25 and standard deviation 0.5
If we flip it 100 times , we get approximately a normal distribution with expected value 50 , variance 25 , and standard deviation 5
The odds of > 42.5 heads is uprob(( 42.5-50 ) /5 = uprob( - 1.5 ) = 0.93319
97.5 % of the time you are > udistr ( 0.975 ) * 5 + 50 = 40.2
2.5 % of the time you are > udistr ( 0.25 ) * 5 + 50 = 59.8
The theoretical 95 % confidence interval is ( 40.2 , 59.8 ) , which is ( 40 , 60 ) due to discreteness
Convergence to the mean
What is the distribution of ( X 1 + ... + X n )/n ?
?
Its expected value is E ( X ) and its variance is n*Var ( X ) / n 2 = Var(X ) /
n
and its variance is
It is approximately normal
Here is its graph for the fair coin
It takes 25 times as much data to make it 5 times as precise
We saw that in comparing our best case and low lift examples
What is the Chi-square distribution ?
What is this chisqrprob ( 1 , $ g_test ) we 've been using ?
we 've been using ?
Suppose that X is a standard normal
is a standard normal Then X 2 has a 1 - dimensional Chi-square distribution
has a 1 - dimensional Chi-square distribution
The sum of n independent 1 - dim Chi-squares has the n-dimensional Chi-square distribution
chisqrprob(n , x ) and chisqrdistr( n , p ) describe the Chi-square distribution with n degrees of freedom
History of the G- test In 1900 Pearson came up with the G - test while studying log likelihood ratios
He found its distribution
He created the more conveniently calculated Chi-square test
The Chi-square test is the same as the G - test , only with terms of the form ( $ measured - $ expected ) 2 / $ expected .
.
The Chi-square test was widely adopted
The G - test is better
The Yates ' continuity correction
The G - test and chi-square tests err on the small side
So we might end A/B tests too early
Frank Yates suggested adjusting all measured values 0.5 towards the expected values
... because an ideal 40.2 vs 59.8 observation is really going to be 40 vs 60
This correction improves accuracy slightly
How much money did we make ?
People often want to measure improvements in dollars
They also want confidence ranges
The G - test does n't give either
This can be frustrating
A /B Testing Setup Divide people into A and B
Track them , figure how well each performed ( eg revenue per person ) , including those who earned nothing
those who earned nothing
That is our raw data
How to analyze it ?
First attempt , sidestep
Often you can assume that the lift in conversion is proportional to dollars
Not always true
Particularly if you 're testing directing more attention to your best customers
Questions like , " How many are above __ ( page views , dollars , etc ) ? " can address that
Still not satisfactory
Second attempt , standard statistics
We look in a statistics book
And find that the t- test using the Student 's t- distribution is meant to solve our exact problem , likewise ANOVA
Unfortunately they only work if data is normally distributed
Business data is not normally distributed
normally distributed Neither test is applicable
What does business data look like ?
In 1906 economist Vilfredo Pareto noted that 20 % of the people owned 80 % of of the wealth
He found a family of power law distributions to describe this
Pareto distributions turn up in many places such as individual wealth , size of cities , file sizes ...
size of sand particles , math papers published , areas burned by forest fires , bugs in modules , traffic on blogs ...
and one likely approximates the value of your customers
What about at the extreme ?
Pareto distributions lead to extremes
The top samples follow Zipf 's law
Zipf 's law says the n'th largest measurement is about 1/n times the size of the largest
It turns up all over , including word frequency , book sales , photographs taken , lengths of rivers ...
and likely in the value of your top customers
Ignoring the extreme Statistics is not a good way to get to know these people
Better would be dinner and a nice bottle of wine
We may need to truncate the extremes away
Choose a cutoff to truncate at
Truncate everything above that cutoff to that cutoff before doing your statistics
Third attempt , z - test Define mean ( A ) to be sum( A ) / count ( A )
to be We saw that mean ( A ) is approximately normal with variance Var( A ) / count ( A )
is approximately normal with variance Similarly mean( B ) is approximately normal with variance Var( B ) / count ( B )
is approximately normal with variance mean ( A ) - mean ( B ) is approximately normal with variance Var( A ) / count ( A ) + Var( B ) / count( B )
z - test cont . ( mean ( A ) - mean ( B ) ) / sqrt( Var( A ) / count ( A ) + Var ( B ) / count ( B ) )
If A and B have the same average , the above is approximately a standard normal
We use our estimates of the variances of A and B
uprob ( $x ) gives us the probability $ p_larger that a standard normal is greater than this number
gives us the probability that a standard normal is greater than this number Our confidence as a percentage is 200 * abs ( 0.5 - $ p_larger ) , you can also create confidence intervals for the difference
, you can also create confidence intervals for the difference See the Perl utility z - test - example for an implementation
Limitations
This assumes our estimate of the variance is correct
This assumes the normal is a good approximation
Define the variance weight of an observation to be the percent the estimated variance goes down if you take that observation out of the data set
If the variance weight of the largest elements of A and B are both under 1 % , the z - test is reasonably accurate
Truncation may be necessary
Reconsider the G - test ?
The z - test works
It is slower than the G- test
It is more complicated than the G- test
If you can , use the G - test instead

The next slides have some of the questions that came up during and after the talk .
And there were questions
How long have you been doing A/B testing ?
I think my first A/B test was in late 2003 .
So nearly 5 years .
What organizational impacts are there ?
A /B testing may be initially threatening to those who perceive themselves as experts .
So do your best to have your first couple of A/ B tests be fairly easy wins with the product manager on board .
One you have financial results it is easier to handle people who do n't like discovering that their pronouncements are not infallible .

What you refuse to see , is your worst trap has more to say on why people do n't like these challenges .
And more questions
How do you budget the time for A/B testing ?
Generally the time to set up A/B tests comes out the regular development schedule .
That is why I made such a big deal out of making it as lightweight as possible on the developers .
There are a lot of demands on developers , and schedule pressure is one of them .
You want to avoid having reasons to push back .
Currently my job is reporting .
Reporting on A/B tests is one of my responsibilities .
However if you do n't have a dedicated person for reporting ( we did n't when I first worked on A / B testing ) then the time to develop reports will again come out of your development budget .
Which is a good reason to try to reuse reporting from one project to another .
And more questions
What if we want to do this in Java ?
All of the code presented is easily written in any language , including Java , except for the call to chisqrdistr .
My suggestion there is to get All of the code presented is easily written in any language , including Java , except for the call to chisqrdistr .
My suggestion there is to get Rhino and then you can embed statistics - distributions.js in your Java program and call it .
You only need to call one function .
For other languages you can set up a command line utility or a web service .
Unless you want to port the utility again ...
If you want to port the library then I suggest starting with the JavaScript version .
It is more consistently parenthesized so there will be fewer possible gotchas .
And more questions
What do you think of Google 's Website Optimizer ?
If you want to get going on A / B testing and do n't want to worry about doing any of the reporting , are concerned you 'll get it wrong , etc , then by all means use it .
However be aware that it has a number of major limitations .
It works by using JavaScript to inject static content into your page .
The fact that it is static makes it hard to have the bit that you 're A/B testing be dynamic .
You can do it , by having it inject some JavaScript that dynamically rewrites your HTML , but that is hackish .

It does n't support multiple metrics .
It ca n't be used to A/B test email content .
If none of those are a problem for you , then by all means use it .
However I think the flexibility of doing it yourself are worthwhile .
And more questions
What about A/B testing large pieces of functionality ?
You can A /B test anything .
However with large projects it may not make sense during development to try to hide it behind an A /B test .
In that case you could just release the project and then start A/B testing features within it .
Which way you go is up to you .

( Maybe you 'd like to help ? )
A few weeks back , I came across a charmingly nasty site called “ Christian Cross Talk ” whose author devoted his every entry to explaining in depth how and why he hates atheists and blames us for every problem in society .
( Sadly , the site has apparently disappeared in the interim , or I ’d give a link . )
One of his posts presented itself as a point - by - point refutation of my atheist ’s creed .
Quoted below are some of his responses to various points of the creed :
Through the use of reason and conscience , we can perceive morality , defined as the principles of behavior , which produce the greatest happiness and the least suffering both now and in the future .
For who ?
Happiness for who ?
For me ?
For you ?
Why should I care about you , unless God is real , and He is .
The only ethical form of government is democracy .
Every society has both the right and the obligation to revolt against and overthrow any other system .
Ha !
SAYS WHO !
Why do atheists act all moral and make statements of moral absolute when they have no moral foundation whatsoever .
Right and wrong imply an authority that makes it right or wrong .
Human beings possess fundamental rights and freedoms upon which no one may infringe .
Among these are freedom of conscience , freedom of expression , freedom of association , the right to privacy , the right to an education , the right to live in peace and safety , and the right to seek happiness .
Says who ?
If it is n’t God saying it , who cares what he thinks is right ?
What ’s ironic about this is that , as you can see , this apologist does n’t actually disagree with most of what I have to say .
He just thinks that I should n’t be allowed to make statements about right and wrong because I ’m an atheist , which is why he punctuates his response with grade - school - like chants of “ Says who ?
Says who ? ”
He ’s not the only one , either .
As we ’ve all seen , this is a common response of theists to atheists who offer principles of ethical behavior : the claim that , because we do not believe in an absolute Authority , we have no way to justify the principles we propose .
But morality cannot be a matter of “ who ” .
Plato showed why over two thousand years ago in the Euthyphro , and his dilemma still stands : Does God command something because it is good , or is it good because God commands it ?
If it ’s the former , then there is an absolute morality that is not the creation of God , and the question “ Says who ? ” becomes irrelevant – morality exists regardless of what anyone says .
If it ’s the latter , then there is no morality at all , merely the exercise of God ’s whim .
If you assume that morality is a question of “ says who ” – that what constitutes morality is defined by the decrees of some authority figure – then you must believe that that authority figure could change the morality of an action by mere fiat without changing any of the relevant facts .
Could the very same act be either good or bad , based purely on how God chooses to view it ?
This is clearly absurd .
Treating morality as if it had to be the decree of someone is the theistic conception , not ours .
We should decline to play their rigged game .
Instead , rather than a matter of “ who ” , we should argue that morality is and must be a matter of “ why ” .
That is , rather than something imposed by an external authority , morality should be viewed as a set of rational principles which intelligent agents freely agree to abide by – not because they are commanded to do so , but because reason prescribes it as the best course of action for the benefit of all .
This rational , humanist worldview , not a list of arbitrary commands decreed by fiat , is the only philosophy that truly deserves the name of morality .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Major powers gave Iran two weeks to answer calls to rein in its nuclear programme on Saturday or face tougher sanctions after talks ended in stalemate despite unprecedented U.S. participation .
A U.S. State Department spokesman said Washington hoped Iran now understood that it had a choice between cooperation and “ confrontation , which can only lead to further isolation ” .
But prospects of ending a row that has triggered regional tensions and rattled oil markets looked dim as Iran ’s top nuclear negotiator insisted Tehran would not even discuss a demand to freeze uranium enrichment at the next meeting .
“ We still did n’t get the answer we were looking for , ” European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said after some six hours of talks in Geneva with Iran ’s Saeed Jalili and envoys from the United States , Russia , China , France , Germany and Britain -- the so - called sextet of world powers .
Solana said he hoped for a clear answer from Tehran in around two weeks to a month - old sextet offer of trade and technical incentives to halt enrichment .
Asked whether Tehran would otherwise face a new round of the U.N. Security Council sanctions that analysts say are already beginning to bite on its economy , he told a news conference :
“ The Iranians know very well what will continue to happen if nothing happens otherwise . ”
Diplomats said the presence of senior U.S. envoy William Burns at the talks underlined the unity of major powers in the dispute , and stressed that patience was running out with Iran .
“ There is nothing more to talk about .
The Iranians are running the risk of foreclosing their options , ” said one diplomat in Gevena , warning they risked “ going down the path which means further measures in the EU and the U.N . ”
Solana said he hoped for more contacts with Iran “ telephonically or physically ” , but officials made clear that any subsequent contacts would be at a lower level than Saturday ’s talks .
COOPERATION OR CONFRONTATION
In Washington , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said : “ We hope the Iranian people understand that their leaders need to make a choice between cooperation , which would bring benefits to all , and confrontation , which can only lead to further isolation . ”
The U.N. has imposed three sets of sanctions on Iran in a stand - off that goes back to the revelation in 2002 by an exiled opposition group of the existence of a uranium enrichment facility and heavy water plant in the country .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Those political and economic sanctions already target the country ’s banks and include visa bans on officials and measures against companies seen as linked to the nuclear programme .
Iran , the world ’s fourth - largest oil producer , rejects suspicions that it wants the atom bomb and says its nuclear programme is intended to generate electricity .
Asked by Reuters if Tehran would consider a demand to suspend enrichment as a precondition for full negotiations on its nuclear programme , Saeed Jalili said : “ We will only discuss common points of the package . ”
Slideshow ( 6 images )
In a bid to kickstart those negotiations , world powers have also proposed that Tehran first freeze expansion of its nuclear programme in return for the U.N. Security Council halting further sanctions measures .
But a senior Iranian diplomat ruled that out too .
“ Of course we will not discuss the freeze - for - freeze topic in the next meeting with Solana ...
The freeze - for - freeze issue cannot be accepted because this ( enrichment ) is our right and we will never abandon our nuclear right .
The high - level U.S. participation in the meeting , together with Iranian comments playing down the likelihood of an attack by the United States or Israel , had earlier in the week raised hopes of progress and helped lower oil prices from record highs .
Yet that optimism was tempered even before the meeting as both the United States and Iran insisted their policy would not change .
Lebanon tense after Hezbollah power grab By Jocelyne Zablit BEIRUT , Saturday ( AFP ) - Lebanon was steeped in tension today after Hezbollah seized control of west Beirut in what the ruling Western - backed coalition branded an armed coup orchestrated with the help of Iran and Syria .
At least 18 people were killed in the fighting that pitted Sunni supporters of the ruling bloc against Shiite members of the opposition and brought the country dangerously close to a new civil war .
Washington blasted the power grab by Hezbollah and also pointed the finger at Iran and Syria for the unrest , saying they must be held to account .
" The United States is consulting with other governments in the region and with the UN Security Council about measures that must be taken to hold those responsible for the violence in Beirut accountable , " the White House said .
A senior US official declined to list any specific steps , and emphasised that there would not be a " one-size - fits - all " approach to Tehran , Damascus , and the Shiite militant group that Washington brands a terrorist organisation .
An uneasy calm settled over west Beirut today as people ventured out in the affected areas and cleaning crews swept away the debris .
Few armed elements could be seen on the streets and the army was out in force manning roadblocks .
However , the main road leading to the airport remained blocked for a fourth straight day and there were no scheduled incoming or outgoing flights .
" The presence of armed elements has significantly decreased and there is no danger any more for civilians , " an army spokesman told AFP .
Foreigners , meanwhile , continued leaving the country by road to Syria , with Turkey and Kuwait evacuating their citizens on Saturday .
The unrest led to urgent international appeals for calm as Arab foreign ministers prepared to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on Sunday amid fears among Sunni governments of an increase in the influence in Lebanon of Shiite Iran .
The fighting was sparked by the government 's decision to probe a communication network set up by Hezbollah and to sack the head of airport security over his alleged links with the militant group .
The violence that ensued between Sunni and Shiite militants marked a turning point in the 18 - month political crisis that has virtually paralysed the government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora and left the country with no president .
" Will Siniora go back on his decisions or will he resign and resolve the country 's crisis ? " asked the opposition newspaper Ad - Diyar on Saturday .
" Political impasse and insecurity -- Hezbollah 's pyrrhic victory , " said the pro-government L'Orient Le Jour .
Analysts said there were fears the violence could spread beyond Lebanon 's borders .
" Hezbollah had said before it would never point its arms against its own country , but it has crossed this line , " said Nadim Shehadi , Lebanon expert at the Chatham House think - tank in London .
" Hezbollah has crossed a huge red line , and it means Iran has crossed this line .
The political consequences are immense -- it could escalate regionally . "
Both sides appeared unwilling to give any further ground , with the opposition insisting that the roadblocks that have paralysed west Beirut and the airport road would remain until the government meets its demands .
" We are not carrying out a coup -- all of this is related to the government 's decisions , " an opposition official told AFP .
" We are offering partnership ... and they want to monopolise power and limit our share . "
But Youth and Sports Minister Ahmed Fatfat ruled out any chance of the government going back on its decision to probe the communications network that Hezbollah insists is essential to its defences against Israel .
" It would be easier for the government to resign than to revoke its decision , " Fatfat told AFP .
Lebanon 's long - running political standoff , which first erupted in November 2006 when six pro-Syrian ministers quit the cabinet , has left it without a president since November , when Damascus protege Emile Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term of office .
Syrian President Bashar al - Assad said the unrest was a purely " internal affair " but called for dialogue .
Lebanon 's crippling political divide is widely seen as an extension of the confrontation pitting the United States and its Arab allies against Syria and Iran .

Here ’s a post from Jennifer 8 .
Lee , who wrote an article on fortune cookies in China for Wednesday ’s Dining section :
Are fortune cookies Chinese ?
Clearly not .
They are arguably more American ( by way of Japan ) , judging by the way that people in China react to fortune cookies — with a mixture of confusion and amusement .
As part of research for my book , The Fortune Cookie Chronicles , I went around China handing out fortune cookies to random people ( my bellhop , people on the street , vendors ) and recorded their reactions .
Often times , they would put the cookies in their mouth , and then be surprised when they found a piece of paper either in their mouth or in a cookie .
Fortune cookies are not intuitive .
This was confirmed when I discovered a woman named Nana Shi who was making fortune cookies in China .
But she too put instructions on the red wrapper telling people to break the cookie before eating them because they were necessary .
Americans find high emotional attachment to the slips inside their cookies , looking to them for winning lottery numbers and becoming upset when the fortunes inside are unfortunate .
The Chinese , on the other hand , would often tell me after trying the curved vanilla - flavored wafers , “ Americans are so strange , why are they putting pieces of paper in their cookies ? ”

29 July 2008 - Version 1.1 Released
Thanks for the suggestions for improvements -
This version fixes several bugs and adds some more features and chart types including
Check out the short write up i posted to the new Splunk Wiki for the code and data I used to make it work ( it was really easy ) and if you download your own free copy of Splunk you can try it yourself ;-)
14 August 2008 - Using Sparklines with Splunk I gave a quick 5 minute demo at the Splunk Developers Boot Camp on using the Splunk PHP SDK with jquery .
sparkline.js to chart the traffic this page received within the first few days of its launch .
See the changelog for the complete list of changes .
19 November 2008 - Version 1.2 Released
Some important bug fixes amongst some basic new features :
Finally I updated the site and docs somewhat as the old layout was looking a little cramped .
This version also adds a new function called $.sparkline_display_visible ( ) -
Call this anytime sparklines that were drawn into a non-displayed element may have just become visible so that they will be correctly rendered .
For example , this site uses the function to make sure sparklines displayed in the various tabbed pages are drawn when the tab is selected .
25 January 2009 - Version 1.3 Released
This version fixes some positioning issues on all platforms and adds some support for Internet Explorer 8 .
IE 8 beta 2 ( the latest beta release ) seems to have some VML bugs though that I have n't been able to work around yet , so the results are n't perfect .
Also at this time IE8 RC1 is out ..
It looks like sparklines work fairly well in this release , although the small circles used in line charts , box plots , etc. do n't show up .
This release also includes a few bug fixes including one where lines would not always appear crisp in canvas based browsers such as Firefox .
27 March 2009 - Version 1.4.1 Released
This is a bug fix release -
It addresses an off - by - one - pixel error when rendering sparklines in Internet Explorer .
It also addresses some issues with sparklines not being rendered in some situations with jQuery 1.3 and higher .
25 April 2009 - Version 1.4.2 Released
This release just fixes the drawing of circular spots on line charts for Internet Explorer 8 .
Over 3,000 people have bookmarked this site on delicious now !
Only 7 votes on the jQuery plugins site though ; maybe you could help with that ;-)
14 September 2009 - Version 1.4.3 Released
This version adds support for null values for line and bar charts , updates the default pie chart colours , adds the colorMap option for bar charts and adds a lineWidth option for line charts .
-
See the changelog for full details .
See the changelog for the complete list of changes .
26 February 2010 - Version 1.5 Released
This version contains a number of minor updates and fixes , including :
1 March 2010 - Version 1.5.1
Released
I accidentally left a stray comma in the 1.5 release which breaks compatibility with Internet Explorer .
This version contains only a fix for that bug .
See the changelog for the complete list of changes .
30 November 2010 - Version 1.6 Released
This release primarily makes it easier to work with the sparklines if your environment requires you to pass options such as colours , etc. on the tags themselves , rather than feeding them to the sparkline function .
It also allows for values to passed as an attribute on the tag , as well as a comment inside the tag .
This avoids the values being displayed on screen briefly before the sparkline function has a chance to execute .
Also check out Splunk 4.3 -
This project was originally written for that product and it finally shipped with it ;-)
Now you can have sparklines in your Splunk dashboards .
There 's a few non -code updates as well :
It should be fully backwards compatible with the 1.x versions with the following exceptions :
See the full changelog for details of all changes .
15 October 2012 - Version 2.1 Released
This release is primarily a bug - fix release , but also adds support for Internet Explorer 10 .
See the full changelog for details of all changes .
If you 're using a version of jQuery later than 1.8 , be extra sure you 're not rendering your page in quirks mode to avoid breaking tooltips for IE users .
See jQuery 's notes on quirks compatiblity for more info .
26 January 2013 - Version 2.1.1 Relased
This release adds support for jQuery 1.9.0 along with a couple of other bug fixes .
See the full changelog for details of all changes .
15 June 2013 - Version 2.1.2 Relased
This release adds support for jQuery 1.10.0 and other bug fixes and minor improvements .
Documentation
Quick Start
To add some sparklines to your web page you need four things :
The jQuery javascript library loaded into the page - At least version 1.4.3 or higher A copy of jquery .
sparkline.js loaded into the page which you can download from this site
An inline tag on the page within which to display the sparkline ( eg. < span > ) A call to the sparkline ( ) function to actually display the sparkline .
Additionally rendering the page in standards mode ( see the DOCTYPE declaration in the example below ) maximizes compatibilty with Internet Explorer .
Here 's a simple web page that will display some sparklines :
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < head > < script type =" text / javascript " src= " jquery - 1.7.2.js " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" jquery.sparkline.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { /**
This code runs when everything has been loaded on the page */ /*
Inline sparklines take their values from the contents of the tag */ $ ('.inlinesparkline ' ) .sparkline ( ) ; /* Sparklines can also take their values from the first argument passed to the sparkline ( ) function */ var myvalues = [ 10,8,5,7,4,4,1 ] ; $ ( '.dynamicsparkline ' ) .sparkline( myvalues ) ; /*
The second argument gives options such as chart type */ $ ( '.dynamicbar ' ) .
sparkline ( myvalues , {type : ' bar ' , barColor : ' green'} ) ; /*
Use ' html ' instead of an array of values to pass options to a sparkline with data in the tag */ $ ( '.inlinebar ' ) .sparkline ( ' html ' , {type : ' bar ' , barColor : ' red'} ) ; } ) ; </ script > </ head > < body > < p >
Inline Sparkline : < span class=" inlinesparkline "
>1,4,4,7,5,9,10</span >.
</p> < p >
Sparkline with dynamic data : < span class =" dynamicsparkline " >
Loading ..</ span > </p> < p >
Bar chart with dynamic data : < span class =" dynamicbar " > Loading ..</ span > </p> < p >
Bar chart with inline data : < span class= " inlinebar " >
1,3,4,5,3,5</span >
</ p> </ body > </html >
Click here to open this example in a new window .
As the example shows , the values to be used in a sparkline can either be supplied inline , inside the tag to be used as the target or can be passed as the first parameter to the sparkline ( ) function .
To draw different types of charts , or overlay one on top of another , or display charts into hidden layers , read on .
Syntax
$ ( selector ) .sparkline ( values , options ) ;
Values can either be an array of numbers or " html " which causes the values to be read from from the selected tag :
< span class= " sparklines " >
1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1</span> < span id =" ticker " " > Loading ..</ span > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( '.sparklines ' ) .sparkline ( ' html ' ) ; $ ( ' # ticker ' ) .
sparkline ( [ 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1 ] ) ; </ script >
Values supplied in the tag can also appear inside a comment , or as an attribute of the tag itself :
< span class= " sparklines " ><!--
1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1 --></span> < span class= " sparklines " values= "
1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1 " ></ span >
By default the plugin will look for an attribute called " values " on the tag to find values to render , but you can change this by setting the tagValuesAttribute option .
This can be useful if you want to create a composite graph as you can use different names for the values attribute for each graph .
Options is an object that specifies the type of sparkline to draw , colours to use , etc .
$ ( ' # barchart ' ) .
sparkline ( myvalues , { type : ' bar ' , barColor : ' green ' } ) ;
If necessary , options can be passed as attributes on each tag .
This requires setting the enableTagOptions option when calling the sparklines ( ) function and reduces performance somewhat ( more critical on IE6 )
< span class= " sparklines " sparkType= " bar " sparkBarColor = " green " ><!--
1,2,3,4,3,2,1 --></span> < span class= " sparklines " sparkType= " bar " sparkBarColor= " red " ><!--
1,2,3,4,3,2,1 --></span > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( '.sparklines ' ) .sparkline ( 'html ' , { enableTagOptions : true } ) ; </ script >
Each option must be prefixed with " spark " , though this can be changed by passing a tagOptionPrefix option to the sparkline ( ) function
You can also override the default options for all subsequent sparklines by assigning values to $ .fn.sparkline.defaults
Eg. to change the default line color as listed in the common options below , you can do :
$.fn.sparkline.defaults.common.lineColor = 'red ';
Replace ' common ' with ' line ' , ' bar ' , ' tristate ' , ' discrete ' , ' bullet ' , ' pie ' or ' box ' to set options specific to those chart types .
Common Options
These options can be set for most of the supported chart types .
type
One of ' line ' ( default ) , ' bar ' , ' tristate ' , ' discrete ' , ' bullet ' , ' pie ' or ' box ' width Width of the chart - Defaults to ' auto ' -
May be any valid css width - 1.5em , 20 px , etc ( using a number without a unit specifier wo n't do what you want ) -
This option does nothing for bar and tristate chars ( see barWidth ) height Height of the chart - Defaults to ' auto ' ( line height of the containing tag ) lineColor Used by line and discrete charts to specify the colour of the line drawn as a CSS values string fillColor Specify the colour used to fill the area under the graph as a CSS value .
Set to false to disable fill chartRangeMin Specify the minimum value to use for the range of Y values of the chart - Defaults to the minimum value supplied chartRangeMax Specify the maximum value to use for the range of Y values of the chart - Defaults to the maximum value supplied composite
If true then do n't erase any existing chart attached to the tag , but draw another chart over the top - Note that width and height are ignored if an existing chart is detected .
Note :
You 'll usually want to lock the axis on both charts using chartRangeMin and chartRangeMax if you want the same value on each chart to occupy the same point .
enableTagOptions
If true then options can be specified as attributes on each tag to be transformed into a sparkline , as well as passed to the sparkline ( ) function .
See also tagOptionPrefix tagOptionPrefix
String that each option passed as an attribute on a tag must begin with .
Defaults to ' spark ' tagValuesAttribute
The name of the tag attribute to fetch values from , if present - Defaults to ' values ' disableHiddenCheck
Set to true to disable checking for hidden sparklines .
This can be beneficial if you know you 'll never attempt to draw a sparkline into a hidden parent element as it avoids a browser reflow for the test , increasing rendering performance .
Defaults to false - New in 2.0
Range Maps
Several parameters , such as colorMap and tooltipLookupValues accept a range map as a paramter .
As the name suggest , it maps ranges of numbers to values .
For example :
var range_map = $ .range_map ( { 1 : ' red ' , ' 2:9 ' : ' yellow ' , ' 10 : ' : ' red ' })
This would map 1 to red , values of 2 through 9 ( inclusive ) to yellow and values of 10 and higher to 'red '
Hidden Sparklines
If you try to display a sparkline in a tag that 's currently not visible ( ie. the tag or one of its parents are set to display : none ) then you 'll find that the sparkline has n't been rendered when you finally do make the tag visible .
This is because a tag with display : none has no size , and thus a canvas can't be created and sized for the sparkline to be rendered to .
The solution is to call the $.sparkline_display_visible ( ) function anytime a sparkline may have become visible so that it can be correctly rendered .
This is the technique this site uses to handle the sparklines that are hidden in the different tabbed sections ; the site calls the routine in the tab - changed callback .
Note that as of version 2.0 , support for hidden sparklines can be disabled by supplying the disabled HiddenCheck option .
This can result in a performance increase in some cases .
Line Charts
8,4,0,0,0,0,1,4,4,10,10,10,10,0,0,0,4,6,5,9,10
Line charts are the default chart type , but to specify the type explicitly set an option called " type " to " line " .
defaultPixelsPerValue Defaults to 3 pixels of width for each value in the chart spotColor The CSS colour of the final value marker .
Set to false or an empty string to hide it minSpotColor
The CSS colour of the marker displayed for the mimum value .
Set to false or an empty string to hide it maxSpotColor
The CSS colour of the marker displayed for the maximum value .
Set to false or an empty string to hide it spotRadius Radius of all spot markers ,
In pixels ( default : 1.5 ) - Integer valueSpots Specifies which points to draw spots on , and with which colour .
Accepts a range .
For example , to render green spots on all values less than 50 and red on values higher use {': 49 ' : ' green , ' 50 : ' : ' red'}
- New in 2.0 highlightSpotColor
Specifies a colour for the spot that appears on a value when moused over .
Set to null to disable .
Defaults to # f5 f - New in 2.0 highlightLineColor
Specifies a colour for the vertical line that appears through a value when moused over .
Set to null to disable .
Defaults to # f22 - New in 2.0 lineWidth
In pixels ( default : 1 ) - Integer normalRangeMin , normalRangeMax
Specify threshold values between which to draw a bar to denote the " normal " or expected range of values .
For example the green bar here
80,85,84,88,98,114,116,104,95,85,84 might denote a normal operating temperature range drawNormalOnTop
By default the normal range is drawn behind the fill area of the chart .
Setting this option to true causes it to be drawn over the top of the fill area xvalues See below chartRangeClip
If true then the y values supplied to plot will be clipped to fall between chartRangeMin and chartRangeMax -
By default chartRangeMin / Max just ensure that the chart spans at least that range of values , but does not constrain it chartRangeMinX Specifies the minimum value to use for the X value of the chart chartRangeMaxX Specifies the maximum value to use for the X value of the chart
See also all of the common options above , that can also be used with line charts
By default the values supplied to line charts are presumed to be y values mapping on to sequential ( integer ) x values .
If you need to specify both the x and y values for your chart , you have a few options :
Inline : x and y values are separated by a colon : x:y , x:y , x:y - eg. < span class = " linechart " >
1:3,2.7:4,4.8:3</span >
Array of arrays : An array of [ x , y ] arrays : $ ( ' #linechart ' ) .sparkline ( [ [ 1,3 ] , [ 2.7,4 ] , [ 4.8,3 ] ] ) ;
Separate arrays :
Pass x values separately : $ ( ' # linechart ' ) . sparkline ( [ 3,4,3 ] , { xvalues : [ 1,2.7,4.8 ] } ) ;
You can also specify a value of " null " to omit values from the chart completely .
eg :
< span class =" linechart " >
1,2,3, null,3,4,2</span > becomes :
1,2,3 , null,3,4,2
Bar Charts
10,8,9,3,5,8,5
- 3,1,2,0,3,-1
1,3,4, null,3,2,4 0:2,2:4,4:2,4:1
Set the " type " option to " bar " to generate bar charts .
Values can be omitted by using the " null " value instead of a number .
barColor CSS colour used for postive values negBarColor CSS colour used for negative values zeroColor CSS colour used for values equal to zero nullColor CSS colour used for values equal to null -
By default null values are omitted entirely , but setting this adds a thin marker for the entry -
This can be useful if your chart is pretty sparse ; perhaps try setting it to a light grey or something equally unobtrusive barWidth Width of each bar , in pixels ( integer ) barSpacing Space between each bar , in pixels ( integer ) zeroAxis Centers the y - axis at zero if true ( default ) colorMap A range map to map specific values to selected colours .
For example if you want all values of - 2 to appear yellow , use colorMap : { ' - 2 ' : ' # ff0 ' } .
As of version 1.5 you may also pass an array of values here instead of a mapping to specifiy a color for each individual bar .
For example if your chart has three values 1,3,1 you can set colorMap = [ " red " , " green " , " blue " ]
As of version 2.0 , objects will be automatically be converted to range maps so you can specify colours for a range of values stacked BarColor An array of colours to use for stacked bar charts .
The first series will use the first value in the array , the second series will use the second , etc. New in 2.0
See also all of the common options above , that can also be used with bar charts
Version 2.0 adds support for stacked bar charts .
Values for each data series in the chart can be separated by colons if passed by html , or as an array of arrays .
For example , to draw series one with values of 1,2,3,4 and series 2 with values of 4,3, 2,1 :
< span class = " bar " > 1:4,2:3,3:2,4:1</span>
// same result as the html data above $ ( '.bar ' ) .sparkline ( [ [ 1,4 ] , [ 2 , 3 ] , [ 3 , 2 ] , [ 4 , 1 ] ] , { type : ' bar ' } ) ;
Tristate Charts
1,1,0,1,-1,-1,1, -1,0,0,1,
1
Tri-state charts are useful to show win - lose - draw information , such as the SF Giants recent game results at the top of the page .
You can also use the colorMap option to use different colours for different values , or for arbitrary positions in the chart .
Set the " type " option to " tristate " to generate tristate charts .
posBarColor CSS colour for positive ( win ) values negBarColor CSS colour for negative ( lose ) values zeroBarColor CSS colour for zero ( draw ) values barWidth Width of each bar , in pixels ( integer ) barSpacing Space between each bar , in pixels ( integer ) colorMap A range map to map specific values to selected colours .
For example if you want all values of - 2 to appear yellow , use colorMap : { ' - 2 ' : ' # ff0 ' } .
As of version 1.5 you may also pass an array of values here instead of a mapping to specifiy a color for each individual bar .
For example if your chart has three values 1,3,1 you can set colorMap = [ " red " , " green " , " blue " ]
As of version 2.0 , objects will be automatically be converted to range maps so you can specify colours for a range of values .
See also all of the common options above , that can also be used with tristate charts
Discrete Charts
4,6,7,7,4,3,2,1,4,4,5,6,7,6,6,2,4,5
Discrete charts provide a separated thin vertical line for each value .
Set the " type " option to " discrete " to generate discrete charts .
lineHeight Height of each line in pixels - Defaults to 30 % of the graph height thresholdValue Values less than this value will be drawn using thresholdColor instead of lineColor thresholdColor Colour to use in combination with thresholdValue
See also all of the common options above , that can also be used with discrete charts
Bullet Graphs
10,12,12,9,7
See the wikipedia page for more information on Bullet graphs .
Supplied values must be in this order : target , performance , range1 , range2 , range3 , ...
Set the " type " option to " bullet " to generate bullet graphs .
targetColor
The CSS colour of the vertical target marker targetWidth
The width of the target marker in pixels ( integer ) performanceColor
The CSS color of the performance measure horizontal bar rangeColors Colors to use for each qualitative range background color -
This must be a javascript array .
eg [ ' red ' , ' green ' , '# 22 f ' ]
See also all of the common options above , that can also be used with bullet charts
Pie Charts
1,1,2
1,5
20,50,80
Set the " type " option to " pie " to generate pie charts .
These little pie charts tend only to be useful with 2 or 3 values at most
sliceColors
An array of CSS colors to use for pie slices offset Angle in degrees to offset the first slice - Try - 90 or +90 borderWidth Width of the border to draw around the whole pie chart , in pixels .
Defaults to 0 ( no border ) - New in 2.0 borderColor CSS color to use to draw the pie border .
Defaults to #000 - New in 2.0
See also all of the common options above , that can also be used with pie charts
Box Plots
4,27,34,52,54,59,61,68,78,82,85,87,91,93,100
Loading ..
See the wikipedia page for more information on Box plots
Set the " type " option to " box " to generate box plots .
raw
If set to false ( default ) then the values supplied are used to caculate the box data points for you .
If true then you must pre-calculate the points ( see below ) showOutliers
If true ( default ) then outliers ( values > 1.5 x the IQR ) are marked with circles and the whiskers are placed at Q1 and Q3 instead of the least and greatest value outlierIQR
Set the inter - quartile range multipler used to calculate values that qualify as an outlier - Defaults to 1.5 boxLineColor CSS line colour used to outline the box boxFillColor CSS fill colour used for the box whiskerColor CSS colour used to draw the whiskers outlierLineColor CSS colour used to draw the outlier circles outlierFillColor CSS colour used to fill the outlier circles spotRadius Radius in pixels to draw the outlier circles medianColor CSS colour used to draw the median line target
If set to a value , then a small crosshair is drawn at that point to represent a target value targetColor CSS colour used to draw the target crosshair , if set minValue
If minvalue and maxvalue are set then the scale of the plot is fixed .
By default minValue and maxValue are deduced from the values supplied maxValue See minValue
See also all of the common options above , that can also be used with box plot charts
As noted in the options above , by default " raw " is set to false .
This means that you can just pass an arbitrarily long list of values to the sparkline function and the corresponding box plot will be calculated from those values .
This is probably the behaviour you want most of the time .
If , on the other hand , you have thousands of values to deal with you may want to pre-compute the points needed for the box plot .
In that case , set raw=true and pass in the computed values .
If showing outliers , supplied values of :
low_outlier , low_whisker , q1 , median , q3 , high_whisker , high_outlier
Omit the outliers and set showOutliers to false to omit outlier display .
Interactive Sparklines
Version 2.0 of the plugin introduces support for interactive sparklines in the form of tooltips , mouseover highlighting and click interaction for all supported types of sparkline .
If you 're happy with the default look and feel of the tooltips , you can skip this entire section .
Options to control sparkline interactions :
disableInteraction
Set to true to disable all sparkline interactivity , making the plugin behave in much the same way as it did in 1.x
Defaults to false disableTooltips
Set to true to disable mouseover tooltips .
Defaults to false disableHighlight
Set to true to disable the highlighting of individual values when mousing over a sparkline .
Defaults to false highlightLighten Controls the amount to lighten or darken a value when moused over .
A value of 1.5 will lighten by 50 % , 0.5 will darken by 50 % .
Defaults to 1.4 highlightColor
If specified , then values that are moused over will be changed to this colour instead of being lightend tooltipContainer Specifies the DOM element that tooltips should be rendered into .
Defaults to document . body tooltipClassname Specifies a CSS class name to apply to tooltips to override the default built - in style .
tooltipOffsetX
Specifies how many pixels away from the mouse pointer to render the tooltip on the X axis tooltipOffsetY
Specifies how many pixels away from the mouse pointer to render the tooltip on the Y axis tooltipFormatter Pass a javascript function to use as a callback to override the HTML used to generate tooltips .
The callback will be passed arguments of ( sparkline , options , fields ) .
sparkline is the sparkline object being rendered , " options " is the key : value mapping of options set for this sparkline - use options .
get ( key , default ) to fetch an individual option .
" fields " is an array of fields to render for the sparkline .
This will be a single element array unless its a box plot .
tooltipChartTitle
If specified then the tooltip uses the string specified by this setting as a title tooltipFormat A format string or spformat object ( or an array thereof for multiple entries ) to control the format of the tooltip tooltipPrefix A string to prepend to each field displayed in a tooltip tooltipSuffix A string to append to each field displayed in a tooltip tooltipSkipNull
If true then null values will not have a tooltip displayed
Defaults to true tooltipValueLookups
An object or range map to map field values to tooltip strings .
For example you may want to map - 1 , 0 and 1 to the strings " Lost " , " Draw " , " Won " tooltipFormatFieldlist
An array of values specifying which fields to display in a tooltip and in what order .
Currently only useful for box plots .
See below for more details tooltipFormatFieldlistKey
Specifies which key holds the field name to reference above .
For box plots this should be " field " numberFormatter Pass a javascript function to control how numbers are formatted in tooltips .
The callback will be passwd a number to format and must return a string .
Default behaviour is to format numbers to western conventions .
numberDigitGroupSep
Character to use for group separator in numbers " 1,234 " for l10n purposes .
Defaults to the comma - " , " numberDecimal Mark Character to use for the decimal point in numbers for l10n purposes .
Defaults to the period - " . " numberDigitGroupCount
Number of digits between the group seperator in numbers for l10n purposes .
Defaults to 3 .
Formatting Tooltips
There are a couple of approaches you can take to format tooltips .
Either you can manually generate tooltips by using the tooltipFormatter callback function ( perhaps to hook in an external tooltip library ) , or you can use the other tooltip options above to fine - tune the default formatter .
The tooltipFormat and toolipValueLookups options provide the main methods of formatting the text displayed for each value in a toolip .
The tooltipFormat is applied whenever the mouse is moved over a value .
Various fields enclosed between double curly braces in the format string are substituted depending on the type of sparkline in use .
For example , the default format string for line charts is :
< span style= " color : { {color}} " >●</ span > {{prefix}}{{y}}{{suffix}}</span >
" color " is derived from the colour of the line being drawn .
" prefix " and " suffix " and set by setting the tooltipPrefix and tooltipSuffix items .
" y " represents the y value of the point under the mouse .
" x " can also be used to if useful .
The supported fields for the different types of sparklines include :
All types : " prefix " , " suffix " as set by tooltipPrefix and tooltipSuffix options
" prefix " , " suffix " as set by tooltipPrefix and tooltipSuffix options Line : " color " , " fillColor " , " x " , " y " , " isNull " ( true if a null value )
" color " , " fillColor " , " x " , " y " , " isNull " ( true if a null value ) Bar : " value " ( the value under the pointer ) , " color " , " isNull "
" value " ( the value under the pointer ) , " color " , " isNull " Tristate : " value " ( the value under the pointer ) , " color " , " isNull "
" value " ( the value under the pointer ) , " color " , " isNull " Discrete : " value " , " isNull "
" value " , " isNull " Pie : " value " , " percent " ( number between 0 and 100 ) , " color " ( of the moused - over slice ) "
" value " , " percent " ( number between 0 and 100 ) , " color " ( of the moused - over slice ) " Bullet : " value " , " fieldkey " , " isNull "
" value " , " fieldkey " , " isNull " Box : " field " and " value " .
Field may be one of " lq " ( lower quartile ) , " med " ( median ) , " uq " ( upper quartile ) , " lo " ( left outlier ) , " ro " ( right outlier ) , " lw " ( left whisker ) " rw " ( right whisker )
Box plot field order
For box plots , you can control which fields are displayed and in what order using the tooltipFormatFieldlist and tooltipFormatFieldlistKey options .
For example , to display only the median , lower quartile and upper quartile values , in that order : 4,27,34,52,54,59,61,68,78,82,85,87,91,93,100
$ ( '.boxplot ' ) .
sparkline ( values , { type : ' box ' , tooltipFormatFieldlist : [ ' med ' , 'lq ' , 'uq ' ] , tooltipFormatFieldlistKey : ' field ' } ) ;
Formatting field names and values
You can translate field names and values to other arbitrary strings using the tooltipValueLookups option .
Box plots do this , for example , to remap " lq " to the string " Lower Quartile " , etc but you can also use it to map values ( numbers ) or ranges of values to strings too using a range map
For example , we can create a bar chart with tooltips that say " low " , " medium " or " high " along with the value :
var values = [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 3 , 8 ] ; $ ( '.bar ' ) .
sparkline ( values , { type : ' bar ' , tooltipFormat : '{{value : levels}} - {{value}} ' , tooltipValueLookups : { levels : $.range_map ( { ': 2 ' : ' Low ' , ' 3:6 ' : ' Medium ' , ' 7 : ' : ' High ' } ) } } ) ;
You can also specify a CSS class name to associate with a format by passing the format string and class to $.spformat :
$ ( '.bar ' ) .
sparkline ( values , { type : ' bar ' , tooltipFormat : $.spformat ( '{{value}} ' , ' tooltip-class ' ) } ) ;
Click Events
When a user clicks on a sparkline , a sparkline Click event is generated .
The event object contains a property called " sparklines " that holds an array of the sparkline objects under the mouse at the time of the click .
For non-composite sparklines , this array will have just one entry .
This example will display an alert with the moused - over value whenever a value is clicked :
1,3,4,7,1,3,2,4,5,6,
6,5
$ ('.clickdemo' ) .sparkline ( ) ; $ ( '.clickdemo' ) .bind ( ' sparklineClick ' , function ( ev ) { var sparkline = ev.sparklines[0 ] , region = sparkline.getCurrentRegionFields ( ) ; alert ( " Clicked on x= " +region .x + " y= " +region.y ) ; } ) ;
The fields available from getCurrentRegionFields ( ) match those listed in the formatting tooltips section , above .
Mouse - over Events
When the mouse moves over a different value in a sparkline a sparklineRegionChange event is generated .
This can be useful to hook in an alternate tooltip library .
As with the sparklineClick event , the generated event has a property called sparklines that holds an array of the sparklines under the pointer .
Example that updates a span with the current region details :
1,3,4,7,1,3,2,4,5,6,6,5
Last region :
$ ('.mouseoverdemo ' ) .sparkline ( ) ; $ ('.mouseoverdemo' ) .bind (' sparklineRegionChange ' , function ( ev ) { var sparkline = ev.sparklines[0 ] , region = sparkline.getCurrentRegionFields ( ) , value = region.y ; $ ( '.mouseoverregion ' ) .
text ( " x= " +region .x + " y= " +region.y ) ; }).bind(' mouseleave ' , function ( ) { $ ( '.mouseoverregion ' ) . text ( '' ) ; } ) ;

Subliminal messages are words , images , or sounds that might appear in television or radio commercials , TV shows or movies , print ads or recorded music .
Usually when subliminal messages are seen or heard , they ’re not recognized for what they are .
In fact , they may be ignored by the conscious brain and be beyond the level of conscious perception .
Before the 1970s , subliminal ads were commonplace in movies and other media .
The theory holds , and it is getting less popular , that subliminal messages are perceived by the subconscious or unconscious mind .
Since the conscious mind does n’t have time to rationalize or analyze these messages , people might more easily accept them .
For instance , the use of red in commercials for Target® is at least partly subliminal .
The red itself really has nothing to do with the company , but persistence in using it for most commercials means advertisers hope that the color red , whenever seen , will remind people of Target and convince them to shop there .
Subliminal messages might have sexual connotations .
There ’s disagreement on the degree to which these messages are used , understood , or accessed .
The idea of these messages has been around since the late 19th century , and by the mid 20th century , the use of this messaging in advertising was considered standard fare , especially visual messages where something would flash for a split second on a screen that would subliminally convince the viewer to act in a certain way .
People became afraid that subliminal messages could be used to “ brainwash ” themselves or others .
This fear became so great that by the 1970s , the US Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) banned the use of subliminal messages in advertisements .
Yet it ’s never really been proven these messages work to any great degree .
The ban also only exists for advertisement and does not affect film or music recordings .
Rock music , especially , came under fire as possibly containing messages of words or phrases recorded backward that people thought were intended to corrupt youth .
There have been a few backward - recorded messages in rock music , but not so many as people might think .
Further , they may not always have evil intent .
There ’s no consensus on whether a person could actually perceive such a message , and usually the big thrill is playing the music backward so a backward recording is understood .
Another type of subliminal message that has endured strong criticism is certain animations in Disney ® films that spell out specific words .
Perhaps the most famous of these is the word , sex , appearing as clouds , in The Lion King .
You actually can see this if you pause your DVD player , but Disney did not place it there on purpose .
Instead , it ’s been attributed to a capricious animator , and would almost certainly have been edited if it was discovered .
This also suggests these messages may not work since they may never be consciously perceived .
There ’s no indication the word sex , which has numerous connotations , could be read or understood by three or four year olds .
Perhaps a more obvious form of subliminal advertising is the idea of hiding things in plain sight , like the use of product placement in films .
In several action scenes in the film Spider Man , the action takes place around buildings hung with ads .
If you ’re conscious of it , you ’ll notice the backdrop of ads , but if you do n’t realize they are there , they might be considered a form of subliminal advertising .
It ’s unclear the degree to which these ads might influence buying choice , but they are likely to be taken in by the unconscious mind , while your conscious mind is absorbed by the story action .
It can be a matter of how acutely aware you are that product placement exists in many modern films and television series .
Overview
Clone Digger aimed to detect similar code in Python and Java programs .
The synonyms for the term " similar code " are " clone " and " duplicate code " .
What is software clone ?
Two continuous fragments of code form clone if they are similar enough .
Why is it important to detect clones ?
The presence of clones can increase maintenance cost of the code .
Detected clones can be refactored or just kept in mind .
Why should I use Clone Digger to detect clones ?
There are several clone detection tools , they are listed here .
The benefits of Clone Digger are :
Variety of handled clone types .
Strictly speaking , a pair of sequences of statements is considered a clone if one sequence can be obtained from the other by replacing some small subexpressions .
Particularly , changes of variable and function names and constants are allowed .
It 's free ( provided under the GPL license ) .
Clone Digger uses complex algorithm of finding duplicate code , consisting of several phases .
The principles can be found in the paper " Duplicate code detection using anti-unification " .
How to use Clone Digger ?
All allowed arguments are listed here .
In general , the process of finding clones can be compared to sieving .
You should choose middle size of the mesh in order to find something interesting .
There are two dimensions of the mesh in Clone Digger : the minimal size of clones ( set by -- length - threshold parameter ) and the maximum distance between sequences , which are reported as clones ( set by -- distance - threshold ) .
Happy searching !
Google vowed that its Linux - based Android mobile platform would empower enthusiasts and amateur developers , but today we have seen compelling evidence that this is an empty promise .
Third - party Android application developers , who have grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of SDK updates , were shocked to discover that Google has been secretly making new versions of the Android SDK available to the Android Developer Challenge ( ADC ) finalists under non-disclosure agreements .
This was revealed yesterday when Google employee David McLaughlin accidentally sent notification of a new SDK release to a public Android mailing list .
The message , which was intended only for ADC Round two entrants , says that SDK build 84853 is available through the private ADC download site .
McLaughlin later apologized for mistakenly sending the message to the wrong list .
ADC
Round two participants have confirmed that they have access to updated SDK builds but declined to provide further details because they are bound by non-disclosure agreements .
We have contacted Google and asked for additional details , but we have not yet received a response .
While most of the Android community was forced to use an outdated version of the SDK from February and were left to wonder if they would ever see another SDK release at all , a small assortment of 50 gagged developers were given priority access to much - needed improvements and bug fixes that Google has apparently been keeping secret .
This revelation has compelled some to question the search giant 's motives and wonder whether Google is really committed to making Android an equal - opportunity platform for enthusiast developers .
For many of the critics , Google 's secrecy and unwillingness to communicate is ultimately more troubling than the lack of SDK updates .
" I do n't think the biggest issue here is who has and does n't have access to the SDK .
I think the main issue here is communication or lack thereof .
Google embraced the development community and touted how they were going to build this platform with the help of the development community .
Somewhere along the line , this ' seemed ' to change .
I say seemed because this could have always been part of Google 's strategy , " wrote third - party developer Ken Adair in a message to the Android discussion list .
" The problem is they have failed to nurture the relationship with the development community .
They have cut them off from the information that was once flowing and left them to speculate and wonder .
In response , you are seeing many that feel cheated and betrayed . "
Non-disclosure agreements and selective access to development tools are hardly emblematic of an open ecosystem .
Google has intentionally disadvantaged many developers and kept the broader Android community in the dark about the progress of the platform .
Google 's failure to fulfill its commitment to openness has eroded one of the principle differentiating factors that made Android a relevant alternative to Apple 's iPhone operating system .
If Google cannot change course , the lack of transparency in the development process will likely push disenfranchised developers towards other mobile platforms .
Meet Yoda the cat with FOUR ears
If Batman had a cat , it would probably look something like this .
The household pet , named Yoda , was born with an extra set of ears .
Valerie and Ted Rock took him in two years ago after visiting a bar near their home in Chicago , where he was being passed round by curious drinkers .
He was one of a large litter and the owners were looking for a home for him .
A good listener : Two - year - old house cat Yoda was born with four ears
The couple immediately fell for the freaky feline and asked the owner if they could adopt him .
He agreed and the couple named the cat Yoda , after the pointy - eared Jedi knight in Star Wars .
Valerie , 65 , said : ' We were at a pub on the south side of Chicago with a group of friends when we noticed a small cage sitting on the bar and people passing around a kitten .
' He had been part of a large litter and the owners were looking to find a home for him .
' Ted and I had just lost a cat that was our pet for over 20 years , and we were sure we were done with cats .
' When he was passed around he reached for Ted , crawled up into the crook of his neck and fell asleep - Ted was a goner .
' It was a done deal when the kitten made himself at home on Ted 's shoulder .
' We decided to name him Yoda .
I understand the Star Wars character was based on George Lucas ' cat . '
After adopting the eight - week - old kitten into their Illinois home , Valerie decided to have Yoda checked out with the local vet .
Owner : Valerie Rock found Yoda being passed around a Chicago bar and took him home with her
But the vet was mystified by his unique appearance .
' The vet had never seen anything like it before , ' explains Valerie .
' He immediately went to the internet and found the four - eared cat in Germany .
' We have spoken with other vets in our acquaintance , and they likewise had never encountered anything like this .
' We began to realise that we had something very special .
' As a result , he has been an indoor cat and has a chip installed in case he gets lost .
Yoda is so different that we were concerned that he might be catnapped . '
Yoda 's extra ' flaps ' are separate to the base of his skull , with one placed slightly behind the other .
Yet despite his unusual looks , Valerie is sure Yoda 's behaviour - and hearing - are quite normal .
' Yoda 's hearing is normal as far as we know , ' says Valerie .
' People do a double take when they see him or his picture .
It is great fun showing him off .
Yoda :
The wise Star Wars character the cat was named after
' We have actually had people ask if we had his ears cut to look this way .
' But he is a perfectly normal affectionate , curious cat and is a joy to have around .
' He is not afraid of anything and is very sociable unlike some of the other cats I have owned .
' But he does have an interesting obsession with bread - I can't leave bread on the counter for a moment .
' And when he purrs , it is not audible .
The only way I know that he is purring is to put my finger on his throat to feel the vibration .
' He also is not very vocal .
He meows , but only softly , and not very often which is a good thing . '
Online activists from the right and the left announced an unprecedented campaign Tuesday to hold Democratic lawmakers accountable for caving in to the Bush administration on domestic spying .
Netroots activists are raising money online to run advertisements against " Blue Dog Democrats " , such as Rep. Chris Carney , D - Pa. , who voted for a bill that would immunize telecommunications companies who cooperated with the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping .
Credit : EggmanA group of high - profile progressive bloggers and libertarian Republicans are rolling out a new political action committee called Accountability Now to channel widespread anger over pending legislation that would legalize much of the president 's warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans , and grant retroactive legal immunity to telephone companies that cooperated with the spying when it was still illegal .
Progressive author and lawyer Glenn Greenwald , who writes for Salon.com , and blogger Jane Hamsher of Firedoglake , are spearheading the effort .
They 've hired the political media consultants behind a historic Ron Paul online fundraising drive to organize a similar " moneybomb , " set to go off Aug .
8 .
" That is the day Richard Nixon resigned , and the idea is that 35 years ago when you did this kind of stuff , you were forced out of office , and now congress drops everything to make your crimes legal , " says Hamsher in an interview .
The campaign marks a milestone in the evolution of online grassroots organizing .
The PAC is cherry - picking the tactics and tools that proved most successful in the presidential primary campaigns , and is using them to corral online support for the single issue of domestic spying .
The PAC 's money pay for advertisements in the districts of the House Democrats who voted for the spy bill – potentially causing problems for those capitulating on the Bush wiretapping program .
" The fact is , we 're all entering completely new territory here , " writes Micah Sifry on the TechPresident blog in a post on other , similar efforts to rally support to influence Barack Obama 's vote on the pending legislation this Wednesday in the Senate .
" There have always been efforts to influence political candidates to take or change positions during a campaign ( or afterward ) , but we 've never before had a national campaign create an open platform for mobilizing supporters and then seen a salient chunk of those supporters openly use that platform to challenge the candidate on a policy position . "
Key to the new effort are consultants Trevor Lyman and Rick Williams , whose successful online money - raising effort for Ron Paul , the libertarian - leaning Texas congressman , broke records last year .
The pair masterminded a " moneybomb " drive called " This November 5th " that brought in an unprecedented $ 4.2 million in contributions in a single day .
A repeat effort in December raised another $ 6 million for Paul .
Now the pair have built a web page for Accountability
Now where opponents of the spy bill can commit in advance to donating money to the PAC .

The moneybomb is only one of several techniques , both online and off , that Hamsher 's Firedoglake is experimenting with to make offending members of congress feel the anger of their constituents .
Blue America PAC , of which Firedoglake is a part , has already hired Advomatic and Advomatic Laboratories in New York City , to create a VOIP widget that lets voters call their senators ask them what their stance is on the spy legislation , and to urge them to vote for an amendment that would remove the telecom immunity provision .
So far , 1,600 calls have been made using the tool , which launched Wednesday , says Matt Browner Hamlin , Advomatic Laboratories ' founder .
Blue America PAC also launched a robocall campaign in late June against House Majority Leader and Maryland Representative Steny Hoyer , who organized the vote for the legislation .
And it 's run television ads against Reps .
John Barrow , D - Ga. , and Chris Carney , D - Pa – the so - called Blue Dog Democrats who pushed for the legislation .

Hamsher says the effort is aimed at Democrats , because that 's the party in control of Congress .
" They will have the power , " she says .
" From our perspective , Chris Carney , or a Republican , it does n't make any difference – they 're both voting bad on a variety of issues .
But Republicans have no power , and Chris Carney in the center will .
Using money it has already raised , the group ran a full - page advertisement in The Washington Post on Tuesday with bullet points explaining what 's wrong with the pending legislation .
The Senate is expected to follow the House in approving the new spy legislation Wednesday .

Several studies this week have tried to explain what is being called the “ obesity paradox : ” the fact that most fat people actually live longer than thin people .
At this week ’s meeting of the American Heart Association , yet another study was reported which found that fatter cardiac patients were more likely to survive hospitalization and invasive treatments than thinner ones , even when adjusting for age and other contributing factors .
In this analysis of 130,139 heart disease patients , 5.4 % of “ normal ” weight patients died , as compared to 2.4 % of “ obese ” and 3.1 % of “ overweight . ”
Yes , those whose were “ obese ” were more than two times more likely to survive !
This is really only a “ paradox ” because it goes against what everyone believes to be true ... largely because we do n’t hear anything else .
While many may be incredulous , the largest body of evidence has found that fatness is not a risk factor for heart disease or premature death , even controlling for the effects of smoking .
Ancel Keys and colleagues confirmed this nearly half a century ago upon examining 16 prospective studies in seven countries , as well as actual angiographic and autopsy examinations of 23,000 sets of coronary arteries which found no relationship between body fatness and the degree or progression of atherosclerotic build - up .
And the most careful studies ever since have continued to support these findings .
Dr. Paul Ernsberger , of Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland , Ohio , led a review of nearly 400 studies that was published in the Journal of Obesity and Weight Regulation in 1987 which corroborated these results .
“ The idea that fat strains the heart has no scientific basis , ” he said .
“ As far as I can tell , the idea comes from diet books , not scientific books .
Unfortunately , some doctors read diet books . ”
This April , researchers at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles reported their clinical study of 14,739 patients with coronary artery disease , that had been confirmed on tomography , who were followed for over three years .
They found that “ obese ” and “ overweight ” patients were at significantly lower risks for cardiac death than “ normal ” weight patients .
The medical student presenting the paper at the AHA meeting tried to justify the “ obesity paradox ” in their study by claiming , with no apparent evidence , that the fatter patients had better outcomes because they may have received better and more aggressive treatment .
That hypothesis is unsupportable .
It is well recognized among obesity researchers and doctors that obese people on the whole receive worse medical care , are denied or have less access to quality care , are treated less aggressively and are often sicker by the time they do get care than thinner people .
The discrimination in health care has been well documented , as has very real weight bias even among health professionals specializing in obesity .

Men
The hidden half of domestic violence
How to have eternal life
Early Sunday Morning , April 1st , 2007 someone hacked into my account and deleted the interactive group for Shattered Men .
This is where most of the work for Shattered Men was done .
They also gained access to the e-mail account that we used which contained confidential information from our membership both as an ordained minister and as a
registered nurse but it appears they simply deleted that as quickly as they could but we lost several thousand messages there too .
In this deletion , we lost all of the information that has been posted since Oct. 31 , 1999 including over 40,000 messages along with the contact information for 990 members .
We will rebuild .
Yahoo is working on trying to recover some of this information and they have said they do know who did it .
We will be requesting criminal charges be filed with the FBI who has already been contacted regarding this .
Although this shows that someone does not want the hidden side of abuse to be know , we need to remember that unless we look at BOTH sides , we will not resolve this problem but it appears that someone is willing to break United States federal laws to keep BOTH sides from being exposed !
YOU can help show this person that his or her actions will not work .

PLEASE NOTE :
It has come to our attention that this page is linked on a feminist blog as a complaint about the men 's rights movement in general .
I have tried to reply on this site but was unable to so I am replying here for those who find their way here from that site .
I ask , why is it ok for these radical feminist to always demand rights for women but anytime a man states there should be equal protection as is supposedly guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States we are called whinny little boys or worse .
The blog this was on it by a radical feminist but she does think men and women should have rights and responsibilities .
The problem is , she thinks women should have the rights and men should be responsible to assure they have all of them .
The following is from this site :
I have little patience myself with these attacks on domestic violence shelters for women , because I tend to think that the supposed concern for battered men coming from a lot of MRAs is disingenous .
Like Bean says , real concern for battered men would result in MRAs starting shelters and doing outreach , but instead efforts have been focused on trying to sue existing women 's shelters until they go under .
This particular site that is supposed to be about helping male victims seems more interested in begrudging women who escape abusive partners their chance at a bed to sleep in and a warm meal .
( That entire site is illuminating -- another example of a " Christian " who thinks that Jesus ' exhortations to love your neighbor , advice that anyone begruding shelter to abused women is definitely not following , is less important than Paul 's prescriptions for male dominance . )
We have tried to get funding to start shelters for men .
In fact , there are three in the United States that do help men .
Most women shelters tell us they will help men but this is a well kept secret .
Hands of Hope in Marion Indiana is one example of this but in looking at the literature they only talk about helping women and their children
In listing the number of people they have helped in 2002 and 2003 it includes 1,735 and children and " 0 " men .
Of course NONE of their ads are directed at men so it would be like expecting a man to go to a woman 's hospital to get a check up .
I have tried to buy advertisement space in news papers but it was refused .
Still , the feminist did not start women 's shelters , men did .
People like Senator Biden who has accepted the feminist distortions hook , line and sinker and enacted the Violence Against Women Act .
What distortions ?
How about things like the Super bowl Sunday myth or the myth that more women are hurt in domestic violence then rapes muggings and auto accidents combined ?
MOST of the men's rights movements DO acknowledge there are far too many female victims of domestic violence .
We are NOT asking for a Violence Against MEN
Act to exclude women .
We are asking for a DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT to include EVERYONE .
Is that too much to ask ?
We are not " begrudging women who escape abusive partners their chance at a bed to sleep in and a warm meal " but we are asking that men who escape abusive partners not be made to sleep in the streets , in homeless missions or in jails .
Is that too much to ask ?
Should not everyone be protected ?
Should we not value ALL our people ???

An abused woman who leaves emergency housing may move into ( deleted ) ' transitional housing , where she can remain for up to 6 months , with the possibility of an extension if warranted .
It is hoped that upon leaving she will move to permanent housing .
However , a recent survey of ( deleted ) ' shelter residents indicated that in less than one - third of the cases women moved into permanent housing .

A militant attack that freed hundreds of prisoners in Kandahar has created a " serious security situation " that adversely affects Canada 's mission in Afghanistan , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday .
He was responding in Huntsville , Ont. , to reporters ' questions about the attack on June 13 that freed most of the prisoners at Kandahar 's main prison , including about 400 suspected Taliban militants .
" I do n't want to minimize : this is a serious security situation .
It 's a setback , " Harper said .
" It 's particularly a setback in our plans .
As you know , we have a plan to pass full responsibility to the Afghan authorities by 2011 .
This is a setback in that regard , " he said .
In March , Harper 's Conservatives , with support from the Liberals , passed a motion that would keep Canadian soldiers in Kandahar until 2011 .
About 2,500 Canadian soldiers are currently deployed in Afghanistan , mostly in and around Kandahar , as part of the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force .
Harper said the good news was that the Afghan government responded quickly and directly , and that Afghan forces were working quite well with Canadian forces to deal with some of the consequences of the prison break .
The prime minister pointed out that the prison is an Afghan government institution , so security there is the responsibility of Afghan forces .
" But , obviously , this affects all of our operations , " he said .
" That 's why we are working carefully with the Afghan government to address the consequences of this and , obviously , to deal with reconstruction of the prison . "
56 Taliban confirmed dead in battle : Afghan Defence Ministry
As Harper spoke , Afghan and Canadian forces continued a military operation launched Wednesday against hundreds of insurgents gathered in villages outside Kandahar .

( ( Alexander Panetta / Canadian Press ) )
Military officials declared victory over the Taliban on Thursday , saying they had almost cleared the Kandahar area of militant fighters in a 24 - hour battle .
Still , the commander of the Canadian troops in Afghanistan warned that Afghan police must be supported in the region to ensure that Taliban members do n't return .
" They 've been defeated for the most part . …
They 're now trying to escape , " Brig . - Gen. Denis Thompson said of the Taliban .
He said Afghan and Canadian soldiers are combing the region to find any remaining insurgents .
The Afghan National Army , under the guidance of the Canadian Forces , moved into the rural Arghandab region on Wednesday after reports emerged that hundreds of Taliban fighters were gathering there and preparing for possible attacks .

' It is a positive sign that the Afghan Army can take the lead .

-- Average Steve < a href=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/06/19/canada-taliban.html#socialcomments#postc>Add your comment</a>[/ CUSTOM ]
The Canadians and Afghans attacked on foot and by air , exchanging fire with Taliban fighters holed up in villages along the Arghandab River .
The Afghan Defence Ministry said 56 insurgents have been confirmed dead , while Kandahar 's governor estimated hundreds of others were killed and wounded .
" We are finding more bodies , more wounded people , " Gov. Asadullah Khalid said .
At least two Afghan soldiers died in the battle , and at least one civilian was killed .
No Canadians died .
NATO downplays Taliban 's capabilities
In the hours before the Canadian and Afghan troops launched their attack , local officials and residents had said upward of 650 insurgents had gathered in Arghandab and were seizing villages , bombing bridges and planting landmines in preparation for an attack on the city of Kandahar , just 15 kilometres away .
NATO downplayed the Taliban 's capabilities , saying there were far fewer than 650 fighters and the city was never truly under threat .
Still , NATO rushed 1,400 Afghan soldiers and equipment into the area , citing the battle as a good opportunity for the Afghan army to lead a mission .
" No large formation of insurgents were met or spotted .
Only minor incidents occurred , " NATO spokesman Maj. - Gen. Carlos Branco said Thursday .
" The insurgents who were there were evidently not in the numbers or with the foothold that they have claimed . "
Residents will be compensated : Canadian commander

Kandahar 's governor , Khalid , said residents of Arghandab who fled their homes in the hours before the battle may be able to return within three days .
The time frame will be crucial for most residents , who run fruit farms in the area , which is at the height of harvest season .
Thompson said people whose homes were destroyed in the battle will be compensated .
He said it will be crucial to launch humanitarian projects in the area to help them get their lives back in order .
He said he hoped the military 's ability to largely clear the region of the Taliban on Wednesday will restore residents ' confidence that they are safe again .
Thompson said that confidence was likely shaken by the surge of insurgents in Arghandab in recent days .

Abstract
In the United States , there is a largely hidden burden of diseases caused by a group of chronic and debilitating parasitic , bacterial , and congenital infections known as the neglected infections of poverty .
Like their neglected tropical disease counterparts in developing countries , the neglected infections of poverty in the US disproportionately affect impoverished and under - represented minority populations .
The major neglected infections include the helminth infections , toxocariasis , strongyloidiasis , ascariasis , and cysticercosis ; the intestinal protozoan infection trichomoniasis ; some zoonotic bacterial infections , including leptospirosis ; the vector - borne infections Chagas disease , leishmaniasis , trench fever , and dengue fever ; and the congenital infections cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , toxoplasmosis , and syphilis .
These diseases occur predominantly in people of color living in the Mississippi Delta and elsewhere in the American South , in disadvantaged urban areas , and in the US–Mexico borderlands , as well as in certain immigrant populations and disadvantaged white populations living in Appalachia .
Preliminary disease burden estimates of the neglected infections of poverty indicate that tens of thousands , or in some cases , hundreds of thousands of poor Americans harbor these chronic infections , which represent some of the greatest health disparities in the United States .
Specific policy recommendations include active surveillance ( including newborn screening ) to ascertain accurate population - based estimates of disease burden ; epidemiological studies to determine the extent of autochthonous transmission of Chagas disease and other infections ; mass or targeted treatments ; vector control ; and research and development for new control tools including improved diagnostics and accelerated development of a vaccine to prevent congenital CMV infection and congenital toxoplasmosis .

Introduction
In the United States of America , the mortality rate resulting from infectious diseases has declined precipitously over the course of the twentieth century [ 1 ] , and major scourges such as typhoid fever and malaria are no longer serious public health threats [ 2 ] .
However , among the poorest populations living in the US there remains highly prevalent a group of serious parasitic and bacterial diseases such as Chagas disease , cysticercosis , and toxocariasis [ 3 ] , which , like the neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) , are characterized by their high prevalence , chronic and disabling features , and disproportionate effect on the poor [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
These infections occur outside of tropical regions of Africa , Asia , and Latin America , and I refer to them as neglected infections of poverty , because they not well known to the US public - health community , and they promote poverty because of their impact on child development , pregnancy outcomes , and worker productivity [ 5 ] .
In this review I highlight the largely underappreciated burden of the neglected infections of poverty in the US and make policy recommendations for addressing such health disparities .
Policy Recommendations
Based on my estimates of prevalence ( Table 2 ) and other health and socioeconomic impacts , the most important neglected helminth infections of poverty in the US are the helminth diseases toxocariasis ( inner cities and the American South ) , ascariasis ( Appalachia and the American South ) , strongyloidiasis ( Appalachia ) , and cysticercosis ( US–Mexico borderlands ) .
Among the important vector - borne neglected infections are dengue and Chagas disease in the US–Mexico borderlands and in post -Katrina Louisiana .
Congenital infections such as congenital CMV and congenital syphilis stand out as health disparities in inner cities and the American South .
Trench fever and leptospirosis are important among the homeless and other disadvantaged urban populations .
Among the common features of these neglected infections are ( 1 ) their highly disproportionate health impact on people of color and people living in poverty ; ( 2 ) their chronic , largely insidious , and disabling features ; and ( 3 ) their ability to promote poverty because of their impact on child development , pregnancy outcome , and productive capacity .
It is important to note that , while some of these neglected infections occur exclusively among recent immigrant populations , most do not .
Instead , poverty is the single most important determinant .
Control of these neglected infections needs to be prioritized by policy makers and public - health experts because it is both a highly cost - effective mechanism for lifting disadvantaged populations out of poverty and consistent with our shared American values of equity and equality [ 150 ] .
The World Health Organization also recognizes that control of neglected diseases represents a fundamental human right [ 151 ] .
An important obstacle to the control or elimination of the neglected infections of poverty in the US is the absence of reliable population - based estimates of prevalence and disease burden data about these conditions [ 3 ] , [ 19 ] .
These neglected infections are underdiagnosed and most are not reportable to the CDC .
The estimates I provide here are preliminary and based on very few active surveillance studies , including some obtained by analyses of sera collected from National Health and Examination Surveys .
For some of the neglected infections of poverty , seropositivity may be equated with active infection [ 89 ] , [ 90 ] , [ 95 ] , [ 109 ] , [ 113 ] , whereas for others it may reflect both current and past infections [ 53 ] , [ 74 ] .
For infections such as Chagas disease estimates reported here vary widely .
We also lack a system for the national collection of fecal samples for intestinal parasitic infections .
Expanded measures are urgently needed to implement active surveillance and obtain population - based estimates of the neglected infections ( Table 3 ) .
An added measure would be to expand newborn screening for toxoplasmosis [ 3 ] , [ 152 ] , and possibly congenital Chagas disease .
Screening for congenital toxoplamosis would also likely benefit persons of all socioeconomic circumstances [ 61 ] .
Such efforts would create opportunities to determine the extent and true disease burden of these neglected infections .

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000256.t003
There is also an urgent need to better define the transmission dynamics of some of the neglected diseases ( Table 3 ) .
For Chagas disease , and to some extent , dengue and leishmaniasis , the full extent of authochthonous transmission in Louisiana and the US–Mexico borderlands is poorly understood .
A full appreciation of Chagas disease transmission mechanisms would include molecular genotyping of the parasite to determine whether different strains or demes are endemic , and a complete characterization of the different vectors and animal reservoir hosts .
Similarly , the extent of autochthonous cysticercosis transmission in the US is largely unstudied , as it is for many of the bacterial zoonoses including urban foci of leptospirosis and trench fever .
For toxocariasis , the contribution of feral versus domesticated animal reservoirs to transmission is also not well understood .
Following enhanced surveillance and improved understanding of transmission dynamics , there are several opportunities to treat or prevent neglected infections of poverty in the US using existing drugs or other control tools ( Table 3 ) .
Through either population - based drug administration or case identification and treatment , the soil - transmitted helminths could be controlled by administration of albendazole and ivermectin [ 22 ] , while expanded use of praziquantel would treat schistosomiasis among selected immigrant populations [ 90 ] and prevent transmission of T. solium eggs and possibly reduce the incidence of cysticercosis [ 153 ] .
Metronidazole and tinidazole are available for the treatment of trichomoniasis and giardiasis [ 154 ] , [ 155 ] , and nitazoxanide is available for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis [ 144 ] , [ 156 ] .
Pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine is used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis , and the optimal length of treatment and its impact on child development and neurological sequelae need to be determined [ 61 ] .
Antibiotics are available for the treatment of leptospirosis and other bacterial zoonoses [ 157 ] .
An important role also exists for veterinary public health interventions to prevent zoonotic transmission to humans , possibly including the mass treatment of Toxocara - infected dogs , Toxoplasma - infected cats , and other measures [ 158 ] .
The control of almost all of the neglected infections of poverty would also benefit from improvements in environmental sanitation , piped clean water , and improvements in housing in some of the poorest endemic areas .
For Chagas disease , dengue , and leishmaniasis , consideration of expanded vector control approaches is warranted [ 55 ] , [ 159 ] .
Development of new control and prevention tools is needed ( Table 3 ) .
Currently , the serologic - based diagnostic tests for most of the parasitic infections rely on extracts or crude preparations of parasite antigens and would benefit from the development of improved and widely available diagnostic kits that utilize standardized and purified recombinant antigens .
For Chagas disease there is a particularly urgent need for rapid diagnostic tests and polymerase chain reaction - based assays for detection of acute and congenital infections .
Furthermore , no drugs adequately and reliably treat Chagas disease [ 160 ] , dengue [ 161 ] , or congenital CMV infection [ 162 ] .
Although vaccines for dengue [ 163 ] and CMV infection [ 164 ] are under development , progress has been slow because of inadequate resources and commercial incentives [ 5 ] .
A pediatric dengue vaccine initiative was recently established through support by the Gates Foundation [ 163 ] .
For CMV infection , both a live attenuated vaccine and a recombinant vaccine have been developed [ 164 ] , but clinical testing in pregnant women to determine the impact of these vaccines on vertical transmission has been severely lagging because of inadequate support — a tragedy , given that more than 10,000 congenital CMV infections occur among infants of color annually [ 64 ] .
In 2006 , the annual budget of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) was $ 4.4 billion , with approximately $ 1.6 billion of this amount spent on biodefense [ 165 ] .
Of the selected disease - specific areas targeted for funding by the NIAID in their published annual report , none specifically mentions a neglected infection of poverty [ 165 ] .
A consequence of this lack of targeted funding for neglected diseases is that the development of critically needed new tools for these conditions has lagged behind those for biodefense .
The Global Forum on Health Research has coined the term “ the 10/90 gap ” to describe how only 10 % of resources are devoted to 90 % of the global burden of disease , i.e. , that represented by disease disproportionately occurring in developing countries [ 166 ] .
The absence of development of new tools for neglected infections of poverty , such as those outlined above , highlights a unique American 10/90 gap for poor people and people of color in the US .

Maine lawmaker makes phone - spying query Associated Press
Published : Saturday July 26 , 2008
Print This Email This AUGUSTA , Maine Now that Congress has given immunity to telecommunications companies that helped the government spy on Americans in suspected terrorism cases , a Maine legislator is asking Verizon anew if it turned over any customer records to the federal government .
As it has in the past when faced with such queries , Verizon Communications Inc. says it is not commenting on matters involving national security .
State Rep. Herbert Adams posed the question about phone records on July 18 , eight days after President Bush signed into law a bill that overhauled government eavesdropping rules and granted immunity to telecommunications companies that helped the government monitor Americans in suspected terrorism cases .
The law in effect nullified a lawsuit by Maine which sought to know what kind of phone customer information was turned over to the National Security Agency as part of its anti-terror efforts .
That and several other similar cases brought by consumers , privacy advocates and others had been consolidated before Congress granted immunity .
Adams , a member of the Legislature 's Utilities and Energy Committee , posed similar questions about phone records to an executive for FairPoint Communications earlier this year .
FairPoint is taking over Verizon 's landline phone and Internet service in northern New England .
While FairPoint said it had not turned over records , it said it could not speak for Verizon .
Adams posed the question anew on July 18 , saying that Verizon could answer " under protection of Federal law ( and ) without fear of lawsuits . "
" At any time prior to the 2008 sale of FairPoint Communications , did Verizon ever surrender , voluntarily or under subpoena , any individual or aggregate customer information to any agency of the U.S. government ? " says his letter .
A copy was furnished to company spokesman John Bonomo , who said there would be no response .
" We do not comment on matters involving national security , " Bonomo said in an e-mail to The Associated Press .
Adams , D - Portland , had anticipated his query would not be answered .
" Possibly tens of thousands of Mainers have had their private phone records leaked to the federal government without their knowledge or say so , and now none of them may ever know , " he said .

A missing feature in document viewers
It often happens that I 'm looking at some multi-page document , such as a large PDF file , with a viewer program , say Adobe 's Acrobat Reader , or Gnome Document Viewer , and the page numbers do n't match .
Typically , the viewer numbers all the pages sequentially , starting with 1 .
But many documents have some front matter , such as a table of contents , that is outside the normal numbering .
For example , there might be a front cover page , and then a table of contents labeled with page numbers i through xviii , and then the main content of the document follows on pages 1 through 263 .
Computer programmers , I just realized , have a nice piece of jargon to describe this situation , which is very common .
They speak of " logical " and " physical " pages .
The " physical " page numbers are the real , honest - to - goodness numbers of the pages , what you get if you start at 1 and count up .
The " logical " page numbers are the names by which the pages are referred .
In the example document I described , physical page 1 is the front cover , physical page 2 is logical page i , physical page 19 is logical page xviii , physical page 20 is logical page 1 , and so forth .
The document has 282 physical pages , and the last one is logical page 263 .
Let 's denote physical pages with square brackets and logical pages with curvy brackets .
So " ( xviii ) " and " [ 19 ] " denote the same page in this document .
Page ( 1 ) is page [ 20 ] , and page ( 20 ) is page [ 39 ] .
Page [ 1 ] has no logical designation , or perhaps it is something like " ( front cover sheet ) " .
Now the problem I want to discuss is as follows :
Every viewer program has a little box where it displays the current page number , and the little box is usually editable .
You scan the table of contents , find the topic you want to read about , and the table says that it's on page ( 165 ) .
Then you tell the document viewer to go to page 165 , and it does , but it 's not the page 165 you want , because the viewer gives you [ 165 ] , which is actually ( 146 ) .
You actually wanted ( 165 ) , which is page [ 184 ] .
Then you curse , mentally subtract 146 ( what you got ) from 165 ( what you wanted ) , add the result , 19 , back to 165 , getting 184 , and then you ask for 184 to get 165 .
And if you 're me you probably mess up one time in three and have to do it over , because subtraction is hard .
But it would be extremely easy for viewer programs to mostly fix this .
They need to support an option where you can click on the box and tell it " your page number is wrong here " .
Maybe you would right - click the little page - number box , and the process would pop up a dialog :
Then you would type in 146 ( which you can see at the bottom of the page you 're viewing ) and click " OK " .
From then on the process would know that the logical and physical page numbers differed by 19 , and it would subtract 19 from the number in the little box until you told it something else .
You could then type 165 into the little box , and the process would think " well , you asked for ( 165 ) , and I know that ( 165 ) is really [ 184 ] because you told me earlier that [ 165 ] is really ( 146 ) " and then you would get [ 184 ] , which is what you wanted .
And when you scrolled down from ( 165 ) to ( 166 ) , the program would think " ho , you just went from [ 184 ] to [ 185 ] , so I will change the display in the little box and display [ 185 ] - 19 = ( 166 ) there " .
But no , none of them do this .
The document itself should carry this information , and some of them do , sometimes .
But not every document will , so viewers should support this feature , which is useful anyway .
Some document formats support internal links , but most documents do not use those features , and anyway they are useless when what you are trying to do is look up a reference from someone else 's bibliography : " ( See Ogul , pp. 662–664 . ) "
This is not a complete solution , but it's an almost complete solution , and it can be implemented unilaterally , by which I mean that the document author and the viewer program author need not agree on anything .
It 's really easy to do .

Clark : Outrage over my comments a ' manufactured issue ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican presidential candidate John McCain seems to finally have found a winning issue .
It 's not the economy , or the war , or his plan to sell coastlines to oil companies ; no , the McCain campaign has spent most of the last 48 hours gnashing its teeth over some inartfully phrased criticism .
McCain 's rolled out a slew of surrogates to take to the phone lines and unleash varying degrees of " how dare he " on Gen.
Wesley Clark , a supporter of Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
Clark is not backing down from his observation , first aired Sunday morning , that McCain 's honorable service as a Vietnam veteran and POW does not automatically mean he has the right judgment to be commander in chief .
Appearing on liberal radio host Ed Schultz 's show Tuesday , Clark stuck to his guns , and he accused McCain and the GOP apparatus of drumming up a false controversy .
" The only orchestration was by Republicans , " Clark said , referring to unsubstantiated accusations that his criticism was encouraged by Obama , who has repeatedly distanced himself from Clark 's remark .
" I think that since John McCain 's hired the Swift Boat team to protect his military record , " Clark continued , " they just decided they would launch a preemptive strike . "
A McCain campaign conference call Monday featured Col. Bud Day , who appeared in attack ads from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth aimed at John Kerry in 2004 .
Day also compared Kerry to Benedict Arnold .
The campaign hosted another call Tuesday featuring Sen. Lindsey Graham calling McCain the most qualified candidate because of his military service .
All the hubbub started on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday , when Clark said , " I do n't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president . "
The " riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down " construction was a repetition of the phrasing of the question from host Bob Scheiffer .
Speaking to Schultz on Tuesday , Clark defended the answer .
" I 'm going to answer the question usually the way it 's asked , and that 's straight talk , " Clark said .
" This is a manufactured controversy , " he continued , accusing the Republican party of launching a " reconnaissance attack .
Someone 's going in there to see how the Democratic party 's going to handle the national security issues .
Because believe me John McCain is running on national security .
" He 's claiming that having served in the armed forces somehow gives him superior judgment over Barack Obama .
And what I 'm trying to say is , while I honor his service for having been a fighter pilot and been shot down and a courageous prisoner of war , that does not give him a claim to superior judgment in the oval office , " he continued .
" In fact if you look at what he 's said , his judgment 's been pretty bad on some of the major issues " like the GI Bill of Rights .
McCain is also going after Sen. Jim Webb , who recently urged McCain to " calm down " with the intense umbrage he is taking at mentions of his military service .
For his part , Obama rejected a comparison of Clark 's comments to the Swift Boat ads that ran against Kerry four years ago .
" The fact that someone on a cable show or news show , like General Clark , said something inartful about Senator McCain is not keeping Ohioans up at night , " he said , during a news conference following a speech in eastern Ohio .
Clark said he has no reason to apologize to McCain , and he seemed to suggest that the outrage from the opposing campaign was calculated at first to distract from a major speech Obama delivered Monday .
He also made clear that his statements were not suggested or approved by the campaign .
" It had nothing to do with the Obama campaign , " Clark said .
If I were going to offer an apology , it would be to Barack Obama .
' I 'm really sorry that the Republicans stirred this up in such a way as to take away from your speech on patriotism . ' "

TBILISI , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Though Russia says it will begin pulling back its troops from Georgia on Monday , it 's unclear how long the redeployment will take , and a Russian lawmaker has compared the situation to the U.S. presence in Iraq .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says his troops will begin withdrawing from Georgia on Monday .

Russia President Dmitry Medvedev told French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday that Russia would start pulling back its forces from Georgia on Monday , Medvedev 's office said .
Sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , brokered a cease - fire between Russia and Georgia last week .
Russian troops will begin withdrawing to a buffer zone and into the breakaway province of South Ossetia as stipulated by the cease - fire , Medvedev 's office said .
Moscow gave no indication of when the withdrawal would be completed .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , visiting Georgia , called on Russia to stick to its agreement to pull its forces out of Georgia within " the next few days . "
Speaking Sunday at a joint news conference with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , she said a " very prompt withdrawal " was needed so international peacekeepers could be dispatched to Georgia .
" President Medvedev agreed , but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks , " Merkel said in the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
Watch more on the crisis »
However , lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev , head of the Russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said Moscow will withdraw only when it is " assured that Georgians will not continue to use military force " in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Russian troops will leave " sooner or later , " Kosachev said , saying the timetable depends " definitely on how Georgians will continue to behave . "
" If I would ask you in response to the same question how fast the American forces can leave Iraq , for example , the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there , " Kosachev said .
" The same answer would be toward this situation . "
The United States has been in Iraq since its 2003 invasion .
Medvedev signed the truce deal Saturday , a day after it was signed by Saakashvili .
The conflict began more than a week ago when Georgia launched a military incursion into South Ossetia to rout separatist rebels .
Russia -- which supports the separatists , many of whom claim Russian citizenship -- has peacekeeping responsibilities for the region and responded by sending tanks into the province for what it said was peace enforcement .
From there , the violence spread further into Georgia and Abkhazia .
Watch more on the cease - fire »
The Georgian troops withdrew , and Russian forces took control of several areas inside the country -- prompting an international outcry .
Six - point truce Russia and Georgia agreed to six points in their truce deal completed Saturday :
 Do not revert to force again .
 Definitively stop all hostilities .
 Give free access to humanitarian aid .
 Georgian forces withdraw from areas of occupation .
 Russian forces withdraw to positions at start of hostilities .
 Open international discussions on South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Russia maintains it is protecting its peacekeepers and citizens from Georgian forces in the breakaway republics , but Saakashvili insists Moscow is trying to assert control over the former Soviet republic .
" It is up to Russia now to decide whether it will continue to defy the world ... or accomplish its final goal of regime change in Georgia , " Saakashvili said Sunday .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he was skeptical that Russia would quickly withdraw its forces .
" My own view is that the Russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like , " Gates said in an interview broadcast Sunday .
" I think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that they 've signed , and do so in a timely way . "
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who just wrapped up a visit to Tbilisi , also expressed skepticism about a prompt Russian withdrawal .
" I would think that when the Russian president says that a signed cease - fire accord will mean the withdrawal of Russian forces , that Russian forces would then withdraw .
They did not , " she told Fox News on Sunday .
" However , yet again , the Russian president has given his word , and this time , I hope he 'll honor it . "
Watch President Bush on " why Georgia matters " »
It is unclear how many people have been killed in the conflict , but various claims put the figure in the thousands .
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday that it estimated the fighting has displaced more than 158,000 people , citing statistics from the Russian and Georgian governments .
Almost 99,000 of those displaced were in Georgia , while 30,000 were displaced in South Ossetia and 30,000 have fled to Russia , the UNHCR said .

Hi - my name is Joe Collins , but my name is signed as ' hand - rubber . '
A lot of people noticed , when I get excited about something , I rub my hands .
They saw it again and again and the label stuck .
So forget ' Joe ' my name is ' Hand rubber ' !
Angela , Sign Name : Angel
I 'm Angela and my sign name is ' Angel . '
Why ' Angel ' ?
Well it 's related to my name .
It was given to me so long ago I can't remember - maybe ten years ago !
So now I 'm used to ' Angel ' .
Derek , Sign Name : Earrings
I 'm Derek , and my sign name is ' Earrings . '
Because I used to have loads of rings in my ear .
The rings came off , but I 'm still called ' Earrings . '

Billy , Sign Name : Piano player
I 'm Billy - my sign name is ' Piano player ' .
Six years ago I was on TV playing the piano .
I 'm still called the piano man - I can't get rid of it !
Julian , Sign Name : Waffle
I 'm Julian , and my sign name means ' Waffle ' .
Because my friends noticed I always talk and waffle on .
So it became a combination of the letter ' J ' and waffle .
That 's why !
David , Sign Name : Sand
I 'm David Sands - my sign name is ' Sand . '
It began at school because my surname is ' Sands ' .
And that was it - finished !
Boring !
Sasha , Sign Name : Chopstick - in- hair
My name 's Sasha and I have a few sign names .
First , when with friends I sometimes spill my drinks .
So now they 've given me the sign name ' Splasher . '
But I also have a formal sign name .
Which is ' chopstick - in - hair ' because my hair is so long .
In deaf life , people like Secretive are n't strange at all .
Among my closest friends are Waffle , Piano - player , Angel , and even Hand - rubber .
And that 's just my work colleagues .
I 'm not immune myself .
My name is a combination of ' take photo ' and the letter ' C ' for Charlie .
How on earth do you pronounce that , you might ask .
Well the answer is you do n't .
You sign it .
If someone does n't have a sign name , the alternative is to fingerspell it .
But the beauty of a sign name - one swift gesture made with your hands - is that it 's over as quickly , if not quicker , than you could say it .
As opposed to taking a lot longer , S - P - E - L - L - I - N - G a name out L - E - T - T - E - R , by boring , impersonal , L - E - T - T - E - R .
I nearly collapsed at my keyboard just writing that .
Sign names are a weird and wonderful thing , where your average hearing names like Matt , Jack or Jane look positively plain .
But before you get too excited about the possibility of throwing your dull , former identity away , let me point something out : you do n't get to choose your sign name .
You do n't even get power of veto on it .
It is given to you .
It makes sense .
If deaf people could choose their name , you 'd get loads of guys wandering around calling themselves Stud , Beer Belly or Jackie Chan 's Lovechild .
Women would probably call themselves Lip Gloss , Model or Soft Hair .
I 'm generalising , and stereotyping , but you get my point .
When a sign name is given to you , it 's special .
A bit like losing your deaf virginity .
It 's thought up after an intense period of observation , when people have worked out firstly whether they like you enough to give you one ( a sign name , that is ) , and they 've taken all your habits and mannerisms into account to find a name that best sums you up .
Your typical sign name is usually drawn from one of four areas :
Firstly , it could come from an aspect of your personality , such as talking all the time like my mate Waffle , or Hand - rubber for someone who rubs their hands a lot when they get excited .
Secondly , it could be something to do with your appearance , like wearing a lot of earrings or jewellery , what kind of hair you have , or make - up .
Thirdly it could be a play on your name , like Angel for someone called ' Angela ' , or if your surname is Burder ... well , keep reading to find out the story behind that one .
If someone came up to you and introduced themselves like this : " Hello ! I 'm Secretive .
Nice to meet you , " what would you think ?
You would probably assume you 'd misheard them or that they were behaving strangely .
Perhaps you 'd wonder what ' secretive ' might be keeping from you .
In deaf life , people like Secretive are n't strange at all .
Among my closest friends are Waffle , Piano - player , Angel , and even Hand - rubber .
And that 's just my work colleagues .
I 'm not immune myself .

Finally , it could originate from a hobby or a job - such as playing a certain sport all the time , or being into drama or photography .
If your sign name does happen to come from your job , your life gets a lot harder if you 're a tax inspector , or an accountant .
If you 're new to the deaf world , you could consider being given a sign name as a re-birth , a chance to be branded with a whole new identity .
Like a deaf christening or baptism , it 's a way of welcoming you to the community .
Just without holy water , hymns , and having to wear your Sunday best with everyone you know looking on .
But this is where things turn dark .
A sign name can ' make ' you in the deaf world but , by the same token , it can also break you .
The fact is , once a sign name 's been attached to your face and bandied around a bit , it 's incredibly hard to shift .
You 're stuck with it , as a friend of mine found to his cost .
The chap in question had a sign attached to him that meant ' smooth ' .
He was a serial dater , you see , with the gift of the gab - or hands , for that matter .
Smooth was quite happy go lucky , until one fateful night when some bright spark decided to rename him , quite against his will .
Unfortunately , Smooth had the surname Burder .
Not a problem in itself .
But things got boring in the pub one night amongst a bunch of deaf friends and they started to mess around .
Someone started calling him ' Murder ' and testing it out .
They thought it was hilarious , and so did he , at least , at first .
They said nonsense things like , " Here 's Murder coming round the corner , watch out ! " and , " You never know when ' Murder ' is going to creep up on you ! "
Then they 'd collapse in fits of laughter .
They called Smooth a killer and laughed some more .
Let me explain .
When you sign ' murder ' , it 's more than a sign .
It 's like a stabbing motion , your clenched fist raised above your shoulder , striking down on the person in front of you .
The sign is rather like recreating the shower scene in the classic movie Psycho , just without the piercing music .
Indeed , when you see the dramatic sign , you feel like you should take notes in case you 're asked to give a statement later .
So it seemed more than just a name , and the problem is , it stuck .
My friend went from Smooth to Murder in the blink of an eye , without even being able to call on a lawyer to appeal , get an injunction or plead his case .
Soon , Murder was taking over his life .
Everywhere he went , his name went before him .
People he met would laugh at being told his sign name .
Matters reached a head when the previously successful fellow did n't have a date for months - as if Smooth had been killed off and had been replaced by a murderous new alter ego who quite literally slaughtered his chances with women .
My guess is that somewhere deep in their unconscious , women began to see him as a threat , rather than dating material .
And it was nothing to do with his personality at all .
I reckon that if he 'd actually been a killer , he would have had greater chance of getting a girlfriend - through one of those strange women who writes to serial killers in prison and asks if they can marry them .
Such is the power of a sign name .
Talking of disaster sign names , something similar happened to me three years ago .
I debated whether to write about this , but since I 'm delving into my friends ' lives , I should mention something pertinent from my own .
Here goes .
The New York Times , who seem to have got hold of Take - Two 's data a little earlier than the rest of us , are reporting that the publisher 's going to announce some hard GTA IV sales figures later today .
Those figures will reveal the game has already sold 6 million copies , with an astonishing 3.6 million of them going on the first day .
This means the game 's racked up sales of over $ 500 million in just one week .
Hoo-boy .
If the NYT are on the money , expect Take - Two to confirm this later today .

Cheney 's crony leaves grim Interior legacy
US President George W. Bush ( R ) and Vice President Dick Cheney walk to the Rose Garden on July 10 , 2008 for Bush to sign H.R. 6304 , the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 , at the White House in Washington , DC .
The bill would expand legal authority for electronic wiretaps by spy agencies and includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks .

DEVELOPMENT : Paul Hoffman , high - ranking Interior official , resigns
WHAT IT MEANS : " I can attest to the fact that ( the Department of Interior ) gets in your blood , but I can also say that it does not necessarily turn it green . "
- Paul Hoffman , a deputy assistant secretary of the Interior , announcing his resignation this week .
Hoffman , who got his post thanks to Vice President Dick Cheney , regularly helped the veep undercut environmental regulations , according to a Washington Post investigation published last year .
From keeping the Yellowstone cutthroat trout off the Endangered Species List to helping lift the Clinton - era ban on snowmobiling in Yellowstone National Park , Hoffman , former director of the Cody , Wyo. , Chamber of Commerce , made sure that commerce in his and Cheney 's home state was n't unduly burdened .
Hoffman also overrode the decision of the Grand Canyon 's park superintendent to remove biblical plaques from the park , and forced its bookstores to stock a creationist text claiming the canyon was created in six days a few thousand years ago .
More recently , he tried to rewrite national park management rules to give snowmobiles and off - road vehicles free rein and allow commercial activities , like mining and rock concerts .
Perhaps Interior will bleed a bit more green now .

DEVELOPMENT : Judge Brimmer swats Roadless Rule - again .
WHAT IT MEANS : Five years ago , federal Judge Clarence Brimmer struck down the 2001 Roadless Rule - which put 58.5 million acres of national forestland off - limits to road building - saying the Clinton administration had failed to adequately assess the environmental impacts of leaving all that land alone .
Three years later , that hydra-esque Roadless Rule reared up again when U.S. District Judge Elizabeth LaPorte invalidated the Bush administration 's new state - by - state rule making process , reinstating the Clinton - era protections .
The weary Brimmer returned to his bench Aug. 12 to offer a second ruling against the Roadless Rule .
This time , his opinion included some harsh words for the Clinton administration for being environmentally inconsiderate , along with a written smack - down of Judge LaPorte for being so darn uppity .
The dueling decisions - issued by two judges of equal standing - leave the rule once again in legal limbo .
Lawyers have appealed both decisions to the U.S. circuit courts .
In the meantime , any attempts to develop roadless areas are sure to run up against lawsuits , says Earthjustice attorney Kristen Boyles .
" It 'd be a waste of tax money to try to get into roadless areas while their status is in question . "

7 Captain Boomerang Vs. The Flash While most Superman stories boil down to " He punches something REALLY hard " ( or in the grittier , psychological stories , " He 's really DETERMINED to punch something really hard " ) , the Flash 's stories are based on a fine balance .
The balance between the colossal stupidity of his enemies and the not - quite - so - colossal stupidity of the hero , who never seems to remember that since he has superhuman speed , he could kill anyone before they even know they 're his enemy , literally the instant he decides to do so .

But even this balance swung over to " wildly one - sided " when he fought Captain Boomerang .
We seriously doubt that there is a Boomerang Army , or that they would promote this man to captain .
How do you take on a hero who can outrun bullets ?
If you 're George Harkness you think , " I 'll use slower projectiles that are designed to return to me , and because I have the mental faculties of a goldfish and have already forgotten the beginning of this sentence , I will then strap explosives to these projectiles !
I can see no possible flaw in this plan ! "
Harkness turned to crime after an audience ridiculed his boomeranging prowess , a decision which turned out even worse than you 'd expect .
Captain Boomerang is considered a joke even among the Rogue 's Gallery of mental patients that are Flash villains , and those guys take orders from a talking Gorilla .

6 Thunderpunch Vs. The Transformers Thunderpunch was one of the Neo- Knights , a super - team dedicated to the destruction of the Transformers .
If you imagine that means they piloted incredible super - bot - scrapping mega- machines , then congratulations !
You 're way smarter than the Neo - Knights .
Instead , they went toe - to - toe with robots who could honestly step on them without noticing the squishing sound , let alone their array of wildly unsuitable superpowers .
But none was worse than Thunderpunch .

He had ( slightly ) superhuman strength and was a classic case of somebody choosing the exact wrong opponent to nullify his only advantages .
Fully half the crime - fighting heroes ever have been variations of the " Punches people really hard " power , but when you 're dealing with four - story tall robots that also turn into tanks , it 's like a particularly athletic moth launching itself at the sun .
Thunderpunch did n't do himself any favors when designing his uniform either : notice that the only parts of his body he does n't coat with metal or hard - wearing fabric are the parts he hits robots with .

This country ’s harsh regime of immigration enforcement is racked with troubles from top to bottom , from the federal raids recklessly sweeping thousands of harmless immigrants into custody to the scandal - riddled detention system that abuses and neglects them once they get there .
Last week ,
The Times ’s Nina Bernstein reported on another shameful case of someone entering immigration detention , getting sick , and dying .
This time it was Hiu Lui Ng , a computer engineer from China .
He paid the ultimate price for overstaying a visa , and getting lost in a sprawling system that some have likened to a gulag .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement will not comment because of a continuing investigation .
But court affidavits tell a story of shocking neglect :
Although he complained of excruciating back pain for months , and grew ever frailer in custody , officials at the Rhode Island detention center where he was being held denied Mr. Ng an independent medical evaluation and even a wheelchair .
At one point , according to the affidavits , he was shackled and taken in an ambulance for a two - hour drive to Hartford , where an immigration officer pressured him to stop appealing his case and accept deportation .
When lawyers finally persuaded a judge to insist on suitable medical treatment for Mr. Ng , the long - deferred diagnosis was dire .
Prison officials had said it was all an act .
It was terminal cancer  and a broken spine .
Mr. Ng was taken to the hospital , and died five days later .
The Nazca booby , a Galápagos Island seabird , emerges from its shell ready to kill its brother or sister .
Wake Forest University biologists and their colleagues have linked the murderous behavior to high levels of testosterone and other male hormones found in the hatchlings .
The elevated levels of male hormones , called androgens , increase aggression in both male and female chicks and prepare the birds to fight to the death as soon as they hatch , said David J. Anderson , professor of biology at Wake Forest and project leader .
Much of the field work was completed by Martina Müller , while she was a graduate student at Wake Forest .
" The older of two Nazca booby hatchlings unconditionally attacks and ejects the younger from the nest within days of hatching , " Anderson said .
Because Nazca boobies have difficulty raising more than one chick , it is important for the older chick to vanquish the younger one in order to increase its own chances of survival .
According to the study , the high hormone levels also cause the surviving chicks to behave like bullies after they grow up .
They frequently seek out nestlings in their colony , and during those visits they often bite and push around the defenseless youngsters .
Blood samples were taken from Nazca booby chicks within 24 hours of hatching .
In 15 nests with two eggs , blood samples were taken from both hatchlings .
Samples were also taken from 15 hatchlings in one - egg nests .
Then , blood hormones were analyzed by researchers at the University of Maryland , who co-authored the study .
For comparison , the researchers did the same for blue - footed boobies , a closely related species .
The researchers suspect that the Nazca booby hatchlings experience the high level of aggression - related hormone during a " sensitive period " in their growth , when long - term growth patterns are easily affected .
Some Nazca booby nestlings experience a one - two hormonal punch , raising their aggression hormones even higher when they actually have a nest mate .
The nestlings that fight siblings become bigger bullies as adults than the Nazca booby nestlings who never fight .
" The hormones that are part of this epic battle early in life seem to permanently change some aspects of their social personality , " Anderson said .
Nazca booby chicks have aggression - related hormone levels three times as high as their less aggressive cousins , the blue - footed boobies .
Blue - footed boobies do not have the same lethal fights right after hatching and do not go on to bully their fellow birds as adults .
The research is part of a long - term study by Anderson that has included monitoring more than 16,000 Nazca booby nests at Punta Cevallos , Isla Espanola , in the Galápagos Islands since 1984 .
Going Down Conversation with a friend , as we walk to the elevators : Friend :
So , what are you up to this weekend ?
Me : Saturday we are going to the Chihuly museum .
Friend :
Oh , you know it 's not just Chihuly , right ?
It 's devoted to glass in general .
Me : No , I had n't realized .
Friend : Yeah , they even have a glass blowing room , where you can see people making art and stuff .
Me : Cool .
At this point the elevator arrives containing two people .
We enter .
Friend :
The last time I went they were blowing a squirrel .
Me : A squirrel ?
Friend : Yeah , it was like this three - foot high squirrel , and there were two or three people blowing it .
Like , taking turns .
Me : That 's kind of strange .
Friend :
Not at all what I was expecting to see , that 's for sure .
We arrive at the next floor .
The two other people exit looking perplexed and creeped out .

Karadzic was one of the world 's most wanted war crimes fugitives .
He is a former Bosnian Serb president and a masterminded man of the ethnic cleansing .
More than 8000 Muslims were killed during the 1992 - 95 Bosnian war .
But the latest research says about 100,000 people were killed in this war .
Karadzic was arrested on early Tuesday morning in a sweep by Serbian security forces .
After Karadzic , Myanmar military leader Than Shwe should be considered and included in the list of world ’s most wanted because he masterminded to kill the Buddhist monks and people during September uprising , 2007 .
He can also be accused of masterminding " ethnic cleansing " killings of Sham , Kayin and its own citizens .
The Army and Senior General Than Shwe had committed similar crimes of killing NLD members and students on many occasions .
The major massacre is in Depe Yin town , 30th May 2003 , hundreds of NLD members led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi , were killed .
The intention of Depe Yin massacre was to assassinate Daw Aung San Kyi , but she fortunately released with the help of people and pro-democracy members .
Recently the Nargis cyclone hit many parts of Myanmar , with more than 138,000 people killed and more than 2 million people helpless , homeless and hopeless .
Nargis killed less , but Myanmar military government killed more with the failures to rescue , food supplies and medical supplies .
All the cruelties of life in Myanmar are masterminded by Senior General Than Shwe .
The moral center of humanity slowly asserts itself .
Only the most powerful are too afraid to join .
You may have missed the news :
At the end of May , 111 nations , including , at the last minute , Great Britain , showing the world the power of an unleashed conscience , agreed to an international ban on cluster bombs , surely one of the cruelest and , given the nature of war today , most unnecessary weapons in modern arsenals .
Among those not endorsing the treaty and MIA at the conference in Dublin where it was debated were Russia , China , Israel and , to the surprise of no one , the United States of George Bush , that increasingly isolated moral rump state of which so many are so ashamed .
Indeed , the treaty is widely seen as a " diplomatic defeat " for the U.S. , so identified is the Bush administration with the sanctity of its WMD .
The official U.S. stance on cluster bombs is that they have " demonstrated military utility , " which trumps " the humanitarian concerns of those in Dublin , " which the U.S. nonetheless shares with such passion that , as Defense Secretary Robert Gates explained in a recent policy memo , " by 2018 the military will no longer use cluster weapons with a failure rate greater than 1 percent .
In the interim period the U.S. will deplete its existing stockpiles of cluster munitions with a greater than 1 percent dud rate by exporting them to foreign governments that agree not to use them starting in 2018 . "
Certainly there is a hellish ingenuity to the cluster bomb , which was designed for use on an open field of battle .
A " mother canister , " as it is called , opens in mid-air and releases hundreds of grenade - size bombs that " spew deadly shrapnel over very large swathes of land " when they hit the ground , as explained recently in the Salt Lake Tribune by former munitions researcher Dick Devlin .
And Canadian journalist Gwynne Dyer adds : " If they exploded high enough to let the bomblets scatter properly , a few well - placed cluster bombs or shells could destroy dozens of soft - skinned military vehicles and blunt the attack of an entire mechanized infantry battalion .
A few hundred could stop an army corps . "
Of course , we do n't use cluster bombs to disable massing infantries .
We have n't fought that kind of war in over 50 years .
We use them now in counterinsurgency warfare , against primarily civilian populations , in such places as Kosovo ( U.S. ) , Afghanistan ( U.S. , Russia ) , Lebanon ( Israel ) and , of course , Iraq ( U.S. ) .
We use them , in other words , to shred innocent bystanders .
Oh , and there 's one other feature to these weapons :
Up to 20 percent of the bomblets fail to explode on impact .
The fight moves on , but the duds stay on the ground until someone -- often a child -- disturbs them .
Then they go off .
It might be years later , well after the war is over .
But then , wars are never over -- and each unexploded bomblet that litters the planet is a metaphor waiting patiently to make this point .
This last property of cluster bombs is the one that has made them a focal point of humanitarian outrage , out of proportion ( it almost seems ) to the number of deaths that belated detonations have actually caused over the years -- worldwide , in the thousands -- relative to the total number of people , civilians and otherwise , who are chewed up physically , emotionally and spiritually in the grinding fury and stupidity of humanity 's wars .
The Dublin accord creates a new international convention , to be formally signed in December , that prohibits the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of cluster bombs .
While the big geopolitical players , the major devotees and users of this hideous weapon , are not a part of it , they will be affected by it .
For instance , Dyer , echoing other observers on the power of moral persuasion , writes : " Cluster bombs are now stigmatized as immoral and ( for most countries ) illegal weapons .
. . .
What the treaty really does is to shift assumptions so that international public opinion will see a country that uses cluster bombs as being in the wrong . "
Great , I say , but let 's expand the context .
Banning or stigmatizing the use of cluster bombs will , at best , minimize one specific form of cruelty practiced in warfare .
This may be an important step toward a saner , safer world .
But too limited a focus could , at worst , bestow a faux - blessing on hellish wars fought with " legal " weapons only .
Governments can always find ways around specific moral strictures .
The world banned poison gas after World War I , but World War II gave us the saturation bombing of cities and , ultimately , nuclear weapons .
Cluster bombs are morally preposterous because their long - term consequences reveal the folly of the short - term strategic ends for which they were employed .
The principle that makes them wrong also stigmatizes war itself .
Let us not stop demanding moral sanity till we get to the heart of our folly .

" I plucked up the courage to investigate and I pulled out a little baby bat .
I just lost my breath when I saw it and I did not know what it was at first , " she said .
Ever heard the one about the dog that could sniff out cancers ?
Well , the story could have a basis in fact .
Scientists revealed yesterday how odours from the skin could be used to detect certain tumours .
Human skin emits hundreds of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds , many of which are odorous .
By comparing the chemicals released by the skin of healthy volunteers to those with basal cell carcinoma , the most common form of skin cancer , scientists were able to characterise the " smell " of the tumours .
Michelle Gallagher , a chemist at Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia , took the inspiration for her experiments from stories that dogs could sniff out cancers .
" Researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours , but we 're the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved , " she said .
" This research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours , hopefully leading to more rapid and non-invasive detection and diagnosis . "
Gallagher analysed the air above tumours in 11 patients with basal cell carcinoma , the most common skin cancer .
These were compared with the odour from the skin of 11 people without cancer .
The findings were presented yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia .
The scientists have applied for a patent on their work .
They eventually plan to identify odour profiles for all types of skin cancer , including squamous cell cancer and melanoma .
If all goes well , the technique could be combined with an electronic nose that could aid in the diagnosis of cancers .
Lara Bennett , a science information officer at Cancer Research UK , warned against expecting too much from the research and said larger studies were required : " Our skin releases many different chemicals , and their levels depend on many factors , including the area of the body and the age of the person - factors that would make developing a national skin cancer screen based on detecting them extremely difficult , " she said .
Nina Goad of the British Association of Dermatologists also welcomed the research but said that , at present , skin cancers tend not to pose much of a problem for diagnosis when seen by a specialist .
" They have a distinctive appearance and if there is any doubt then biopsy is a simple confirmatory investigation . "
Genetic modification actually cuts the productivity of crops , an authoritative new study shows , undermining repeated claims that a switch to the controversial technology is needed to solve the growing world food crisis .
The study – carried out over the past three years at the University of Kansas in the US grain belt – has found that GM soya produces about 10 per cent less food than its conventional equivalent , contradicting assertions by advocates of the technology that it increases yields .
Professor Barney Gordon , of the university 's department of agronomy , said he started the research – reported in the journal Better Crops – because many farmers who had changed over to the GM crop had " noticed that yields are not as high as expected even under optimal conditions " .
He added : " People were asking the question ' how come I do n't get as high a yield as I used to ? ' "
He grew a Monsanto GM soybean and an almost identical conventional variety in the same field .
The modified crop produced only 70 bushels of grain per acre , compared with 77 bushels from the non-GM one .
The GM crop – engineered to resist Monsanto's own weedkiller , Roundup – recovered only when he added extra manganese , leading to suggestions that the modification hindered the crop 's take - up of the essential element from the soil .
Even with the addition it brought the GM soya 's yield to equal that of the conventional one , rather than surpassing it .
The new study confirms earlier research at the University of Nebraska , which found that another Monsanto GM soya produced 6 per cent less than its closest conventional relative , and 11 per cent less than the best non-GM soya available .
The Nebraska study suggested that two factors are at work .
First , it takes time to modify a plant and , while this is being done , better conventional ones are being developed .
This is acknowledged even by the fervently pro-GM US Department of Agriculture , which has admitted that the time lag could lead to a " decrease " in yields .
But the fact that GM crops did worse than their near - identical non-GM counterparts suggest that a second factor is also at work , and that the very process of modification depresses productivity .
The new Kansas study both confirms this and suggests how it is happening .
A similar situation seems to have happened with GM cotton in the US , where the total US crop declined even as GM technology took over .
( See graphic above . )
Monsanto said yesterday that it was surprised by the extent of the decline found by the Kansas study , but not by the fact that the yields had dropped .
It said that the soya had not been engineered to increase yields , and that it was now developing one that would .
Critics doubt whether the company will achieve this , saying that it requires more complex modification .
And Lester Brown , president of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington – and who was one of the first to predict the current food crisis – said that the physiology of plants was now reaching the limits of the productivity that could be achieved .
A former champion crop grower himself , he drew the comparison with human runners .
Since Roger Bannister ran the first four - minute mile more than 50 years ago , the best time has improved only modestly .
" Despite all the advances in training , no one contemplates a three - minute mile . "
Last week the biggest study of its kind ever conducted – the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development – concluded that GM was not the answer to world hunger .
Professor Bob Watson , the director of the study and chief scientist at the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , when asked if GM could solve world hunger , said : " The simple answer is no . "

OiNK allowed members to swap high quality music files
British police have arrested the individual users of a file sharing website for the first time .
Six former members of the now - defunct file - sharing site OiNK were detained " in relation to uploading pre-released music , " according to Cleveland Police .
Five men aged between 19 and 33 and a 28 - year - old woman have now been released on bail without charge .
OiNK was shut down last October by Cleveland Police acting on advice from Interpol .
Its servers in Amsterdam were seized and returned wiped of any data .
The free site allowed its 180,000 members to swap high quality music files with each other using the Bittorrent protocol .
Leaked tracks
Membership was by invite - only and users were asked to upload a certain amount of material every month .
Unlike similar Bittorrent sites , OiNK members had to register using a valid email address .
Both the police and the record industry said that users often traded in pre-released or leaked tracks before the material was available to buy in the shops .
In a statement , the BPI , which speaks for the record industry , said : " The illegal online distribution of music , particularly pre-release , is hugely damaging , and as OiNK was the biggest source for pre-releases at the time we moved to shut it down .
" We provided the information to assist this investigation , but this is now a police matter and we are unable to comment further at this stage . "
Tougher penalties
A 24 - year - old IT worker was arrested last October as part of the investigation into OiNK .
He remains on police bail on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and infringement of copyright law .
But the latest arrests mark the first time British police have taken direct action against the members or users of a file sharing website .
The record industry has also been pressing for tougher penalties for people caught downloading music illegally .
It advocates a three - strike rule where internet providers are asked to cut off the connection of customers who have ignored warnings about downloading pirated material .
Senators Barack Obama and John McCain have both criticized private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan , while they 've also acknowledged that they do n't see a way to guard government officials without the services of companies like Blackwater .
Obama has long advocated for increased accountability of private security contractors .
In February 2007 -- seven months before Blackwater contractors killed 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad ’s Nisour Square -- he introduced legislation to clarify contractors ’ legal status and create an FBI unit to investigate contractor misconduct .
The bill never came to a vote , but in the days after the Nisour Square shooting , Obama introduced a more modest amendment simply requiring closer tracking of contractors .
McCain also voted for the amendment , which passed unanimously in September 2007 .
Though the candidates do n’t have kind words for security contractors , both have opposed calls to remove contractors from Iraq .
" Here 's the problem : we have 140,000 private contractors right there , " Obama said in March .
" So unless we want to replace all of or a big chunk of those with U.S. troops , we can't draw down the contractors faster than we can draw down our troops . "
" I 'd like it [ the U.S. military to guard State Department officials in Iraq ] but we do n’t have enough , " McCain said in October .
" And I 'd love to see pigs fly , but it ai n't gonna happen . "
The State Department has only 1,450 diplomatic security agents worldwide , with only a small portion of those in Iraq -- just 36 , according to author Jeremy Scahill .
Shortly after the Nisour Square shootings , Ryan Crocker , the American ambassador to Iraq , underscored this point : " There is simply no way at all that the State Department 's Bureau of Diplomatic Security could ever have enough full - time personnel to staff the security function in Iraq .
There is no alternative except through contracts . "
Neither of the candidates appears to have commented when the State Department renewed Blackwater ’s diplomatic security contract in Iraq for another year .
Nor did the campaigns weigh in on the recent controversy regarding the question of contractors ' immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts .
McCain has not directly addressed his ties to private security companies .
BKSH & Associates , a lobbying firm headed until this spring by McCain adviser Charles Black , advised Blackwater during congressional hearings following the Nisour Square shooting .
The campaign ’s senior foreign policy adviser , former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , served as a senior adviser for Veritas Capital from 2005 to 2007 .
Veritas owns DynCorp International , another major security contractor in Iraq .
( We found no reports of anyone in Obama 's campaign connected to security contractors . )
The McCain campaign declined to comment for this article , and the Obama campaign did n’t respond to our requests for an interview .

Drug prices up 100 % — or higher
Spikes bring legal , political scrutiny
Drug companies are quietly pushing through price hikes of 100 % — or even more than 1,000 % — for a very small but growing number of prescription drugs , helping to drive up costs for insurers , patients and government programs .
The number of brand - name drugs with increases of 100 % or more could double this year from four years ago , researchers from the University of Minnesota say .
Many of the drugs are older products that treat fairly rare , but often serious or even life - threatening , conditions .
Among the examples : Questcor Pharmaceuticals last August raised the wholesale price on Acthar , which treats spasms in babies , from about $ 1,650 a vial to more than $ 23,000 .
Ovation raised the cost of Cosmegen , which treats a type of tumor , from $ 16.79 to $ 593.75 in January 2006 .
The average wholesale price of 26 brand - name drugs jumped 100 % or more in a single cost adjustment last year , up from 15 in 2004 , the university study found .
In the first half of this year , 17 drugs made the list .
" This does drive up the price of health care , " says Alan Goldbloom , president of Children 's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota .
" Hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers , so you and I are paying it in increased premiums . "
Some of the drugs are administered in hospitals , which bill insurers , patients or government programs for them .
Insured patients pay either a flat dollar amount , such as $ 20 , or a percentage of the drug 's cost .
Last year , prices rose about 7.4 % on average for 1,344 brand - name drugs , according to Express Scripts , which manages drug benefits for large employers and insurers .
Reasons for the larger increases are varied , researchers say .
" There 's no simple explanation , " says Stephen Schondelmeyer , director of the PRIME Institute at the University of Minnesota , which studies drug industry economics .
" Some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it . "
The price increases are drawing legal and political scrutiny :
• In a decision awaiting approval by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , drugmaker Abbott agreed last week to pay up to $ 27.5 million to settle a lawsuit over a 400 % price increase on its HIV / AIDS drug Norvir .
Settlement did not lower the price .
• Sen . Amy Klobuchar , D - Minn. , and Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , asked the Government Accountability Office last week to investigate large price hikes .
Klobuchar asked the Federal Trade Commission in April to investigate Ovation Pharmaceuticals , which raised prices on four drugs in 2006 by up to 3,436 % .
Drug companies say the price hikes cover the costs of keeping the drugs on the market .
They say the drugs are often less costly than alternative treatments , such as surgery or newer , high - tech medicines .
Questcor says on its website that it had to raise Acthar 's price after struggling for years to " keep ( it ) financially viable . "
Ovation says it needed to cover its 2005 purchase of the drugs and facility upgrades .
" We feel we made an important investment in keeping these older products alive , " says spokeswoman Sally Benjamin Young .
The Republican National Committee on Monday largely backed off from threats to sue CafePress for hosting an online venue for vendors to hawk trademarked GOP - related regalia like T - shirts , stickers and portrayals of elephants .
" The RNC is basically caving , " said Paul Alan Levy , a lawyer for Public Citizen Litigation Group , the nonprofit group representing the Foster City - based T - shirt - selling site .
Under the deal , the Grand Old Party will allow the sale of most anything depicting its trademarks .
The RNC owns the trademarks to " GOP , " " Grand Old Party , " " Republican National Committee , " " RNC " and the official GOP elephant logo .
The accord , however , requires CafePress vendors selling paraphernalia solely with the trademarked GOP elephant logo or the letters G - O - P to secure a license from the committee .
" Those users selling shirts or bumper stickers that is nothing but that must apply for licenses , " Levy said in a telephone interview .
" It 's hard to justify litigation over that . "
Levy , who said the accord is the result of recent back - and - forth negotiations , expected the licenses would be free .
" If not , we 'll have to figure out what we 'll do about it . "
Hundreds of various GOP - related pieces of merchandise are for sale on CafePress – some favorable and some not .
The GOP did not discriminate against favorable or unfavorable paraphernalia .
On Thursday , Threat Level published one of a few letters ( . pdf ) the committee sent to CafePress before the flap was resolved .
" Please cease and desist from allowing vendors to utilize the federally registered trademarks of the RNC or we will be forced to consider a legal remedy , " Sean Cairncross , the party 's chief counsel , wrote CafePress .
Alex Conant , a GOP spokesman , said " We asked them to stop selling with our trademarked logo on them .
They agreed . "
The agreement , ( .pdf ) for example , would not require a license to sell a shirt with a design portraying a GOP - trademarked elephant trailed by two smaller elephants and the words , " I 'm raising my children right . "
Before the deal , the committee maintained such a depiction was a trademark violation .

I can reveal that sometime last year , reddit got a National Security Letter ( NSL ) from FBI , requesting access to the reddit logs .
Much to my dismay , instead of enlisting ACLU help , the reddit admins promptly handed over all the data .
I left reddit in disgust , but due to the gag order that comes with the NSL , I was not able to tell you what happened .
I no longer can keep this a secret .
So many of you may have become targets of FBI surveillance because of reddit admins ' actions .
If FBI identify my identity , I could be in serious legal trouble .
But I still want all of you to know that instead of protecting your privacy , the reddit guys just handed your data over to the authorities .
The Internet Archive successfully fought off an NSL with the help of ACLU and EFF .
reddit could 've done the same if they wanted to .
I urge you to think twice before posting on reddit .
The owners of reddit make money out of your submissions , but do n't even have the decency to protect you from the long tentacles of the Patriot Act .

PLATTSBURGH —
The federal government has agreed to allow most New York residents to use a new , more secure driver license to cross the border .
New York Gov. David Paterson announced the agreement between the state and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
A New York Enhanced Driver License has been added to the list of approved alternatives to passports for entry to the United States from Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and Bermuda under Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative .
The new Enhanced Driver Licenses are anticipated to be available by summer ’s end , well in advance of the WHTI , which will go into effect June 1 , 2009 .
“ The development of this license will help to ease long lines at our New York - Canada border crossings , allowing commerce to flow more freely and securely in and out of the state , ” Paterson said .
“ It represents a major step forward that will help the upstate economy and offer a convenience for all New Yorkers who travel in North America . ”
New York residents who are U.S. citizens and want an Enhanced Driver License must go to a New York Department of Motor Vehicles office and submit proof of identity and citizenship .
The new license is expected to cost $ 80 — $ 30 more than a regular driver license — and be valid for eight years .

Speculation of widespread closures was sparked when every Australian store was ordered to close at 2 pm so all staff could attend 28 meetings around the country but they were not given prior indication of the move .
Starbucks announced in a statement embargoed until 5 pm today that the decision to close 61 " underperforming " locations was made " to concentrate its attention and resources on profitable growth , operational efficiencies and an enhanced experience for customers and partners [ employees ] globally " .
Starbucks calls its employees " partners " .
Starbucks Asia Pacific president John Culver would not reveal which stores would close , saying he wanted employees to be told first .
" Obviously a decision like this is a very difficult decision for any company to make and really more so from a Starbucks perspective because of the impact that we have on our people , " he said .
" We wanted to make sure we handled these announcements the right way and put our people first . "
The locations of the closures will be made public on July 31 when they will be posted on the chain 's Australian website .
Mr Culver said the company had set up an " employee assistance line " offering counselling to its " partners " and redundancy packages would be offered .
Casual staff would also be offered redundancy .
He refused to say why the employees were give such short notice of the massive closures .
" As part of the decision all partners , whether they have worked for the company for week or multiple years , will be eligible for a redundancy package , " Mr Culver said .
" Depending on length of service and position , it ranges anywhere from a maximum of 20 weeks of redundancy pay that we will be paying .
All partners at a minimum will receive at least a week 's notice - period pay as well as two weeks ' severance pay .
" This is above and beyond what we are legally required to do but we feel it's the right decision to support our partners and show the value we place on them as people . "
Mr Culver said about 685 employees would lose their jobs but he would not reveal what proportion of them were full time and casual .
RIYADH ( Reuters ) -
High oil prices are hitting those least able to afford it , but an imbalance in demand and supply which is partly behind the price spike could last for years , Britain ’s energy minister said on Saturday .
“ The sheer scale of the price rises speaks of a clear belief that this supply and demand imbalance will continue for years to come , ” Malcolm Wicks said in a speech to the Riyadh - based International Energy Forum .
He cited the rapid development of countries such as India and China , coupled with slower oil supply on international markets , as being mainly behind record prices that neared $ 140 per barrel last week .
Saudi Arabia has called an unprecedented one - day meeting of oil - producing and consuming nations in Jeddah on June 22 , which could be attended by some heads of state .
Britain ’s Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said he will be there .
Saudi Arabia , the world ’s biggest oil exporter , has said current prices are unjustifiable but blamed speculators and a weak dollar .
Riyadh has said it will pump an extra 300,000 barrels per day to make up for shortfalls by other OPEC members .
The New York Times reported on Friday that Saudi Arabia is considering raising production by around 500,000 bpd to stem prices .
“ There are understandable concerns about speculators pushing the price higher than the fundamentals would suggest , ” Wicks said , acknowledging that speculation plays a role .
Poorer countries and the poor generally were hardest hit by expensive energy , he said .
“ The dramatic price rise has put pressure on economies .
It has put energy security of some countries under strain , and it is creating real problems for many of those people that are least able to pay for the energy they need , ” he said .
“ In the UK , as elsewhere , we are having to do more than ever to look after those on lower incomes who are hardest hit by rising fuel costs . ”
An Australian submarine has fired a new heavy torpedo for the first time and sunk a US warship .
But , rest easy , the dramatic event was part of an exercise and not a sudden deterioration in relations with the US .
The Minister for Defence , Joel Fitzgibbon , congratulated the crew of the submarine HMAS Waller on the sinking .
The researchers looked at the activity of over 9,000 genes
The Chicago University team looked at over 9,000 genes in 180 people , half Caucasian and half from Nigeria .
They found differences between the two races in 5 % of key genes .
The American Journal of Human Genetics study may help explain why some groups are more vulnerable to disease , and aid development of more tailored treatment .
Gum disease
The researchers used gene chip array technology , which uses a microscope to analyse a specialised slide capable of containing thousands of genes derived from blood cells .
Sixty nuclear families , each including a mother , a father and a child were studied .
Thirty were from Utah in the US , while the rest were Yorubans from Ibadan , Nigeria .
We want to understand why different populations experience different degrees of toxicity when taking certain drugs
Professor Eileen Dolan , University of Chicago
The researchers looked at expression levels - how active a gene is .
They found significant differences , particularly in immune system genes involved in producing antibodies to combat bacterial infection .
This backs up previous work which has shown African Americans may be more susceptible than Caucasians to infection , such as the gum disease bug Porphyromonas gingivalis .
The US study also found activity levels varied significantly in genes involved in basic cellular processes which are thought to play a part in how the body responds to drugs , including the risk of side effects .
' Small and subtle '
Professor Eileen Dolan , who led the research , said : " Our primary interest is the genes that regulate how people respond to medicines , such as cancer chemotherapy .
" We want to understand why different populations experience different degrees of toxicity when taking certain drugs and learn how to predict who might be most at risk for drug side effects . "
She added : " Population differences in gene expression have only recently begun to be investigated .
" We believe they play a significant role in susceptibility to disease and in regulating drug response .
" Our current research focuses on how these genetic and expression differences play a role in sensitivity to adverse effects associated with chemotherapy . "
Dr Chris Tyler - Smith , a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust 's Sanger Institute , said genetic differences between ethnic groups were " small and subtle " .
" They usually just consist of slight differences in frequency of a few variants found in all populations .
But they are important for our understanding of recent evolution and can have medical implications as well .
" They have been difficult to identify , and it is particularly interesting to see that characteristics like variation in susceptibility to infection are showing up . "
OP-ED
We , as parents , are well aware of the importance of our teachers who teach and program our children .
We also know how important it is for our children to play with good - thinking children growing up .
Sen .
Barack Obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry , militant white and black people : the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Louis Farrakhan , William Ayers and Rev. Michael Pfleger .
We cannot say we are not affected by teachers who are militant and angry .
We know too well that we become like them , and Mr. Obama will run this country in their mindset .
The Democratic Party , in its quest for power , has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages , creating a God - like figure in a man who falls short in every way .
It seems to me that if Mr. Obama wins the presidential election , then Messrs .
Farrakhan , Wright , Ayers and Pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist America .
The Democrats have targeted young people , knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds .
I know this process well .
I was caught up in the hysteria during the Vietnam era , which was brought about through Marxist propaganda underlying the so - called peace movement .
The radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2.5 million people in Cambodia and South Vietnam .
Did they stop the war , or did they bring the war to those innocent people ?
In the end , they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away .
Those same leaders who were in the streets in the ‘ 60s are very powerful today in their work to bring down the Iraq war and to attack our president , and they have found their way into our schools .
William Ayers is a good example of that .
Thank God , today , we have a strong generation of young soldiers who know exactly who they are and what they must do to protect our freedom and our democracy .
And we have the leadership of Gen. David Petraeus , who has brought hope and stability to Iraq and prevented the terrorists from establishing a base in that country .
Our soldiers are lifting us to an example of patriotism at a time when we ’ve almost forgotten who we are and what is at stake .
If Mr. Obama had his way , he would have pulled our troops from Iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath , turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies .
With what he has openly stated about his plans for our military , and his lack of understanding about the true nature of our enemies , there ’s not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that Mr. Obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world , and from Iran , which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb .
And while a misleading portrait of Mr. Obama is being perpetrated by a media controlled by the Democrats , the Obama camp has sent out people to attack the greatness of Sen.
John McCain , whose suffering and courage in a Hanoi prison camp is an American legend .
Gen . Wesley Clark , who himself has shame upon him , having been relieved of his command , has done their bidding and become a lying fool in his need to demean a fellow soldier and a true hero .
This is a perilous time , and more than ever , the world needs a united and strong America .
If , God forbid , we live to see Mr. Obama president , we will live through a socialist era that America has not seen before , and our country will be weakened in every way .

The most recent xkcd comic reminds me of a interesting phenomena I ’ve observed …
I ’ve noticed that people tend to have an “ insider ” and “ outsider ” explanation for their particular areas of expertise .
The outsider explanation largely parrots the party line and provides a surface explanation that of how things should be .
The insider explanation though , is infinitely more interesting to listen to .
People will drop their guard and provide a frank and often hilarious view of how things actually are done because you ’ve proven yourself to be someone safe to dish with .
What does it require for someone to assume that you ’re an “ insider ” ?
In my experience , after having spoken to people from a variety of different fields , the transition point from outsider to insider is surprisingly universal .
2 facts and a joke
The way to pass as an insider is to prove that you know 2 facts and a joke .
For example , if Michael and I were strangers and I were to be talking to him about designs for a business card , the conversation might go something like this :
Michael :
So do you have any ideas for the basic style of the card ?
Hang :
Well , I ’ve always like minimalistic Swiss school type stuff ( fact 1 ) .
Michael :
Ok , we can do that , what sort of font were you thinking ?
Hang : Hrmm …
I want it to stand out so… not Helvetica ( joke 1 ) .
Something a bit machine like and futuristic .
Oh , and make sure it ’s nicely kerned as well ( fact 2 ) .
Note that the joke does n’t actually have to be funny .
In fact , it ’s often better if it ’s not funny because funny jokes get repeated to outsiders and lose their insider cachet ( making fun of comic sans would not work in this case since there ’s so many funny websites lampooning comic sans ) .
What 2 facts and a joke indicates to someone is that you understand both the content of the discipline as well as the culture .
To understand a joke , you have to understand the implicit cultural values and assumptions that are held by lampooning them .
I ’ve tried numerous permutations over the years and it ’s amazing how consistently this works .
I ’ve trotted out 20 facts before and still been treated like an outsider until I told that one joke .
I ’ve cracked half a dozen jokes but could n’t get anywhere until I threw in some facts .
So next time you want to try reenacting xkcd in real life , just remember , 2 facts and a joke …
Hello , PS. blog readers !
At the end of July , we announced the game The Last Guy for North America , and said there would be much more about the game in the coming weeks .
Since then , I hope you ’ve checked out the trailers that have been released , the special “ interview ” with the guys in the Himalayas , and the just - posted IGN review .
If you have n’t heard of The Last Guy yet , here ’s the run-down .
Every stage is a real city , shown from overhead using detailed aerial photography .
Basically you make your way through cities , find people hiding in buildings , and lead them to the Escape Zone while avoiding zombies roaming the streets .
Use thermography vision to find people hiding in buildings , “ dash ” to run away quicker , and “ huddle ” to scrunch up the line to keep the people out of the path of the zombies .
The controls are simple , but keeping your line away from the zombies and making it to the Escape Zone without losing anyone is anything but .
We released the demo last week , giving a taste of half of the Asakusa , Tokyo stage , one of the many stages in The Last Guy .
I hope you ’ve had a chance to check it out .
If you ’re anything like me , you probably have that song stuck in your head too .
Well , I ’m back here on the blog today because I ’m here to announce that the full North American release of The Last Guy will be hitting the North American PlayStation Store tomorrow afternoon for $ 9.99 !
And you can purchase the game from the PlayStation Store , or from right inside the demo itself .
How handy is that ?
With the full game , you ’ll get to experience the full Asakusa stage from the demo , plus a bunch of other exciting cities from around the world , with 15 stages in all .
Of course there ’s London and Los Angeles , which we originally mentioned .
And in the latest trailer above you can see cities like Washington , D.C. , Sydney , Berlin , and Chinatown in Yokohama , Japan .
There are lots of other great cities waiting to be saved by you in the full game , plus a bunch of different kinds of zombies and boss zombies for you to outwit and out - maneuver .
You ’ll definitely have to use the power - ups scattered throughout each stage wisely to make it through each of the 15 stages .
Here are a few cool screenshots from some of the new cities , Berlin and San Francisco .
So you have until tomorrow afternoon to practice with the demo to perfect your line - leading zombie - avoiding skills , thermography powers , building - encircling technique , and Stamina gauge management .
Because the levels in the full game are much more challenging , and even feature online rankings and different ratings for how well you do ( like how many VIPs you find and rescue ) .
Who knows , maybe something cool will happen if you get a good “ clear ” rating on all the levels …
By the way , there will be a couple of cool The Last Guy wallpapers on the store tomorrow as well .
Hope you like ’em !
Let me know what you think of the demo , and the full game when it comes out tomorrow .
Thanks !
A federal judge today sided with the Bush administration in a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit related to missing White House e-mails .
Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly , who is probably most familiar to Ars readers for her role in the Microsoft antitrust case , held that the White House 's Office of Administration was not a federal agency as that term is defined by the FOIA and was therefore not obligated to respond to FOIA requests .
The ruling represents a setback for the plaintiff , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , which was also behind the White House e-mail lawsuit we covered in April .
That lawsuit was heard by a different judge , was directed at a different federal agency , and was filed under different federal statutes : the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act .
The White House has denied wrongdoing in that case , and the case is still being litigated .
In contrast , today 's decision may represent the end of CREW 's efforts to unearth records about the White House 's e-mail problems under FOIA .
CREW was seeking internal documents that could reveal the extent of the missing e-mail problem .
Not surprisingly , the Bush administration has been reluctant to release those potentially embarrassing records .
Indeed , after more than a quarter - century of complying with FOIA requests , last year the Office of Administration announced that it had re-considered its status under FOIA and would no longer comply with FOIA requests .
FOIA applies to executive branch entities with " substantial independent authority , " and it specifically excludes the president 's personal staff and advisors .
For example , the executive residence staff , which does cooking and cleaning for the president and his guests , is not subject to FOIA requests .
Similarly , purely advisory bodies like the Council of Economic Advisors and the National Security Council are exempt from FOIA because they simply provide advice and administrative support to the president , and wield no independent authority .
The Office of Administration provides administrative support to the executive offices of the president and vice president .
It offers a variety of clerical , administrative , and technical services , including — most crucially — e- mail services .
In 2007 , CREW made a demand under FOIA that OA produce internal documents concerning the extent of its e-mail problems .
Rather than producing the requested materials , the Office of Administration reversed its decades - long policy of complying with FOIA requests .
CREW sued , and OA told the courts that due to its proximity to the president and its lack of policymaking authority , it was not an " agency " as that term is definied by FOIA , and that it was therefore exempt from information requests .
In today 's decision , Judge Kollar - Kotelly bought this argument .
Acknowledging that it was a close case , she concluded that OA was more like the White House housekeeping staff than the full - blown federal agencies that FOIA was intended to cover .
In a 29 - page opinion , she rejected CREW 's arguments and dismissed its lawsuit .
The decision is a victory for the White House , but CREW contends that the White House has little to crow about .
" The fact is , until CREW asked for documents pertaining to this problem , the Office of Administration routinely processed FOIA requests , " said executive director Melanie Sloan .
" Only because the administration has so much to hide here , has the White House taken the unprecedented position that OA is not subject to the FOIA . "
She vowed to appeal the decision .
But even if an appeals court agrees to hear the case , CREW is now in a race with the clock as much as it is in a battle with the Bush Administration .
With barely seven months before the next president takes the oath of office , the Bush administration should have little trouble running out the clock on the e-mail dispute .
The task of cleaning up the White House e-mail mess will almost certainly fall to either John McCain or Barack Obama .
It may be a long time before humans can extend their lifespans to hundreds of years , but the technology to make humans look sixty years younger than their actual age is right around the corner .
A group of scientists at the University of Michigan have done an exhaustive study of what gives people the appearance of age — wrinkled , saggy , or broken skin — and figured out a quick fix that may keep skin looking taut and young even though the person inside it has grown very old .
The key lies with collagen , a spongy layer of tissue beneath the skin that is gradually dissolved as people grow older .

Scientists say that aging bodies release an enzyme called collagenase that literally eats away at collagen , which in turn makes the skin weak and thin .
It sags and becomes easier to bruise or tear .
If collagenase could be removed from the body , or the collagen itself rejuvenated , people 's skin would stay firm and healthy .
There are several possible substances already available that could promote collagen regrowth ( you can see one , Restylane , plumping up collagen in the image above ) .
According to Eurekalert :
The U - M researchers base their conclusions on past studies in which they have explored why certain anti-aging treatments are effective .
A 2007 study looked at Restylane , marketed as a dermal filler , and found that injections of the product caused fibroblasts to stretch , promoting new collagen , and also limited the breakdown of collagen .
In another 2007 study , the U - M team tested lotions containing retinol , a form of Vitamin A found in many skin - care products , and found it significantly reduced wrinkles and skin roughness in elderly skin by promoting new collagen .
Other U - M studies have shown why some laser treatments work and some less powerful ones do not .
Carbon dioxide laser resurfacing is effective because it removes the aging dermis ; in the three - week regrowth process , new , young collagen is produced .
Voorhees and his colleagues say they provide needed , independent research on the effectiveness of available and future treatments to counteract skin aging .
They have no ties to the manufacturers of products they study .

It sounds like the early twenty - first century may be the first time in human history when you might have no idea how old the person is that you 're talking to .
With collagen replacement , you might think that you 're dating a 25 - year - old until she suddenly drops dead of old age .

In every office , there ’s that guy .
He ’s outgoing , and he ’s got a decent , but not great , sense of humor .
You talk about work and what you did on the weekend .
He ’s also kind of a jerk .
He cracks jokes that make you cringe rather than laugh , wondering how anyone could say that , even in jest .
When you talk hobbies , you realize you really have nothing in common beyond the building you work in .
You do n’t hate him , but you do n’t like him either .
You have your place in the world .
He has his .
You ’re both better off with how little they overlap .
For me , the fourth edition of Dungeons and Dragons ( D&D ) is that guy .
Streamlined System
Fourth edition does contain improvements over D&D 3.5 .
Many rules have been simplified .
For example , skills are broader .
Stealth replaces both Hide and Move Silently .
Perception replaces both Spot and Listen .
Thievery replaces Open Locks , Disable Device , Sleight of Hand , and the use of Search to detect devices .
It used to take a fistful of dice to get a rogue down a hallway .
4th edition improves the situation notably .
4th edition also adds the concept of a passive skill check , which allows many actions that used to be opposed roles to be resolved with a single roll .
Grappling , though a combat a action rather than a skill , similarly replaces the contested rolls of 3.5 with single rolls against a difficulty determined by the target ’s attributes and skills .
Previous editions of D&D used saving throws to determine a target ’s ability to resist the effects of magic , breath weapons , poisons , and the like .
Fourth edition replaces saving throws with Fortitude , Reflex , and Will defense statistics that function like Armor Class ( AC ) .
When a spell is cast against a creature , the caster makes an attack roll against the target ’s appropriate defense score ( fortitude , reflex , or will depending on the spell ) .
This change simplifies the rules , making spells operate similarly to mundane missile and melee combat .
The authors removed or simplified many one of a kind mechanics unique to a single class or situation .
For example , they removed cleric domain abilities and almost entirely eliminated memorization of spells .
Wizards still have a memorization mechanic , but it ’s smaller in scope than in previous editions .
Barbarians , bards , druids , monks , and sorcerers are gone altogether from 4th edition , replaced with the addition of the warlord and warlock classes .
Much of the randomness has been removed from player character ( PC ) creation and advancement .
Rolling up attributes with d6s is now a variant rule .
The preferred method for character creation is to take the standard array of attributes or purchase attributes using a point system .
The new rules ensure that characters start off on the same footing .
Similarly , characters gain a fixed number of hit points per level based on their class , rather than rolling .
There are simplifications for the dungeon master ( DM ) as well .
For example , DMs create an encounter by determining a budget of experience points for the encounter , then spending that budget on monsters , traps , and other encounter features .
Power Outages
The trouble began at page 15 of the Player ’s Handbook ( PHB ) .
Each character has a basic role in combat : controller , defender , leader , or striker .
The Dungeon Master ’s Guide ( DMG ) and Monster Manual ( MM ) present a similar system for monsters , though their roles are named artillery , brute , controller , lurker , skirmisher , and soldier .
My first was that it ’s World of Warcraft ( WoW ) meets D&D : “ LF1M Kobold Hall .
Need Defender then GTG ! ” Little did I know …
D&D 3.5 has racial characters , class abilities , spells , and feats for almost anything a heroic character could want to do .
Many of these mechanics introduced their own special case rules , complicating the system as a whole .
The 4th edition authors rewrote almost all of these as Powers , also called Prayers , Exploits , and Spells , depending on the character class .
Characters do n’t get many powers : 4 at 1st level up to 17 at 30th level , plus a few extra for race , class , and paragon path powers .
Feats remain , but there ’s now a sharper division between feats and powers : powers describe what a character can do , whereas feats modify how a thing is done .
Because there are fewer powers , with less variety , and simpler mechanics to resolve them , the game mechanics for powers does streamline the game , a trend which I praised in the section above .
During playtesting , we had trouble with players keeping track of all their powers , but we ’ve already found some recommendations for handling this , such as writing up powers for character on index cards .
Again , though , the system makes me think of computer RPGs and massively multiplayer online games ( CRPGs and MMOs ) .
Character abilities in 4th edition are similar in number and type to popular MMOs .
Many powers can be used once per encounter or once per day , similar to abilities in MMOs that have a cool down timer .
This has some advantages , such as flattening the learning curve for gamers coming to tabletop RPGs from video games .
The mechanics used in video games are far from arbitrary .
That industry has spent a fortune — some in deliberate research , some in learning from costly mistakes — figuring out what makes games fun and playable to gamers .
Doubtless , there are lessons applicable to tabletop RPGs .
Unfortunately , there are drawbacks .
4th edition strips away much of the support for variety and creative play .
The spell selection in 3.5 , even with only the PHB , gave spell casters a wide array of options .
Watching inventive uses of spells , equipment , and human ( or demi- human ) cleverness was one of the joys of the game .
I ’ve seen grease used to rig tournament competitions with lucrative side betting ; illusions used to flatter vain nobles ; magics used to secure shelter , food , water , and profit in dangerous environments ; and oracles used to look deep into the past and future .
4th edition powers focus on combat and healing .
There are exceptions , such as the priest prayer to create a cloud chariot , but even for wizards , who fare better than most classes , most powers are combat spells .
The PHB describes the Divine Oracle paragon path ( think prestige class , more on this later ) thus , “ You become the voice of your god , full of prophecy and omens .
When you use your prophetic powers , your eyes glow with the silvery depths of the Astral sea . ”
What are their path powers ?
They ca n’t be surprised , gain additional combat actions , can re-roll dice , and rewind time to choose alternate actions .
Where is the power that haunts me with visions of that most noble institution , my church , succumbing to corruption and crumbling ?
Where is the mixed blessing , as much curse as power , that my idle musings or cynical jokes sometimes take on the power of prophecy ?
Where ’s the power that invokes my deity to guide my hand as I free write , giving me a Nostradamus - like quatrain that will aid me in my quest if only I can decipher its meaning ?
Where ’s the second sight that could forewarn me before I bought a game with such a pathetic take on the role of divine oracles in a fantasy setting ?
I speculate that 4th edition was deliberately designed so that every mechanic could be refereed by a computer with no intelligent human interpretation .
Spells , abilities , magic items , and other elements of the game that required human adjudication have been replaced by stripped down , usually combat - oriented , game mechanics that can be mechanistically resolved .
Some few remain , relegated to the small chapter on Rituals at the end of the PHB .
( More on that later . )
Behold the wonder , for here we have the Babbage machine of tabletop roleplaying !
A DM must decide what prophetic vision an oracle receives , but a lobotomized COBOL programmer can write software that gives a + 5 attack bonus because a character sees the future .
Perhaps the authors did this to facilitate the D&D Insider service ’s electronic tabletop environment for playing D&D .
Perhaps they are paving the way for CRPGs or MMOs based on D&D .
I really do n’t care why .
The single , most important advantage tabletop RPGs have over CRPGs and MMOs is the infinite possibility .
I can attempt anything I can describe to the DM .
The variety of spells , skills , abilities , and magic items in D&D 3.5 supported that flexibility and freedom .
In 4th edition , almost every game mechanic is a combat mechanic : bonuses and penalties , damage dealt , healing , and / or movement .
Why would I play a tabletop RPG with heroic abilities defined as narrowly as a video game ?
It misses out on the strength of the medium .
Another problem stems from the same cause .
Some of the powers are far fetched .
Yes , I actually brought myself to complain about the realism of a game with fireballs , holy swords , and dragons .
But the problem is n’t realism so much as consistency and expectation .
In a video game , I ’m used to dealing with abstract concepts .
The fact that my warrior in WoW can taunt a slime that does n’t have intelligent reasoning skills is okay , because it ’s consistent with what I expect from the fantasy MMO genre .
The genre conventions are not the same in tabletop fantasy RPGs — at least certainly not for D&D , which has always followed a model closer to a Tolkein or Feist book .
Previously , fighters were outstanding with armor and swords , but they were not inherently magical .
In 4th edition , fighters have abilities like , “ Come and Get It , ” which pull foes toward them .
It seems to be based on a goading or taunting ability , but there ’s no requirement that the fighter share a language with the target or be capable of conveying the taunt without a shared language .
There ’s not even a requirement that the target be intelligent or of the right temperament to get angry and act based on that anger .
Sword and sorcery are fantastic in nature , but beneath the magic there ’s a grounding in human nature , physics , and common sense without which the game world seems arbitrary and unpredictable .
So the trope that works in MMOs seems out of place and unrealistic in a tabletop RPG .
As another examples , 17th level warlords have access to a power called , “ Own the Battlefield . ”
The description is , “ Like a puppet master , you position your enemies exactly how you want them , ” and the effect is to slide every enemy nearby a certain number of squares on the battlemap as the warlord sees fit .
I could n’t help laughing out loud when I read it , trying to imagine how I ’d describe it to a group of players .
“ Okay , you use ‘ Own the Battlefield , ’ huh ?
Uhh… ok… well … alright , I know it ’s supposed to be based on your mastery of the field of combat and tactics , but there ’s absolutely * no way * those spellcasters are foolish enough to just impale themselves on your melee line like that .
I guess holes open up in the ceiling and strings come down , attaching themselves to your foes on the battlefield .
They fight at the strings to no avail and are dragged where your Warlord capriciously points .
Once your adversaries are repositioned , the strings retract back into the stone ceiling and are gone . ”
Sorry , but I just ca n’t make this ability make sense .
I understand the idea is to give Warlords the ability to shape a battlespace using their leadership skills and tactical knowledge , but the way it was mapped into a rule just breaks my suspension of disbelief .
Some powers could have unbalancing effects if used by creative players .
The DMG explicitly notes that powers triggered by successfully striking or killing a target cannot be triggered unless the target is a reasonable challenge .
Carrying around a sack of rats to brain when a power is needed does not suffice .
Many powers have their own “ sack of rats ” exploits .
A paladin might simplify crossing a gorge or river by pulling the weakest climber or swimmer across using Angelic Rescue or Sublime Transposition , abilities that teleport an ally closer to the paladin .
I do n’t object to the need for common sense in resolving game mechanics .
I do object to mechanics that do n’t seem well considered outside a narrow , expected application , especially if the resolution is to add arbitrary rules like , “ No clubbing rats to get healing surges , ” that have no corresponding in game rationale .
Rituals
To be fair , 4th edition preserves some of the interesting non-combat abilities I ’ve been mourning .
The Rituals chapter includes them .
Rituals are spells with lengthy casting times and expensive components , ensuring they are used outside of combat and require an investment of resources .
There are rituals for divination , conjuration , warding , and more .
However , the rituals section is about twenty pages , stuffed into the back of the book .
The chapter feels like a resting place for afterthoughts that could n’t fit into other parts of the game system .
Paragon Paths and Epic Destinies
In D&D 4th edition , characters advance from level 1 to level 30 .
During the first ten levels , they are heroes .
At tenth level , they choose a paragon path , a specialization within their class that grants them additional abilities based on a narrower focus .
Paragon paths replace the prestige classes of D&D 3.5 and are built into the class progression , so every character takes one .
At level 20 , characters are eligible to take an epic destiny .
Prestige classes in 3.5 served two purposes .
One , they gave players a way of distinguishing their characters by giving them a specific focus area .
Secondarily – and alas all too rarely used – they gave DMs a way of creating custom classes anchored to their worlds .
For example , the Order of the Broken Key is a specific knightly order in my world .
The prestige class allows me to give them abilities that make sense as an outgrowth of their mission and calling in life .
Paragon paths satisfy the need for characters to add a narrower specialization to their character ’s abilities , but they are not advocated as a way to interweave the mechanics of the class and the institutions of the DM ’s game world .
Epic destinies start players thinking about the mark they want to leave on the world .
As their characters become powerful enough that they will likely retire from active play , players deliberately plan a story arc with the DM that will create a lasting legacy in the world .
Examples in the PHB include apotheosis and the founding of a magic academy .
Characters develop abilities between levels 20 and 30 arising out of their epic destiny .
We did n’t get a chance to playtest this , but it sounds like a useful tool for players and DMs to build a lasting and memorable story .
Unfortunately , like other powers , almost all the destiny features boil down to simple bonuses to stats and rolls , chances to reroll bad results , and the like .
Mad Lootz !
Unlike previous editions of D&D , the magic item list has moved from the DMG to the PHB .
The authors suggest that one should openly tell the players what their magic items are , or at least what bonus to attack roll and damage the weapon grants , if not the special effects it has .
I understand their reasoning : it gets tiresome for the DM to remember to add various bonuses for items not yet identified by the players .
Unfortunately , in the context of the rest of the rules , it feels a bit too much like having a pop up window showing the precise specifications of an item found in an MMO .
Combat and Other Challenges
There are some small tweaks to combat .
For example , 4th edition introduces minor actions , a new type of action .
Characters get one standard , one move , and one minor action .
As described above , combat is , if anything , improved by some of the simplified rules , such as replacing saving throws with attack rolls and the non-resisted rolls for grappling .
The system for out of combat challenges is not as well done .
These tasks are resolved in a Skill Challenge .
In preparing the challenge , the DM decides how many successful skill checks are necessary to beat the challenge .
The DM also decides how many failed skill checks constitute failure of the challenge as a whole .
During the game , the players try to accumulate enough successful skill checks without failing enough checks to fail the challenge as a whole .
Checks are made using a variety of skills .
Many of the examples feature conversations with NPCs .
In most of the games I ’ve played , it ’s not so easy to predict the path of a conversation .
Players are unpredictable in what they ’ll do or say , so it ’s difficult to pre-determine what skills might be applicable or used by the players .
Moreover , I do n’t see the need for this mechanic .
I never needed an arbitrary challenge structure in 3.5 ; interrogations , negotiations , and researches were always driven by roleplaying .
The mechanics of skill checks were useful tools to support the narrative , but the story unfolded in reaction to the players .
There was no arbitrarily set number of successful or failed skill checks .
One way to run a skill challenge would be to keep the framework of mechanics hidden under the hood where it belongs .
Unfortunately , this is contrary to the rules suggested in the DMG .
The DMG recommends a transparent explanation of the nature of the challenge .
In fact , the DM is supposed to tell the players what they should consider using during the challenge : “ You ca n’t start a skill challenge until the PCs know their role in it , and that means giving them a couple of skills to start with , ” with an example of play where the DM tells the players , “ Your magical disguises , the Bluff skill , and knowledge of the academic aspects of magic — Arcana , in other words — will be key in this challenge . ”
When my players come up with a plan to sneak into the wizard ’s college , why ca n’t I just ask them how they plan to do it ?
Why should I have to tell them what they ’re going to do and the skills they ’re going to use to do it ?
What if their plan is to light a classroom building on fire after hours to distract students and pull them from the dormitory , then sneak in ?
Or to forge documentation from the local lord of the lands granting them unfettered access to the site ?
Will those require knowledge of the academic aspects of magic , too ?
In fact , this very section of rules stresses the need to reward clever ideas by players even if they deviate from the script for the challenge .
Given that they likely often will , why bother with the challenge mechanic ?
Nuts and Bolts : Quality of Instruction , Artwork , and Writing
The DM ’s guide contains a great deal of instruction for new DMs .
The authors devoted a lot of space to describing what players are looking for in an adventure and how to construct one .
Veteran players will not find this material new or interesting .
However , the space is well spent for new roleplayers getting started with D&D .
The MM includes all the usual suspects : kobolds , evil dragons ( metallic dragons are deferred to another book ) , medusas , manticores , giants , and so on .
The entries are clear , easy to read , and easy to use during combat .
During the playtest , I did n’t find myself stumbling over what abilities a monster had available .
It was easy to pick up an entry and run it in a fight .
Some of the artwork in the MM is truly outstanding .
Throughout the D&D 4th edition core books , however , the quality of writing is below what I would ’ve expected .
Some descriptions of powers or other abilities are n’t clear .
Some mechanical descriptions of the powers do not match the flavor text given in italics at the beginning of the entry .
And in some places , it ’s just silly .
The Fantastic Flourish exploit is described as , “ With perfect timing , you flick one enemy ’s blood into the eyes of another . ”
Anyone who ’s trying to play fancy tricks with blood spatter patterns is n’t going to live long enough to level up to having that power .
Besides , does that mean the power does n’t work on creatures without eyes ?
There was no such note of a limitation .
In some cases , the writing is just lazy and indicative of bad editing .
On page 87 of the player ’s handbook , the flavor text quote ascribed to the Kensei is , “ My weapon and I are as one . ”
On page 88 , the first line of the description of the Swordmaster is , “ You and your blade are as one . ”
The writing was somewhat disappointing in other areas as well .
Much of the prose was florid .
At the beginning of each class description , I wished the author would stop trying to sell me on the idea of playing that class – or even playing the game in general – and get on with presenting the information .
Stop telling me how much bold , daring , and wondrous adventure I ’m going to have and get on with it so I can go have my adventure already .
The PHB is the worst of the three books in this respect ; the quality did pick up in both the DMG and MM .
Summary
Overall , I ’m disappointed in this edition of D&D .
I tried to like it , but I can ’t .
I tried to hate it , too , but I ca n’t do that either .
I ’m sure this has come across in the review .
I praise the system for being simplified and streamlined compared to 3.5 , but then I condemn it for stripping out all the abilities that require intelligent refereeing and lead to interesting variety in play .
I complain about the lack of flexibility , but then also complain about the arbitrary rules necessary to stop abuse of the powers as written .
I say it ’s a good thing to have a game system that ’s accessible to video gamers and learns from that genre , but to me the biggest systemic flaw in the system is that it uses too many conventions of video gaming and loses the essence of tabletop roleplaying .
I suppose one explanation is that I ’m a picky curmudgeon who wants mutually exclusive things in a game system and could n’t possibly be made happy .
In truth , I ’m struggling with a game system that has a lot of good ideas in it , but many of which were imperfectly ( or in some cases poorly ) executed .
For now , my campaign is going to stay based in 3.5 .
I think I could make a good game out of 4th edition , but it would take more effort in house rules than I ’m willing to put in just yet .
Maybe I ’ll take a second look if / when a revision 4.5 is released .

One of the undisputed gems of the Nintendo 64 was the action platformer Banjo - Kazooie .
The title followed a pair of buddies as they battled the evil witch Gruntilda and her minions , all the while collecting musical notes and jigsaw pieces ( referred to in - game as “ jiggies ” ) in order to unlock new areas .
Now , after a long absence and a botched sequel ( the utterly skippable Banjo - Twooie ) , the pair is back for another adventure , and this time they ’re packing some horsepower .
The driving element behind Nuts and Bolts is building and using vehicles in order to accomplish objectives .
In the demo we got to try out on the E3 show floor , you found yourself in Banjo Land , an homage to past titles in the series .
Scattered around the world were pre-made vehicles which you could use to climb up tall hills , reach remote areas , and generally explore areas no bear can traverse alone .
Our personal favorite was the buggy with a spring and gyroscope , which would allow you to launch the vehicle high into the air and then do tricks like flips and spins before you came down .
The Microsoft rep on - hand explained that this particular car would be good for stunt challenges , where you have to perform tricks in order to score enough points to advance .
We also got a very small taste of the vehicle editor , where you can take in any existing contraption or create your own from the ground up in order to make a custom transportation machine .
For our purposes , we took an existing design and slapped some wings and jet engines on it and made ourselves a buggy ready for both land and air .
The construction room was jam - packed with items to use for building ( there will be well over 100 parts in the final version ) , but we were assured that you had to unlock pieces as you go , so someone ca n’t simply head in at the beginning of the game and create a machine that can best any challenge .
Also , the gradual introduction of pieces will allow players to slowly learn the intricacies of how to construct vehicles , rather than throwing them to the wolves straight away .
Of course , there ’s no reason to have all these methods of travel if you ca n’t use them , and that ’s where the challenges come in .
Whenever you ’re in a challenge level like Banjo Land , various points on your mini-map will be highlighted with jiggie icons .
Heading to one of these locales will start a challenge that you must pass successfully if you want to win the coveted piece .
The objective we tackled concerned George the Ice Cube , who had slid away from his wife and ended up in a hot desert .
Because George is so big and ca n’t be moved by hand , Banjo was given the option to choose one of three already created vehicles to scoop up the rogue frozen block and get him back home .
We first tried tackling the challenge with the “ beginner ” vehicle , a cart with a large , shallow bowl on top where we could sit George down and push him back up the mountain .
However , physics got the better of us , and every time we tried to stop or change direction George would invariably slide out and fall back down the mountain .
Strangely enough , the Microsoft rep mentioned that almost no one had been able to complete the objective with that vehicle , and we ’d actually have an easier time with the “ advanced ” contraption .
In this case , we powered up a helicopter which used a sticky ball to grab onto George and haul him up the mountain .
After a few tense moments of trying to perfect our command of altitude control as George swung wildly about , we got him back to his beloved wife , free to continue his chilly life .
Nuts and Bolts is shaping up to be the sort of game that will appeal to anyone who likes problem - solving and figuring out their own way to do things .
The game is sure to shape up a bit like Spore ’s Creature Creator in that it ’ll likely take you a few failed attempts before you really make something good , but once you do , you ’ll take greater pride in knowing that it was solely the result of your skills and abilities that you managed to figure it out .
Now , instead of taking the vehicles developers have designed for you to achieve a goal , it ’s all up to you to make it happen .
If you ’ve ever wished for a game that gives you unparalleled freedom while retaining some sense of overarching structure , this is it .

A group calling itself the Jewish Internet Defense Force ( JIDF ) hacked into a Facebook group called , " Israel " is not a country !... ...
Delist it from Facebook as a country ! " early Sunday morning , erasing thousands of members ' names from the site .
The JIDF was founded by an American Jew in response to a terrorist attack that took the lives of eight young yeshiva students in Jerusalem earlier this year .
" This is a major victory against Jew haters , " proclaimed a JIDF source who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The source said the group " goes after Jew - hating internet sites . "
More than 4,000 names were deleted from the anti-Semitic " Israel is not a country ! " group 's database by the hackers .
A JIDF statement posted on the hacked site announced , " This was one of the most vile , most antisemitic , most pro-Jihad and most disgusting , and most importantly , most ACTIVE hate groups on the internet .
It actively promoted hatred , violence , murder , and genocide .
Despite tens of thousands of complaints , Facebook would n't remove it , as they claimed that this incitement to murder was " legitimate political discourse " - Facebook 's negligence and abdication of responsibility gave us no option but to take matters in our own hands ..... "

Editor 's Note :
This article has been updated to reflect more up–to–date information .
The original article can be found here : Heresy in the Hood : Teen Witchcraft in America .
It ’s a different America today from the relative innocence of 1999 , when I first wrote about witchcraft among American youth .
That was the year Harry Potter burst upon the American scene .
The year before , Teen Witch : Wicca for a New Generation by Silver Ravenwolf was published , offering how –to instructions specifically to curious adolescents about the beliefs and practice of sorcery .
The book has sold over 150,000 copies , according to its author .
{1}
Harry Potter was just an imaginative story , advocates claimed , and few kids were seriously drawn to witchcraft .
Any alarms were pure hysteria .
Well , here we are three years later , and a review of current TV shows , children ’s games , the latest titles from mighty Scholastic Books , a visit to any local Borders or Barnes and Noble bookstore , or a review of popular youth Web sites , should more than confirm our initial warnings .
Sorcery and witchcraft have become the hottest themes in youth culture and education for the first time in modern Western civilization .
It ’s past time for alarms ; if we care about the spiritual integrity of our children , the hour may have come for panic .
When the Cat’s Away
Is witchcraft still the fastest–growing religion in America today , as I quoted a proponent who appeared on the teen–popular " E " cable channel back in 1999 ?
If pop culture and my own e–mail traffic is any reflection of the trends , then the answer would have to be a resounding ‘ yes . ’
Since " Heresy in the Hood : Teen Witchcraft in America " was published in 1999 , the number of young self –professed witches and pagans who send e–mails has grown steadily .
By far most of them strongly disagree with my views and the article , which took a conservative Christian view of witchcraft and outlined the growing pop media fascination with this subject .
Just a few excerpts from these e–mails is revealing .
( I ’ve left the original wording and spelling intact . ) :
" Would n’t this be a better world if you and people like you could stop being so bigotted and open your hearts to those that are different than you .
I am a pagan I do n’t believe in heaven or hell , god or the devil . "
" First of all , we DONNOT WORSHIP SATAN !
And we DONNOT feed on christian children … .
You tell people how to catch and kill wiccans but you probably have never met a true wiccan . "
[ Note :
There is nothing in the article about feeding on children or catching and killing Wiccans , or anyone . ]
" I am reminded of a saying from Deuteromotry … Judge not lest ye be judged .
And also , a verse from the New Testament ( sorry I forgot the chapter and verse number ) … where Jesus of Nazareth speaks , saying , ‘ Know that in my Father ’s house there are many mansions , and many paths to the One Truth . ’
Something to bear in mind , eh ? "
And my personal favorite e–mail : " Have a bad day . "
Most of the e–mails are insulting in tone and question the very existence of an article like " Teen Witchcraft . "
Borrowing from the " gay rights " playbook , these young people are somewhere learning that serious debate about the issue of witchcraft is a form of hate .
A similar veil of indoctrination has also blinded most adults who would be gatekeepers to screen sorcery out of the gardens where our young play .
Without protectors , the profit–driven media is both responding to interest in witchcraft and creating it in a rapid feedback loop .
Sorcery Chic
With Hollywood churning out occult–themed programs and movies at a frenetic pace , the interest of youth has been kept high .
A burst of movies and TV shows featuring witchcraft has targeted young viewers , among them Buffy , the Vampire Slayer , which has developed an almost cult–like following ; WB ’s Charmed ; and the sappy Sabrina the Teenage Witch .
Young fans are feeding their occult appetites further by snapping up these shows ’ companion paperbacks .
Followers of Sabrina can purchase one of the 45 paperbacks now available , and Charmed buffs can choose from fourteen .
Buffy fans can purchase not just novels featuring the show characters , but DVD ’s of three seasons of programs , scripts , and other novelties like calendars and school planners .
Never mind that Buffy plots have included her attempted rape by her love interest , Spike , or her death and then " resurrection " as she climbed back out of the grave .
{ 2} Many parents nonetheless let their offspring immerse themselves in such irreverent nonsense .
Buffy has a campy , tongue–in–cheek style that invites dismissal of objections , sneaking past all but the most discerning parental concerns .
Cartoon characters and games are replete with sorcery , from the much–publicized Pokemon to Yu–Gi– Oh !
and other anime , a world where conjuring , demon battles and spell–casting are the order of every player ’s move and collector ’s wish .
Even Scooby –Doo has taken its once light –hearted approach to the scary and spooky to a serious level in its feature –length movie released in 2002 .
The bad guy in the plot plans a voodoo ritual , but the movie also manages to cast Wiccans in a positive light as " healers . "
One Web site mourns the lost innocence of Scooby –Doo : " It ’s cheap and desperate .
There ’s no place for demonic possession and Busta Rhymes in a Hanna–Barbera production . "

Soap operas popular with teens have incorporated more and more occult story lines .
On NBC ’s Passions , recent plot elements included spells , potions , zombies , animated human–like dolls , and bringing the dead back to life , all pivoting around a witch character played by actress Juliet Mills .
Youth interest has been stoked steadily by one–sided movies over the past decade .
The Craft in 1996 featured teen sorcerers .
That same year , The Crucible created an almost laughable Hollywood version of 1692 Salem , where Winona Ryder smears blood on herself in the opening scene depicting a voodoo ritual inspired by the Jamaican servant , Tituba .
Would Puritan girls , even those who actually dabbled in the occult , ever have done such a thing ?
Practical Magic featured Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman fulfilling every girl ’s fondest wish — obtaining Mr. Right — by using spells and enchantment .
An array of recent movies dealing with occult themes along with the two Harry Potter movies are persuading most youngsters ( and many parents ) to see sorcery as simply the product of a creative mind or a tool for personal empowerment .
Ripe for Spiritual Deception
Why the explosion of interest , and why now ?
Ever since playwright Arthur Miller wrote
The Crucible in the 1950 ’s to parallel the McCarthy hearings , a " witch hunt " has become one of the left ’s favorite epithets to intimidate the devout , who are , of course , merely unenlightened dullards .
The truth is that witchcraft is real , and so is the unchanging Christian prohibition against it .
Any power other than God is forbidden , starting with the First Commandment , and attempting to do " magick " exposes one to contact with demonic power , whether or not one names it as such .
There is no difference between white or black witchcraft ; neither involve the biblically revealed Creator or Christ as Savior , so both are elements of rebellion used for selfish , not Christ–centered purposes .
Humans do have access to divine power , but it is through prayer to God and Him alone , not other named or imagined spirits .
And , God ’s will determines the final outcome ; rituals or other works of humans do not .
Ironically , God is in charge even if the fictional Harry Potter or his friend Hermoine cast " spells . "
Yet Potter fans will never hear about God ’s real , omnipotent power by reading the Christ–less Rowling books or seeing the Potter movies .
One of the biggest and most artificial aspects of these stories is this pretense .
In this sense , they truly are fantasies .
It may be part of the tactics of Satan to intentionally reveal the blueprint for the enchantment of our youth for all who have eyes to see .
Satan and his army of demonic spirits are genuine and referenced frequently in the Bible .
His main goal is to separate humans forever from fellowship and eternal life with God through Christ .
So he uses whatever works : deception , distraction , or destruction .
One aspect of the deceit is hiding in plain sight .
" Ha , ha !
Satan ?
Just a figment of overworked fundamentalists ’ imaginations !
They ’re just frustrated because they ’re too repressed and fearful to get into something really creative — like witchcraft ! "
So goes the ironic snare of spiritual deception .
For those watching , the growing obsession of our culture with something so " non–existent " can become a potent testimony to the truth of the gospel , where Christ dealt with spiritual darkness as a daily reality , casting out demons more than thirty times in Scripture .
Unfortunately , without enough courageous Christians vigilantly protecting children from witchcraft , the framework for bondage is in place .
Now , sadly , it seems we are heading into the final construction phase of their spiritual prison .
In Plain Sight
No one has to hunt for witches anymore ; they may own the house next door .
Children are being lovingly primed to embrace paganism by movies , games , TV , the Internet and countless sorcery –friendly books .
There is certainly no parallel in current pop culture to the Harry Potter books .
Not only the books themselves but a plethora of offshoots abound , from The Sorcerer ’s Companion : A Guide to the Magical World of Harry Potter by Allan Zola Kronzek and Elizabeth Kronzek , to The Everything Kids ’ Witches and Wizards Book by L.T. Samuels .
The obsession with the Potter books seems odd , however .
Again , why now ?
It ’s not as if they are something totally original .
Jane Yolen ’s Wizard ’s Hall , published in 1993 , features a boy named Henry , age 11 , who goes to a school for wizardry , and has a smart girl and a redheaded boy as his best friends .
It ’s the kind of place where they give you a new name , where the pictures wink at you and there are star maps in the dark on the ceilings of your bedroom .
This whimsy will sound familiar to Potter readers , for in addition to the plot similarities , such elements recall the style of J.K. Rowling , the author of the Potter books .
It is difficult to fathom why Rowling ’s yarns became such hits when the Yolen books , while successful , have managed to stay out of the superstar realm .
Did superior publisher promotion account for the difference ?
Is the length of the Potter books appealing to a wider audience including adults ?
Or , could the reason lie with a culture that has developed a taste for " magick " and is now ready to pluck the whole fruit , no matter the cost ?
The top–selling Potter books , in spite of denials by its author and other advocates , do inspire follow–up interest in sorcery and the occult among children .
Consider this passage said to be written by a 13 – year–old on the popular Internet site , The Witches ’ Voice ( www.witchvox.com):
" You ’re 12 years old , and have stumbled upon the book ‘ Teen Witch ’ by Silver Ravenwolf at this very odd and interesting section of Borders called ‘ Magickal Studies . ’
Next to Teen Witch is the book , ‘ Wicca , a Guide for the Solitary Practitioner ’ by Scott Cunningham .
You have never heard this term before — ‘ Wicca ’ — but naturally you ’re a huge fan of ‘ Charmed ’ and ‘ Harry Potter ’ , so you immediately open to the middle of this interesting book , Teen Witch .
What ’s the first thing you see ?
Spells !
Tons of them !
‘ Oh cool !
Now I can be a real witch ’ you say , as you take this fascinating book to the checkout line …. "
{4}
Yet , most parents do n’t see any danger in this , because many are buying the secular spin on the occult , that it ’s an aspect of one ’s imagination and therefore a dimension of human nature .
So , when ten–year–old Madison starts casting spells from her room , we should see it as just a harmless alternative to playing with her Barbies .
The Potter series also uses real names of sorcerers and mythological monsters , according to some experts .
Medieval alchemist Nicholas Flamel is a figure in the first book , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ’s Stone .
He actually did exist , born in 1330 .
Fluffy the three –headed dog is like Cerberus , a Greek monster who guarded the entry to Hades , and like Cerberus , Fluffy is calmed by soft music .
{ 5} Who says children immersed in the Potter books are n’t being tutored in neopaganism ?
Harry is the perfect hero for a self –obsessed culture : a miserable home life and low self–esteem can be overcome with the wave of a wand and the " discovery " that one has secret powers .
Why not make every kid feel " special , " no matter the method ?
The Kiddy Lit Occult Gold Mine
The profit incentive for children ’s publishers ca n’t be discounted as a major driver behind the sorcery explosion .
Parents in times past would never have dreamed of drenching their innocents in spell–casting and fortune–telling .
The Christian roots in our culture were too deep for people to let kids wander into such hazardous territory .
But current biblically illiterate generations of parents often see nothing wrong with ritual and magick , and some are in fact dabbling in such activities themselves .
Following the Potter books , publishers of young teen fiction have introduced a wide array of witch–themed paperbacks , so that young Potter fans can grow into more " age–appropriate " sorcery .
We chose three to read from among the many now available ( far more than in 1999 ) .
There is the " Witches Chillers " series by Silver Ravenwolf ( Llewellyn Publications , 2000 ) ; the " Circle of Three " books by Isobel Bird ( Avon Books , 2001 ) ; and the " Daughters of the Moon " series by Lynne Ewing ( Hyperion Books for Children , 2000 ) .
Whatever happened to Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys ?
Even the silly Babysitters Club books would be a welcome change .
In these standby novels , girls fret over friends , popularity , sports , parents , boyfriends , jobs and homework — or a neighborhood " mystery . "
But in this new darker world , girls do n’t simply ask a friend ’s advice , hang out at the soda shop or give the team their best effort .
That would be too boring and too passive .
Today ’s girl takes charge , even in the heavenlies — these young priestesses cast spells .
The paperbacks are laced with actual spells and rituals suited to many teen occasions .
They are also packed with sexual innuendo and activity ; alternative dress and lifestyles ; and questionable role models in parents .
They also continue the dissemination of pro–witch and anti–Christian propaganda .
Ravenwolf says she concocted the idea for the " Witches Chillers " from imagining the teens on the cover of Teen Witch to be real adolescents .
She named them and came up with the idea for the series .
Her involvement goes further than books .
Besides creating the eighteen titles and the Teen Witch Kit , complete with spells , talismans and other ritual equipment , Ravenwolf says she has thirty covens in eleven states .
{ 6} More offerings by major bookstores for boys and girls include a series from Pocket Pulse based on the TV show " Angel " about a guy who fights vampires , demons and such through his Angel Detective Agency .
Author R.L. Stine has contributed the controversial Goosebumps series for grade school kids , and more recently , the Fear Street series for adolescents , lacing the teen world of cheerleading and sports with supernatural evil .
There is often little else on the shelves to choose from .
There ’s Witch Child and Sorceress by Celia Rees ( Candlewick Press , Cambridge , Massachusetts ) .
The Book of Shadows , the first in the " Sweep " series of fourteen books by Cate Tiernan ( Puffin Books ) , offers this preview on its back cover : " I never chose to learn witchcraft .
But I ’m starting to wonder if witchcraft is choosing me . "
This notion of being " chosen " is a troubling recurring theme in story lines , including Harry Potter .
It ’s a seductive method of manipulating human envy by ensnaring naïve youth : if you ’re a misfit , it ’s not because you are lacking something ; it ’s because you are " above " the rest in a unique way .
One of the biggest names in children ’s literature is giant Scholastic Books .
Teachers distribute sales flyers for Scholastic publications in classes to schoolchildren , a system set up through the company ’s ongoing close relationships with the American educational establishment .
Now Scholastic , being the U.S. distributor of the Potter books , plays a particularly formidable role in the promotion of sorcery to children .
It has expanded its offerings beyond the Rowling books and the Goosebumps series to T* Witches , about the twin daughters of two very powerful witches , and Midnight Magic , which uses Tarot cards , a fortune–telling device popular with Wiccans .
As adolescents peak in self–absorption , our panacea is to hand our offspring the sorcerer ’s wand to wave away all troubles .
They can use it to raise that already inflated self–esteem .
Not only can they pick up how –to books like Teen Witch , or Wild Girls : The Path of the Young Goddess by Patricia Monaghan ( Llewellyn , 2001 ) , now they can obtain instruction from a number of Web sites friendly to teens on this subject .
Bypassing the Parent Filter : The Internet ’s Role
Not only has the Internet provided a way for " pagans " to network and share ideas , beliefs and spells , it ’s a neat and clean way for curious youth to avoid the scrutiny of parents while exploring once–forbidden subjects .
Any Web–savvy child can be indoctrinated into a pagan worldview and start casting spells before a parent catches on to this new interest .
A 15 – year–old on the Web site , Witches ’ Voice , writes :
" A friend told me about a religion that worships both a male and a female deity .
I was interested and she gave me Silver Ravenwolf ’s book , Teen Witch .
I started reading and never put it down .
I got on the internet and learned more and more .
I finally did a devotion ceremony and I considered myself to be Wiccan .
Then I remembered , ‘ What am I going to do about my parents ?!’
I then decided to keep it a secret until I could tell them in a proper time and place .
Bad idea … . " {7}
She then goes on to describe how she refused to go to church with her Catholic parents one Sunday morning , blurting out the news about her altered " faith . "
After the uproar subsided , her parents eventually became resigned to her beliefs because ( she says ) they observed a lowered stress level in her behavior .
Such is the advice given to curious youth by more experienced teens , with anecdotes to give any novice " courage " to delve into the Craft .
" After all , she seems to have it together .
Maybe it ’s fine for me , too . "
The Internet resources on witchcraft are vast and growing daily .
Some are tailored specifically to teens and younger aged–children .
Teen Witch ( www.teenwitch.com) has expanded greatly since I first learned about it several years ago .
There are now spells for every occasion .
Witches ’ Voice ( www.witchvox.com) has a special teen section .
Silver Ravenwolf has her own Web site with material tailored to teens .
There are other tutorial sites ( www.witchschool.com); there are pagan book sites ( www.isisbooks.com); there are sites for supplies ( www.realmagicwands.com).
Too numerous to mention are sites specific to role–playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and toys , CDs , DVDs and video games with occult themes .
Potter–spawned discussions and books have generated a whole Internet culture , as well .
Is there any avenue of modern information where children are not subject to spiritual seduction ?
One Web site has taken a strong stand against this promotion of witchcraft to teens .
Kathi Sharpe has a site called Ex–Witch at www.exwitch.org .
She recommends boycotting Scholastic Books because of its promotion of witchcraft and sorcery to kids .
" Nearly every school district in the U.S. has a Scholastic Book Fair several times yearly , " she writes .
" Today we are urging parents and educators to prayerfully consider a general boycott of Scholastic materials in homes and schools country–wide . "
Kathi , a former witch who is now a Christian , has strong opinions about the Potter books .
" Anyone who allows their children to read these books and participate in related activities is allowing their children access to the occult . "
She stresses that the activities Harry and his friends so casually engage in are all forbidden in the Bible " … and with good reason : they are dangerous , and serve to draw people away from Him .
Furthermore , the power behind spells and divination is demonic . "
Witchcraft hides among the rushes on other teen sites .
On the questionable sexuality dimension , Planned Parenthood ’s Teen Wire at www.teenwire.com goes beyond its teen sex territory to explore aspects of " spirituality . "
One article on the site is entitled , " Life as a Witch . "
A teenager named Torprme writes , " I am a sophomore in high school and I am a witch . "
Another article describes witchcraft in general terms after deceptively luring teens to the page with the title , " Buffy ’s Tale . "
The author , Patricia Telesco , has written several other articles on the PP site , one about horoscopes and another called " Winter Festivals . "
It describes winter solstices , native American winter ceremonies and Yule traditions of Christmas .
This article was all that surfaced after a search of this site using the keyword " Christian , " dispelling any thoughts of genuine inclusivity .
Teen Wire , of course , promotes the general Planned Parenthood philosophy that abortion is an ethical , safe and viable option .
Sex–heterosexual or homosexual — is perfectly appropriate whenever one is " ready , " no matter the age .
Any risks involved are only a matter of proper management through contraception and " choice . "
The heartbreak of early pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , now at epidemic levels in our country , are as usual ignored in this adult–generated site aimed at exploiting the young for commercial purposes .
The " Empowered " Young Feminist
As an adjunct to the spiritual deception taking place among adult women as a part of radical feminism in America , witchcraft is increasingly being adopted as a practice in ostensibly Christian churches .
This trend is filtering down to teen girls .
Ravenwolf in Teen Witch attempts to paint " Wicca " as an alternative practice that is powerful yet positive , and compatible with most religious beliefs .
She writes , " WitchCraft is a nature–based , life –affirming religion that follows a moral code and seeks to build harmony among people , and empower the self and others .
If you think about it , we could use that statement for almost any positive religion , could n’t we ? " ( p. 4 ) .
Like my e–mail correspondents , Ravenwolf seems to single out biblical Christianity .
" Our only animosity toward Christianity , or toward any other religion … is ... that these institutions have claimed to be ‘ the one true right and only way . ’
… Witches are sick and tired of people in other religions passing judgment and spreading lies about our belief system just because they are either insecure in their own faith or do n’t realize that many paths to God exist in our universe " ( pp.7–8 ) .
After numerous classroom and cultural messages about ‘ tolerance , ’ frequently with orthodox Christians set up as the bad guys , many teens will naturally embrace Ravenwolf ’s ideology as a positive , progressive alternative .
Thus , Teen Witch reinforces the ample doses of nature worship girls are already receiving throughout the culture , including at school , while justifying ignorance about and hostility toward Christianity .
And it is all set within a framework that appears to be an extension of tolerance and compassion , and in fact , even a part of " civil rights . "
Taking a chapter from the feminist and homosexual playbook , " pagan pride " is set to burst upon the American scene with its accusations and demands .
Groups are springing up like the Witches Anti–Defamation League , Witches Against Religious Discrimination and the Alternative Religions Education Network , taking refuge under the constitutional protections on religious freedom .
With the " witch hunt " chapter already written , sorcerers playing victim to ‘ evil ’ Christians is a believable role in the eyes of many Americans .
So the activist organizations and legal defense are falling into place .
The ACLU defended a girl in a Detroit high school several years back who was asked to stop wearing a necklace with a pentacle ( a witchcraft symbol ) .
A settlement was made in the teen ’s favor which required the school to change its policies on witchcraft symbols and attire .
The ACLU defended a local teen in a case Oklahoma as well , and other witch defense groups threatened to sue a middle school in Colorado Springs in 1999 after a vice principal questioned a group of twelve –year–olds who were rumored to be casting spells .
The school backed off after the " rights " groups organized a publicity and letter–writing campaign .{8}
And if your teen is n’t an activist or practitioner in middle school or high school , college is a fertile field for the growth of witch sympathies .
Your daughter or son who takes a religion or women ’s studies class at a non–Christian college can expect to be exposed to the benefits of alternative religions , mostly occultic , in overcoming the " oppression " of the entrenched Christian mainstream .
This is maintained all the while any hope of an authentic study of Christianity should probably be abandoned .
My daughter , a senior at a small liberal arts college in Ohio , tells numerous tales of occult bias in her classes .
Her class on " Women in American Religion " required reading the Cynthia Eller book , Living in the Lap of the Goddess , which dwells extensively and positively on witchcraft as a liberating faith for women .
In the class , pairs of students were assigned to develop their own " rituals " and lead the class in carrying them out .
In other words , they were assigned the task of casting spells for college credit .
Why Witchcraft is Wrong
When one does not know the genuine , the counterfeit is easy to accept .
So a limited knowledge of Christianity plays right into the hands of promoters of witchcraft in America .
There is no power and authority outside oneself , witchcraft maintains .
The " goddess " and her male consort honored in many witchcraft beliefs may be conceptualized by a Wiccan practitioner as nature–based deities , but most operate as if the power they are invoking is just an extension of the " higher " self .
This lie from Satan is as old as Genesis .
" You shall be as gods , " the serpent told Eve .
If you are " as gods , " you can make your own rules .
Forget parents !
Forget teachers !
We ’ll just live for the moment , the latest sensation and party on down .
So witchcraft is a perfect fit for a paganized , pleasure–centered , shallow America .
Christ was just a nice teacher , so the thinking goes .
A dumbed–down , uninformed view of a saviour–less " Christ " becomes a tool to clobber traditional Christians .
Did n’t Jesus say " Judge not ? "
But it was n’t to discourage people from realization of sin and the need for Him as Savior .
It was to keep us honest about our own failings while we are keeping each other accountable as Christians .
Christ was always and still is , not just a nice guy , but our Savior from sin .
That ’s what He said , over and over .
And sin is always defined by God , not man , who would change the definitions endlessly to fit the occasion .
Yes , there are many aspects of Christianity that fit the " nice guy " image of Christ — compassion for the unfortunate , food for the hungry , healing for the sick — but witches tend to forget about those other Christian principles that are part of the whole fabric .
These include belief in one God , repentance of sin , Christ as Savior .
That ’s what the New Testament is all about .
That is the hope of the gospel .
Another important revealed truth is the reality of Satan .
Christ cast out demons because
He has authority over Satan , who is only allowed access to humans as we allow it either deliberately or through casual spiritual dabbling .
If a good supernatural divine power exists as revealed through Scripture , why not also supernatural evil ?
There is no logical reason to reject Satan as a possibility except wishful thinking .
What do we imagine those voodoo spirits in Haiti are , in reality ?
Once one has really understood that the God of the Bible exists , the revelation of Scripture makes so much sense .
He is truly all–powerful , perfectly just , as well as merciful through Christ .
Then , how can so–called Christians be thoughtlessly disloyal to Him , violating the first and second commandments , by casually exploring witchcraft or letting their children anywhere near it ?
Many who are seduced into the pseudo–spirituality of witchcraft and neopaganism buy into the lie that the Bible ’s claims are questionable .
And from that belief , any spiritual cohesiveness disintegrates .
Ironically , one of the major claims of Wiccans is that the " goddess " and earth–centered religions existed before Christianity .
Yet , Christians maintain that God created everything and Christ has been eternally part of the Godhead , present from the beginning .
But if we are debating claims of antiquity , nothing is more ancient than the prohibitions against witchcraft and sorcery , and this is just one more way the Bible ( if one takes the trouble to read it ) reveals timeless knowledge .
There is nothing " progressive " about these practices , and nothing in them to surprise God .
He ’s known about them since the Creation .
There are numerous descriptions of pagan practices in Old and New Testament writings .
Spell–casting , witchcraft , astrology , goddess –worship , fortune–telling , worshipping the moon , sun or stars — all are there in the ancient Near East .
And all reflected in Old Testament times , just as they do today , an attempt to override the one true God and " discover " different truths , those that just happen to support our own self –interest , when God has our highest self –interest in mind all along .
When we deliberately or neglectfully allow witchcraft to have access to our precious children , we show God how little we truly value the little ones
He has placed in our care .
Those who truly respect and honor God ’s Creation and the stewardship entrusted to us , will not willingly hand their children over to seducing spirits .
When God gave us the First Commandment , it should come as no surprise to anyone that He meant it .

WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's proposal Saturday to make expanded offshore drilling part of a new Democratic energy bill got a skeptical reaction from Republicans , who said they suspect it will contain other provisions unacceptable to the minority .
The result may be that Congress remains deadlocked on the potent election issue .
Ms. Pelosi's proposal is the clearest sign yet that Democratic Congressional leaders are tacking away from earlier strong opposition to expanded offshore oil production , in the face of opinion ...
Israel 's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gives a speech during a graduation ceremony of the National Security College in Jerusalem July , 2008 .
REUTERS / Baz Ratner
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Wednesday he would step down after his ruling Kadima party chooses a new leader in a September 17 internal election in which he will not run .
“ I have decided I wo n’t run in the Kadima movement primaries , nor do I intend to intervene in the elections , ” Olmert said in a surprise announcement from his official residence in Jerusalem .
“ When a new ( Kadima party ) chairman is chosen , I will resign as prime minister to permit them to put together a new government swiftly and effectively . ”
ROBOTS already cut the grass and vacuum rugs .
Now they are helping with a more artistic job : creating vast photographic panoramas with ordinary cameras .
A new , inexpensive robotic device from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University attaches snugly to almost any standard digital camera , tilting and panning it to fashion highly detailed panoramic vistas  whether of the Grand Canyon , a rain forest or a backyard Easter egg hunt .
The robot is called GigaPan , named “ giga ” for the billion or more pixels it can marshal for a typical panorama .
It creates the huge , high - resolution vista by extending its robotic finger and repeatedly clicking the camera shutter , taking tens , hundreds or even thousands of overlapping images , each at a slightly different angle , that are then stitched together by software to create one gigapixel shot .
Viewers can explore a panorama in detail when it is displayed on a computer screen , clicking on any part of the image and then zooming in for crisp close - ups .
You can move from an overall shot of the forest , for instance , to an image of one small moth resting on the side of a single tree trunk .
The roboticized camera mount and related software were devised by a team led by Randy Sargent , a senior systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon West and the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , Calif. , and Illah Nourbakhsh , an associate professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh .
The work was part of a project to introduce people to different countries and cultures through images .

I am reliably told by a Bush administration official that there is an old saying in Texas that goes like this : “ If all you ever do is all you ’ve ever done , then all you ’ll ever get is all you ever got . ”
Could anyone possibly come up with a better description of President Bush ’s energy policy ?
America is in the midst of its worst energy crisis in years and what is the big decision our Decider has decided ?
Drum roll , please : Our Decider decided to lift the executive orders banning drilling for oil and natural gas off the country ’s shoreline  even though he knew this was a meaningless gesture because a Congressional moratorium on drilling passed in 1981 remains in force .
The economist Paul Romer once said to me that “ a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . ”
President Bush is well on his way to being remembered as the leader who wasted not one but two crises : 9/11 and 4/11 .
The average price of gasoline in the U.S. last week , according to the Energy Information Administration , was $ 4.11 .
After 9/11 , Mr. Bush had the chance to summon the country to a great nation - building project focused on breaking our addiction to oil .
Instead , he told us to go shopping .
After gasoline prices hit $ 4.11 last week , he had the chance to summon the country to a great nation - building project focused on clean energy .
Instead , he told us to go drilling .
The difference at Airlie was that the object of the lectures was to improve understanding of the relationships among people rather than among mathematical symbols .
After the lectures students met in small groups to pose follow - up questions and design research strategies .
The idea was to motivate them to do applied work and give them a head start in developing an applied focus for their Ph.D. theses .
David Weiman , the former director of the council 's program and now at the Russell Sage Foundation , hopes that the summer conference and research grants that the council provides can offset what he sees as a lamentable tendency among young graduate students .
Too often , he says , they allow mathematical technique to dictate the questions they ask rather than first seizing a pressing social question from which the choice of appropriate technique would then follow .
Graduate programs , he says , '' emphasize teaching students how to prove theorems , misleading them into thinking that economics is a deductive exercise , the mere application of mathematical logic . ''
Prof .
Alan Blinder of Princeton University considers it damning to some of the country 's most prestigious graduate programs that their students need to flock to summer camp to find an outlet for their interest in applied work .
Mr. Blinder , a former member of President Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers and a driving force behind the council 's efforts to promote applied economics , said in a recent interview that too much of what young scholars write these days is '' theoretical drivel , mathematically elegant but not about anything real . ''
He attributes the problem in part to the first year of training , or what he calls mathematics boot camp , during which students are handed a steady diet of theory but not taught to connect it to the real world .
They soon forget the issues that attracted them to economics .
Mr. Blinder makes an important distinction .
He remains scrupulously agnostic over whether graduate training is overly theoretical .
'' That 's a tough issue . ''
But he is unwavering when he criticizes the training as '' increasingly aloof and self - referential . ''
Indeed , the students at Airlie seemed surprisingly unfamiliar with many current economic issues .
Chatting at lunch with a half - dozen of so of the graduate students , one of the guest lecturers referred to the earned - income tax credit as the E.I.T.C. , the country 's most successful anti-poverty program next to Social Security .
'' What 's that , '' one student asked .
Nor could many of the students distinguish Medicare from Medicaid or demonstrate familiarity with simple facts about the American economy .
They had studied the theory of financial markets , but not its connection to the crisis sweeping through Asia .
Record Makes Thin -Film Solar Cell Competitive With Silicon Efficiency
by Staff Writers
Golden CO ( SPX ) Mar 26 , 2008
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory have moved closer to creating a thin - film solar cell that can compete with the efficiency of the more common silicon - based solar cell .
The copper indium gallium diselenide ( CIGS ) thin - film solar cell recently reached 19.9 percent efficiency , setting a new world record for this type of cell .
Multicrystalline silicon - based solar cells have shown efficiencies as high as 20.3 percent .
The energy conversion efficiency of a solar cell is the percentage of sunlight converted by the cell into electricity .
" This is an important milestone , " said NREL Senior Scientist Miguel Contreras .
" The thin film people have always looked for matching silicon in performance , and we are reaching that goal . "
CIGS cells use extremely thin layers of semiconductor material applied to a low - cost backing such as glass , flexible metallic foils , high - temperature polymers or stainless steel sheets .
Thin - film cells require less energy to make and can be fabricated by a variety of processes .
Because of this , they provide a promising path for providing more affordable solar cells for residential and other uses .
The CIGS cells are of interest for space applications and the portable electronics market because of their light weight .
They are also suitable in special architectural uses , such as photovoltaic roof shingles , windows , siding and others .
Researchers were able to set the world record because of improvements in the quality of the material applied during the manufacturing process , boosting the power output from the cell , Contreras said .
Members of the record - setting team at the National Center for Photovoltaics include Contreras , Ingrid Repins , Brian Egaas , John Scharf , Clay DeHart and Raghu Bhattacharya .
Today ’s post on critical thinking concerns the five principles collectively known as Mill ’s methods , first presented together in 1843 by the Enlightenment philosopher John Stuart Mill in his book A System of Logic .
Each of them is intended to illuminate the flow of causality in a different way , giving us mental tools to link causes and effects .
In this post , I ’ll highlight past entries in my “ Popular Delusions ” series , and show how failure to properly use Mill ’s methods has duped the practitioners of pseudoscience .
1 . The method of agreement .
If two or more cases of the event you ’re seeking to explain have only one causal factor in common , that factor is probably the cause of the event .
Example :
In my post on hauntings , I noted a way in which ghost - hunters conspicuously fail to apply the method of agreement : the vast majority of ghost sightings have nothing in common except that the people involved are in the twilight state on the edge of sleep .
These conditions are most suitable for the human neurological state of sleep paralysis , which typically entails hallucination , inability to move , and a strong sense of a looming presence .
This is a causal factor in common among these cases which ghost believers generally overlook .
Since ghost sightings have little else in common , the method of agreement would suggest that sleep paralysis is the most probable cause of this phenomenon .
2 . The method of difference .
If there is one case where an event occurs and one case where it does n’t occur , and all the causal factors except one are the same in both cases , that one factor is probably the cause of why the event happened in one instance and did not happen in another .
Example : Astrology is an excellent example of misapplication of the method of difference .
Astrologers claim that the celestial bodies and constellations that are ascendant at the time of a person ’s birth determine their subsequent traits of personality and character .
This is the sort of claim that could be proven by the method of difference , but most astrologers are steadfastly uninterested in even doing the tests .
Those few who have tried , using the method of difference to predict the personality characteristics of strangers based on their birth times , have been dismal failures .
3 . The joint method of agreement and difference .
If there are some cases where an event occurs and some cases where it does not occur , and all the cases where it does occur have only one causal factor in common , while all the cases where it does not occur lack that causal factor , that factor is probably the cause of the event .
Example : Faith healers are notorious for their ignorance of this method .
If sick people who were prayed over frequently experienced otherwise inexplicable remissions , while people lacking such intervention never did , this would be strong evidence in favor of intercessory prayer .
But all these conditions , in reality , are absent : sick people who receive prayer experience spontaneous recovery at rates no greater than chance , while spontaneous remission also occurs among people receiving no special theological intervention .
4 . The method of residues .
When seeking to explain the causes of a set of events , deduct all the causal factors which are known to cause some subset of those events ; the remaining causal factors are probably the cause of the remaining members of the set .
Example :
The method of residues is routinely ignored by proponents of homeopathy , who believe that a purported remedy can be diluted out of existence and still retain its curative power .
A proper application of the method of residues would begin with the application of a chosen homeopathic remedy at full strength , then successively subtract the components of that remedy to observe how the effect diminishes .
Homeopaths , however , believe the opposite : that as causes are progressively subtracted , the effects will grow greater in magnitude .
This violates not just the laws of physics but the very notion of causality itself .
5 . The method of concomitant variation .
When two events or circumstances are observed to vary in the same proportions , such that an increase in one always accompanies an increase in the other , one is probably the cause of the other .
Example :
This method is abused and misused not once , but twice , by the fanatical anti-vaccine campaigners .
When they claim that the preservative chemical thimerosal causes autism in some subset of vaccinated children , they fail to take note of the fact that autism rates have been rising in recent decades even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines .
And in their steadfast denial of vaccines ’ efficacy in preventing deadly disease , they steadfastly ignore the declining rates of these infectious diseases , dwindling to near zero in many cases , which accompanied the widespread use of vaccination .
And as vaccination declines among the superstitious , these diseases reappear and spread in turn – an unfortunately near - perfect example of the correlation that the method of concomitant variation reminds us not to overlook .

The white owner of a construction company , initially sentenced to life in prison in 2005 for ordering that a black man be beaten and then thrown to a pack of lions , was released Thursday on parole  a stunning turn in the notorious “ lion ’s den case ” that has left many South Africans enraged .
“ It is clear from the poor working class , poor communities that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently than those who are poor , ” read a statement from the North West Congress of South African Trade Unions .
Several other organizations issued similar messages of protest .
Mark Scott - Crossley , the owner of the construction company , had been convicted of murder in the killing of a former worker , Nelson Chisale , in Limpopo Province .
South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world , and the most monstrous killings are a staple of newspaper headlines .
With the startling power of its twin rotors and its 200 - horsepower engine behind my shoulder blades screaming like an army of leaf blowers , it felt almost as if I were doing the lifting myself , with muscles I did not know I had .
It felt like living in the future  and , even better , the future we imagined back when it was something to be hoped for rather than feared .
Pressing the left - hand stick forward caused the device to pitch forward slightly , and the jetpack began advancing , a few feet above the lawn .
Mr. Martin and a colleague steadied it by grasping hand rails and trotting alongside , like parents teaching a child to ride a bicycle without training wheels .
Then , coming around a curve , Mr. Martin jogged to the right to avoid some equipment on the ground , bringing the jetpack too close to an overhanging tree .
The limb was sucked into the rotors with a brief but sickening sound , like a blender trying to make a margarita with twigs .
Luckily , he had spare parts and access to a workshop to replace a chipped rotor .
Mr. Martin started trying to make his jetpack dreams come true in college .
While he was studying biochemistry , he was also working on painstaking calculations of thrust in the library and researching the Wright brothers ’ methodical approach to technology development .
He later had jobs in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries , but much of the money went to the work going on in his garage .
He built a network of enthusiasts who helped him develop his ideas .
In June 1997 , seven weeks after the birth of his second child , Mr. Martin figured his prototype was now powerful enough to lift its first flier , so long as that person weighed less than 130 pounds .
So he turned to his wife .
“ I said , ‘ Hey , Vanessa , what are you doing tonight ? ’ ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Using sheets of glass covered with organic dyes , scientists have devised an efficient and practical solar power device that they believe can help make this clean , renewable energy source more affordable .
Experts eager for energy sources that do not involve the burning of fossil fuels often point to the promise of solar energy -- harnessing sunlight to make electricity .
But solar power so far has proven costlier than standard energy sources .
Writing on Thursday in the journal Science , Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers describe the development of a new type of “ solar concentrator ” that may provide a better way to extract energy from the sun .
They used glass sheets coated in organic dyes to concentrate light hitting the panes .
The dyes absorbed the light , then emitted it into the glass , which carried the light to the edges of the pane much as fiber - optic cables transport light over distances , the researchers said .
At the edges of the glass are located small solar cells that then transform the light into electricity .
“ It consists of just a piece of glass with a layer of paint on top of it , ” MIT electrical engineering professor Marc Baldo , who led the research , said in a telephone interview .
“ The idea is the light comes in and hits the paint .
The paint then bounces the light out to the edges of the glass .
All you need is the solar cells on the edges .
So we think we can use this to reduce the cost of solar electricity , ” added said .
MIT researcher Jonathan Mapel , who also worked on the study , said the hope is that the use of this sort of technology can help bring the cost of solar power closer to the cost of conventional fossil fuel power sources such as coal .
“ One of the challenges with solar ( energy ) in general is that it ’s just too high in cost .
And what you ’d like to do is reduce the price of solar electricity , ” Mapel said .
Solar concentrators collect sunlight over a large area -- in this case the panes of glass -- and concentrate it into a small solar cell that turns the light into electricity .
Existing solar concentrators use mirrors or lenses to concentrate the light .
The sheets used in this research are flat and light , thus can be utilized in solar panels placed on roofs or even used as windows that could generate power .
The new system , unlike some concentrators , does not have to move to track the progression of the sun across the sky in order to provide a continuous power source , Baldo said .
The researchers think their system could be available within three years and even could be added onto existing solar - panel systems to increase their efficiency .
“ This accomplishment demonstrates the critical importance of innovative basic research in bringing about revolutionary advances in solar energy utilization in a cost - effective manner , ” Aravinda Kini of the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Office of Science , a sponsor of the work , said in a statement .
Some of the MIT researchers are forming a company , Covalent Solar , based in Boston to develop and market the technology .
My relationship with Ubuntu can be mildly described as love - hate .
Ubuntu hates me .
I love Ubuntu .
Wait a minute , I am so frustrated with all the trouble that Ubuntu gives me that I hate it .
Maybe it ’s hate - hate .
Still , I ’ve installed Ubuntu at least 9 times .
Most of the times , the Internet would n’t work and I ’d give up and delete the partition and switch back to Windows .
I even had to download the text - only alternate CD because the drivers for the wireless card messed up the graphical installation .
I tried Fedora as well –no luck .
Maybe all Linux hates me .
See , I ’m a graphics designer / web developer , so it makes sense that I need my Adobe suite to work .
Recently though , my work load has been mostly business - like and managerial , so I thought I ’d give Ubuntu another –maybe final–shot .
A little bit about my setup : I have a HP dv2610 us laptop , which works great with Vista .
It ’s got plenty of ram and hard disk space .
So why would I need Ubuntu ?
Well , I really do n’t .
I work in a highly technical environment , so it ’s partially peer pressure that I want to be well - versed in a Linux environment .
Partly , it ’s because I like switching computers a lot , and the main draw is to play around with a new OS .
I ’ve owned PCs , Macs , but emulating all of those is easy in a Linux environment–or so I ’d heard .
I also want to play around with customizing the OS to my tastes .
I like how the fancy Compiz stuff works , and I want to learn / play around with bash scripting .
So , on with the story .
Everytime I ’ve installed Ubuntu , I ’ve done it on a small partition , keeping my Windows partition intact .
This time , I thought I ’d take the plunge .
I have all my files backed up , I ’ve got restore discs in case disaster strikes .
And I have about a week to play around in new environs .
I decided to format the hard drive and go fully Ubuntu .
Most of my previous attempts , I ’ve gotten as far as getting the restricted nVidia drivers installed , but wireless is crucial for me .
Since I have a broadcom wireless card ( BCM94311MCG wlan mini-pci to be exact ) , nothing I tried worked for me .
I tried ndiswrapper ( following the directions from this site ) , but that failed .
I tried several other options , but nothing really worked .
Good thing I learnt Spanish in high school , because a Spanish Linux forum had the exact instructions I needed to get my card working .
It took me a day or so , but here I am , writing my blog through my wireless Internet connection !
There ’s a few mistakes on that page which I have corrected and I ’ve documented the correct mechanism to get the card working on this post .
I ’ll write more about my experiences in the coming week here .
I ’m a Linux newbie , so if I ’m doing something wrong , or if there ’s a better way to go about doing it , please comment or send me an email !

It 's no secret at this point .
Superheroes are real , and they 're everywhere .
You may not have noticed , because the media does a pretty good job of keeping things quiet , but the stars of your favorite comic books are n't made up , they are all portraits , ( albeit , exaggerated ones ) , based on real people .
It 's true .
Real people are getting into costumes to protect this planet , ladies and gentlemen , and I 'm happy to say that it's my job ( for some reason ) to find out their secret identities .
For my methods , I 've tirelessly researched the histories behind 4 popular heroes and crosschecked some facts of their secret identities with well - known facts about public figures to come up with the likely candidates .
Brace yourselves , sports fans , because I 'm about to blow some of the most successful cover -ups in history wide open .

The Lowdown :
Captain America is one of the most respected heroes in the Marvel Universe .
The result of a military program designed to build an army of Super Soldiers , Captain America is n't so much a superhero as much as he is the strongest , fastest and most powerful human being around operating on levels just slightly higher than those of above average athletes .
Fighting bravely in World War II , Steve Rogers 's triumphant success against foreign oppression established him as a beloved American icon .
The Real Captain America is a confident and powerful symbol of American Superiority with a remarkably strong chin :
Lance Armstrong
Named " Greatest Fucking Athlete " by every magazine that ranks athletes , Armstrong possesses both the physical strength and the ability to kick ass in foreign countries that Marvel 's Captain America practically bleeds .
No , Lance Armstrong is n't bitchslapping a bunch of Nazis , but he is making a whole lot of French people look stupid year after year after year , ( they fucking love biking ) , which is just as good if not better .
A look at Armstrong 's physical attributes reads like the back of a Captain America Marvel Card , ( if Captain America dated Sheryl Crow once ) .
While the average human 's maximal oxygen consumption is between 40 and 50 , Armstrong 's is 83.8 and his heart is about 30 % larger than the average heart .
He also has what Dr. Wikipedia describes as an unusually low lactate level .
During intense training in racers , lactic acid builds up and slows a normal human down , but Armstrong 's body for some reason ( magic ? ) does n't produce as much lactic acid as your average human .
Without getting any more sciencey on anyone 's ass , Armstrong is , long story short , in better physical condition than you could ever dream of being .
You might say , he's

If you ’ve ever wanted to see a solar eclipse , this might be the time to do it .
It is a very rare chance to see an eclipse at totality because the Moon ’s shadow is so small and , more often than not , it falls on sparsely populated regions of the planet .
Often eclipse hunters are resigned to planning expensive trips to these locations , sometimes only to be disappointed by poor weather .
But there ’s an answer .
This Friday ’s eclipse will swing over Canada , the tip of Greenland , parts of Russia , China and Mongolia , including the Gobi desert , although nothing can replace actually travelling to one of these locations to witness this celestial event , NASA will transmit the eclipse live over the Internet .
Excellent , now we can do some eclipse - chasing without leaving our armchairs …
Back in 1999 , the south of the UK was fortunate to witness a total solar eclipse .
I remember the excitement this caused on August 11th during that short British summer .
Totality could be experienced in the southern - most county of Cornwall , but my hometown , Bristol , would see more than 90 % totality .
Although it was n’t perfect , I decided to stay at home as the weather forecast for Cornwall was n’t good , Bristol was better .
Ultimately I wanted to see the “ diamond ring ” of the edge of the Sun peaking over the limb of the Moon .
So , I kitted myself out .
I constructed a rudimentary eclipse projector with a pair of binoculars and purchased a new tripod for my camera so I could photograph the projected image via the binocular set - up .
I was good to go .
But as with all British summers , I could n’t rely on the weather .
It turned out the weather front that was forecast for Cornwall had blown north ahead of schedule , blanketing my city and most of Cornwall .
Alas , the eclipse was wasted on most of mainland Britain …
That ’s the problem with trying to view the eclipse , often it will be in the wrong location at the right time , or the right location at the wrong time .
Of course many eclipse hunters have luck on their side and are able to enjoy totality with clear skies , but for most of us have to make do with photos and videos taken by other people after the event .
Not quite the same .
This Friday ’s eclipse will be like most others , but this time it will start in Canada , pass over Greenland , Russia , China and Mongolia .
If you are based in the USA , you might catch a glimpse of the event at sunrise in northeastern Maine .
However , dedicated eclipse chasers like NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak will be travelling to northern China to witness the event .
But it has n’t been easy .
As the Olympics are starting next week in Beijing , travel expenses have sky - rocketed , plus fuel prices can only make things worse .
Many Chinese eclipse tours can cost $ 3,000 - $ 6,000 and if you fancied a trip to the High Arctic on a Russian icebreaker , expect to pay $ 23,000 .
So we do n’t miss out , NASA will be transmitting the live eclipse ( presumably via their homepage www.nasa.gov) starting well before its peak at 7:09 am EDT .
Also , museums like the Exploratorium in San Francisco have special eclipse events scheduled so we can all have the chance of seeing the event as it happens .
Again , it ’s not the same as experiencing it yourself , but at least you can guarantee clear skies via the Internet …

An idea came to me the other day when i was designing a scenario for a wargame on my computer .
I dont know if any of you have heard of Super Power ( called Global Power outside of the US ) but it can be interesting for seeing the world from the strategic viewpoint of often ignored nations .
I know this post will be a little long , but I love to put out these scenarios and at least some of you have shown interest in the past , so just this once I wont wait for someone else to start the topic .
I had the game set up true to life , with US forces occupying Afghanistan and Iraq .
The goal I set for myself was to militarize over the course of one year and launch an invasion of both neighboring countries as well as Kuwait .
Predictably I lost , but the scenario triggered som thinking and have me the idea that Iran could be a legitimate threat , especially as a pawn working in the interests of a greater cause , such as an secret pact with China .
Iran is very different from Iraq .
Unlike Iraq , Iran has the geographic position to deny the US access to the Persian Gulf , as well as the cruise missiles to back it up .
Unlike Iraq , Iran will not be invaded through an open desert , but over a mountain range , or else by amphibious assault .
Unlike Iraq , Iran has an opening to launch a first strike against a large number of US Troops who are not optimally prepared to resist the invasion .
Unlike Iraq , Iran would likely have ballistic missiles capable of attacking the Suez Cannal by the time such a war took place .
In short , Iran could hit America hard and it would probably take 6 months to 1 year for America 's retaliation to be prepared .
Phase 1 , days 1 - 30 : A barrage of cruise missiles and a few conventionally armed ballistic missiles soften American airpower in Iraq and Afghanistan and destroy key supply depots .
A large scale invasion of Iraq follows immediately , in conjunction with a smaller offensive into Afghanistan .
Iranian civilian vessels are armed with cruise missiles and surface to air missiles are deployed throughout the Persian Gulf , Red Sea , Arabian Sea , and Mediterranean to lay in wait for American reinforcements .
Kuwait is to be invaded once American troops in Iraq are eliminated .
Phase 2 , days 31 - 90 : Iran blockades the Persian Gulf creating an oil embargo on the United States as well as reduced production over all .
China secretly pays for oil in weapons and massive technical assistance with a crash nuclear program intended to between 1 and 5 bombs by years end .
The American buildup of forces in Turkey and Saudi Arabia begins .
The American strategy is to make a 3 pronged attack , from Turkey to Iran , through Iraq to Southwest Iran , and across the Gulf into Southeast Iran .
An eastern front from Pakistan is not possible because false - flag terrorism from China escalates tensions between Pakistan and India to a critical point .
As US troops move through the Suez Cannal , Iran launches conventional ballistic missiles , damaging the canal system and blocking it with the wreckage of several large ships .
The Americans must now take additional weeks to either await clear passage or to pass around Africa .
American or Israeli aircraft attack Iran 's ballistic missile sites , taking heavy losses against Chinese - provided radar and air defense systems but destroying many air defenses and Iran 's known ballistic missiles .
Iranian sleeper ships take a heavy toll as American ships enter the Red Sea .
Although Paul Van Ripper 's use of this tactic in a wargame before Iraq has increased force protection and softened the effectiveness of this tactic , the Americans do not truly expect such a large scale attack so far from Iran .
The attack kills up to 20,000 troops and 200 pieces of hardware .
Although not enough to stop the attack , it forces up to 1 month of delay as additonal troops and equipment are sent .
Phase 3 , days 91 - 150 : Although American forces in Turkey are assembling on schedule , US forces bound for Saudi Arabia have been heavily delayed and have taken heavy losses .
Iran makes regular probing attacks on the Turkish border , supported by cruise missiles and gas attacks .
Incindiary munitions delivered by cruise missiles take a heavy toll on Ankara and Incirlik .
Turkish forces demand an active role in the war now and are moved to the border to prepare for their part in the invasion of occupied Iraq .
While American forces in Saudi Arabia are understrength , Iran invades .
They take heavy losses but are successful and capture a small amount of undamaged US hardware , most of which is secretly sold to China for reverse - engineering .
Phase 4A , day 151 : Iran has obtained nuclear weapons and reveals this to the world .
Iran offers peace terms
Phase 4B , days 151- 180 : Iran does not yet posses nuclear weapons , or posses them yet believes they can defeat America in battle .
With the Saudi Theather closed and the sudden willingness of the Turks to fight , the American attack into Iraq and Northern Iran begins early .
Iranian troops in Southern Iraq and Saudi Arabia withdraw into Iran , destroying oil wells as they go .
The Iranians concentrate their defense in the mountains of Western Iran .
This is the first time since Korea that an organized and professional foe has resisted America on constricted and unfavorable terrain .
The Iranian defenses easily deflect the initial attack through the mountains .
America quickly secures Iraq and Saudi Arabia , and extends the lines of battle along the entire Zagros range , probing for a weakness .
At this point there is yet another opportunity for Iran to force peace before meeting with disaster , if they have the bomb .
Phase 5 , days 181- 270 : Despite heavy losses , the Iranians hold the front line for the first month or two by concentrating defenses on favorable terrain , reinforcing their positions adequately , and emplacing reserves to counter - attack any breakthrough .
Eventually an American breakthrough destabalizes the front .
The war will be over within a month of this breakthrough unless Iran has nuclear weapons with which they can force peace .
Phase 6 - the unthinkable - days 271- 278 : Iran announces their possesion of nuclear weapons and that they are prepared to launch on Turkey and perhaps other NATO countries .
They use tactical nuclear weapons to stop the American breakthrough and demand a peace settlement immediately , or else they will nuke remaining US positions and launch on Incirlik , Ankara , and Istanbul , Turkey - as well as Tel Aviv , Haifa , and Beer - Sheva , Israel .
China immediately notifies the US state department that this crisis will not be an excuse for them to make a nuclear conquest of the arab world , and that " there is potential for escalation " ...
God only knows what would happen .
Conclusion : Although Iran is no match for the US Military , their geography is favorable if they can develop the proper resources to take full advantage of it .
In order to upset the United States , Iran must do the following :
1. Produce a sizeable quantity of Medium Range Ballistic Missiles .
2. Acquire a VERY large quantity of cruise missiles and equip them with sufficient guidance systems to be used on a broad scale against advancing ground forces as well as naval threats .
3. Acquire sufficient sonar and torpedo technology / hardware to control the Straight of Hormuz ( Persian Gulf ) and Northern Arabian Sea in the face of US Submarine threats .
4 . Enter into agreements with modernized militaries to train first - rate officers and improve the tactical ability of their military at all levels , especially small unit level .
5 . Acquire a large volume of modern air defenses and at least a small number of modern aircraft and well trained pilots to ensure competent defense of their own airspace .
6 . Develop the range and precision of their artillery to exploit their Western mountains to the fullest extent as a defensive asset .
7. Secretly complete or acquire at least 3 nuclear weapons , and prepare themselves to produce more within 6 months of initial hostilities against any major power .
8 . Make arrangements to sign a strategic alliance with China and North Korea immediately at the end of the war .
It is my opinion that with extensive military spending and cooperation with China , N. Korea , Pakistan , and perhaps Russia , Iran could be prepared for hostilities against the United States within 1 year at the earliest and 2 - 3 years at the most .
It would be impossible to conceal development on this level , but the nations involve could argue in the UN that they are merely insuring their own sovreignity in the face of US Aggression .
Niether US nor Iraqi citizens will stand for the deployment of troops necessary to counter this scenario by non-diplomatic means prior to the outbreak of Iranian aggression .
If Iran had the means to negotiate a peace terms , using nuclear weapons as leverage after fighting well against neighbors and perhaps US troops ( although Iran will probably want nukes going in , and will sue for peace before the American invasion ) then I believe the terms would come out something like this :
1. Iran could advance their western border , perhaps even as far as the Tigris , taking control of much Iraqi oil and Shiite areas , with the US forced to acknowledge this as reparations for the US - backed Iraq - Iran war .
US military forces in Iraq would be strictly capped by the treaty .
2. Kuwaiti independence would be restored under their Emir and minor reparations paid to Kuwait .
The invasion of Kuwait would be appologized for as necessary to denying America a military base against Iran .
The number of US Military forces based in Kuwait would be strictly capped by the treaty .
3 . Afghan independence would be restored with new elections to be monitored by only UN security council members who did not participate in the war ( France , Russia , China ) .
American troops would be barred from Afghanistan by the treaty and required to pay " aid money " ( reparations ) in acknowledgement of their responsibility after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan .
Civil war would likely result , with Pakistani and Iranian intelligence assisting a new Taliban regime .
4. Saudi Independence would be restored with UN monitored elections - member of the House of Saud having been executed as American puppets during the war .
The election of a somewhat anti-American regime would be likely .
American military presence in this holy land would be entirely banned by treaty .
5 . A de-militarized zone in Eastern Turkey and Northern Iran would be established , and US military presence in Turkey would be strictly capped by treaty .
6. Iran would sign ( and probably violate ) treaties ensuring free access to the Persian Gulf .
This resolution is devastating for American oil supplies and foreign policy in the Gulf .
America would be forced to greatly reduce its energy consumption while accelerating its transition away from an oil economy ( which already must end soon due to Peak Oil ) .
After American troops had withdrawn from the region , a nuclear attack against Iran 's nuclear weapons would be almost certain and followed by a return to war unless Iran signs a strategic alliance with China .

’s journey to capturing the Dream lightweight grand prix began in Turku , Finland , almost 10 years ago .
At just 20 years of age , he traveled there from his hometown of Oslo , Norway , to take part in one of the most brutal and grueling events in the history of MMA : FinnFight .
In a time when gloves and time limits were completely out of the question and head butts were the favorite move of any strong wrestler , Hansen , with only a little bit of grappling experience , entered the ring against local fighter Marcus Peltonen .
Although Peltonen already had a fight under his belt , Hansen stomped him for a technical knockout in 98 seconds .
Hansen then made his way around the local Shooto circuit .
After just one fight , a submission victory over Sami Hyyppa in October 2002 , he was invited to Japan for Shooto ’s big year - end show .
His opponent there was Takumi Nakayama , an eventual King of the Cage lightweight champion and a veteran of 14 fights , including a win over Tatsuya Kawajiri and a draw with legendary shooter Rumina Sato After going the distance with the Paraestra Osaka fighter , Hansen was awarded a split decision -- something that was quite a rarity for a foreign fighter at the time .
Sato , who was present at the show , was amazed that a European nobody managed to do what he had not and therefore wasted no time challenging the Norwegian .
The two met three months later , and Hansen stopped Sato minutes into the opening round .
A star was born .
The win over Sato propelled Hansen to an immediate title shot against Takanori Gomi .
Gomi had won the vacant title in a fight against Sato and was on an unprecedented 14 - fight win streak that spanned four and a half years .
Even though Gomi was not yet the exceptional phenomenon he would become during his stint with Pride between 2004 and 2007 , it was already clear that the “ Fireball Kid ” was poised for superstardom .
Hansen had other plans , though .
He dominated Gomi on the ground , putting him in one awkward position after another .
At the end of the fight , the judges were left with no other choice than to award the challenger another majority decision .
Now the champion of the oldest fighting promotion in the world , the “ Hellboy ” had completely arrived in the homeland of “ KakutÅ  .
” Despite dropping the belt in his first defense to Brazilian Vitor Ribeiro -- an even more advanced ground fighter than himself -- Hansen became the nightmare of numerous Japanese champions in the years to come .
He posterized both Caol Uno and leglock specialist Masakazu Imanari with his patented knee strike .
He also went to war with Hayato Sakurai , a fighter who had competed two weight classes higher than Hansen for the majority of his career , losing only a razor - thin unanimous decision to “ Mach ” in the semifinals of the 2005 Bushido lightweight tournament .
With the loss , Hellboy ’s first in almost two years , doubts began to arise about his skills .
Due to bad luck , the downfall of Pride and a subsequent eight - month layoff , Hansen dropped to the status of a .500 fighter in 2006 - 2007 .
If he had won the previous fight , it was a safe bet he would lose the next .
In those years , inconsistency characterized his career .
Having put those troubles behind him , however , Hansen began proving his critics wrong .
He started out with a slick submission over Japanese Olympic wrestler Kazuyuki Miyata on New Year ’s Eve 2007 and carried that momentum with him into the Dream lightweight grand prix .
In the opening round , longtime Shooto companion Kotetsu Boku fell prey to Hansen ’s superior striking and grappling .
In the quarterfinals , Hansen was matched with American Eddie Alvarez .
For 15 minutes the pair traded punches , knees , takedowns and submission attempts in a fight that reminded fans of what ’s so great about the sport .
Despite delivering a fight - of - the - year type of performance , Hansen had to let Alvarez , who was just a little better , move on to the semifinals via unanimous decision .
Hansen was out .
Then three weeks ago , Joachim received a call from manager John Benjamin .
Dream promoter FEG had been so impressed with his showing against Alvarez that the promotion wanted to bring him back for an alternate match .
The rest is history : Hansen stepped up his game Monday at the grand prix final and dispatched of Kultar Gill via armbar 2:33 into the first .
With little hope of getting back into the tournament , it was the irony of fate that he got to take Alvarez ’s place when the American could n’t continue due to a nasty cut .
Well knowing that this was a chance that was unlikely to happen again anytime soon , Hansen seized the opportunity and brought his A - game against fellow finalist Shinya Aoki .
The only stumbling block was the fact that the Japanese grappling ace with the flamboyant spandex pants had embarrassed him in their previous meeting 18 months earlier , schooling him on the ground before finishing with a gogoplata submission .
Hansen proved that he had learned his lesson from that defeat .
He stayed out of the lanky judo star ’s submission attempts , instead using ground - and - pound to stop the pre-tournament favorite for the win at 4:19 of the opening round .
Now the Dream lightweight grand prix winner as well as the first Dream lightweight champion , the Norwegian obviously has a bull ’s - eye on his back .
But with four wins in his last five fights and a fight - of - the - year performance in losing to Alvarez , Hansen has brought his career full circle .
He ’s been in the best shape of his life and can kick back and wait for New Year ’s Eve , when he is likely to fight again .
FEG could match him with Aoki for a third and final time , or give fans the pleasure of experiencing Hansen - Alvarez II , or even pair Hansen with Tatsuya Kawajiri and hope for a more conclusive ending this time .
Regardless , 2008 has been Joachim Hansen ’s year so far , and another win will make him an even stronger candidate for fighter of the year .
" Our massive strategy was to use the Fairness Doctrine to challenge and harass right - wing broadcasters and hope the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too expensive to continue . "
-- Bill Ruder , Democratic campaign consultant and Assistant Secretary of Commerce , Kennedy Administration
The usual suspects will be doing the dirty work .
Congresswoman Louise Slaughter ( D - NY ) or Congressman Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) will likely resurrect the failed Media Act ( Meaningful Expression of Democracy in America Act ) intended to make political commentary unflattering to Democrats more difficult to deliver and easier to suppress through congressional oversight and , of course , litigation .
They have been trying for years .
The Media Ownership Reform Acts , H.R. 4069 & H.R. 3302 , and H.R. 4710 , the MEDIA Act , all tried to control ownership , force their definition of " diversity " and " localism " and reinstate the defunct " fairness doctrine " that was used until 1987 to suppress conservative broadcasters with tit - for - tat opposing view requirements .
These became a prohibitive financial burden if a broadcast was challenged , so controversial topics were assiduously avoided and programming was lackluster and innocuous .
While challenges were filed from both sides of the political spectrum , the long - term effect was to discourage any meaningful discussion of issues by conservatives on the radio .
Since the fairness doctrine repeal , Talk Radio has become a significant voice in today 's media world , one the left wishes to silence .
Luckily , attempts to reinstate " fairness " in recent years have not been successful , the legislative language was weak , and their justification a transparent exaggeration .
The 2004 House Resolution 4710 ( Media Act ) was obviously not directed at CBS or NPR and it revealed an underlying pathology of the left ; an inability to accept that conservative opinion is necessary within the national debate , it 's very existence brings balance .
However , balance is not really what they want .
(2) There is a substantial governmental interest in conditioning the award or renewal of a broadcast license on the requirement that the licensee ensure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources by presenting a reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance .
(3) Since the removal of the Fairness Doctrine standard in 1987 , we have seen a polarization in America due to the dissemination of false and misleading information and the growing proliferation of highly partisan news outlets .
Conservative radio , to which a sizable minority of adult Americans listens to on any given day , infuriatingly exposes leftist schemes and is harshly critical of their agenda .
Translated , " highly partisan " means " not in agreement with us . "
Just enough information gets through the stranglehold on the rest of the media that Democrats ' dominance is not assured .
Rush Limbaugh , in particular , puts them into a rage , as he is so effective at turning over the leftist stones to reveal the ugly ideological vermin underneath .
In a softball 2004 interview with the publicly funded leftist anti-American Bill Moyer of PBS , congressperson Slaughter revealed her prejudices while selling media reform to the socialist home team .
BILL MOYERS : Well , you know some serious people , including some liberals have said that one reason Rush Limbaugh has succeeded is because he is good entertainment .
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : Exactly .
He does n't make any pretense of being a news person or even telling you the truth .
He says he 's an entertainer .
BILL MOYERS : And you 're saying that kind of discourse is dominating America right now .
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : Dominating America and a waste of good broadcast time and a waste of our airwaves .
BILL MOYERS : Not to the people who agree with him .
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : Well , they do n't hear anything else .
Why would they disagree with him ?
" Dominating America " is , of course , nonsense ; most people still get their news from mainstream broadcast and print , which is overwhelmingly liberal , leftist and biased .
The statement reveals just how important a show like Limbaugh 's is .
If it were not effective , they would not care .
What Democrat socialists cannot win in an honest debate , they try to steal by removing their opponent 's access to the public view , by suppressing discussion and by inserting propaganda .
Their starting assumptions are simple : conservatives are liars , their beliefs are false , their criticisms are unfounded and they need to be controlled " in the public interest . "
They also believe that Americans are stupid .
Rep .
Slaughter 's double talk in the interview continued along that vein .
BILL MOYERS : What does your bill before Congress propose ?
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : So far , it just reinstates [ the fairness doctrine . ]
But you know , I 've been giving some thought to it this week .
I will in no way do anything to hurt the first amendment .
I 'd die for it .
I certainly do n't want to do anything about censorship or anything .
I simply want equal time .
As simple as we can make it is that we simply want to reinstate it .
That people have an opportunity to give them an opposing view , that you can't own a radio station in the United States that simply gives one side all day long .
BILL MOYERS : So you 're primarily concerned about radio ?
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : No . I 'm concerned about television as well .
But radio is probably where we 're going to get the biggest problems in trying to get this done , because people have the radio on all day .
They listen to it .
And I think that says a lot .
I think we can see that reflected in what people are thinking and feeling today .
BILL MOYERS : You know people say well , " Yes , it is in principle true that the government , the people passed to the television and radio companies the right to use the airwaves , the public spectrum . "
But cable 's a different baby altogether .
Cable is unregulated .
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : Right .
BILL MOYERS : Are you proposing the fairness doctrine for Fox News or MSNBC ?
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : You bet .
I 'll bet not .
MSNBC will be fine under any new Fairness laws , as long as it tows the Democrat line .
In the battle for America 's mind , the socialist and radical left never rest .
They know that whoever controls the information citizens see and hear has enormous influence on how they vote .
In the tradition of those who care for party and power more than country , they work diligently to undermine the basic freedoms that guarantee dissenting voices are heard .
They disguise their intentions under buzz words like " fairness " and " democratic expression " to appeal to the public 's sense of fair play , all while funneling millions of dollars into false front " bi-partisan " think tanks and media " watchdog groups " designed to mislead millions with push - polls , straw - man studies , and outright disinformation .
Organizations like the Center for American Progress , Media Matters , the Open Society Institute and dozens like them are intended to desensitize the public , to steadily chip away at the foundations of specific constitutional rights , those that do not mesh well with leftist progressive , socialist and communitarian dogma .
BILL MOYERS : You 're saying that your fairness doctrine would simply mean that if a radio station or television station offers one position , like Rush Limbaugh , on a bill or a campaign of President or an election , they should also have people who disagree with Rush Limbaugh ?
LOUISE SLAUGHTER : Absolutely .
They should not be putting their own bias and their own feelings out on their radio station because they think they own it .
It has to be done as a public trust and in the public interest .
BILL MOYERS : But the first amendment guarantees the right of free press .
LOUISE SLAUGHTER :
If they owned the airwaves , then I 'd probably have no complaint .
But they do n't .
It belongs to us .
Part of our democracy .
It 's part of the ability that we have to contact our citizens .
It 's a way that we want our children to grow up with some understanding of what this country is about and what it 's based on and what their choices are .
Rep .
Slaughter 's words are a rhetorical sleight of hand .
She sets up the interview with the common leftist theme of " us versus them , " painting the unspoken conservative " them " not as participants , but exploiters .
She tries to make the bitter pill of media control taste sweet .
" It belongs to us , " she says .
Who is " us " specifically ?
Are we to suppose that by the congresswoman 's definition conservatives are not really citizens ?
Are they not Americans with an opposing view that also understand what this country is " about ? "
This is a clear " disenfranchisement " of a large number of Americans , to use their own slogan against them .
For all their endless complaining about political polarization , Democrats readily contribute to it .
Beginning in 1989 with the iconic rock band The Go - Go's , PETA changed the face of celebrity activism .
Using celebrity influence was nothing new , but having famous people literally expose themselves in the most vulnerable way created a campaign that was hard for both the media and the public to ignore .
From our " Rather Go Naked " to " Ink , Not Mink " campaigns and from the sexy to the sweet , celebs everywhere use their voices and their bodies to help animals , and these videos show it all .
Atypical characteristics of children ’s linguistic development are early signs of the risk of developing reading and writing disabilities , or dyslexia .
New research points to preventive exercises as an effective means to tackle the challenges children face when learning to read .
The results achieved at the Centre of Excellence in Learning and Motivation Research were presented at the Academy of Finland ’s science breakfast on August21st .
Headed by Professor Heikki Lyytinen at the University of Jyväskylä , the research delved into how to predict and prevent difficulties in learning to read and write .
The study involved a 107 children with a dyslexic parent and a control group of children without a hereditary predisposition to dyslexia .
The researchers followed the development of the predisposed children , from birth through school age .
“ Half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group .
The atypical characteristics of these children ’s linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage , and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties , ” says Lyytinen .
According to Lyytinen , the predictors of reading and writing difficulties are evident primarily in two contexts :
(1) A delayed ability to perceive and mentally process the subtleties of a person ’s voice ;
(2) A sluggishness in naming familiar , visually presented objects
When approaching the age when they acquire the ability to read , at risk children seem to have more difficulties than expected in memorizing the names and corresponding sounds of letters .
“ Acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers .
The automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge .
Also , a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text , ” says Lyytinen .
“ A slow reader is n’t able to grasp a given text as a whole , and therefore has a hard time following the storyline .
This is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences . ”
The difficulties children experience when learning to read can be significantly reduced through training – “ and in a way that children find amusing , even if they do have difficulties in learning to read , ” Lyytinen points out .
The CoE in Learning and Motivation Research has developed computer game - like learning environments to aid preventive training , and made them available on the internet free of charge .
They are especially recommended for children with a perceived risk of developing reading and writing disabilities or who have had a hard time learning to read already in first grade .
“ The best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre-school age , but it ’s not too late even after the children have started school .
The learning result , of course , improves with repeated training : more than once a day and in short sessions .
The optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable . ”
Researchers at the CoE in Learning and Motivation Research have made good use of a wide range of scientific disciplines in creating the learning environment .
Apart from psychology , the exercises include elements from phonetics , mathematics and information technology .
This has allowed the researchers to make the learning environment more effective than traditional educational games .
With funding from the Ministry of Education and in collaboration with researchers of the Niilo Mäki Institute , the researchers at the CoE are also working to create constantly - developing , game - like exercises as well as tools with which to identify risks and detect learning disabilities .

OMeta に近い気がするけど、どうなんだろ。 " ということで 、OMeta をチェック中。 前のPEPM の PEG で左再帰の話 経由で論文は読んでたはずなんですが、 「 言語を作るための言語 」という視点で
Introduction が書かれてたのでその時は全然ピンと来てませんでした。 そうか、 PEGs operate on ... only ... characters .

OMeta さん。 まだ論文見てるだけなんですが、 「 ネストしたリストに対するネストしたパターン」が書けるのは素晴らしいとして、

13:51 08/06/17 ぱたーん☆まっち パターンマッチ的な物の未来を考える、というか主に願望を垂れ流します
（ see also : NyaRuRuさん、 きむら( K ) さん）。 リンク先でも話題にあがっているように、パターンマッチの使い勝手を考える上で 正規表現というのは近い位置にいるような気がするので、意図的にその辺りごちゃまぜに考えます。 とりあえず、文字列以外のリストも正規表現で処理したいということは自分の場合本気で結構あるので （日記に書いたのだ と
PQ
Tree や 構文解析の話 ‐ " 毎回スタックを覗く感じの実 装 " は非終端記号+構文木列スタックを正規表現で覗き込みたい
‐ など）、 その辺り巧く統合されて正規表現でできることはパターンマッチでできて逆もまた可、ってなると楽しい。
あるいは。 各種 LL の多重/アンパック/リスト代入は、私の感覚では、物凄く限定された形のパターンマッチなんですが、
Haskell や ML のようなフルのパターンマッチまで行かなくても、なにかもう一声欲しいよなーと思うことがあって、 そんなに大革命でなくても、今の言語に対するこのくらいの拡張でも便利なのでは…という消極的拡張。 if a.size >= 2 then x = a [ 0 ] y = a [ 1 ] ... end よりも if a.size >= 2 then x , y , * = a ... end の方が感覚的に は500 倍 くらいわかりやすくて、 if x , y , * = a then ... end # 的な何かそういったもの さらにこう書けたらもう500 倍 くらいわかりやすいなーと。 正規表現って文字列のパターンを視覚的にわかりやすく表現する記法で、 それを使って 、 「 そのパターンにマッチするかどうか調べられる」と同時に
「 マッチする部分を取り出せる」という二つの機能を実現しているわけで、
多重代入は今のところ「取り出す」専用だけど「取り出せるかどうか調べる」も兼ねたい。
（※今のところ1番目より2番目は圧倒的に遅いので、そもそもこういう風に使うように
できていないわけですけど、そこを「こういう風に使いたい」という辺りも含めて）
（※そういえば、" パターン "
がここで書いた二つの役目を兼ねてるのって別に必然じゃないよね
分離して考えることもできるんじゃない？みたいな論文を見たことがある気がする）
よりも の方が感覚的に は500 倍 くらいわかりやすくて、 さらにこう書けたらも う500 倍 くらいわかりやすいなーと。 正規表現って文字列のパターンを視覚的にわかりやすく表現する記法で、 それを使って 、 「 そのパターンにマッチするかどうか調べられる」と同時に
「 マッチする部分を取り出せる」という二つの機能を実現しているわけで、
多重代入は今のところ「取り出す」専用だけど「取り出せるかどうか調べる」も兼ねたい。 また積極的主張に戻る。 いやこれは私が色々使い方間違ってるだけな気がするんですが、たまにこういう正規表現書くはめになって mystr.scan ( /( aaa ) |( aab ) |( abc ) / ) do case when $ 1 ... when $ 2 ... when $ 3 ... end end 正規表現に括弧が増えるのが面倒くさい！あと、aaa の代わりに中で () 使うようなちょっと複雑な正規表現 が入ると、もう $ 1 の次が $ 3 なのか $ 4 なのか中身によって変わってしまって大変なことに！ … などなどの理由で mystr.scan do -case when / aaa / ... when / aab / ... when / abc/ ... end # 的な何かそういったもの こういう風に書きたいなあと妄想してしまうことがよくあります。たぶん、「 ブロック」を first - class のオブジェクトとして扱える言語がループ等の制御構造を自由自在に作り出せるのと同じように、 「 パターン 」 を first - class のオブジェクトとして扱える言語なら、こういう、ユーザー定義のパターンマッチ 制御構造みたいなのを書けるであろうなあ、というアレコレ。
これに類することができる文字列解析器（Semantic
Action がつけられるヤツなら基 本OK そう）や、 正規表現用のツールの存在は知っていますが、これもやっぱり、文字列に限らず「 データ構造」に対する「 パターン 」 のユーザー定義の自由な「制御」、っていう枠組みにまで広げた方が便利だと思うんですよ。
なんか正規表現の話しかしてないな。なんでだろ。 「列」に対するパターンマッチの機能以外は、
Extractor ( Scala ) とか [ PPT ]
Active Pattern ( F# ) とか View Pattern ( Haskell ) とか で任意の抽象データ型に好きなだけパターンマッチできるようになった時点で、私的にはかなり満足 できちゃってるんですよね、たぶん。あんんまり話を混ぜない方がよかった気がしてきた。まあいいや。 みんなで混乱しましょう 。
「 列」に対するパターンという話で行くと、C++ の STL でい う「 Iterator やRange 」 と「 Algorithm 」 の間にある、今だ と 「 Predicate や Function 」のレイヤが何か 「パターン」によっててもう少し構造化されうるんじゃ
ないかという適当な感覚があって、その辺適当にこうなんとか。

「 推移律を満たさない度合」をパラメータ化して何かできないか
が面白そうだなーと思って考えてたんですけど、その前に、マージソートやその他著名な
ソートアルゴリズムに対して、推移律を満たさない答えを返すこと自体そもそも可能なのだろうか、 という疑問が。要は " A < B " と " B < C " がわかってる時 に " A < C ? " を問い合わせてくるアルゴリズムって
無駄なことをやってるわけで、最適なアルゴリズムならそもそもそんなことは訊いてこないので、 そこでfalseと答えて推移律を破ることもできない、はず。
「計算量のオーダー的に最適」なのとは独立な性質だと思う（普通のマージソートの最後に１回余分な比較を
付け加えて推移律を満たさない答えを返す機会を与えてもO(n log(n ) ) は変わらない。逆に、最悪O( n^2 ) であっても
クイックソートが推移律を破らせないのは(重複要素がない場合)わりと自明な気がする）。
マージソートは、ヒープソートは、バブルソートは、挿入ソートは、シェルソートは、それぞれどうだろう。
あとで考える。 あるいは 昔 ICPC の合宿かなんかで、「全順序になってない順序に標準ライブラリのsort関数を適用する
荒技トポロジカルソート」という話を聞いたことがあるような気がするんだけど、で、これも
クイックソートなら大丈夫そうかなーと朧気に思った覚えがあるんだけど、
一方でこれが上手く行かないように挿入ソートを組むのは簡単な気がする。 これが可能なsortの実装というのはどういうものに限られるのだろうか。 千日手 王手を回避しなきゃいけないので、自分の駒の移動先と打ち込み先は常に自玉のライン上（＋桂馬の位置）

移動元はライン上でなければならない云々。うーん。
「 無限ではないことを示す」証明の定番というと、なんか下限のある盤面に関する特徴量を見つけて、

10:16 08/06/05 双方連続王手の千日手 やねうらおさんとこの話題 が面白かったので考えてるんですけど難しいですね。違う方向から考えようと思って [ 定 理1 ]
より王は動かない。ゆえに手順中に両王手は存在しない。すなわち、 全ての手は 「 " 大駒 " による遠距離からの王手」と、「大駒を相手玉に隣接させるもしくは小駒による、
近距離王手」のどちらか一方。千日手が一周する間の、先手による前者の王手の回数を
Af ( far ) 、 後者の回数 を
An ( near ) とする。同様に後手のそれ を
Bf ,
Bn とする。 これとは別に、相手にかけられた王手の回避の仕方で分類してみる。 王手をかけてきてる駒を取 る
Ag ( get ) 、合駒を打 つ Ap ( put ) 、駒を動かして合 駒 Ab ( block ) の ３種類。これも排反 。 An + Af = Ap + Ag+Ab = Bn + Bf = Bp+ Bg + Bb Ap = Ag & Bp = Bg ( 打った回数分取らないと持ち駒の収支が合わない )
Ap = Bg & Bp = Ag ( 打った回数分取られないと盤上の駒数の収支が合わない)
An ≦ Bg & Bn ≦ Ag ( 近接王手は取るしかない ) Bp+ Bb ≦ Af & Ap+ Ab ≦ Bf ( 合駒は遠距離王手に対してしか打てない ) ゆえに An ≦ Ag ＝ Ap ≦ Ap+ Ab ≦ Af。だからなんだというのだー！ という辺りで諦めた 。 [ 定 理 3 ] と [ 定 理2 ]
（ Ap=0 とすると Ab=Af=Bb=Bf , 他=0 になるが相手玉のライン上から別のライン上へ１手で移るのは
不可能なことからこれはないqed）を言い直しただけに近い。うーむ。
11:21 08/06/04 計算機は人間のように考えない 再帰ではない方法 は、実際のところ、再帰のままでいいと思います。ひとつだけ細工が要りますが。

人間が手で問題を解くなら、解の規則性や公式を見つけ出して、それに基づいた賢い計算式を発見する……
そういう風に考えるアプローチは必須だろうと思います。ただ、そこに計算機があるときはどうか。
「とりあえず馬鹿みたいに全部試す」のが計算機の最も得意とするところ。計算機達はそういう風に
アルゴリズムの夢を見る。 動的計画法 が感覚的に理解できないという人のひっかかる点の一つとして、
「 問題 P の入力 n に対する答え P ( n ) が欲しいだけなのに、 P( n - 1 ) , P( n - 2 ) , P( n - 3 ) , ... , P( 1 ) , P( 0 ) の答えを全部片っ端から計算する 」
という知性のかけらも感じられない物凄い無駄なことを平気でやってる感、があるのではないかと思う。
自分が手で動的計画法を実行してるシーンを考えると実際なんか馬鹿っぽいのだ。
けど、たぶん、計算機にとってはそうじゃない。
とかいう。 何が言いたいのかさっぱりわからなくなってきたけど、こう、アルゴリズムを考えるときには、 それを実行するのは自分じゃなくてコンピュータだよ！っていうのは意外と頭から抜け落ちがちだよ という話をしたかったんだと思う、たぶん。冒頭のリンクはあんまり関係なかった気がしてきた。
17:55 08/06/03 おもしろいみろん 「 プログラミング言語の 」 「フォーマルな」意味論（Semantics ） には大きくわけて３種類あって、一番メジャーなのは操作的意味論… （参考 → [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ）
というのは、まあそうかなとも思うのですが、
それはそれとして一番面白いのは表示的意味論だ、と適当なことを書き散らしてみるよ。 役に立つかなんて関係ない、面白さが全てだ。 勿論、どれもきちんと深く学んで、どういう風に応用されてるかを知れば面白いんですよ。 でも操作的意味論と公理的意味論って、パッと見すごく当たり前じゃないですか。 操作的意味論って要するに eval の実装が書いてあるだけだし（暴言）、 公理的意味論で は " プログラムを動かす前と後でどういう論理式が成り立つか " がプログラムの意味で、 「 プログラム " x := 42 " を実行した直後は、42を当てはめると真になる論理式はxを
当てはめても真になりますよ x+1==43 とか。それが x:=42 の意味」みたいな。知ってるよそんなこと。
いや、繰り返しますが、もちろん世の中そんな単純ではなくて、それぞれ真剣に深く考えると そんな「当たり前」なことばかりではなくて面白いですし、それ以前に、当たり前っていいことだよね。
プログラマの直感に合うってこと、わかりやすいってことだし。
ただ、勉強してて 「 " プログラム " っていうものをそういう風に捉える見方があったのか！その発想はなかった！ 」
と感じる瞬間が一番多かったのは、自分にとっては表示的意味論でした。そういう意味で「面白い」と思う。 全速力で表示的意味論 表示的意味論というのは、プログラムの意味を数学のオブジェクトで表現しようとする意味論です。 「 123 っていう式の意味は？ 」
「 整数 123 だよ 」
「 function f( x ) { return x+2 } っていう関数の意味は？ 」
「 整数を受け取ってそれに2を足して返す(数学的な意味での)関数だよ」。
「 function g(x ) { return x +1+1*1 } っていう関数の意味は？ 」
「字面は違うけど、それも意味的には整数を受け取ってそれに2を足して返す(数学的な意味での)関数だよ」
「 f( 123 ) っていう式の意味は？ 」
「 f の表す( 数学的な ) 関数を 123 の表す整数に適用した結果 ― つまり整 数125だよ 」
「 function h( x ) { if ( x==1 ) { return 2 } else { for ( ; ;) {} } } っていう関数の意味は？ 」
「 引数が1なら2を返して、それ以外なら無限ループする関数だよ 」 !!!!
ええと、無限ループって全然数学用語じゃないですよね。困った。なんとか数学っぽく定義したいんですが。
ここは、こんなアプローチがあります。意地でも関数には関数で居てもらうために、
無限ループするときは「無限ループしてることを示す値」というのを返すことにしてしまう。その名も
⊥ （ボトム）。 「 では改めて、 function h( x ) { if ( x==1 ) { return 2 } else { for ( ; ;) {} } } っていう関数の意味は？ 」
「 引数が1なら2を返して、それ以外なら⊥を返す関数だよ 」 「 function i(x ) { return 3 } っていう関数の意味は？ 」
「引数１個受け取るけどその値に関係なく 3 を返す関数だよ 」
「 function k( x ) { return i( h( x ) ) } っていう関数の意味は？ 」
「引数１個受け取とって、それにhの表す関数を適用した結果にiの表す関数を適用した結果を返す関数だよ」
「 k(5 ) っていう式の意味は？ 」
「 k の表す関数に 5 の表す整数を適用した結果だから ― 整 数5 をhに適用した結果にiを適用した結果 ― つまり⊥にiを適用した結果 ― iは引数関係なく 3 を返すはずだから ― この式の意味は整数 3 だ」 !!!!
Haskell みたく遅延評価する言語だったなら、この会話は正しい。確かに
k(5 ) は 3 になるはずだから。 でも、正格評価の言語だと、これはおかしい。k( 5 ) は無限ループするはず、つまり意味としては ⊥ でないといけない。 「 function i(x ) { return 3 } っていう関数の意味は？ 」
「 引数が⊥なら⊥を返して、それ以外なら値に関係なく 3 を返す関数だよ 」 正格評価の場合、正しくはこうでないといけなかったのだ。i
だけじゃなくて f も g も h も k も、そう。 こんな風に 、 「 int -> int 型の式の意味 」は、 直感的に思い浮か ぶ 「 整数から整数への( 数学的な ) 関数」では上手く行かないのです。
ここで上げた方法では、 「( 整数または⊥ から 整数または⊥ への数学的な関数 ) または⊥」みたいなものと して考えよう…という方向をとりました。別の方法もあるんじゃないかなたぶん。
あと、普通の値と違って⊥は if x == ⊥ then ... みたいな形で使うことはできないという制限から 考えると、 「 ( 整数または⊥ から 整数または⊥ への数学的な関数 )
または⊥」の中でも、プログラムとして
表現できる集合はごく一部だろうと推測できて、実際、「連続関数」と呼ばれる種類の関数（微分とかで出てくる
連続関数とは別物です注意）だけがプログラムで書けることがわかったりして （参考 : [ PDF ] 武市先生の 講義資料）、 この 「 または⊥または⊥または⊥」で⊥を埋め込みまくった謎の集合上の連続関数に、
「 ⊥が少なめの方が " 大きい " 関数」的に大小関係を定義してやると CPO ( Complete Partial Order ) と呼ばれる種類の集合になって、 再帰関数の意味とは不動点である！ と議論できるようになったりとか、まあ色々なお話があるわけです。 いわゆ る
「
領域理論」というのが、こっちの方向の表示的意味論です。 こう、「無限ループ自体を⊥という１つのオブジェクトとして扱っちゃう 」
「遅延評価/正格評価を、評価順序というよりも、値⊥の扱い方の違いとして捉える」、 あと全然説明してないですけど 「 " ⊥が少なめの方が大きい関数 " 的に関数と関数の間の順序関係を考える 」 「 再帰関数は不動点というか⊥からはじまる関数列の極限」あたりの発想が、自分的には結構驚きだったの
でありました。 ところで 表示的意味論界（？）の大問題として、「 Full Abstraction 」 というのがあります。 同じ動きをするプログラムの意味は、多少字面が違ってても同じ数学的オブジェクト
であって欲しい。そういう表示的意味論は「
Fully Abstract である」と言う。これが成り立つと嬉しい。

Have you ever heard of a snoring duck ?
Well , after watching this short ( 46 sec ) YouTube clip , you can say that you have .
That 's it .
Carry on ! -
Thanks benzoic !
Now this really is a mixed blessing .
On the one hand , I ’m thrilled to see that a study documenting the anti-cancer properties of cannabinoids is finally receiving some mainstream media attention .
On the other hand , I ’m disappointed that its coverage is limited to a British tabloid that is better known for running anti-pot propaganda like this :
Cannabis killer knifed neighbour 100 times
via Metro.co.uk
A mentally ill man driven to violent frenzies by cannabis was sentenced to life yesterday for stabbing a man 100 times .
… Kashmiri , 50 , of Tooting , south London , sexually assaulted the woman at her south London home in June , 2006 , and returned five nights later to attack her .
… Kashmiri , whose violent episodes are triggered by cannabis , denied murder but admitted manslaughter due to diminished responsibility .
Of course , I ’m accustomed to reading “ Reefer Madness ” in the British press .
But I ’m less accustomed to reading “ Reefer Madness ” when it comes from the mouth of an established medi- pot researcher like Dr. Wai Man Liu .
Cannabis may help the war on cancer
via Metro.co.uk
Cannabis could be used to treat many forms of cancer , new research suggests .
The drug contains an ingredient which slows tumour growth and prevents the reproduction of cancer cells , doctors say .
Its effects are seen in all cancers but particularly in those of the lung and brain , and leukaemia , it is claimed .
But scientists warned against smoking the drug , saying the only safe version was that created in the lab .
Researcher Dr Wai Man
Liu said : ‘ I ’m in no way encouraging people to take up smoking the ganja – there would be more harm than good . ’
Previous research has shown cannabis - based medicines can help cancer patients as a painkiller , appetite stimulant and in reducing nausea .
The drug has also long been used by multiple sclerosis and arthritis sufferers to reduce pain .
Its medicinal benefits come from the main active ingredient , THC .
The latest research , by St George ’s University of London , shows that THC can weaken cancer cells to make traditional chemotherapy more effective .
Dr Liu said : ‘ It ’s another weapon against the armour of cancer .
We are quite close but need to jump through certain hoops .
I believe it could be used in two to three years . ’
Dr Joanna Owens , from Cancer Research UK , said the latest studies were encouraging but needed to be followed up with more trials .
She added : ‘ Making cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy or radiotherapy is a great concept but it is still early days . ’
Having recently lost friends and family members to cancer , including one to leukemia , I can inform Dr. Liu that such a diagnosis — even when treated with standard radiation and chemotherapy — is a death sentence .
For Dr. Liu to advise , with a straight face no less , that these patients would do “ more harm than good ” by smoking cannabis is a disgrace .
Not only can cannabis alleviate cancer patients ’ nausea and pain , elevate their mood , and increase their appetite , but also — as Dr. Liu ’s own data demonstrates — it may help to alleviate the very disease that ’s ravaging their bodies .
Nevertheless , I suppose that Dr. Liu would rather have these patients shut up and die than expose the political hypocrisy surrounding criminalizing a plant .
Finally , as for Dr. Liu ’s idyllic estimate that his pharmaceutically - approved pot - based anti-cancer drugs will be available in “ two to three years , ” do n’t hold your breath ( or , if you already have cancer , try not to die in the interim ) .
I ’m sure that these investigators made similar proclamations when they documented pot ’s anti-cancer properties — in 1975 !
Yet here we are 38 years later and the only ‘ progress ’ we ’ve made on this issue is in the wrong direction — having moved from investigating the plant ’s anti-cancer potential in animals to cells in vitro in a petri dish !
Thank you Dr. Liu ; now kindly get out of my sight .

The stolen account information is used to allow a remote hacker access to the player 's account .
The hacker can then steal the player 's virtual assets by transferring them to another player account .
Such assets are often sold or auctioned off for real - world currency .
With millions of players , such trojans can easily affect thousands of users .
Installation
Usually OnlineGames trojans are spammed in emails with deceptive and enticing subjects and attachment names .
However , such trojans can also be downloaded by other malicious programs , for example by worms , backdoors , and trojan downloaders .
After the trojan 's file is started by a user , it installs itself to the system by copying its file to Windows folder .
It also creates a startup key value in the Registry for the copied file .
This is done to make sure that the trojan 's file is started every time Windows boots .
The startup key value is created under the following Registry key :
[ HKLM\SoftWare \Microsoft\Windows \CurrentVersion \Run ]
After installation the trojan locates the Explorer . exe process , drops a DLL from its body onto a hard drive and injects the dropped DLL into the Windows Explorer process .
Note that unlike the main trojan 's file , the DLL is dropped into the Windows System folder .
The dropped DLL is the main spying component .
Activity
In order to retrieve sensitive data , the trojan reads the process memory of certain game executables , for example WOW.EXE ( World of Warcraft ) , ElementClient.exe ( Perfect World ) , CabalMain.exe ( Cabal Online ) .
The trojan may also attempt to read certain variables from the games ' configuration files .
For example , the current game server address may be read from the CurrentServer.ini file .
Some variants of the trojan have keylogging capabilities .
They monitor what keys a user pressed and sends the keyboard activity logs to a malicious hacker .
The spying component contains an encrypted URL that is used to send stolen data .
The stolen data is sent to a hacker by accessing the specified website with a specially constructed URL .
The trojan can also try to connect to a hard - coded IP Address , create a socket and send stolen data to it .
Typically many of these IP addresses are registered in China .
Some variants try to suppress AVP anti-virus scanner windows .
Also , if a system debugger is detected , the trojan does not attempt to steal data .
Some of trojan 's strings are formed by executable code .
This is done to make the trojans less " visible " to heuristic scanners that react on certain types of text strings in the inspected files .

In the United States , there are three parks which are considered to be the crown jewels in the National Parks system : Yellowstone , Yosemite , and the Grand Canyon .
If you had to make a similar list for Australia , I do n’t know what two of the parks would be , one one of them would have to be Kakadu .
Kakadu is an enormous park .
It is one of the largest national parks in the world , over twice the size of Yellowstone and is larger than New Jersey or the nation of Israel .
Of the 850 UNESCO World Heritage sites , only 25 are recognized for both natural and cultural significance , and Kakadu is one of them .
Even if you have never heard of Kakadu , you have probably seen it on TV .
Kakadu is where many of the ‘ outback ’ scenes in Crocodile Dundee were shot and was often frequented by Steve Irwin .
There is no one single thing in Kakadu .
The park has wetlands with a wide diversity of bird life , several rivers with crocodiles , rock escarpments , part of the coast on the Arafura Sea , and savanna .
Kakadu has over 280 bird species , 60 mammal species , and 1,600 plant species .
My trip to Kakadu began as almost all trips to Kakadu do : from Darwin .
Kakadu within driving distance to Darwin and there are day tours you can take from the city .
While there is n’t a lot you can see just taking a day trip , it is doable .
Driving distance is about two hours , depending on where you go in the park .
There are only two main roads in the park which are paved and a small number of spur roads to various sights .
Everything else requires a 4 - wheel drive ( which I did n’t have ) .
Most of the unpaved roads are not accessible during the wet season which is about October to March .
I was there in May , which seemed to be the perfect time to go .
Conditions were dry enough that most roads were open , yet not so dry that everything was brown .
Fire plays an important part of things in the park ( and for most of Australia for that matter ) .
While I was there I saw many brush fires in the park , all of which were started on purpose .
They tend to start fires early in the dry season when the grass still has some moisture so the fires do n’t get out of hand , least you have a bigger fire later in the year when conditions are really dry .
Many of the plants require fire to germinate .
In fact , there is one species of kite ( a bird ) which catches prey has it flees fire .
It has learned to pick up burning sticks and embers and to drop them on the unburnt brush to spread fire to flush out more animals .
My first day in the park I visited Ubirr , which is noted for its Aboriginal rock artwork .
The Aboriginal presence in the area extends back over 20,000 years ( I ’ve heard estimates of 40,000 years , which would put it on a par with the evidence of human settlement I saw in Mungo National Park ) .
There are several locations in Kakadu of well - preserved examples of Aboriginal artwork , some of which is older than the cave paintings found in Lascaux , France .
Unlike Lascaux , the art in Kakadu is n’t in a cave and is very accessible .
I arrived at Ubirr about two hours before sunset and managed to climb up the large outcrop to watch the sunset over the nearby wetlands .
It was something like you ’d see in a documentary about the African savanna , except there were no lions , zebras or elephants .
A large number of tourists arrived just before sunset , so it must be one of the big stops for tour groups in the park .
I stayed overnight in Kakadu in my camper , and the next day I headed out early to explore some more of the park .
One of the most prominent features in Kakadu is Jimjim Falls .
Unfortunately , the road there was the only one I saw that was closed in the park , so I could n’t take a trip in a 4 - wheel drive out there .
My first stop was at Anbangbang , which is another rock art site south of Ubirr .
The geologist in me noticed a difference in the rocks between the two locations .
Ubirr was a fine - grained sandstone , whereas Anbangbang was a very coarse conglomerate .
The artwork was surprisingly sophisticated for something done thousands of year ago .
All of the art was done in sheltered areas under rock overhangs .
In nearly all of the locations , you could also see holes worn into the stone , where food was prepared .
The last big thing I did was to take a boat trip on the South Alligator River .
( There are no alligators in Kakadu , only crocodiles , but the first Europeans to go there did n’t know the difference ) .
The water levels on the river vary dramatically depending on the time of year you are there .
The guide we had said that just two weeks beforehand , all the trees in the area had been about halfway submerged , so the water had gone more than a meter .
Again , the time of the visit was almost perfect .
The water was n’t so high that it was just a giant lake , but it was n’t so low that it was dried out .
There was plenty of grass around and many of the bird species were giving birth .
There were birds all over the place .
I wish I had taken notes during the trip , but I was too busy taking photos ( and after many attempts in many places , I can say with authority I suck at taking bird photos ) .
The big feature of the tour , and of the entire park itself , were the crocodiles .
We saw three crocs during the 90 - minutes of the tour , including one very large male sunning himself on the bank of the river .
Everywhere in Kakadu , on every body of water , you can see warning signs about crocs .
Do n’t swim , do n’t fish , do n’t clean fish , do n’t stop , do n’t do anything , please stay the hell away from the water .
Crocs are dangerous , but so long as you do n’t do anything stupid , they are n’t a problem .
I heard a news report while in Australia that local Australians are attacked at higher rates than tourists , usually because they do n’t tend to take warnings as seriously .
In 2002 a German tourist was killed by a croc in Kakadu .
If a person was going to Australia and could only see one thing , I think I ’d have to recommend Kakadu .
It is probably the quintessential Australian experience where you can see most of the things which makes Australia , Australia .

Game Over Hillary Clinton Should Have Conceded Tuesday Night
No , she can 't .
Robyn Beck / Getty Images
It 's time for Hillary to concede .
I 'm the biggest — sometimes , it feels like , the only — Hillary supporter at this paper .
I do n't agree that she 's guilty of " dividing the party , " or that this protracted Democratic nomination battle turned the country against the Democrats .
My desire for her to concede is both political and personal .
First , there 's now no scenario in which Hillary can overtake Barack Obama and win the nomination .
And second , I do n't want to see her embarrass herself and diminish her legacy as a First Lady and a senator .
First , the math .
Clinton did n't win enough delegates in Indiana .
If she stays in the race ( still unclear at press time ) , Clinton will have to win around 70 percent of the remaining delegates to take the nomination — a shift that does n't seem plausible even if she continues to chip away at Obama 's standing with white , working - class voters in states that have yet to vote .
( Hello , Kentucky and West Virginia . )
Moreover , Clinton 's base of white , working - class voters is n't enough to eliminate Obama 's overall lead among delegates and in the popular vote .
To win , Clinton would have to win the support of a substantial majority of superdelegates , and they 're more than aware which way the political wind is blowing .
The longer Clinton lets this race go on , the uglier it will be for her in the end .
And — not that I 'm opposed to fighting dirty — has n't it gotten ugly enough for Clinton already ?
The pandering gas - tax " holiday , " the painfully insincere disdain for " elites " and " economists " — Clinton is embarrassing herself .
I 'm tired of defending what her campaign has become .
Clinton has always enjoyed strong support among red-state , pickup - truck - driving , working - class voters .
The fact that she felt the need to pander to them with gimmicks like the gas - tax holiday ( as opposed to , say , pandering by drinking beer and eating pancakes , of which both Democratic candidates are guilty ) speaks volumes .
Her " victory " speech in Indiana was the final straw .
She 's desperate , and it shows .
More than anyone at this paper , I 've hated — and if there was a stronger word , I would use it — the sexist , condescending , and just plain despicable treatment of Hillary in the press and by many Obama supporters .
I 've hated it every time they called her a " ball - buster " or a bitch or a fat , lesbian harpy .
I 've hated it every time they 've compared her to a nagging wife , every time they 've blamed her for her husband 's infidelity , every time they 've made fun of her laugh .
And I hated the fact that Hillary was held to a higher standard than any male candidate would ever be held to .
I want to see a competent , liberal , intelligent , tough woman in the White House in my lifetime — and Hillary could 've been that woman .
But it 's time to face facts : Hillary can't win the nomination .
So it 's time , to use Obama 's hackneyed term , for a little " unity . "
Now that it 's clear that Hillary can't win , we need to unite around the Democratic candidate who has won .
Because the Bush administration has been hell and we can't risk four more years of hell .
Because Obama and Clinton agree about more than they disagree about .
And because we 're winning .
As aggravating as this protracted election battle has sometimes felt , it 's engaged a new generation of progressive voters , and it 's given a voice to Americans who want things to change — Americans who want health care , jobs , and an end to Bush 's war in Iraq .
I have concerns about Obama , of course .
I worry that he 's untested , that the red states he 's won in party primaries will go for McCain in the general , and that he is n't up for a knock - down - drag - out battle with one of the toughest assholes in the Republican Party .
But if anything , this drawn - out battle with Hillary Clinton has prepared Obama for the trials to come .
So Hillary has done her job .
Now it 's time to call it a day .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
The AIDS epidemic among African - Americans in some parts of the United States is as severe as in parts of Africa , according to a report out Tuesday .
" AIDS in America today is a black disease , " says Phill Wilson , founder of the Black AIDS institute .
" Left Behind - Black America : A Neglected Priority in the Global AIDS " is intended to raise awareness and remind the public that the " AIDS epidemic is not over in America , especially not in Black America , " says the report , published by the Black AIDS Institute , an HIV / AIDS think tank focused exclusively on African - Americans .
" AIDS in America today is a black disease , " says Phill Wilson , founder and CEO of the institute and himself HIV - positive for 20 years .
" 2006 CDC data tell us that about half of the just over 1 million Americans living with HIV or AIDS are black . "
Although black people represent only about one in eight Americans , one in every two people living with HIV in the United States is black , the report notes .
The report uses just - released data from UNAIDS and existing CDC and Census data to highlight grim statistics :
• AIDS remains the leading cause of death among black women between ages 25 and 34 .
It 's the second - leading cause of death in black men 35 - 44 .

• In Washington , more than 80 percent of HIV cases are among black people , that 's one in 20 residents .
iReport : AIDS in Washington 's older population
" Five percent of the entire population ( in DC ) is infected ... that 's comparable to countries like Uganda or South Africa , " Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN for the recent " Black in America " documentary .
According to this report , if black Americans made up their own country , it would rank above Ethiopia ( 420,000 to 1,300,000 ) and below Ivory Coast ( 750,000 ) in HIV population .
Both Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast are among the 15 nations receiving funds from the President 's Emergency Plan For Aids Relief .
The United States has given about $ 15 billion to PEPFAR nations in the past five years .

What 's your experience being black in America ?
The Black AIDS Institute says it 's not criticizing the federal government for helping poorer countries cope with the AIDS epidemic .
Rather , it 's saying the " AIDS epidemic [ in the U.S. ] is not getting the kind attention that it merits . "

Wilson says more needs to be done to prevent the spread of HIV in this country .

In this report , Wilson and others urge the federal government and private foundations to significantly increase funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs .
The report also calls on international agencies to hold the U.S. government accountable for failure to address HIV / AIDS epidemic in its own country ( despite lauding it for its PEPFAR efforts ) .
It also urges black communities in the United States to fight the stigma and overcome prejudice associated with being infected with HIV .

You might not think the sullen , tattooed teenager skulking around your local record store has anything in common with Winston Churchill , but you would be wrong .
Sir Winston , King George V , and the slaves of ancient Greece — to name a few — all have their place in the colorful history of skin decoration .
For a practice so commonly associated with youth , tattooing is remarkably old , says professor Nina Jablonski , head of Penn State 's anthropology department and author of " Skin : A Natural History . "
" Tattoos have probably been important to people for over 10,000 years , " she notes .
The oldest documented tattoos belong to Otzi the Iceman , whose preserved body was discovered in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991 .
He died around 3300 B.C. , says Jablonski , but the practice of inserting pigment under the skin 's surface originated long before Otzi .
In Japan , tattooing is thought to go back to the Paleolithic era , and tattooed Egyptian mummies — primarily female — have been uncovered dating to the age of the pyramids .
In 1948 , the excavation of Siberian tombs revealed bodies over 2,000 years old decorated with tattoos of animals and mythical beasts .
Egypt 's international trade spread the practice of tattooing to Crete , Greece , and Arabia , and there is a history of tattooing in ancient China , as well as among Celtic and Northern European tribes , such as the Picts — literally " painted people " — and in Samoa and the Polynesian islands , where the word " tatou " originated .
In fact , Jablonski explains , tattooing is as widespread as it is ancient , popping up on every inhabited continent .
With the rise of Christianity , tattooing became increasingly associated with paganism and the criminal class , and was prohibited in Europe under the first Christian Roman emperor , Constantine .
In the late 18th century , the practice of tattooing became popular among British sailors around the time of Captain James Cook 's voyages to Tahiti , and for a time , tattoos were present in the western world mostly on the bodies of seamen returning from the South Pacific .
But the art form experienced a resurgence among the British gentry after King George V and later Edward VII were tattooed ( with a dragon and a cross , respectively ) , and foreign courts followed the British Court 's lead , sparking a rash of tattooed royalty during the nineteenth century .
According to Jablonski , " Tattoos become more socially acceptable because they are visibly sported by people who are themselves socially accepted . "
" People 's reasons for tattooing have varied from place to place , " she adds , " but their central purpose in all places and throughout time has been to convey a message of great significance through a visible symbol . "
In the Middle East , mourners rubbed the ash from funeral pyres into self - inflicted wounds , thereby carrying a piece of the departed with them forever .
Tattoos have long been used as a means of identification :
The Romans tattooed their criminals and slaves , a practice that was adopted by the Japanese in the early 17th century , and the Nazis tattooed numbers on the arms of Jews during the Holocaust to dehumanize concentration camp inmates and identify their corpses .
Despite these grim uses , people today primarily use tattoos to tell their personal stories , as talismans , or to memorialize a loved one .
" Their permanence is their allure , " Jablonski explains .
Today , actor Brad Pitt has an image of Otzi the Iceman tattooed on his arm , and the adoption of the practice by movie stars and sports personalities has taken some of the taboo out of the tattoo .
Still , says Jablonski , tattooing retains its reputation as a subculture identifier , though young people are more likely to view tattoos as just another form of self - expression .
Tattoos have never been as varied in content and design as they are now .
Observes Jablonski , " Classic tattoos will always have a place , but people are increasingly using their bodies to create landscape / bodyscape effects . "
Whatever the direction it takes , tattooing is here to stay .
" Tattoos are part of an ancient and universal tradition of human self - decoration and expression , " she concludes .
" They convey their messages without words and sometimes even long after death . "
Diamonds may be lost or stolen — it 's a tattoo that is forever .

The corporate logo for Freddie Mac is seen at its headquarters building in McLean , Virginia in this July 23 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury is growing increasingly likely to recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the months ahead on the taxpayer ’s dime , Barron ’s reported in its August 18 edition .
The weekly financial newspaper said that such a move could wipe out existing holders of the agencies ’ common stock , with preferred shareholders and even holders of the two entities ’ $ 19 billion of subordinated debt also suffering losses .
An insider in the Bush administration told Barron ’s that Fannie and Freddie “ are being jawboned ” by the Treasury Department and their new regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) , to raise more equity .
But government officials do n’t expect the agencies to succeed , Barron ’s reported .
If the government - sponsored enterprises fail to raise fresh capital , the administration is likely to mount its own recapitalization , with Treasury infusing taxpayer money into the agencies , according to the Barron ’s source .
The paper reported the infusion would take the form of a preferred stock with such seniority , dividend preference and convertibility rights that Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s existing common shares “ effectively would be wiped out , and their preferred shares left bereft of dividends . ”
The report called an equity injection by the government a quasi-nationalization -- without having to put the agencies ’ liabilities on the U.S. balance sheet , and thus doubling the U.S. debt .
After accounting for deferred tax assets and generous asset marks , Fannie and Freddie each may have a negative $ 50 billion in asset value , and little prospect of digging themselves out of the hole , Barron ’s reported .
Rick Boyd used to spend $ 500 a month on gas and tolls commuting 48 miles a day between his home in Westchester County , N.Y. , and his office in Hasbrouck Heights , N.J. Now Boyd does n't commute any more because his company , Chorus , which provides clinical , practice management and financial software for health care providers , has gone virtual .
Chorus closed its Hasbrouck Heights headquarters in early June and its other office , in Stafford , Texas ( outside of Houston ) , in early July .
Now all of the company 's 35 employees and full - time consultants work at home , and for the most part , they love it .
Chorus CIO
Rick Boyd says existing technology made it easy for his company to go virtual .
Boyd , who is Chorus 's CIO , says the company decided to close its offices to save money and spare employees the hassle and rising cost of commuting and because it had the necessary technology to support such a move .
President and CEO A.J. Schreiber says Chorus can continue to serve customers while simultaneously saving $ 400,000 a year simply by closing its 15,000 square feet of office space .
Sure , breaking leases and telecom contracts is costing the company money , but the long - term savings far outweigh those short - term costs , says Schreiber .
" We would n't have done this if it would have had a negative impact on our ability to serve customers , " he adds .
Chorus CEO A.J. Schreiber made the decision to go virtual .
In making the bold move to close its offices and go virtual , Chorus demonstrates the positive bottom - line results that stem from applying workplace flexibility as a business strategy , says Cali Williams Yost , president and founder of consultancy Work + Life Fit .
" Flexibility is a strategy for managing your business , " she says .
" It helps you recruit and retain talent and manage resources like real estate .
There are more and more companies realizing you do n't need to be in the same place every minute of every day . "

The first lesson is that you need the right infrastructure to support a virtual , telecommuting set of employees .
The Infrastructure and Equipment to Support Telecommuting
Marvin Luz had serious concerns about Chorus becoming a virtual company .
The vice president of client services thought the transition was going to be a lot of work , and he wondered how the company would get through it .
" I was a little apprehensive , " says Luz .
" There 's something to be said for being in an office and the security blanket of having your coworkers right next to you if you have questions . "
Foremost on the client services exec 's mind was Chorus 's ability to meet its customers ' needs with a staff of telecommuters .
The company had to figure out how customer support calls would be routed to agents at their homes and in such a way that clients would n't know that the agent to whom they were speaking was working from home .
Chorus already had in place much of the telecommunications infrastructure it would need to support telecommuters , including a firewall and VPN .
In 2007 , CIO Boyd deployed a voice over IP ( VoIP ) solution from Cisco that included Cisco 's IP Communicator and a high - end router in the company 's New Jersey data center , which remains in operation , with staff visiting as needed .
He also added a Windows Active Directory server ( Chorus already had two in its office outside Houston ) and two T1 lines to the New Jersey data center .
Boyd says all of this technology made it easier for Chorus to go virtual .
( For more on the technologies necessary to communicate telecommuters see , " How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Telecommuting . " )
In preparation for the company 's transformation , Boyd and his seven - person staff deployed the IP Communicators on every employee 's laptop .
Employees use the IP Communicators to make and receive phone calls .
The IT department ran into trouble when it first began deploying the IP Communicators on everyone 's laptops .
Because it was new technology for the company , Boyd and his staff were n't sure how to set it up at first .
They were also just coming up to speed on the voice over IP system .
Boyd says the first few deployments of the IP Communicators were very difficult , but once he and his staff got more comfortable with the technology , it went more smoothly .
( They had help from Dynamic Strategies , a New Jersey - based VoIP services provider . )
It took Chorus about three weeks to get all the IP Communicators on everyone 's computers , he says .
To ensure the quality of the phone connections , Boyd and his staff had to give some employees higher - end routers than typical home routers that dedicate a certain amount of bandwidth to employees '
Internet phones , says Boyd .
Most employees already had cell phones , but Chorus put together a policy and expense guidelines for all employees so that they could get BlackBerrys or Windows Mobile - compatible devices to use as a back up in the event their IP Communicator goes down .
( Chorus also supports the new 3G iPhone . )
In addition , Boyd and team created " hunt " groups for each of the support groups : customer support , infrastructure support , application development and business analysts .
So if customer support needs an infrastructure employee to help with a major client issue , the customer support employee dials the extension for the infrastructure team 's hunt group and that number rings out to the entire group and whoever is available can answer the call .
Testing the Work at Home Arrangement and Technology
Before employees began working from home , Chorus tested the telecommuting set - up with Customer Support Account Manager Jairis Galvez .
She worked at home two Fridays in a row , and all of the vice presidents called into her queue to make sure they could hear her , that she could hear them and that there was n't static on the line .
Another technical issue Chorus 's IT department had to address was how far - flung employees would make internal phone calls now that they 're distributed .
When Chorus maintained two offices , employees in Texas and New Jersey could dial four - digit phone numbers to reach each other across the country .
The company found that the four - digit dialing did n't work when each party was logged into the VPN from their home offices .
The firewall ( PIX 506 ) was not capable of allowing a VPN to VPN data transfer so the call would connect but neither party could hear the other .
They had to dial 10 - digit numbers to reach each other .
Boyd discovered that the company 's firewall needed to be upgraded to enable the four - digit dialing so he installed a new Cisco 515 firewall in late June .
Now every employee is just a four - digit dial away .

UP until this week many pundits believed the recent positive news out of Iraq posed a unique problem for Barack Obama , who , despite some recent hedging , has always supported withdrawing American troops from the country .
Would the potential president really tell his generals to end a war that may finally be turning a corner ?
But this week Mr Obama received an unsolicited gift from Nouri al - Maliki , Iraq 's prime minister , who said he 's considering a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops .
Now many are wondering how John McCain might respond to such a declaration from Iraq 's leaders .
So far it 's tough to tell .
In 2004 Mr McCain told the Council on Foreign Relations that if asked to leave , America would have to withdraw .
[ I ] f that scenario evolves then I think it 's obvious that we would have to leave because -- if it was an elected government of Iraq , and we 've been asked to leave other places in the world .
If it were an extremist government then I think we would have other challenges , but I do n't see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the Iraqi government over to the Iraqi people .
But the McCain campaign 's most recent statement was more non-committal .
" Senator McCain has always said that conditions on the ground — including the security threats posed by extremists and terrorists , and the ability of Iraqi forces to meet those threats — would be key determinants in US force levels , " said Randy Scheunemann , Mr McCain 's foreign - policy adviser , avoiding the question .
Mr Maliki has sure put Mr McCain in a box .
The candidate has prided himself on standing firm on Iraq — he has maintained his hawkish stance and criticised those who even utter the word " timetable " .
Moreover , his campaign has attacked Mr Obama 's " constantly shifting positions " on Iraq .
So it would be a difficult political manoeuvre for Mr McCain to respond at all positively to Mr Maliki 's idea .
Meanwhile , Mr Obama might begin to ask a receptive American electorate , " Who is it that wants America to stay in Iraq ? "

See the conversation at BikePortland.org
The cultural clash between Portland bicyclists and motorists took a surreal turn Sunday night when a motorist involved in a confrontation with a cyclist turned out to be a longtime advocate for cycling .
Colin Yates , 47 , was driving with his wife and two teenagers in his family 's green Subaru Legacy when he saw a bicyclist pass him on the left and blow through a stoplight on Southeast 20th Avenue at Belmont Street .
Yates continued driving north on 20th Avenue , through another intersection , until he caught up with the bicyclist .
Yates honked his horn , leaned out his window , and chided the bicyclist for making other cyclists look bad .
Yates , a self - described bike advocate for more than 30 years , told the bicyclist that he was a responsible bike rider who gets upset when he sees fellow riders disobeying traffic signals .
Traffic continued to flow , and the cyclist and Yates both continued north on Southeast 20th , until they were stopped at a red light at Stark Street .
The bicyclist rode up to the driver 's window .
Yates described the man to police as " irritated and aggravated . "
The cyclist was cursing at Yates and yelled at him to get out of the car .
" Let 's go !
You want to go ? " the bicyclist shouted , challenging Yates to a fight .
By now , the bicyclist , Steven McAtee , 31 , was off his wheels .
Yates said McAtee picked up his bike and wielded it like a weapon , smashing it against the Subaru 's hood and windshield .
Yates stepped from his car and told McAtee to back off .
McAtee turned on Yates .
He lifted his bike above his shoulders and struck Yates with it , Yates said .
Yates tried to use his hands to block the blows and then ducked back into his car and attempted to leave .
But McAtee got in front of the Subaru and repeatedly struck the vehicle with his bike , Yates said .
Yates stepped from his car again and was struck five to seven more times with McAtee 's bicycle , police reports say .
Suddenly , out of nowhere , a passer - by knocked McAtee to the ground with one punch .
And , as fast as McAtee hit the ground , nearly a dozen people -- many bicyclists who were riding by and noticed the commotion -- swarmed around Yates , shoving cell phone cameras about a foot from his face and accusing him of roughing up the bicyclist .
To make matters worse , a 9 - 1 - 1 call that came in at 10:10 p.m. was relayed to officers as : " Car hit bicycle , and people yelling . "
Officers found a confusing scene when they arrived .
About 25 to 30 people were gathered , and police described the atmosphere as hostile towards the motorist .
Some witnesses were afraid to speak up for Yates .
One witness on a bicycle told police he did n't want to make a statement at the scene because of the " thugs and bad folks " here , according to the police report .
He later talked to police by phone and gave an account that backed up Yates ' story .
It turns out , police say bicyclist McAtee was both drunk and in the wrong .
And he 's a city employee .
He works for Portland 's transportation department as a building plan examiner .
McAtee was charged with third - degree assault , criminal mischief , driving under the influence of intoxicants and disorderly conduct .
He could not be reached for comment Wednesday .
Police said Yates , who set out the next day on a move to Colorado , had an imprint of a bike chain on his left forearm and grease stains on his shoulder .
News of Sunday night 's confrontation circulated quickly among officers and reached Officer Robert Pickett , the bureau 's unofficial liaison between police and Portland 's biking community .
" It 's almost kind of quintessentially a Portland thing , " Pickett said , after reading the police reports .
Pickett , who said he works to bridge the gap between motorists and cyclists , called the alleged assault and subsequent witness reaction unfortunate .
" It 's too bad there 's an 'us vs. them ' dynamic , " Pickett said .
He asked that witnesses who approach such a scene call police but not rush to get involved .
" We ask them to be a good witness and not jump to conclusions . "

Living in the country , there ’s loads of little field mice living around the place , but even though you know they ’re there , you never get to see them .
For a while my Mum and Dad have spotted some little Mice running around the garden , and my Dad ’s found evidence of them living in our shed ( they ’ve nibbled through his favourite deckchairs ) .
This morning I saw the dog acting weird , she was chasing what looked like a Bee into the flower bed and spazzing around a lot , which she does n’t normally do .
Later on I went to see what the fuss was about and found two little baby field mice !
Look !
* Edit *
I ’m afraid a few hours after I wrote this blog entry , a seagull swooped down caught one of the mice , before flying off with it in it ’s beak .
I ’m a bit gutted , but it ’s the way life goes I suppose .
RIP baby mousy .

A HUGE early Roman settlement unearthed in Cirencester is the most significant historical discovery ever made in the town , archaeologists said this week .
The encampment which covers several hectares , dates back to the late - Iron Age in the 1st century ad , and was likely to have been occupied by the first Roman settlers in Cirencester .
Alongside the exciting discovery at the Kingshill development on the A417 , Oxford Archaeologists unearthed a Bronze Age burial mound dating back to 2,000 bc containing a skeleton .
County archaeologist Charles Parry said when the proposal to build 270 houses and a shop on the land came up his team recommended an excavation to retrieve the town 's lost past .
" It is one of the most significant and interesting sites discovered in Cirencester .
We knew that there was important archaeology there as it is very close to the major road system of the Roman town of Cirencester , " he said .
" There are known to be a scatter of such farmsteads across the Cotswold landscape but what is remarkable is the size of the settlement as it is quite large and the activity on it was unusual . "
The settlement enclosure contains lots of pits probably used for grain storage .
Archaeologists are now trying to find out if the settlement dates back to just before or after the Roman conquest .
Senior project manager at Oxford Archaeology , Ken Welsh said the team of 15 have found evidence suggesting there were round houses there and textile making took place .
So far they have found some loom weights made of stone and pottery and a weaving comb .
Mr Parry said : " This is one of the largest excavations in Cirencester as it covers several hectares .
It seems to have been a settlement which went through various changes over time which is unusual . "
The prehistoric round barrow burial mound found near to the settlement contained a central pit where what is thought to be a male skeleton was found buried with a pottery vessel known as a beaker from the late - Neolithic and early Bronze Age .
An array of prehistoric material has been found at the site including flint from various tools , polished stone axes and tools made from bone and antlers as well as highly decorated pottery .
Mr Welsh , said : " It may have been an area people came back to again and again and perhaps these materials were placed as some type of thanksgiving . "
Oxford Archaeologists are hoping their painstaking research will unearth the history of who may have once lived or worked in the area .
The team , who finish their dig commissioned by Robert Hitchens and Redrow housebuilders tomorrow ( Fri ) , will review all of the finds which will eventually go to Cirencester 's Corinium Museum .
Pictures released by Interpol of man suspected of child sex abuse Interpol has released images from the internet of a man it suspects of sexually abusing young boys .
The international police agency is launching the worldwide appeal because two years of investigations have failed to identify the man .
Pictures showing the man sexually abusing at least three boys were found on the internet , police say .
Last year , images of another suspected paedophile , unscrambled after they were distorted , quickly led to an arrest .
" The law enforcement community around the world has done all it can to find this man who clearly presents a danger to young children , and we are now asking the public to help identify this predator and protect other potential victims from abuse , " said Interpol Secretary General , Ronald Noble , in a statement .
Police first became aware of the suspect two years ago from photos of him found on the computer hard - drive of a man arrested in Norway and later convicted on paedophilia - related charges , the Associated Press reports .
Computer technology revealed the face of the man known as Mr Swirl
The six pictures released by Interpol show a white man , aged about 50 , with thinning grey hair .
It says it has images of the man abusing boys of between approximately six and 10 years old , which it believes were taken in South East Asia in 2000 and 2001 .
" There are at least three child victims that are in the images , but it could be more , " said Kristin Kvigne , of the agency 's people - trafficking division .
' Mr Swirl ' Last October Interpol released pictures of a suspected paedophile who became known as Mr Swirl because his face had originally been disguised on the internet using a digital technique .
Computer technology was used to unscramble the face of the man , who had been seen in dozens of images of abuse .
A 32 - year - old Canadian ex-teacher , Christopher Neil , was soon arrested , and is due to go on trial in Thailand in June .
He denies charges of abusing a nine - year - old boy .
In the present case , the man has not attempted to disguise his identity in the photos .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Ms Kvigne said Interpol had carefully weighed the decision to release the pictures , given the risk that an innocent person might be wrongly identified .
She urged people to contact the police if they recognise the man , and not to take any action on their own .

Belarus is a country of 10 million citizens in the heart of Europe .
Its president , Alexander Lukashenko , has been in power since 1994 , and U.S. Presidential candidate John McCain recently described him as a " brutal dictator " and supports continued U.S. sanctions , imposed in reaction to rigged elections in 2006 .
This September , over 700 international observers will be on hand to monitor new parliamentary elections , and Lukashenko may be trying to warm up to the West .
Here is a look at some recent scenes in and around Belarus .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The first Guantanamo Bay war crimes trial , of Osama bin Laden ’s former driver , can start next week , a federal judge ruled on Thursday , refusing to intervene in the military process backed by President George W. Bush and Congress .
U.S. District Judge James Robertson rejected a request from attorneys for Salim Hamdan , who drove for the al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan , to stop his trial while he challenges the military tribunal system .
Robertson heard more than two hours of arguments from Hamdan ’s lawyers and the Justice Department over whether the trial should be delayed .
It is due to start on July 21 .
Hamdan , a Yemeni , would be the first prisoner tried in the U.S. war crimes court at the Guantanamo naval base in Cuba .
There are about 265 detainees at base ’s prison camp , which was set up in January 2002 to hold terrorism suspects captured after the September 11 attacks by al Qaeda in 2001 .
Most have been held for years without being charged and many have complained of abuse .
Hamdan ’s attorneys said a landmark Supreme Court ruling last month made clear the detainees are entitled to fundamental constitutional rights .
“ Guantanamo once was a constitution - free zone .
It no longer is , ” Georgetown University law professor Neal Katyal , one of the lawyers for Hamdan , said in arguing for a delay .
But the judge sided with the arguments by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John O’Quinn , who said a 2006 law backed by Bush allows such challenges only after a trial takes place .
The Guantanamo trials are the first U.S. war crimes tribunals since World War Two .
They were set up to try non-American captives whom the Bush administration considers “ enemy combatants ” not entitled to the legal protections granted to soldiers and civilians .

Human rights groups have criticized the Guantanamo prison and trial system as inherently unfair .
“ FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS ”
“ We ’re disappointed in the court ’s decision but we look forward to , in the military commissions process , defending Mr. Hamdan , ” said Lt. Cmdr. Brian Mizer , a military defense lawyer .
“ He ’s a driver and a mechanic , not a member of al Qaeda and not guilty of materially supporting terrorism . ”
Mizer said Hamdan ’s trial was “ not going to be full , open and fair as the government has alleged . ”
“ There are fundamental flaws in this system , ” he said .
Army Col. Lawrence Morris , chief prosecutor of the Guantanamo tribunals , said he was pleased with the ruling and that it could mean more prisoners charged more quickly .
“ We had planned to continue forward in any event .
Obviously it gives us more confidence to do so , ” Morris told reporters .
Robertson noted the law authorizing the tribunals allows a prisoner to go to the U.S. Court of Appeals after his trial at the base .
He also cited a recent ruling by the appeals court that another Guantanamo prisoner cannot bring an appeal until after his military tribunal trial has taken place .
Spokesman Erik Ablin said the Justice Department was pleased with the decision and that the government looks forward to presenting its case against Hamdan .
Thursday ’s ruling was the latest in Hamdan ’s lawyers ’ challenge to the tribunal system that Bush created after the September 11 attacks .
Robertson and then the Supreme Court ruled for Hamdan in 2006 , but Bush got the Republican - led Congress to adopt the 2006 legislation establishing the current system .

Buyers Guide How to Choose Best Probiotic :
Even after knowing the top - notch probiotics of great health benefits , you will agree with us that there is a little more you need to understand prior to buying some .
We are always with you No wonder we take you through this buyer ’s guide .
Below is the little more you need to add to your basket .
Multistrain
Multistrain probiotics tend to be more effective as far as symptom relief is concerned .
They work best as our bodies only absorb the strains they want Considering that our food , sleep , stress level , and exercise could change from day to day , it is sensible that our bodies are needful of probiotics on different days .
It is recommended that adults should take probiotics of at least 6 strains .
Some of these strains should be of Bifidobacterium and others be of type Lactobacillus .
Sugar Level
The sugar we consume could hurt our health through a number of ways .
They can cause a yeast infection , contribute to diabetes , decrease immunity , and support the growth of candida .
Whenever you take probiotics with the aim of becoming healthy , it is good to note that adding a lot of sugar will only reduce its benefits .
You should , therefore , avoid any probiotics with lots of sugar .
Probiotic juices and yogurts could be high in sugar and are among the ones to be avoided during medication .
Allergens
It has been proven that probiotics help with allergies .
As such , it would be counterproductive to purchase probiotics containing allergens .
Normally , most probiotics are grown in dairies and as such , they may have traces of milk left in them .
If you are sensitive to dairy , you should take much care .
The most common allergens in powder supplements are soy , wheat , and dairy .
Probiotic yogurts may also tend to have natural / artificial flavors , natural / artificial colors , preservatives , wheat , loads of sugar , carrageenan , and soy .
Please , watch out if you are sensitive to any of these ingredients .
Bottom Line
The devil may not be as black as he is painted .
Whilst some bacteria are harmful , other bacteria and fungi are of great benefit to us .
Take some time and learn about probiotics .
As for now , if you know of anyone suffering from the aforementioned condition , refer them to our top 10 best products and buyer ’s guide .
Together , let us enjoy consuming bacteria .
Enlarge Microsoft appears to be on the right track with Internet Explorer 8 , despite some kinks .
THE BOTTOM LINE THE BOTTOM LINE Internet Explorer 8 www.microsoft.com/ie8
Score : 3 stars ( out of four ) , rating based on Beta 2 software Pro : Private browsing .
Improved search , security and navigation .
Web Slices and accelerator features have potential .
Con : A little sluggish at times .
Many
Web pages do n't fully appear until you click a " compatibility view " button .
Relatively few partners so far for Web Slice and accelerator features .
TALKING TECH TALKING TECH Anonymous
Web browsing , in which your cybertracks are concealed , may be the most attention - grabbing feature in the new Beta 2 release of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 8 .
Microsoft ( MSFT ) is aiming the browser at a wider consumer audience .
But because of the potentially erratic behavior inherent in beta or test software , it will mostly appeal to tech enthusiasts who want to check out the latest features .
Many of those features — private browsing , improved search and better tabbed browsing ( keeping multiple pages open at once in a single window ) — are welcome .
So are so - called accelerators to help you quickly view a map or check a price of some product you 're reading about .
Microsoft is also promising greater security , which seems to come up every time it upgrades its browser .
And the latest IE can reopen tabs you 've closed since launching the browser .
Some features are merely catch - up ; Apple 's Safari browser , for example , has had a version of private browsing for some time .
I encountered some sluggishness testing Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and XP computers .
Microsoft says its new browser is faster than before , but it did n't always feel that way .
IE8 , unlike its predecessor , conforms to the latest Web code standards .
But that meant I sometimes had to click a " compatibility view " button to display full Web pages designed for the IE7 layout .
Here 's a closer exploration of key IE8 features : Private browsing .
You 're shopping online for a present for your spouse or significant other and do n't want them to find out .
Or maybe you do n't want them to find out where you 've been for other reasons ( wink - wink ) .
With " InPrivate " browsing turned on , all traces of the sites you visit are removed from the Web history .
No Web cookies ( small text files that store information on your preferences ) , temporary Internet files ( copies of Web pages you 've viewed ) or user names and passwords are left behind after you close a session .
Internet searches are also kept mum .
You can prevent websites from sharing details about your visit with other sites .
The privacy feature is easily turned on when you click to open any new tab .
Lest you fret about your kids , Microsoft says the feature wo n't override any parental controls set up in Vista .
Address bar .
When you type something in Mozilla 's " Smart Location " ( or " awesome " ) bar , the browser serves up a drop - down list of possible Web destinations based on sites you 've already bookmarked or tagged .
Similarly , when you start typing a URL into the new Internet Explorer , a drop - down list of potential matches appears , based on places you 've already gone .
In IE7 you 'd only get a match if the characters you typed came at the beginning of the URL ( just after " www " ) .
That 's no longer so .
But IE8 does n't go as far as Firefox in making intelligent guesses about where you want to go .
Type " WhiteSox " in Firefox , and you 're transported to the ballclub 's official website .
Typing WhiteSox in IE8 instead brought up a Google page suggesting www.whitesox.com as a possible destination .
Search .
Microsoft has improved the IE8 search box to let partners such as Amazon , Wikipedia , and Yahoo add search suggestions as you type .
It also is working with eBay , Facebook , and others to help you find stuff without many extra clicks .
One way is through ? accelerators ? — clickable buttons that may appear when you highlight text on a page .
You might select an address to map it through Microsoft ?s Live Search service .
Or highlight words to bring up a tool to translate them .
A Facebook accelerator helps you quickly find people or update your profile .
The number of accelerators now is slim ; Microsoft hopes developers will create more .
Another IE8 feature with potential is called ?
Web Slices .?
It lets you monitor information on sites you check frequently , right from the Favorites Bar near the top of the browser .
Say you ?re bidding for a Nintendo Wii on eBay .
You can mouse over the Wii in an eBay search results page and click on the Web Slice icon that appears .
Once in the Favorites Bar it will turn bold when the price changes .
Meanwhile , Mozilla Labs Tuesday unveiled a prototype of an intriguing concept called Ubiquity , which also promises shortcuts to maps , translations and more .
It ?s way early .
But Ubiquity suggests even more dramatic changes are coming for browsers .
Security and stability .
IE7 included an anti-phishing filter to steer you away from bogus websites masquerading as real ones .
IE8 goes further by helping you also avoid sites that distribute malicious software .
And it combats an insidious security vulnerability known as " cross - site scripting " or XSS , which Microsoft says might steal your data , deface a Web page or launch other types of attacks .
IE now posts clearer warnings when you come upon a suspect site ; a can 't - miss - it red border is accompanied by the words " Unsafe Website . "
You can report sites you think are up to no good .
The new browser is also supposed to be more stable .
Microsoft is n't saying it 'll never crash .
But there 's a decent chance a crash will just bring down the tab with the misbehaving page , without causing the browser to shut down entirely .
A handy new tool makes it easy to manage ( and if need be disable ) the mess of add - on software toolbars and plug-ins you may have installed as shortcuts to various tasks .
It seems AOL and AIM instant - messaging toolbars and a RealPlayer download plug - in were slowing down the browser on one of my PCs .
Each toolbar gets a separate " close " button .
I 'm for anything to make browsing safer , more productive , even secretive .
Microsoft appears to be on the right track .
Even if at times Internet Explorer 8 still feels like a work in progress .

Antifascist Calling …
August 21 , 2008
The waning months of the Bush administration can be characterized by an avalanche of changes to long - standing rules governing domestic intelligence operations .
Despite posturing by leading Democrats , including the party ’s presumptive presidential nominee , Sen. Barack Obama , the FISA legislation legalized the Bush administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program and set the stage for further assaults on the right to privacy and dissent .
The revisions proposed by U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and other top administration officials , represent the greatest expansion of executive power since the Watergate era and should been viewed as an imminent threat to already - diminished civil liberties protections in the United States .
The slippery slope towards open police state methods of governance may have begun with the 2001 passage of the USA PATRIOT Act , but recent events signal that a qualitative acceleration of repressive measures are currently underway .
These changes are slated to go into effect with the new fiscal year beginning October 1 , and are subject neither to congressional oversight nor judicial review .
Bush allies in Congress kicked - off the summer with the shameful passage by the House and Senate of the FISA Amendments Act , an unconstitutional domestic spying bill that gutted Fourth Amendment protections .
With broad consensus by both capitalist political parties , the FISA Act eliminates meaningful judicial oversight of state surveillance while granting virtual immunity to law - breaking telecoms .
Despite posturing by leading Democrats , including the party ’s presumptive presidential nominee , Sen. Barack Obama , the FISA legislation legalized the Bush administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program and set the stage for further assaults on the right to privacy and dissent .
Further attacks were not long in coming .
In the last month alone , mainstream media have reported that the FBI illegally obtained the phone records of overseas journalists allegedly as part of a 2004 " terrorism investigation . "
Other reports documented how the Department of Homeland Security asserts the right to seize a traveler ’s laptop and other electronic devices for an unspecified period of time and without probable cause .
Still other reports revealed that the administration has expanded the power of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) to issue " overarching policies and procedures " and to coordinate " priorities " with foreign intelligence services that target American citizens and legal residents .
And on Wednesday , The Washington Post exposed how the federal government has used " its system of border checkpoints to greatly expand a database on travelers entering the country by collecting information on all U.S. citizens crossing by land , compiling data that will be stored for 15 years and may be used in criminal and intelligence investigations . "
Ellen Nakashima writes ,
The disclosure of the database is among a series of notices , officials say , to make DHS ’s data gathering more transparent .
Critics say the moves exemplify efforts by the Bush administration in its final months to cement an unprecedented expansion of data gathering for national security and intelligence purposes .
( " Citizens ’ U.S. Border Crossings Tracked , " The Washington Post , August 20 , 2008 )
The Post also revealed that the information will be linked to a new database , the Non-Federal Entity Data System , " which is being set up to hold personal information about all drivers in a state ’s database . "
Posted at the Government Printing Office ’s website , the notice states that the information may even be shared with federal contractors or consultants " to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records . "
But perhaps the most controversial move towards increasing the federal government ’s surveillance powers were unveiled by the Justice Department in late July .
According to The Washington Post , " a new domestic spying measure … would make it easier for state and local police to collect intelligence about Americans , share the sensitive data with federal agencies and retain it for at least 10 years . "
New rules for police intelligence - gathering would apply to any of the 18,000 state and local police agencies that receive some $ 1.6 billion each year in federal grants .
These proposed changes , as with other administration measures , were quietly published July 31 in the Federal Register .
The McClatchy Washington Bureau reported August 13 , that Mukasey confirmed plans to " loosen post - Watergate restrictions on the FBI ’s national security and criminal investigations , " under cover of improving the Bureau ’s " ability to detect terrorists . "
Marisa Taylor wrote ,
Mukasey said he expected criticism of the new rules because " they expressly authorize the FBI to engage in intelligence collection inside the United States . "
However , he said the criticism would be misplaced because the bureau has long had authority to do so .
Mukasey said the new rules " remove unnecessary barriers " to cooperation between law enforcement agencies and " eliminate the artificial distinctions " in the way agents conduct surveillance in criminal and national security investigations .
( " FBI to Get Freer Rein to Look for Terrorism Suspects , " McClatchy Washington Bureau , August 13 , 2008 )
While the Justice Department ’s draft proposals have been selectively leaked to the media , and DoJ is expected to release its final version of the changes within a few weeks , even then the bulk of these modifications will remain classified on grounds of " national security . "
Under the new regulatory regime proposed by Mukasey , state and local police would be given free rein to target groups as well as individuals , and to launch criminal intelligence investigations based on the " suspicion " that a target is " engaged in terrorism . "
The results of such investigations could be shared " with a constellation of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies , and others in many cases , " according to Post reporters Spencer S. Hsu and Carrie Johnson .
With probable cause tossed overboard , domestic intelligence as envisaged by the Bush Justice Department is little more than a fishing expedition intended to cast a wide driftnet over Americans ’ constitutional rights , reducing guarantees of free speech and assembly to banal pieties mouthed by state propagandists .
These changes are intended to lock - in Bush regime surveillance programs such as warrantless internet and phone wiretapping , data mining , the scattershot issuance of top secret National Security Letters to seize financial and other personal records , as well as expanding a security index of individuals deemed " terrorist threats " by the corporatist state .
Simultaneous with the release of new DoJ domestic spying guidelines , the Bush administration ’s " modernization " of Reagan - era Executive Order 12333 , as The Washington Post delicately puts it , also calls for intensified sharing of intelligence information with local law enforcement agencies .
In addition to consolidating power within the ODNI , E.O. 12333 revisions direct the CIA " and other spy agencies , " in a clear violation of the Agency ’s charter , to " provide specialized equipment , technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel " to state and local authorities .
The latest moves to expand executive power follow close on the heels of other orders and rule changes issued by the Bush regime .
As researcher and analyst Michel Chossudovsky reported in June , the Orwellian National Security Presidential Directive 59 / Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 ( NSPD 59 / HSPD 24 ) , entitled " Biometrics for Identification and Screening to Enhance National Security , " is directed against U.S. citizens .
Chossudovsky wrote ,
NSPD 59 goes far beyond the issue of biometric identification , it recommends the collection and storage of " associated biographic " information , meaning information on the private lives of US citizens , in minute detail , all of which will be " accomplished within the law . "
The directive uses 9/11 as an all encompassing justification to wage a witch hunt against dissenting citizens , establishing at the same time an atmosphere of fear and intimidation across the land .
It also calls for the integration of various data banks as well as inter-agency cooperation in the sharing of information , with a view to eventually centralizing the information on American citizens .
( " Big Brother " Presidential Directive : " Biometrics for Identification and Screening to Enhance National Security , " Global Research , June 11 , 2008 )
Indeed , NSPD 59 / HSPD 24 creates the framework for expanding the definition of who is a " terrorist " to include other categories of individuals " who may pose a threat to national security . "
In addition to al Qaeda and other far - right Islamist terror groups , many of whom have served as a cat ’s paw for Western intelligence agencies in the Middle East , Central and South Asia , and the Balkans , NSPD 59 / HSPD 24 has identified two new categories of individuals as potential threats : " Radical groups " and " disgruntled employees . "
In other words , domestic anarchist and socialist organizations as well as labor unions acting on behalf of their members ’ rights , now officially fall under the panoptic lens of federal intelligence agencies and the private security contractors who staff the 16 separate agencies that comprise the U.S. " intelligence community . "
These moves represent nothing less than an attempt by the Bush administration to return to the days of COINTELPRO when the Bureau , acting in concert with state and local police " red squads " targeted the left for destruction .
" After 9/11 , the gloves come off "
Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the U.S. national security state has ramped - up its repressive machinery , targeting millions of Americans through broad surveillance programs across a multitude of state and private intelligence agencies .
While the FBI , CIA , NSA , the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) may be the federal " tip of the spear " of current intelligence operations , they certainly are not alone when it comes to domestic spying .
Outsourced contractors from communications , defense and security corporations such as AT&T , Booz Allen Hamilton , Lockheed Martin , Boeing , Verizon Communications , Northrop Grumman , Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) , L - 3 Communications , CACI International and many more , have collaborated with Bush regime war criminals in fashioning a hypermodern , high - tech police state .
That these corporations have staked - out " homeland security " as a niche market to expand their operations has been explored by Antifascist Calling in numerous articles .
As I have previously reported , it is estimated that some 70 % of the personnel employed by U.S. intelligence agencies are now private contractors holding top secret and above security clearances .
Unaccountable actors virtually beyond congressional scrutiny , outsourced intelligence agents first and foremost are employees answerable to corporate managers and boards of directors , not the American people or their representatives .
Chiefly concerned with inflating profit margins by overselling the " terrorist threat , " the incestuous relationships amongst corporate grifters and a diminished " public sector " demonstrate the precarious state of democratic norms and institutions in the U.S .
New rules governing FBI counterintelligence investigations will allow the Bureau to run informants for the purpose of infiltrating organizations deemed " subversive " by federal snoops .
Many of the worst abuses under COINTELPRO , the CIA ’s Operation CHAOS and the U.S. Army ’s deployment of Military Intelligence Groups ( MIGs ) for illegal domestic operations during the 1960s , employed neofascists as infiltrators and as nascent death squads .
While the Bureau may have eschewed close collaboration with fascist gangs , will sophisticated , high - tech private security corporations now play a similar role in Bureau counterintelligence and domestic security operations ?
If history is any judge , the answer inevitably will be " yes . "
Currently equipping the " intelligence community " with electronic specialists , network managers , software designers and analysts , will defense and security corporations bulk - up the Bureau and related agencies with " plausibly deniable " ex-military and intelligence assets for targeted infiltration and " disruption " of domestic antiwar and anticapitalist groups ?
It ca n’t happen here ?
Why its happening already !
As investigative journalist James Ridgeway revealed in April , a private security firm ,
organized and managed by former Secret Service officers spied on Greenpeace and other environmental organizations from the late 1990s through at least 2000 , pilfering documents from trash bins , attempting to plant undercover operatives within groups , casing offices , collecting phone records of activists , and penetrating confidential meetings .
According to company documents provided to Mother Jones by a former investor in the firm , this security outfit collected confidential internal records –donor lists , detailed financial statements , the Social Security numbers of staff members , strategy memos — from these organizations and produced intelligence reports for public relations firms and major corporations involved in environmental controversies .
( " Cops and Former Secret Service Agents Ran Black Ops on Green Groups , " Mother Jones , April 11 , 2008 )
The firm , Beckett Brown International ( later called S2i ) provided a range of services for corporate clients .
According to Ridgeway , the private snoops engaged in " intelligence collection " for Allied Waste ; conducted background checks and " performed due diligence " for the Carlyle Group ; handled " crisis management " for the Gallo wine company and Pirelli ; engaged in " information collection " for Wal - Mart .
Also listed as BBI / S2i records as clients were Halliburton and Monsanto .
Mike German , a former FBI agent and whistleblower who is now the policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union , said that once proposed changes are implemented , police may collect intelligence even when no underlying crime is suspected .
This is nothing less than " preemptive policing " and a recipe for tightening the screws on dissent .
The Post averred ,
German , an FBI agent for 16 years , said easing established limits on intelligence - gathering would lead to abuses against peaceful political dissenters .
In addition to the Maryland case [ that targeted antiwar and death penalty opponents ] , he pointed to reports in the past six years that undercover New York police officers infiltrated protest groups before the 2004 Republican National Convention ; that California state agents eavesdropped on peace , animal rights and labor activists ; and that Denver police spied on Amnesty International and others before being discovered .
" If police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the CIA , they will be encouraged to collect more information , " German said .
" It turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government . "
( Spencer S. Hsu and Carrie Johnson , " U.S. May Ease Police Spy Rules , " The Washington Post , August 16 , 2008 )
In a related report on Fusion Centers , that German coauthored with Jay Staley for the ACLU , they documented how so - called " counterterrorist " national collection agencies are " characterized by ambiguous lines of authority , excessive secrecy , troubling private - sector and military participation , and an apparent bent toward suspicionless information collection and data mining . "
As I reported earlier this month , citing research from German and Staley ’s report , U.S. Marine Corps officers , enlisted personnel and an analyst with U.S. NORTHCOM , pilfered intelligence files and shared them with private defense contractors in hope of securing future employment .
Money talks , particularly in a political culture where the business of government is , after all , business !
With little oversight from a compliant Congress , and an " opposition " party in league with their " constituents " –multinational corporate grifters out to make a buck –the final nails are being hammered into the coffin of America ’s former democratic Republic .

UK economy : UK may already be in recession , with inflation twice as high as claimed , says Major
John Major yesterday mingled " human sympathy " for Gordon Brown 's embattled prime ministership with a warning that Britain may already be in a recession , with inflation " between 8 % and 10 % " - more than double the official figure .
In a rare public appearance , the former Conservative prime minister , who inherited 14 % interest rates and 9.5 % inflation from Margaret Thatcher in 1990 , admitted that current economic circumstances were not as bad as those in the recession he presided over - the price the country paid for Thatcher 's 1980s boom , he admitted .
But his sympathy for Brown - markedly kinder than he often was towards Tony Blair - did not extend to fully endorsing No 10's claim that current problems are due to imported global forces , notably rising food and commodity prices , especially oil .
Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if he felt glee at Brown 's problems , he replied : " No , no , no , no .
No .
Well , I hope it 's human sympathy .
I have very strong disagreements with many of the things politically that Gordon Brown has done .
But he 's doing an extremely difficult job .
" He 's doing it in extremely difficult circumstances .
They may be partially of his making .
But it 's not helpful to the country or anybody else to have some of the comment about him that there has been . "
Major singled out Brown 's decision as chancellor to separate the regulatory functions of the Bank of England as partly responsible for rising inflation and the crisis at Northern Rock , and endorsed David Cameron 's " rainy day " complaint that Labour had not put aside money during the good years .
" They certainly can't cut taxes because they have such a big fiscal deficit .
They can't increase public spending because they 've already spent the money we would normally use , " Major told Marr .
" It 's quite extraordinary that over 10 years in which the world has had the most benign economic circumstances for a very long time , we have run up such a huge fiscal deficit . "
He said the UK 's trade deficit was " about between 50 and 60 times higher than it was in 1997 " .
But what may be Major 's most damning contribution was his support for claims that neither of the two official measures of inflation , the consumer price index ( CPI ) and the retail prices index ( RPI ) , now reflects real inflation as it affects ordinary people on average incomes , because the CPI excludes key items such as housing .
" I would say inflation is probably double the RPI figure , so we 're between 8 % and 10 % , " Major claimed .
Roy Den Hollander is a Manhattan lawyer and a self - described antifeminist .
Over the past year , he has sued Manhattan nightclubs for favoring women by offering ladies ’ night discounts and has sued the federal government over a law that protects women from violence .
And now Columbia University has come within his sights .
On Monday , he filed a lawsuit in United States District Court in Manhattan against Columbia for offering women ’s studies courses , which Mr. Den Hollander sees as discriminatory toward men .
His class - action suit accuses Columbia of using government aid to preach a “ religionist belief system called feminism . ”
A Columbia University spokesman , Robert Hornsby , said he could not comment on the lawsuit or even confirm that the university had been served with it .
In Mr. Den Hollander ’s suit , he called women ’s studies “ a bastion of bigotry against men ” and said its women ’s studies program “ demonizes men and exalts women in order to justify discrimination against men based on collective guilt . ”
Such academic programs at Columbia and at universities nationwide , he said , are “ spreading prejudice and fostering animosity and distrust toward men with the result of the wholesale violation of men ’s rights due to ignorance , falsehoods and malice . ”
“ Federal financial aid , state funds and other assistance help proselytize feminism at Columbia , ” in violation of equal protection safeguards of the Fifth and 14th Amendments , claimed Mr. Den Hollander , who said , “ Columbia has thrown its influence and prestige into violating the rights of men by offering a women ’s studies program but no men ’s studies program . ”
Mr. Den Hollander devotes much of his private practice to representing men in civil cases — “ antifeminist cases or guys ’ - rights cases , ” as he puts it – and said his bitter 2001 divorce from a woman he married in Russia helped tweak his anger toward feminists and laws he sees as favoring women .
In July 2007 , Mr. Den Hollander filed a class- action suit against prominent Manhattan nightclubs like Copacabana , China Club , Lotus and Sol , claiming they discriminated against men with their ladies ’ nights offering free or reduced admission , which violate the 14th Amendment ’s guarantee of equal protection under the law , the suit said .
In February 2008 , he filed a suit against the federal government calling parts of the Violence Against Women Act unconstitutional .
Those cases are still pending .
Mr. Den Hollander said that today ’s lawsuit completes a “ trilogy of antifeminist lawsuits . ”
Looking for a bargain ?
Hoping to graduate from college with a minimum of debt and still wind up with a first rate education ?
Here are 10 great schools , public and private , where you can get an outstanding education and still pay less than $ 25,000 in tuition per year .
1. St. Mary ’s College of Maryland , St. Mary ’s City , Maryland
St. Mary ’s is a honors college , which means that every student in the school is an honors student .
Since it ’s a state school , tuition is affordable .
Yet with only 1,850 students and super low 13:1 faculty student ratio , the experience is more like a liberal arts college than a public university .
2. Christopher Newport University , Newport News , Virginia
If there was a list of “ most improved ” schools , this small public university in southeastern Virginia would be high on the list .
Once known as everybody ’s safety school , CNU recently has undergone a $ 400 million facelift .
SAT scores are up 200 points , enrollment is up 400 percent , and the facilities are among the nicest in the nation .
3. Rice University , Houston , Texas
All right , this is cheating a little bit , a year of tuition at Rice will run you $ 25,606 a year .
But since The Princeton Review calls Rice the # 1 Best Value Private College in the United States , it ’s worth mentioning .
With about 3,000 students , this liberal arts university has an incredible faculty student ratio of only 5:1 !
4. New College of Florida , Sarasota , Florida
If you ’re in state , tuition at this Florida honors college will only run you about $ 4,000 a year ( and about $ 23,000 out of state ) .
The Princeton Review calls this innovative place the # 1 Best Value Public School in the United States .
It ’s pretty darn competitive too – the average GPA of incoming freshmen is over a 3.9 .
5. San Francisco State University , San Francisco , California
SFSU is the quintessential urban school experience –excitement , diversity , great teaching , and students who are politically and academically engaged .
And the best part–it ’s in San Francisco !
In state tuition is only about $ 2,500 a year , and out of state tuition is only about $ 12,500 .
6. University of Minnesota - Morris , Morris , Minnesota
Located in Morris , MN , this public liberal arts school has an enrollment of about 1,600 students and is an absolute bargain , compared to the many pricey private liberal arts schools in Minnesota .
Tuition for both in and out of state students is under $ 9,000 .
7. University of Denver , Denver , Colorado
DU may be one of Colorado ’s best kept secrets .
Located south of downtown Denver , this competitive private university is home to about 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students–and tuition runs about $ 21,000 a year .
8. Wayne State University , Detroit , Michigan
Yeah , it ’s located in a not - so - great area of Detroit , but this school of 20,000 students has a reputation for being one of the best state universities in the United States .
9. Marymount Manhattan College , New York , New York
A bargain college on the Upper East Side of Manhattan ?
Absolutely !
With an 11:1 faculty student ratio and an outstanding communication program , this school of 2,000 undergrads and a $ 21,000 a year price tag is more exciting than a sale at Manolo Blahnik .
10 . Thomas Aquinas College , Santa Paula , California
This incredibly unique Catholic school has no textbooks , lectures , or majors–and no big price tag either .

Email from Acting Registrar Dean Logan Says Poll Workers Entered Incorrect Ballot Codes into E-Voting System
Brad Friedman Byon
6/12/2008 , 9:01 pm PT
Last week I reported in great detail that four out of the twelve votes I 'd cast on my ballot on L.A. County 's e-voting system , during California 's state primary on June 3rd , were flipped to candidates that I had n't voted for .
The ES&S InkaVote Plus system printed my ballot incorrectly .
I was voting on the audio ballot voting system meant primarily for blind and visually - impaired voters .
Had I not been able to inspect my ballot visually after it had printed --- for example , had I been blind --- I would never have known that I was about to cast votes for candidates that I had not selected .
Because the " disabled - accessible " e-voting system at my own precinct was not working , again , for the second election in a row , I was told I 'd have to cast a provisional ballot on the " disabled - accessible " e-voting system at the other " precinct , " in the same polling place , in the same room , as my own " precinct . "
The machine had been down all day , and nobody had come out to replace or repair it , even though the county had been called early in the day and told about the problem .
Last election , on Super Tuesday , the machine was also broken , and none of the poll workers would touch it , due to exposed wires .
This time , despite asking to vote in a specific party 's open primary , I was given a non-partisan audio ballot to compound the fiasco when I tried to vote provisionally on the other " precinct 's " e-voting system that was up and running , even though not a single voter had used it in either this , or the previous election .
The voting went smoothly enough --- even if it took 20 minutes to move through the short audio ballot , shorter than usual because it was a state primary , and because I was n't allowed to vote in partisan races for some reason --- at least until it misprinted my selections , which I had confirmed as correct while actually moving through the audio selections .
Luckily , after noticing that the e-voting system had printed my ballot incorrectly , I was allowed to VOID that ballot , and this time chose to vote on a regular , hand - marked paper ballot instead .
My hand filled in the ballot far more accurately than the computer did .
That night , I alerted officials at the CA Sec. of State 's office and L.A. County 's acting Registrar of Voters , Dean Logan , about the problem , and the machines and ballots in question were isolated for testing .
Whether someone who was n't a loud , muckracking journalist , specializing in issues of election integrity , would have had that kind of quick service , I can't tell you .
Logan promised the machine would be tested , and the SoS office promised to follow the testing closely .
Earlier this week , Logan sent me an update via email , with photos , on what the investigation had so far found .
The problem , Logan wrote , is being attributed to the " human error " of the poll workers who , he says , entered incorrect information into the e-voting system when setting up my ballot for me to vote .
Logan 's complete email , detailing the findings of the cursory investigation to date , follows below , along with my email in response to it .
As you 'll see , the all - too de rigueur " human error " excuse does not sit well with me ...

Monday , June 09 , 2008 1:14 PMBrad FriedmanEvan L. Goldberg ; Lowell FinleyRE : Report on flipped InkaVote Plus votes Mr. Friedman --
Brief update :
As indicated last week , we have identified and secured the InkaVote Plus devices and other voting materials from your polling place at our Election Operations Center ( photos attached ) .
Based on your report and photographs , our staff has conducted an initial assessment and review of what occurred .
Our preliminary assessment is that what occurred was the result of human error in selecting and entering the ballot code and party selection when setting up the Audio Ballot Booth for your use .
As a result you were presented a ballot with a ballot group designation that did not match the voting location / precinct you were in .
This would account for a different rotation of candidate names from the rotation listed on your sample ballot and in the voting booths at your poll site .
Using the photographs in your report , we were able to identify the incorrect ballot code printed on the VOIDED audio ballot slip and to match your selections to the rotation associated with the incorrect ballot code that was used .
The incorrect ballot code and party identification also likely explain the reason you were not presented the partisan contests you requested as provisional ballot status should not affect your ability to cast a partisan ballot .
Had your voted audio ballot been inserted into the Precinct Ballot Reader ( PBR ) after it printed from the Audio Ballot Booth , it would have been rejected based on the incorrect ballot group identification and further action should have been taken to ensure the correct ballot was issued .
In your case , however , since you were voting provisionally , procedures would have called for your ballot to be returned in a provisional ballot envelope for confirmation of voter eligibility .
Once verification occurred , the audio ballot slip would have been duplicated to the correct ballot group format for the precinct in which you are registered to vote .
Properly conducted , that process would have resulted in your selections being recorded and counted as you intended .
While preliminary indications are that this was not a system failure - rather , it appears to have been a process and training deficiency - it is clearly an issue that must be addressed .
The complexity of the situation is further complicated by the variables and multiple party ballots associated with our Primary .
Many of these factors will not apply in the November General Election .
Your experience shows , however , that they do need to be improved for future primaries in which the InkaVote Plus system is used .
Once our review and investigation is complete , we will demonstrate what occurred and show how the instructions were intended to be carried out .
This email is intended as an update only .
A detailed report of these findings and an explanation of their impact will be prepared as part of our continuing review and investigation into the issues raised in your report .
Additional review and analysis needs to be completed to ensure we have been thorough and complete in our investigation and findings .
We will keep you informed of our progress .
I hope this information is helpful .

Acting Registrar - Recorder / County Clerk
Los Angeles County
My response to Logan 's letter follow below ...

Subject : RE : Report on flipped InkaVote Plus votes Brad FriedmanMonday , June 09 , 2008 1:14 PMDean LoganEvan L. Goldberg ; Lowell FinleyRE : Report on flipped InkaVote Plus votes Dean -
The information provided in your update / response , including photos , is very much appreciated .
I look forward to the final determination and confirmation of what went wrong in the L.A.
County voting system when I voted during the recent primary .
It 's especially troubling , of course , because , according to your description of the problem , it would never have been noticed by a vision - impaired voter for whom the system I voted on was generally supposed to serve .
The only reason I was able to notice the failure was because I was able to visually ( and very closely ) examine the computer - printed ballot to determine it had mis-printed my intended votes .
If I understand your explanation , then it seems my incorrectly printed ballot --- since I was forced to vote provisionally --- would not have been noticed by anyone to have included four candidates for whom I did not vote .
While you suggest the failure , attributed to " human error " , would have been caught had the ballot gone through the normal precinct - based op - scan procedure , mine would not have been noticed to have been incorrect because I was forced to vote provisionally , despite appearing accurately on the voter rolls and despite my own " precinct " being across the room from where I was forced to vote .
If your description of the problem is accurate , then it sounds like poll workers at any of L.A. County 's more than 4000 precincts would have the ability to enter in codes for virtually any precinct ( and / or ballot rotation ) when they set up a voter to begin voting on the ES&S audio ballot system .
If that is the case , it raises a number of serious questions and concerns .
For a start , it seems like this is a recipe for fraud .
Particularly when the voter in question would usually be a visually - impaired orblind voter and would have no way to know that a poll worker has set them up to vote in a way that the audio tells them they are voting one way , but the computer - printed ballot results in different selections , unknown to the voter .
Why was I forced to vote provisionally , simply because the machine at my " precinct " --- across the room , in the same polling place --- was not in service all day ?
Since it was in the same room ( polling place ) , and the federal Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) only requires a single " disabled - accessible " voting device in each polling place , and since the machine could have had a code entered to match my real " precinct " ( across the room ) , why should I , or any other voter have to vote provisionally in such a case ?
As you know , provisional ballots are not counted at the same rate as " normal " ballots , and as further information from your note mentions , such ballots are then ( incredibly ) " duplicated " by hand , by some unknown poll worker at county headquarters before they are ever even counted .
Since this was the second election in a row where the " disabled - accessible " ES&S voting device at my precinct was out of service the entire day , and since nobody used any of those machines at my polling place in either of those two elections other than me , would n't it be a better use of tax payer money to have a single machine serving all precincts at a single polling place ?
While you would still be following the letter of the law , the second machine could then be used for a backup at the polling place , since obviously these things break down frequently ( or never work at all from the moment they were set up , as was the case in my own precinct in two elections in a row ) ?
Doing so would help to ensure that disabled voters would have a better chance of being able to cast their vote without being forced to do so provisionally .
I am exceedingly disturbed to hear that --- had my provisional ballot gone through as it was supposed to , and had " verification " of my eligibility to vote occurred --- someone at election headquarters , who I do not know , and who I could not oversee to assure they were doing it correctly , was going to " duplicate [ my ballot ] to the correct ballot group for the precinct in which [ I am ] registered to vote .
" I hope you 'll forgive my dubiousness that whether " Properly conducted " or not , and despite your assurance that " that process would have resulted in your selections being recorded and counted as you intended , " there is absolutely no way for either me or you to know that as a fact .
Nothing personal , but no , I do not trust a poll worker to " duplicate " my ballot properly by hand and I should not have to do so .
Such a system is rife with the possibility for " human error " and / or fraud and , frankly , I take it as a personal affront that someone would " duplicate " my ballot before it is ever counted .
I hope you will take a very serious look at that appalling practice prior to November , as it seems to me to be an outrageous and offensive practice , on a number of levels .
I look forward to your thoughts on the above , and I thank you again for the seriousness with which you have approached this unfortunate and disturbing matter .
I also look forward to participating in the actual testing of your theory as to what went wrong as I requested previously .
On a final note , you should know that the poll workers at my polling place were exceedingly hard working , helpful and very engaged in the process .
I 'm troubled that , once again , it seems this failure may ultimately --- and inappropriately , in my opinion --- be attributed to the " human error " of the poll workers .
Time and again , in virtually every one of the thousands of instances of voting system failures similar to the one I encountered , and which occur with frightening regularity across the country , such failures are attributed to ' lack of ' or ' poor training of poll workers .
'
You described it as a " process and training deficiency . "
As I have pointed out time and again --- including in the testimony [ PDF ]
I was recently invited to give to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) --- we need to implement simple , transparent voting systems that do not require patriotic , over - worked and under - paid poll workers to also be rocket scientists .
We need to stop blaming them for the failures of the systems we have forced them to use .
I would suggest that it's not the dedicated poll workers who are under - trained , but rather the voting systems , such as the one we use in Los Angeles County , that are overly - complicated .
If there is a " deficiency " anywhere , might I suggest we look firstat the voting machine companies --- in this case , ES&S --- who have provided us with voting systems that fail miserably , time and again , to meet the simple , specific , mission - critical purpose for which they were supposedly designed , at the cost of billions of L.A. County , California and federal tax - payer dollars .
Respectfully ,
Brad
We have shown that register allocation can be viewed as solving a collection of puzzles .
We model the register file as a puzzle board and the program variables as puzzle pieces ; pre-coloring and register aliasing fit in naturally .
For architectures such as x86 , SPARC V8 , and StrongARM , we can solve the puzzles in polynomial time , and we have augmented the puzzle solver with a simple heuristic for spilling .
For SPEC CPU2000 , our implementation is as fast as the extended version of linear scan used by LLVM , which is the JIT compiler in the openGL stack of Mac OS 10.5 .
Our implementation produces Pentium code that is of similar quality to the code produced by the slower , state - of - the - art iterated register coalescing algorithm with an extension by Smith , Ramsey , and Holloway from 2004 .
A tutorial on Register Allocation by Puzzle Solving is available at tutorial .
Full version of the paper :
This is the full version of our paper .
The appendices contain the proofs of the theorems stated in the main body of the paper , plus more detailed pseudo - code for the register assignment phase , with spilling and coalescing .
I will use this page to share our " discoveries " with other researchers .
Mostly I will provide links for the documents that we write , and for part of the implementation .
The code of our puzzle solver is available in this page .
The puzzle based register allocator is able to pass all the tests that LLVM 's default algorithm does .
My implementation needs some more fine tuning though .
There are room for optimizations in the spilling and coalescing heuristics , and also I believe it is possible to speed up the implementation a little bit .
Well , so , why should one see register allocation as a puzzle ?
Because that is a very elegant and powerful abstraction !
It allows the register allocation to find an exact register assignment for an architecture as complex as x86 !
That is , if it is possible to find a register assignment that does not cause spilling , a puzzle based allocator will find one .
That was an open problem until now .
We found the largest known class of graphs that admit solution for classic NP - complete problems , such as pre-coloring extension and 2 - weighted coloring .
Furthermore , I really do not think anyone has ever studied the problem of register allocation at this level of granularity .
Appel and George [ Appel01 ] described a live range splitting strategy that allows optimal register assignment .
The same has been done by Sarkar and Barik [ Sarkar07 ] : they defined an optimal linear scan algorithm that relies on live range splitting .
However , Appel and Sarkar do not describe any treatment for registers of different sizes .
Our result is even more surprising if one consider that given an interval graph , the problem of finding an optimal 2 - weighted coloring for it is NP - complete .
And , what can be accomplished from puzzles ?
Many things , I would say .
The optimal assignment is very good at keeping variables in registers .
The number of heuristics that can be added on top of puzzles is virtually unbounded , and this formalism is easy to understand .
Currently we have one particular implementation .
It does not mean that our algorithm is the definitive one .
Puzzles can be used , for example , to increase the precision of the ILP model of Appel and George , or the register assignment strategy of Sarkar and Barik .
Furthermore , a puzzle solver can be very fast .
I am not an expert in C++ , but our implementation of the puzzle solver , at least when compiling big programs , has about the same compilation time than LLVM 's default algorithm , and mind that this is a JIT compiler used in the industry !
I really think that a more careful implementation , aware of good data structures and special cases could boost the velocity of the current program that we have .
Not all the patterns that can make puzzles occur in real architectures .
I believe that , if the implementation is aware of these forbidden cases , it can be coded to run faster .
One feature that was remarkably helpful during the implementation was the type - system for register allocators that we submit to SAS '07 .
The debugger is really , really helpful .
I think that without the type - system , I would never be able to finish the implementation .
I have the debugger implemented in java , and there is a jar file available here .
You can use it with the command
java - classpath=TypeChecker.jar typeChecker .TypeCheckApp < file
References
And if you want to know more about the type inference engine that we use , you can read our paper .
In order to use the debugger , you must convert the output of your allocator to sMIRA , a language for describing register allocation directives .
It is really worth the trouble : whoever has implemented a register allocator knows how hard is to find errors when they are present .
The result of a bad allocation can surface many instructions past the problematic point , and the developer has no clues of what is going on with the code .
Finding such errors is a nightmare .
But with the debugger , it is as easy as it can be : the type - checker points the problematic instructions , and gives some hints of what may be happening , e.g a register is being redefined while the value that it uses is still alive , etc .
But , be aware : the debugger is not yet 100 % done .
I still have to improve the error messages , to make them more intuitive and helpful .
Yet , the debugger was really useful to me .
Oklahoma official defends comic linking gays to Satan David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008

This A county commissioner who is running for re-election in Oklahoma City is defending the virulently anti-gay comic he sent to local Republicans by insisting that the " homosexual agenda " is an issue in the campaign .
In the comic , which Commissioner Brent Rinehart created along with a friend , a devil threatens a small child with a pitchfork , saying " If I can get the kids to believe homosexuality is normal ! " while an angel yells , " Not with Brent around you won't ! " CNN 's John Roberts spoke to Rinehart , who told him , " One person 's mud-slinging , I guess , is another man 's issues .
... I believe the homosexual agenda is an issue in this campaign .
... I thought that it was a very good campaign piece . "
" Are you homophobic ? " Roberts asked .
" I 'm not even sure as to what ' homophobic ' means , " Rinehart replied , " but let 's just keep in mind that we are in a cultural war . "
Rinehart refused to acknowledge that his comic could be considered gay - bashing .
He insisted , " We have an attorney general here in the state of Oklahoma that has used his office for political means , filed campaign charges against me , and it 's based on my opposition to the homosexual agenda .
...
The attorney general , Mr. Drew Edmondson , sued the Boy Scouts of America because they would not allow homosexual boy scout leaders as leaders . "
Attorney General Edmondson appears in Rinehart 's comic holding a sign saying , " Gay rights now ! "
A caption explains that " Drew Edmondson put Oklahoma on record to force the Boy Scots to accept homosexuals as scout leaders , a pedifile 's [ sic ] dream come true . "
" A drowning man tends to thrash about ,  was Edmondson 's only comment on Rinehart 's comic .
" This is one of the strangest things I 've ever seen , " noted political science professor Keith Gaddie .
" I 've never seen a comic book with the phrase ' anal sodomy ' in it before .
...
He 's pretty much grinding every ax he's got from his days in the county commission . "
County Assessor Leonard Sullivan stated , " I 've really encouraged him on more than one occasion to get professional help .
He really needs it . "
Rinehart is facing a difficult re-election battle , in large part because of his questionable purchasing decisions and other actions .
Attorney General Edmondson filed felony campaign finance charges against him last year , accusing him of perjury , conspiracy , and money laundering in connection with his 2004 campaign .
It has also been suggested that Rinehart " is pushing a road and bridge improvement project ... to help Del City developer Ray Pelfrey who is building a new home next to the road and once held the mortgage on Rineharts home . "
" Is this some desperate and weird attempt at payback against the attorney general ? " Roberts asked .
" It 's getting a message out , " Rinehart insisted .
" It 's telling a story of how I got to where I 'm at .
...
It exposes Drew Edmondson for his true agenda .
...
It exposes others here in county government for their true agenda .
...
When I ran for county commissioner , my agenda was roads and bridges , limited government and less taxation , and family values .
... I 've stuck to my guns .
... I 'm not going to back down . "

Americans who prefer to fly without showing ID will be turned away by airport security beginning June 21 , unless they can convince screeners that their driver 's license or passport has been lost , according to a Transportation Security Administration policy change announced on Friday .
The TSA describes the identification rule change as the " latest in a series designed to facilitate travel for legitimate passengers while enhancing the agency 's risk - based focus – on people , not things . "
While signs in the nation 's airports already say that identification is required , that 's not the current rule .
Wired.com watched two years ago when DHS adviser Jim Harper flew home from San Francisco to
Washington , D.C. , after handing his license to this reporter .
That worked because , under the current regulations , travelers who do n't wish to show identification can opt for extra-screening instead , under secret rules made public in a case brought by civil libertarian John Gilmore .
Gilmore sought to overturn the requirement on constitutional grounds , but lost when the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Americans have a right to travel , just not necessarily by plane .
In practice , many TSA employees and supervisors do not know the ID - or - extra - search rule ( it is , after all , a secret ) , and act flummoxed when they encounter a passenger who says they prefer not to show ID .
Under the new rules , passengers who " lost " their ID can expect to be hand - screened , have their bags searched and – according to the release – undergo " interviews with behavior detection or law enforcement officers . "
Which is to say , that the TSA has essentially decided it wo n't tolerate people who challenge their authority or like to travel without showing their papers .
" If you say you lost your ID or have misplaced it or do n't have a passport or driver 's license and are cooperative and explain the circumstances , you will be subject to secondary screening , " TSA spokeswoman Carrie Harman said .
Harman said she had no statistics on the number of people who actually fly without showing identification , and said the policy change was about TSA 's increased focus on identifying threatening people , rather than things .
Despite the looming change in policy , the TSA has still yet to close the large security loophole , which allows someone to bypass the no-fly list by buying a ticket under another name , check in online , then getting through security with a second , fake boarding pass bearing their real name .
This hack was most recently brought to light by security researcher Christopher Soghoian , whose home was raided by the FBI after he created an online fake boarding pass generator to bring attention to the hole .
Now , travelers who wish to fly without identification will have to dissemble about their motives or lie about having identification on their person .
Additionally , the new policy explicitly requires ID - less fliers to be " cooperative . "
The new policy certainly is a good way to enforce obsequiousness to authority , but it 's got nothing to do with security .
In fact , if the TSA 's extra-screening processes are any good , people who currently fly without ID get more scrutiny than the large majority of those with identification .
THREAT LEVEL would like to give the TSA some credit , however .
At least , they announced the rule .
The ID - or - extra - search rule it supersedes was considered " sensitive security information , " and was even described by the government in a court filing as unchallengeable since it was a " law enforcement technique , " not a rule .

Daily satellite images of Greenland ’s glaciers reveal the break - up of two of its largest glaciers in the last month .
A massive 11 - square - mile piece broke off the Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland between July 10th and by July 24th .
That ’s half the size of Manhattan .
Between 2000 and 2001 the same glacier lost 33 square miles of floating ice .
What worries researchers from the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University is what appears to be a massive crack further upstream .
A break - up there would doom 60 square miles , or one - third of what ’s left of the massive ice field .
An 11 square mile area of the Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland ( 80 ˚N , 60 ˚W ) broke away between July 10th and by July 24th .

Meanwhile , the margin of the enormous Jakobshavn Glacier has retreated inland further than at any time in the last 4,000 to 6,000 years .
The Northern branch broke up in the past several weeks , and the glacier has lost at least three square miles since 2007 .
The Jakobshavn Glacier dominates the roughly 130 glaciers flowing out of Greenland ’s interior to the sea , and is the island ’s most productive glacier , calving one of every 10 Greenland icebergs .
Between 2001 and 2005 , it suffered a massive 36 - square - mile loss of ice that raised awareness worldwide of global climate change .

That 's according to the California Energy Commission 's State Alternative Fuels Plan , which was posted online last Christmas Eve ( pdf ) .
The whole report makes for some fascinating reading because it's a blueprint for a low - carbon and renewable transportation fuel future .
The dominant takeaway : it ai n't going to be easy .
One more choice statistic : gasoline usage in California has increased 50 percent , that 's 10 6.7 billion gallons , since 1988 .
Has there been anything close to a commensurate increase in quality of life here to accompany that rise in energy use ?
But China 's oil thirst is growing – to almost 20 billion gallons in 2007 – and perhaps as early as this year , China 's 1.3 billion people will overtake California 's 37 million people in total gasoline and diesel usage .

Buddhist monks have given food and shelter to the cyclone survivors and have raised money , medicine and aid by preaching Dhamma in public to help the people in need .
Like the Buddhist monks , some bloggers are also helping the victims by raising money from blogs .
Some bloggers are reporting news to the world and some are helping the people .
My friend blogger Ko Soe Zayya and four other bloggers have recently organized a Private Volunteer Group for Nargis Cyclone Victims under the name of Handy .
They have been to the Irrawaddy delta and are building there shelters and houses for the survivors . "
They will build 29 houses in Seik Kan Thar Laygone village and 15 houses are completed " said Soe zayya , a burmese blogger .
They have already built many shelter houses for survivors in Kanyintabin village and Kammalartabin Chaung village .

Britain was the world 's biggest arms seller last year , accounting for a third of global arms exports , the Government 's trade promotion organisation said .
UK Trade and Investment ( UKTI ) said British arms exporters had added $ 20.1 billion in new business last year , giving them a larger share of global arms exports than the United States .
" As demonstrated by this outstanding export performance , the UK has a first - class defence industry , with some of the world 's most technologically sophisticated companies , " Minister for Trade and Investment Digby Jones said .
UKTI said the British figures were boosted by orders for Eurofighter Typhoon jets from Saudi Arabia , the world 's biggest arms buyer , which imported $ 32.8 billion in weapons over the last five years .
The United States still tops the world for the last five years with $ 66.7 billion in total arms exports .
Britain was second with $ 56.1 billion and Russia third with $ 35 billion , it said .
Mr. Gramm , a multimillionaire banker , has been under fire since last week , when he dismissed concerns about the troubled economy by referring to “ a mental recession . ”
He also said the United States had become “ a nation of whiners , ” a remark providing fodder for Democrats to portray Republicans as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans .
Since the start of his campaign , but particularly since the onset of the most recent economic turmoil , Mr. McCain has been struggling to convince voters of his ability to manage the economy , an area he has acknowledged in the past as a weakness .
Mr. Gramm , in addition to being a close friend , helped design his economic program and , until last week ’s gaffe , was being mentioned as a possible treasury secretary in a McCain administration .
Although the McCain lobbyist brigade put on a strong face and defended fellow lobbyist Phil Gramm , McCain 's chief economic advisor -- and first choice for Treasury Secretary in an administration that will never be -- the handwriting was on the wall from the moment the public focused on what an ass he is .
Giving a candid look at the thinking inside the Double Talk Express , the multimillionaire and elitist Gramm , who 's gotten every cent he has by working the government for his own self interest while decrying the very concept of the government having any role in the common good , complained that Americans are a " nation of whiners . "
He claimed that there is no recession , and that the falling home prices , steadily growing unemployment numbers , bank failures , inflationary spiral are ... no big deal and " just in people 's minds .
" And , indeed , among people like the Gramms , Bushes , Cheneys and McCains , who have profited so handsomely by sucking at the government teat , life is good .
Life is very , very , very good .
And they would n't change a thing -- except to bring on more of the same -- lots more .
This morning ' smakes it official : after trying to rehabilitate Gramm earlier in the day -- he 's had his " time out , " they said and was back on board -- McCain bowed to intense public pressure and finally jetisoned Gramm as his campaign 's co-chairman , or at least says he did .
McCain and his lobbyists and media allies keep calling Obama an elitist and an arugula eater .
McCain has more corrupt multimillionaires on the Double Talk Express than even Bush had on his campaign , more , in fact , than any other candidate in history .
There 's another scandal every week and today 's was all about a particularly sleazy operator and major McCain fundraiser , Juan Carlos Benitez , one of McCain 's many connections to Jack Abramoff and the Republican Culture of Corruption that has ruined Washington during the Bush presidency .
But it was Gramm 's inevitable " resignation " last night that got the most media attention .
The Obama campaign , of course , pointed out what the media has missed here , what it far more important than another body tossed off the bus to nowhere .
Hari Sevugan : “ The question for John McCain is n’t whether Phil Gramm will continue as chairman of his campaign , but whether he will continue to keep the economic plan that Gramm authored and that represents a continuation of the polices that have failed American families for the last eight years .
" Keith Olbermann summed it all up last night -- and very well :

Minimal
Back in March when I read about Ryan Tomayko ’s redesign , I had two immediate reactions :
Wow , that ’s hardcore !
I should try that myself sometime .
Of course , at the time I was busy working on a book and so could n’t really spare much effort for doing redesign work .
Once that was in its final stages , though , I sat down and started thinking about what I could do to reduce the amount of cruft hanging around my weblog .
Many revisions later , I have something I ’m close to being happy with ; of course , I do n’t think it ’ll ever be perfect or finished ( I ’ve been tweaking bits off and on this evening , and plan to do so for quite some time to come ) , but at least I ’ve got something I ’m not totally embarrassed to throw out in public .
Since it ’s a bit of a radical departure from what I ’ve done previously , and from established norms for weblogs , let me take a moment to explain how I ended up here .
Minimizing
In any sort of discussion of minimal or minimalistic design a certain quote , attributed to Antoine de Saint Exupéry , is inevitably bandied about :
A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add , but when there is nothing left to take away .
At first this seems like a brilliant insight into the heart of the design process , but it really turns out to be bullshit .
because the point at which there is nothing left to take away is the point at which there is nothing left , period .
For example , I ’m working in HTML 4.01 Strict here ( more on that in a later article ) .
Here ’s a valid HTML 4.01 Strict document from which nothing can be taken away :
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " > < title ></ title > < p >
Remove the DOCTYPE and you no longer have any assurance that it ’s HTML 4.01 Strict ( in fact , relying only on a PUBLIC identifier is a bit risky from a legacy - SGML perspective ) .
Remove the title element or the lone p element , and the document is no longer valid .
Everything else in HTML 4.01 Strict is optional and so can be taken away .
Of course , I could take away the requirement of valid HTML , but at that point I ’d probably just declare that the Web which can be expressed in angle brackets is not the true Web ( it is n’t , by the way ) , renounce my worldly possessions and move into a Taoist monastery .
I mention this not because it ’s any sort of earth - shattering revelation , but simply because it ’s important to recognize that minimalism for minimalism ’s sake is just dumb .
Like any other design tool , it should be a means to an end .
The thing that ’s useful about reaching the point of absolute minimalism , then , is not that it ’s the point at which you ’ve achieved perfection , or even anything resembling your end goal .
Rather , it ’s the point at which you realize which of the things you ’ve removed were actually important , because their absence brings them into stark focus .
And I ended up focusing maniacally on one thing .
It ’s about the content
The big take - away from Ryan ’s redesign , for me , was a much stronger focus on content , and a de-emphasizing or removal of anything that was n’t content .
This meant a lot of traditional design elements , such as a header / logo , sidebars , etc. immediately went out the window in favor of a simple , single - column layout .
There ’s no logo , no header and no sidebar .
A paragraph ’s worth of metadata which used to be present in the sidebar of every page has disappeared , replaced with a much smaller interstitial line of metadata which now ( in the absence of dedicated elements in the page for this purpose ) does double duty as an aid to navigation .
The primary goal I had in mind as I was working on the redesign was simple : put content in front of people ’s eyeballs .
This is somewhat tricky because in order to be useful a blog site needs to have a variety of pages which are n’t , strictly speaking , content : archives and topical indexes , for example .
Rather than being content , these pages are ways to reach content , and so they should be designed so that you ’ll leave them as quickly as possible .
This means that all such pages are extremely heavy on direct links to “ content pages ” and suggest ways to quickly navigate to things you might want to find .
In general , I ’ve tried to ensure that each “ non-content ” page ( and many “ content ” pages , as well ) supports the following navigational directions : “ up ” , “ down ” , “ back ” , “ forward ” , “ fast forward ” .
To take an example , have a look at the archive of entries published in April of this year .
All of these navigational directions are present :
“ up ” :
In the interstitial line below the page title is a link to the archive for all entries published this year .
In the interstitial line below the page title is a link to the archive for all entries published this year .
“ down ” : Each entry in the archive offers a direct link to its page .
Each entry in the archive offers a direct link to its page .
“ back ” :
In the interstitial below the entry list is a link to the previous month ’s archive .
In the interstitial below the entry list is a link to the previous month ’s archive . “ forward ” :
Also in that interstitial is a link to the next month ’s archive .
Also in that interstitial is a link to the next month ’s archive . “ fast forward ” :
In the interstitial below the page title is a link to the archive of latest entries .
All except the “ down ” and “ fast forward ” links are also exposed through appropriately - marked link elements in the head of the page .
I do n’t know of a lot of tools which actually support browsing with those , but if you have one and you use it , the links are there for you ( I ’ve always snuck a variety of stuff into link elements , though , so it ’s not really a new feature ) .
Additionally , once you reach the “ top ” of a given area of the site ( e.g. , the archive of latest entries ) , the first interstitial switches to suggesting alternate areas you might be interested in , such as topical browsing by category ( which you can also reach from any individual entry ’s page ) or browsing through links .
And , taking a cue from Maura , I ’ve also been adding meta tags with noindex , follow declarations on archive pages ; hopefully this will weed out any irrelevant search results which would send people to those pages , and help drive people directly to content pages instead .
All of this goes toward the goal of getting you off these “ non-content ” pages as quickly as possible .
The primary exceptions to this navigation scheme are things that are n’t entries or links , like the “ about ” page .
They do n’t form any linked or hierarchical structure , so the interstitials on those pages simply suggest some related pages or places you might want to go , and will often land you in an area with richer navigation patterns .
How I learned to stop designing and love typography
Of course , this content focus ended up posing a challenge : without relying on non-content - based design elements , how do you differentiate logical areas of a page or types of content ?
With one exception ( single - pixel horizontal lines which act as dividers in certain contexts ; I feel a bit bad about giving in on those , but I ’m not quite that hardcore yet ) , I ’ve decided to solve this entirely with typography ; while this is n’t and should n’t be news , you can do quite a lot using nothing more than simple typographic effects .
For example , many people set off blockquotes by adding background colors , borders or large quotation - mark images ; instead , I ’ve just added a bit of margin , and changed the font from Helvetica to italic Georgia .
While I was doing the design work , I spent a lot of time curled up with Richard Rutter ’s adaptation for the Web of Robert Bringhurst ’s classic The Elements of Typographic Style , and ended up implementing a lot of its recommendations .
All of the typography is set to a baseline grid ( with measured intervals , and with implementation helped by useful pointers from Wilson ’s ALA article on the subject ) , and variations in margins as well as font face , size , style and weight implement practically every design element you ’ll see here .
Along the way , I also bumped up the base font sizes everywhere ; the switch to a single - column layout meant that the line lengths for smaller sizes were getting uncomfortable , so a minor tweak ( and a corresponding increase in leading ) was needed .
It may just be me , but the baseline size ( 14px with a total line - height of 22 px ) is quite wonderfully readable .
If you ’re interested , dig into the CSS and you ’ll find a lot of really pedantic stuff that only a typophile could love ( and which more accomplished typophiles , which is to say most all of them , could no doubt have done a better job of ) .
Homeless
All of this leads into what has already been the most adventurous and controversial change : the lack of a ubiquitous “ home page ” link .
At first , I tried to find a way to work it in — for example , in the upper interstitial spot which holds other navigation elements — but it always seemed out of place and I ultimately could n’t find anywhere to put it that reliably worked on every type of page .
And that got me thinking a bit .
There are three primary functions a home page typically serves :
It acts as a “ landing page ” , the first place people come to when they arrive at the site .
It acts as a starting point for navigation , by providing links to useful areas within the site .
It acts as a notifier , by prominently advertising any new content on the site .
Now , the first function here — landing page — is largely irrelevant for this site ; the overwhelming majority of people coming here end up landing directly on a content page , because they ’re almost always coming from a direct link or a search engine .
The third function — advertising new content — is also irrelevant , because feeds do a far better job of that .
If you ’re still dropping by the home page regularly in search of new content , stop already and get yourself a feed reader ( or hit the Django community aggregator instead , since it ’s much more active and opens up a much wider range of content ) .
Which leaves only the second function : home page as navigational gateway .
As I ’ve already mentioned , I ’ve been trying as hard as possible to set up navigational options to keep you off “ non-content ” pages , and deliberately adding such a page to the various navigational chains ( which — I hope — do a better job of helping you get around ) did n’t seem to make much sense .
Plus there ’s already a page which logically should be linked from everywhere — the “ about ” page — which can logically serve as a jumping - off point to any other part of the site .
So I stopped worrying about where to put a “ home page ” link , and just left it out .
I also spent as much time as possible minimizing the amount of non-content information on the home page , eventually trimming it down to a single line of text at the top .
I would n’t recommend trying this anywhere else , but for this site and its traffic and usage patterns , I think I like it .
Plus , it ’s sort of a neat experiment to see how much a home page is actually used versus how often it ’s simply a bit of cruft that people look for but do n’t get any practical value out of .
Under construction
Of course , the redesign is still very much a work in progress ; there are a number of things I ’m still tweaking and refining , and I ’ll be paying attention to comments and stats to get an idea of how well the changes are working .
If you ’ve got an opinion or if you ’ve spotted a problem , type it into the comment box and let me know .
Doctors may not discriminate against gays and lesbians in medical treatment , even if the procedures being sought conflict with physicians ’ religious beliefs , the California Supreme Court decided unanimously Monday .
In its second major decision advancing gay rights this year , the state high court ruled that religious physicians must obey a state law that bars businesses from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation .
“ The 1st Amendment ’s right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the . . . antidiscrimination requirements , ” Justice Joyce L. Kennard wrote for the court .
The decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Guadalupe T. Benitez , an Oceanside lesbian who lives with her partner and wanted to become pregnant with donated sperm .

Benitez filed a suit after Dr. Christine Brody , an obstetrician and gynecologist at the North Coast Women ’s Care Medical Group in Vista , said she would not perform an intrauterine insemination .
In her lawsuit , Benitez alleged that Brody said her religious views prevented her from providing the procedure to a lesbian .
Another physician at the clinic , Dr. Douglas Fenton , later told Benitez that the staff was uncomfortable helping her conceive a child and advised her to find another doctor outside the medical group , Benitez said .
The doctors denied the allegations .
Brody said she would not perform the procedure on any unmarried woman , heterosexual or homosexual .
The state high court said the doctors ’ constitutional rights to freedom of religion did not trump the state antidiscrimination law because the state has a compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical care .

But the doctors “ remain free to voice their objections , religious or otherwise , to the [ law ’s ] prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination , ” Kennard wrote .
The court also said the doctors could testify at a trial that their religious beliefs barred them from doing the procedure for reasons other than the patient ’s sexual orientation .
Robert Tyler , general counsel for Advocates for Faith and Freedom , predicted that the ruling would spur voters “ to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition ” and support a November ballot initiative that would amend the state Constitution to ban same - sex marriage in California .
A state Supreme Court ruling in May made gay marriage legal .
Kenneth R. Pedroza , who represented the doctors , said the ruling would probably cause many physicians to refuse to perform inseminations at all .
Pedroza said Brody did not violate the law because it did not bar discrimination on the basis of marital status when Benitez sought insemination in 1999 .
The state law has since been amended .

Asked whether Brody would perform the procedure on a married lesbian , Pedroza said : “ I do n’t know . ”
But Jennifer C. Pizer , senior counsel for Lambda Legal , said Benitez ’s experience was “ sadly common ” for lesbians seeking reproductive healthcare .
“ We get calls routinely about it , ” she said .
Benitez , 36 , who is now the mother of three , said she has been pursuing her case for 10 years .

“ This is n’t just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women , ” Benitez said .
“ It ’s a win for everyone because everyone could be the next target if doctors choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people . ”
Justice Marvin R. Baxter , the court ’s most conservative justice , said in a separate concurring opinion that doctors could protect against liability by referring patients to other doctors in their practice who did not share their religious objections .
But he conceded that sole practitioners might have little choice and hinted that he might vote in a future case to spare them from the requirement .
“ I am not so certain this balance of competing interests would produce the same result in the case of a sole practitioner , ” Baxter wrote .
The court did not specifically address that question .

A spokesman for the California Medical Assn. said it opposes “ invidious discrimination ” and believes it is “ not protected by a claim of a religious belief . ”
The spokesman said he did not know what practical effect the decision would have on doctors and stressed that the group has no position on what the outcome of the lawsuit should be .
A trial court ruled for Benitez , but an appeals court overturned that decision in favor of the doctors .
After the case landed in the state high court , civil libertarian groups sided with Benitez , and religious groups , including Jewish and Islamic clergy , argued that doctors were entitled to disavow treatments that conflicted with their beliefs .
Monday ’s ruling clears the way for Benitez ’s case to go to trial .

OTTAWA–The federal Conservatives have quietly killed a giant information registry that was used by lawyers , academics , journalists and ordinary citizens to hold government accountable .
The registry , created in 1989 , is an electronic list of every request filed to all federal departments and agencies under the Access to Information Act .
Known as CAIRS , for Co-ordination of Access to Information Requests System , the database allowed ordinary citizens to identify millions of pages of once - secret documents that became public through individual freedom - of - information requests over many years .
But in a notice last week to civil servants on the Treasury Board website , officials posted an innocuous obituary : effective April 1 , 2008 , " the requirement to update CAIRS is no longer in effect . "
A spokesman for Treasury Board confirmed Friday that the system is being killed because " extensive " consultations showed it was not valued by government departments .
The consultations concluded " the valuable resources currently being used to maintain CAIRS would be better used in the collection and analysis of improved statistical reporting , " said Robert Makichuk .
Public Works , which has operated the database , spent $ 166,000 improving it in 2001 .
As recently as 2003 federal officials had been working on a publicly accessible , online version .
Monthly paper lists have also been made available since the 1990s for public consultation at a central federal office in Ottawa .
In the meantime , a Canadian academic put the database on his website and opened it to public use , allowing citizens to quickly search thousands of requests for key words .
Alasdair Roberts , a political scientist at Syracuse University in New York , built a version of the database by requesting the CAIRS electronic records through an Access to Information Act request , and updated the site monthly .
CBC journalist David McKie took over the work in 2006 using another publicly accessible website ( http://www.onlinedemocracy.ca).
Users searching key words cannot access the documents themselves , only the wording of the original access - to - information request , the date , the department , a file number , and general information about the requester , whether media , business , academic or other .
But by citing that file number , a citizen can approach the appropriate department and request copies of the already released documents .
CAIRS was originally designed as an internal government tool to manage the flow of often embarrassing information .
Particularly sensitive requests from news media or opposition politicians would often be red-flagged for special handling that frequently delayed release .
But requesters soon began to mine the database to discover obscure documents , fine - tune the phrasing on new requests , and even to do statistical studies – effectively turning the tool against government .
If departments and agencies are no longer required to update the CAIRS database with new requests , its value as an accountability tool will quickly diminish , critics said .
" This is terrible and I consider this to be yet one more step in making records less accessible , " said Michel Drapeau , a lawyer , frequent user and co-author of a standard reference work on access law .
" To do this now after the CAIRS ' usefulness has been proven over and over again is indicative of the extent to which government will go to stifle the access regime . "
New Democrat MP
Dawn
Black , whose office uses the database regularly , condemned the Tories for shutting down the system .
" It 's another example of the Harper government 's talk about accountability and transparency – they talk the talk , but they do n't walk the walk . "
The Conservative government has a mixed record in the area of freedom of information .
The Federal Accountability
Act broadened the access legislation to cover new entities , such as the CBC , Via Rail , Canada Post and even the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada , who 's the ombudsman for the system .
At the same time , long delays for responses , along with heavy censorship of documents , have become endemic .
The number of complaints received by the information commissioner in 2007 - 2008 , for example , soared to 2,387 – more than 1,000 higher than the previous year .
The level is the second - highest on record , next to the 2,821 received in 1988 – 2,242 of those from a single complainant .
One of these companies deserves a Tony Award for the phenomenal drama unfolding before our Foolish eyes .
The boldness with which the world 's major miners and steelmakers are competing to secure access to raw materials makes for some serious entertainment .
Given the global price inflation on the playbill for Act II of this Shakespearian tragedy , however , this sense of fascination is truly a guilty pleasure .
Fellow Fool David Lee Smith updated Fooldom yesterday with a surprising new twist in BHP Billiton 's ( NYSE : BHP ) quest to acquire rival Rio Tinto ( NYSE : RTP ) .
It seems that steel giant ArcelorMittal ( NYSE : MT ) may also be looking to feast from Rio Tinto 's resource - rich trough .
In a related scene , audiences were treated to an encore performance when Korean steelmaker POSCO ( NYSE : PKX ) announced it had purchased a 10 % stake in Australian coal miner Macarthur Coal for a bit more than $ 400 million .
POSCO 's purchase sought to counter ArcelorMittal 's 19.9 % stake in Macarthur , and the 17.66 % stake held by China 's state - run CITIC Resource Holdings .
POSCO , which imports 600,000 tons of coal from Macarthur per year , said it made the move only to secure access to resources , and that it is not geared toward M&A activity .
In addition , POSCO is looking to increase investments in material supply companies over the next decade , until 30 % of its purchases come from companies in which it is invested .
ArcelorMittal , for its part , recently pulled out of takeover talks for Macarthur , leaving the market to speculate over possible interest from the likes of Anglo American ( NASDAQ : AAUK ) , Xstrata , or Vale ( NYSE : RIO ) .
With today 's news from POSCO , however , any would - be suitors would have to contend with a 47.56 % combined stake among the three major stakeholders .
What 's more , these stakeholders share a vested interest in blocking further consolidation among the major mining companies , which would create ever - larger , more powerful arbiters of resource prices .
For POSCO and ArcelorMittal , simply preventing Macarthur from ending up in the hands of a megaminer like Vale may be victory enough at this stage of the M&A game .
Further Foolishness :
At the end of March , a Brazilian appeals court in São Paulo declared that possession of drugs for personal use is not a criminal offense .
Several lower courts had previously ruled in the same way , but the ruling from the São Paulo Justice Court 's 6th Criminal Chamber marked the first time an appeals court there had found Brazil 's drug law unconstitutional as it pertains to simple drug possession .
The ruling came in the case of Ronaldo Lopes , who was arrested with 7.7 grams of cocaine in three separate bags on the night before Carnival began in 2007 .
Lopes acknowledged that the drugs were his and said they were for his personal use .
Lopes was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison as a drug trafficker .
But the appeals court judges threw out the trafficking charge since it was based on an anonymous complaint .
It then threw out the possession charge , saying it was unconstitutional .
Psicotropicus banner promoting marijuana ( maconha ) legalization .
In his opinion in the case , Judge José Henrique Rodrigues Torres said the law criminalizing drug possession for personal use was invalid because it violated the constitutional principles of harm ( there is no harm to third parties ) , privacy ( it is a personal choice ) , and equality ( possessing alcohol is not a crime ) .
" One can not admit any state intervention , mainly repressive and of penal character , in the realm of personal choice , especially when it comes to legislating morality , " he said .
The ruling applies only to Lopes , but can be used as a precedent in other court proceedings .
There is no word yet on whether the Brazilian government will appeal .
The ruling comes nearly two years after Brazil changed its drug laws to depenalize -- but not decriminalize -- drug possession for personal use .
Under that law , drug possession is still a criminal offense , but penalties are limited to fines , fees , education , and community service .
In his opinion , Torres cited earlier decisions by now retired Judge Maria Lúcia Karam , who told the Chronicle this week the appeals court decision was " praiseworthy " and " significant . "
" The praiseworthy ruling by a Court of Appeals in São Paulo , proclaiming the unconstitutionality of the Brazilian law that criminalizes drug possession for personal use , is a remarkable moment in Brazil 's judicial history , " she said .
" This is a decision of great significance .
This is the first time a Brazilian appeals court has clearly stated that a law that criminalizes drug possession for personal use contradicts the Constitution and the international declarations of human rights .
This is the first time that a Brazilian appeals court has clearly stated that drug possession for personal use is a behavior that matters only to the individual , to his or her privacy , and to his or her personal choices .
This is the first time that a Brazilian appeals court has clearly stated that the state is not authorized to interfere within this sphere of privacy .
This is the first time that a Brazilian appeals court has clearly stated that the individual shall be free to be and to do whatever he or she wants , while behaving in such a way that does not affect any rights of others , " Karam said .
The decision should reverberate through the Brazilian courts , said Karam .
" This is a real precedent , and it should encourage other Brazilian courts and judges to also accomplish their main mission , that is to guarantee liberty and all other fundamental rights of individuals , to actually respect the Constitution and the international declarations of human rights , " she said .
" This is good news , " agreed Luiz Paulo Guanabara , head of the Brazilian drug reform group Psicotropicus .
" The 2006 drug law reform did away with prison sentences for people possessing illicit drugs for personal use , but under that law , drug users were still criminals who could be penalized by community service or fines and fees .
This is an advance , " he said .
" Amazing , " said Martín Arangurí Soto , a graduate student in political science in São Paulo and Drug War Chronicle 's Spanish and Portuguese translator .
" The Justice Court of São Paulo is a very conservative court .
It was among the ones that banned the marijuana marches at the beginning of this month , " he noted .
" Does this mean the marijuana march is on next year ?
They wo n't be able to argue that it is an ' apology for drug use , ' because possessing for personal use is not a crime anymore . "
Drug law reform is a work in process in Brazil , said Guanabara .
" This is a timely decision because the new law is not carved in stone and must be amended to fit social reality .
Now we have the chance to quit unjustly criminalizing people for consuming this or that substance or carrying illicit drugs for personal use . "
One of the remaining issues to be resolved is what quantity of drugs is considered personal use , said Guanabara .
" There is no set quantity to distinguish users from dealers , " he explained .
" This ruling is notable because the defendant was caught carrying more than seven grams of cocaine .
If he had lived in a slum and been detained with that same amount he would have been considered a drug dealer and subjected to the same penalties as someone caught with 10 kilos of cocaine , which is one of the more irrational aspects of our drug laws . "
Beyond the impact the ruling could have on the lives of drug users , it also shows how far Brazil has come , said Guanabara .
" The drug policy discussion has reached the mainstream in Brazil , " he said .
" When Psicotropicus was created just a few years ago , the topic was taboo and people who spoke in favor of drug policy reform were regarded as lunatics or advocates against the ' indisputable ' crime of possessing , using or selling the forbidden drugs . "

Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Financial Statement Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ProElite , Inc. , a New Jersey company and its subsidiaries ( “ ProElite ” or the “ Company ” ) , have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10 - Q .
Accordingly , certain information and footnote disclosures , normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles , have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations .
In the opinion of management , these financial statements reflect all adjustments , consisting of normal recurring accruals , which are considered necessary for a fair presentation .
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10 - KSB for the year ended December 31 , 2007 .
Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year or any other future periods .
Principles of Consolidation
The Company ’s consolidated financial statements include the assets , liabilities and operating results of ProElite and its wholly - owned subsidiaries since formation or acquisition of these entities .
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation .
The equity method of accounting is used for its investment in Entlian Corp. in which ProElite has significant influence ; this represents common stock ownership of at least 20 % and not more than 50 % ( see Note 4 ) .
Revenue Recognition
In general , the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin ( " SAB " ) No. 101 , Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements modified by Emerging Issues Task Force ( " EITF " ) No. 00 - 21 and SAB No. 104 which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized : ( 1 ) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ; ( 2 ) delivery has occurred or services rendered ; ( 3 ) the fee is fixed and determinable ; and ( 4 ) collectibility is reasonably assured .
The Company earns revenue primarily from live event ticket sales , site fees , sponsorship , television license fees and pay per view fees .
The Company also earns incidental revenue from merchandise and video sales and from online advertising , subscriptions and online store sales .
Ticket sales are managed by third parties , ticket agencies and live event venues .
Revenue from ticket sales is recognized at the time of the event when the venue provides estimated or final attendance reporting to the Company .
Revenue from merchandise and video sales is recognized at the point of sale at live event concession stands .
Revenue from sponsorship and television distribution agreements is recognized in accordance with the contract terms , which are generally at the time events occur .
Website revenue is recognized as advertisements are shown , as subscription terms are fulfilled , and as products are shipped .
Cost of Revenue
Costs related to live events are recognized when the event occurs .
Event costs incurred prior to an event are capitalized to prepaid costs and then charged to expense at the time of the event .
Costs primarily include : fighter purses , travel , arena costs , television production and amortization of capitalized value of warrants issued to Showtime .
Cost of other revenue streams are recognized at the time the related revenues are realized .
8
Significant Estimates for Events
The Company is required to estimate significant components of live event revenues and costs because actual amounts may not become available until one or more months after an event date .
Pay - per - view revenue is estimated based upon projected sales of pay - per- view presentations .
These projections are based upon information provided from distribution partners .
The amount of final pay - per - view sales is determined after intermediary pay - per- view distributors have completed their billing cycles .
The television production costs of live events are based upon the television distribution agreements with Showtime and CBS , event - specific production and marketing budgets and historical experience .
Should actual results differ from estimated amounts , a charge or benefit to the statement of operations would be recorded in a future period .
Advertising Expenses
Advertising is expensed as incurred .
Total advertising expense was $ 764,827 and $ 464,825 during the six months ended June 30 , 2008 and 2007 , respectively .
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable relate principally to amounts due from television networks for license fees and pay - per- view presentations and from live event venues for ticket sales .
Amounts due for pay - per - view programming are based primarily upon estimated sales of pay - per- view presentations and are adjusted to actual after intermediary pay - per- view distributors have completed their billing cycles .
If actual sales differ significantly from the estimated sales , the Company records an adjustment to sales .
Accounts receivable from foreign television distribution is generally based upon contracted fees per event or showing .
Accounts receivable from venues for ticket sales to live events are generally received within 30 days of an event date .
An allowance for uncollectible receivables is estimated each period .
This estimate is based upon historical collection experience , the length of time receivables are outstanding and the financial condition of individual customers .
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets primarily consist of computer , office , and video production equipment ; furniture and fixtures ; leasehold improvements ; computer software ; Internet domain names purchased from others ; and website development costs .
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization .
Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight - line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or , when applicable , the life of the lease , whichever is shorter .
Equipment is depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years .
Furniture , fixtures and leasehold improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from five to seven years .
Computer software is amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years .
Internet domain names are amortized over ten years .
Website development costs are amortized over three years .
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 , “ Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ” ( “ SFAS No. 142 ” ) , requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite .
During 2007 , the Company acquired amortizable intangible assets consisting of non-compete agreements , fighter contracts , merchandising rights and distribution agreements and indefinite - lived intangible assets consisting of brands and trademarks .
The Company amortizes the cost of acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives , which range from one to five years .
SFAS No. 142 requires goodwill and other indefinite - lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment at least on an annual basis and more often under certain circumstances , and written down by a charge to operations when impaired .
An interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value .
At June 30 , 2008 , the Company modified its operating plan for its Cage Rage subsidiary , due to its recent operating performance , and as a result recorded a charge of approximately $ 5.2 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values .
Additionally , as of June 30 , 2008 , management assessed the financial performance of and market conditions affecting its ICON and King of the Cage acquisitions .
Management evaluated recent adverse economic trends in the Hawaii market and as a result recorded an impairment of approximately $ 1.8 million to reduce goodwill and acquired intangible assets from the ICON acquisition to estimated realizable value .
Management also evaluated industry trends , including increasing fighter purses and higher than anticipated promotion expenses in the Company ’s King of the Cage subsidiary .
Based upon this analysis , the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $ 2.4 million to reduce goodwill related to the King of the Cage to estimated fair value .
9
Maintaining the goodwill and indefinite - lived intangible assets is predicated upon the Company executing the revised operating plan for Cage Rage and improving profitability of the other acquisitions .
If the Company does not execute successfully against these plans , it may record non-cash charges to operations in future periods to reduce the amount of goodwill and indefinite - lived intangible assets .
Prepaid Distribution Costs
Prepaid distribution costs represent the value of warrants issued to Showtime Networks , Inc. ( “ Showtime ” ) in November 2006 , January 2007 and February 2008 in connection with television and pay - per-view distribution agreements with Showtime and CBS Corp. ( “ CBS ” ) .
Showtime and CBS are related parties .
The value of the warrants issued in 2006 and 2007 is being amortized to cost of revenue over the three - year term of the distribution agreement with Showtime .
As of June 30 , 2008 , management determined the warrants issued in 2008 in connection with the CBS distribution agreement had no future value as the likelihood of realizing gross profit on the CBS events was remote .
Therefore , the entire $ 2.3 million value of these warrants was charged to cost of revenue during the three months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Prepaid Services
Prepaid services included in other assets represent the value of shares issued to MMA Live Entertainment , Inc. for fighter services .
The value of the shares is being amortized to expense over the three - year term of the related agreement .
Valuation of Long - Lived Assets
The carrying amounts of long - lived assets are periodically evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review .
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( “ SFAS ” ) No. 107 , “ Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments . ”
The carrying values of cash equivalents , accounts receivable , accounts payable , and payments due for acquired companies approximate fair value due to the short - term maturities of these instruments .
Foreign Currency
The functional currencies of the Company ’s international subsidiary and investee are the local currency .
The financial statements of the foreign subsidiary are translated into United States dollars using period - end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues and expenses .
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses were insignificant during the period .
Foreign currency translation adjustments are shown as other comprehensive income ( expense ) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet .
10
Loss per Share
The Company utilizes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 , “ Earnings per Share . ”
Basic earnings ( loss ) per share are computed by dividing earnings ( loss ) available to common shareholders by the weighted - average number of common shares outstanding .
Diluted earnings ( loss ) per share is computed similar to basic earnings ( loss ) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive .
Potential common shares include stock that would be issued on exercise of outstanding options and warrants reduced by the number of shares which could be purchased from the related exercise proceeds .
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006 , the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) issued SFAS No. 157 , “ Fair Value Measurements ” .
SFAS No. 157 defines fair value , establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles , and expands disclosures about fair value measurements .
It applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements , the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute .
Accordingly , this statement does not require any new fair value measurements .
This statement is effective for all financial instruments issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15 , 2007 , and interim periods within those fiscal years .
The Company adopted SFAS No. 157 as of January 1 , 2008 and it had no effect on the Company ’s financial position , operations or cash flows .
In December 2007 , the FASB issued SFAS 141 ( R ) , “ Business Combinations ” , replacing SFAS 141 , “ Business Combinations ” .
This statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS 141 that the acquisition method of accounting ( which SFAS 141 termed the purchase method ) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination .
This Statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer : a ) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired , the liabilities assumed , and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree ; b ) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase ; and c ) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination .
This Statement clarifies that acquirers are required to expense costs related to any acquisitions .
SFAS 141R will apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after fiscal years beginning December 15 , 2008 .
Early adoption is prohibited .
Determination of the ultimate effect of this statement will depend on the Company ’s acquisitions , if any , subsequent to December 31 , 2008 .
In December 2007 , the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 , “ Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51 ” .
SFAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary .
Specifically , this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest ( minority interest ) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent ’s equity .
The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement .
SFAS 160 clarifies that changes in a parent ’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest .
In addition , this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated .
Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date .
SFAS 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest .
SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15 , 2008 , with retrospective presentation and disclosure for all periods presented .
Early adoption is prohibited .
The Company does not expect it will be affected by the adoption of SFAS 160 .
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation .

Note 2 Going Concern
The Company has incurred losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations since its inception .
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company ’s ability to continue as a going concern .
The Company ’s business plan calls for expanding the scale of live events , including pay per view , and Internet operations .
As a result , the need for cash has correspondingly increased .
Although the Company had approximately $ 3.5 million of cash at June 30 , 2008 , the Company continues to expend more cash than it brings in through operations .
The Company is actively negotiating to consummate a financing of approximately $ 3.5 million in secured debt ( with a funded amount of $ 3.0 million after an original issue discount of $ 0.5 million ) and believes a successful closing is reasonably likely , but there is no assurance that it will be successful in doing so at all or on a timely basis .
Any such failure to obtain financing in the immediate future would have a material adverse effect on the Company ’s liquidity and capital resources and ability to continue as a going concern .
Even if the Company successfully closes on the debt financing referred to above , it expects that its capital resources would be sufficient only until the end of the year , and only if the Company makes significant reductions in or cessation of operations and expenditures before the end of the year , including dramatically reducing costs by reducing administrative expenses and some lines of business .
Such actions would limit our potential for growth and could materially adversely affect the Company ’s business and prospects .
To address its liquidity needs beyond the immediate period , the Company is actively seeking additional financing beyond the $ 3.0 million referred to above to enable the Company to execute its operating plans without significant reductions in operations , but there is no assurance as to whether any such financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all .
The auditor 's opinion contained in our Annual Report on Form 10 - KSB for the year ended December 31 , 2007 states substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern .
The financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 - Q do not contain any adjustments that may be required should we be unable to continue as a going concern .
Note 3 Net Loss Per Share
Net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period .
The following table summarizes the shares of stock included in calculating earnings per share for the three months ended March 31 , 2008 and 2007 :
Three Months Ended June 30 , 2008 Three Months Ended June 30 , 2007 Six Months Ended June 30 , 2008 Six Months Ended June 30 , 2007 Weighted - average common shares outstanding - basic

Note 4 Acquisitions and Investments
King of the Cage
On September 11 , 2007 , the Company acquired the outstanding capital stock of King of the Cage , Inc. ( “ KOTC ” ) , a promoter of MMA events primarily in the United States .
The acquisition was made in order to increase the Company ’s event activity .
The total purchase price , not including contingent consideration , was $ 5.0 million consisting of : $ 3,250,000 cash paid at closing , $ 500,000 cash paid in November 2007 , 178,571 restricted shares of common stock valued at $ 1,249,997 , or $ 7 per share that were issued in April 2008 , plus nominal direct , capitalizable transaction costs .
Under the stock purchase agreement , the calculation of the number of common shares to be issued is based upon the quoted market price of the Company ’s common stock subject to a maximum per share price of $ 7.00 and a minimum price of $ 2.00 .
Additionally , the Company entered into a five year employment contract with one of the selling shareholders .
( See Note 9 . )
The stock purchase agreement also calls for contingent consideration to be paid annually if certain operating results are achieved by KOTC over five years .
Contingent consideration performance thresholds and payment amounts are as follows :
Performance Thresholds Annual Contingent Consideration Payable Years Ending September 11 , Number of Live Events Produced per Year Annual EBITDA ( as defined in Stock Purchase Agreement ) Cash Common Stock 2008 to 2012 15 n/a $ 500,000 $ - 2008 to 2012 22 n/a $ 75,000 $ 75,000 2008 to 2012 22 Increasing from $ 700,000 to $ 1,500,000 $ 175,000 $ 175,000
The maximum additional contingent consideration is $ 3.75 million in cash and $ 1.25 million in common stock .
At June 30 , 2008 , the Company had accrued a liability of $ 325,000 for estimated contingent consideration payable , which is due in September 2008 .
As security for the contingent consideration , the Company granted the former KOTC shareholders a first priority security interest in the shares of KOTC .
The purchase price was allocated approximately $ 0.1 million to tangible assets , $ 1.1 million to amortizable intangible assets , $ 1.7 million to non-amortizable intangible assets , $ 0.1 million to liabilities and $ 2.4 million to goodwill .
In the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 , the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $ 2.4 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill from the KOTC acquisition to their estimated fair value .
Management determined the impairment charge was needed as a result of industry trends , particularly increasing fighter purses , that caused KOTC ’s financial performance to be less than projected when KOTC was acquired in September 2007 .
The maintenance of the remaining goodwill and acquired intangible assets is predicated upon improving the profitability of KOTC .
If future financial results are less than anticipated , the Company may record additional impairment charges .
13
For the three and six months ended June 30 , 2008 , respectively , KOTC recognized revenue of approximately $ 527,000 and $ 1,027,000 and after expenses , including amortization of approximately $ 105,000 and $ 209,000 related to acquired intangible assets and a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $ 2.4 million in the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 as discussed above , a net loss of approximately $ 2.5 million and $ 2.6 million .
Cage Rage
On September 12 , 2007 , the Company acquired the outstanding capital stock of two entities that promote MMA events : Mixed Martial Arts Promotions Limited , a British domiciled company ( “ MMAP ” ) , and Mixed Martial Arts Productions Limited , a British domiciled company ( “ MMAD ” ) ( collectively “ Cage Rage ” ) .
The acquisition gives the Company an event promotion business in the United Kingdom .
The total purchase price was $ 8.6 million consisting of : $ 4,000,000 cash paid at closing , 500,000 shares of restricted common stock issued in October 2007 , $ 1,000,000 cash to be paid in September 2008 plus $ 100,398 of direct transaction costs .
The Company valued the common stock to be issued at $ 3.5 million , or $ 7.00 per share .
The purchase price was allocated approximately $ 0.9 million to accounts receivable , $ 0.1 million to tangible assets , $ 1.7 million to amortizable intangible assets , $ 3.8 million to non-amortizable intangible assets , $ 0.5 million to accounts payable and $ 2.6 million to goodwill .
In the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 , the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $ 5.2 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets from the Cage Rage acquisition to their estimated fair value .
During July 2008 , the Company ’s management revised the operating plan for Cage Rage in an attempt to achieve profitable live events and reduce operating losses sooner than originally planned in September 2007 , when Cage Rage was acquired .
Key aspects of the revised operating plan are to use smaller venues for live event production and secure a long - term television licensing agreement .
If management is unable to successfully execute the revised operating plan , the Company may record further impairment charges .
Also with respect to assets acquired , the Company recorded a charge of approximately $ 0.9 million during the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 because the likelihood of future recoverability of these assets was uncertain .
For the three and six months ended June 30 , 2008 , respectively , Cage Rage recognized revenue of approximately $ 505,000 and $ 971,000 and after expenses - including amortization of approximately $ 216,000 and $ 432,000 related to acquired intangible assets and the asset impairment and other charges of approximately $ 6.1 million in the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 discussed above - a net loss of approximately $ 7.0 million and $ 7.8 million .
Future Fight Productions , Inc .
On December 7 , 2007 , the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Future Fight Productions , Inc. , ( “ ICON ” ) a promoter of MMA events primarily in Hawaii .
The acquisition gives the Company additional promotion talent and access to fighters and venues .
The assets acquired consisted primarily of a brand name .
Additionally the owner of ICON signed a consulting contract with the Company to continue promoting ICON and other Company - run events .
The total purchase price was $ 2.35 million consisting of : $ 350,000 cash paid at closing and 200,000 shares of restricted common stock , 100,000 of which were issued at closing and the remaining 100,000 are issuable over 3 years .
Additionally , the Company will issue , in three equal installments , 50,000 shares of restricted common stock in connection with the consulting agreement with the seller .
The shares were valued at $ 10 per share .
The purchase price was allocated approximately $ 0.4 million to amortizable intangible assets , $ 0.6 million to non-amortizable assets and $ 1.3 million to goodwill .
The value of the shares to be issued for the consulting agreement , $ 500,000 , will be recorded into expense ratably over the service period .
In the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 , the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $ 1.8 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets from the ICON acquisition to their estimated fair value .
A recessionary economic environment in Hawaii has adversely impacted the Company ’s ability to sell tickets in that market during the first six months of 2008 .
Therefore , the Company revised its operating plan for ICON and recorded an impairment charge to reduce goodwill and acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair value .
14
For the three and six months ended June 30 , 2008 , under the ICON brand name the Company recognized revenue of approximately $ 205,000 for both periods and after expenses , including amortization of approximately $ 20,500 and $ 41,000 related to acquired intangible assets and an impairment charge of $ 1.8 million in the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 as discussed above , a net loss of approximately $ 1.8 million and $ 1.9 million .
Detail of Acquisitions
The following table details the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition :
KOTC Cage Rage ICON Total Current assets , exclusive of cash $ - $ 904,000 $ - $ 904,000 Fixed assets 30,000 61,000 - 91,000 Intangible assets with indefinite lives 1,700,000 3,800,000 628,000 6,128,000
Other intangible assets 1,110,000 1,723,000 410,000 3,243,000 Goodwill 2,356,000 2,571,000 1,312,000 6,239,000 Current liabilities ( 34,000 ) ( 459,000 ) - ( 493,000 ) Consideration $ 5,162,000 $ 8,600,000 $ 2,350,000 $ 16,112,000
The Company allocated purchase prices to amortizable intangible assets of $ 1.9 million to noncompete agreements ( with a weighted average amortization period of 3.9 years ) , fighter contracts of $ 1.2 million ( with a weighted average amortization period of 2 years ) , and $ 0.1 million to distribution contracts ( with a weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years ) .
The Company recorded amortization expense of approximately $ 341,000 and $ 681,000 related to these intangible assets during the three and six months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Additionally , as discussed above , the Company recorded asset impairment and other charges totaling approximately $ 10.3 million during the quarter and six months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Purchase Price Allocations
The purchase price allocations for the acquisitions were based upon discounted expected cash flow models .
Valuation methods including relief from royalty , excess earnings / contributory asset charges , lost profits , and with and without competition , were applied to the discounted expected cash flow models to determine the value of the intangible assets acquired .
The purchase prices of the acquisitions were then allocated based upon the values of intangible assets calculated and the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired .
Additionally , the maintenance of goodwill and indefinite - lived intangible assets on the Company ’s balance sheet requires management to achieve improvements in and expansion of the acquired entities ’ operations .
Should operations not improve to desired levels , the Company may be required to record an additional charge to operations for impairment of these assets .
SpiritMC
On September 18 , 2007 , the Company made an investment in Entlian Corporation ( “ SpiritMC ” ) , a South Korean company promoting MMA events in South Korea .
The investment gives the Company access to event promotion in South Korea and to fighters and venues under contract with SpiritMC .
The cost of the investment was $ 2 million consisting of $ 1 million cash and $ 1 million in restricted common shares ( 100,000 common shares valued at $ 10.00 per share ) .
The $ 10.00 per share valuation resulted from the Company ’s guarantee of a minimum per share value of $ 10.00 to Entlian .
If the Company ’s quoted market price is below $ 10 per share on the date the lock up period expires in March 2009 , the Company is required to issue up to 100,000 additional common shares .
15
The Company acquired approximately 54 % of SpiritMC ’s common stock .
This ownership percentage will dilute down to approximately 32 % when SpiritMC ’s existing debt facility with a third party mandatorily converts to common stock at any time but no later than January 2010 .
The Company has one third of the seats on SpiritMC ’s Board of Directors , and therefore will not exercise control over SpiritMC .
The Company has also determined that it is not the primary beneficiary .
As such , the Company accounts for the investment in SpiritMC using the equity method .
The Company recorded a charge of approximately $ 78,000 and $ 193,000 , representing the Company ’s share of SpiritMC ’s loss for the three and six months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Note 5 Other Current Assets
Other current assets included a balance due of approximately $ 940,000 from a business owned by a former shareholder of Cage Rage .
This amount was due primarily for event sponsorship prior to the Company ’s acquisition of Cage Rage .
During the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 , the Company wrote off this asset into impairment and other charges due to the uncertainty of future recoverability .
Note 6 Fixed Assets , Net

16
The $ 1.8 million note payable dated December 17 , 2007 to Showtime was issued to extend payment of the net amount due to Showtime for television production costs incurred in 2007 .
In June 2008 , Showtime and the Company extended the note due date from December 17 , 2008 to March 31 , 2009 , and the note was given a first priority security interest in the unpledged assets of the Company .
The note bears interest at the daily prime rate as published by JPMorganChase bank with interest payable at maturity .
On June 18 , 2008 , the Company entered into a Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement and related documents with Showtime .
Under the agreements , Showtime funded a note payable by the Company and the Company issued warrants to Showtime .
The note has a face value of $ 3,500,000 , of which the Company received $ 3,000,000 after an original issue discount of $ 500,000 , and a first priority security interest in the unpledged assets of the Company .
The note accrues interest at 10 % per annum payable at maturity .

The note agreement includes a covenant that the Company maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $ 550,000 .
The face value of the note together with accrued , unpaid interest may be prepaid without penalty prior to maturity .

The Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement allows the Company to raise additional indebtedness up to $ 3,500,000 ( “ Additional Indebtedness ” ) with collateral pari pasu with the Showtime notes , provided that Showtime has approval rights over any new holder of Additional Indebtedness , the right to purchase any Additional Indebtedness from new holders of debt , and sole power to exercise remedies upon a default of any Additional Indebtedness .
Other Accrued Liabilities
In connection with the reverse merger of the Company and the predecessor registrant , the Company assumed accounts payable of approximately $ 210,000 and notes payable of approximately $ 137,000 , which existed at the time the predecessor registrant ceased operations .
These liability balances remained unchanged from the date of the reverse merger .
Note 8 Income Taxes
As a result of the Company ’s losses , no income taxes were due for the six and three months ended June 30 , 2008 and 2007 .
The provision for income taxes was offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance .
As of January 1 , 2007 , the Company implemented FASB Interpretation No. 48 , Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 ( “ FIN 48 ” ) , which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions .
This Interpretation provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements , only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit , based on the technical merits of the position .
The adoption on FIN 48 did not have an effect on the Company ’s consolidated financial statements .
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the Company ’s effective tax rate is zero based on the fact that the Company currently has a full reserve against its unrecognized tax benefits .
Current income taxes ( benefits ) are based upon the year ’s income taxable for federal , state and foreign tax reporting purposes .
Deferred income taxes ( benefits ) are provided for certain income and expenses , which are recognized in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes .
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the period in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income .
The Company had a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at June 30 , 2008 .
17
At June 30 , 2008 , the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 24.4 million for federal tax purposes , expiring through 2028 .
In addition , the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 24.4 million for state tax purposes , which expire through 2018 .
However , a change in ownership could result in an “ ownership change ” under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 which restricts the ability of a corporation to utilize existing net operating losses .
The Company also had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 4.1 million for UK tax purposes that had been accumulated since acquisition of Cage Rage .
The Company is subject to Federal and state tax in the United States and tax in the United Kingdom .
The tax years 2006 and 2007 of the parent company remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject .
The acquired subsidiaries may have earlier years subject to examination .
The Company is not currently under examination by any tax authorities .
Note 9 Commitments

Note 10 Litigation and Potential Claims
On December 14 , 2006 , the Company received a demand letter ( the “ Demand Letter ” ) from counsel for Wallid Ismail Promocoes E Eventos LTDA EPP and Wallid Ismail ( collectively “ Wallid ” ) .
The Demand Letter alleges that the Company entered into a “ fully enforceable agreement ” to compensate Wallid for allegedly assisting the Company in raising financing , and that the Company or its directors committed unspecified fraudulent acts , misappropriated Wallid ’s “ confidential and proprietary information , ” and engaged in an “ intentional and well - orchestrated scheme to wrongfully remove Wallid ” as a principal of the Company .
Wallid did not specify the amount of damages he claims to have sustained as a result of these acts .
The Company denies Wallid ’s allegations , and denies that it has , or has breached , any obligations to Wallid .
On January 2 , 2007 , the Company filed a lawsuit against Wallid in the Superior Court for the State of California , County of Los Angeles , LASC Case No. BC 364204 ( the “ California Lawsuit ” ) .
In the California Lawsuit , the Company seeks a judicial declaration that the allegations in the Demand Letter are false .
In addition , the California Lawsuit alleges that Wallid has misappropriated the Company ’s business plan and other confidential and proprietary information , that Wallid has been unjustly enriched at the Company ’s expense , that Wallid is engaging in unfair competition with the Company , and that Wallid ’s actions violate California Business and Professions Code sections 17200 , et seq .
Wallid answered the complaint on March 22 , 2007 , and then transferred the case to federal court .
The case will be litigated in federal court , discovery is underway and the case is set for trial on September 16 , 2008 .
However , it is anticipated that the court will vacate this trial date to accommodate pending defense motions for summary adjudication of issues .
On January 10 , 2007 , Wallid filed suit against the Company , among others , in federal court in New Jersey ( the “ New Jersey Lawsuit ” ) .
He amended his complaint on February 1 , 2007 .
On April 18 , 2007 , the Company filed a motion to dismiss or stay the New Jersey Lawsuit because the California Lawsuit was filed first , or in the alternative to transfer the case to the federal court in California where the California Lawsuit is pending .
On June 26 , 2007 , the court granted the Company ’s motion and ordered the New Jersey Lawsuit transferred to the federal court in California .
On November 5 , 2007 , the federal court in the California lawsuit approved a stipulation by Wallid and the Company granting Wallid leave to file a Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint in the California Lawsuit , and providing for dismissal of the New Jersey Lawsuit without prejudice upon completion of the transfer of that action to California .
The Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint asserts substantially the same claims Wallid asserted in the New Jersey Lawsuit .
Wallid seeks : a 23.25 % to 26.67 % equity interest in the Company ; damages for his losses in an amount to be determined at trial , but no less than $ 75,000 ; punitive damages of no less than $ 10,000,000 ; an imposition of a receiver to oversee the assets of the Company ; an accounting on all income earned by the Company ; and attorneys ’ fees and costs of suit .
The Company denies Wallid ’s allegations and intends to assert a vigorous defense .
West Coast Productions , Inc. ( “ West Coast ” ) filed a civil action against Frank “ Shamrock ” Juarez ( “ Shamrock ” ) on January 23 , 2007 , and sought and obtained a temporary restraining order which prohibited Shamrock from fighting in the Company ’s February 10 , 2007 event .
The Company subsequently entered into a settlement agreement on February 5 , 2007 , pursuant to which West Coast dismissed its civil action and agreed to permit Shamrock to fight in the February 10 , 2007 event .
The Company agreed to pay an aggregate of $ 250,000 to West Coast , out of future compensation due to Shamrock from the Company under the personal services agreement .
The Company also entered into a co-promotion agreement with West Coast , pursuant to which it agreed to co-promote up to three live MMA events that feature Shamrock .

A liability of $ 150,000 has been accrued .
19
On March 22 , 2007 , Zuffa , LLC filed a complaint against Showtime , the Company and Cage Rage in which it alleges that the defendants infringed Zuffa ’s copyrights by airing footage from certain Ultimate Fighting Championship events and alleges that the defendants utilized portions of Zuffa ’s copyrights in the televised broadcast of the February 10 , 2007 MMA event that was held at the Desoto Civic Center in Southaven , Mississippi .
Zuffa has alleged causes of action for copyright infringement and unfair competition , and seeks injunctive relief , compensatory damages or statutory damages , and litigation expenses .
Zuffa has not specified the amount of monetary damages it seeks .
ProElite filed a motion to dismiss the case .
The court dismissed ProElite for lack of personal jurisdiction , and deferred judgment concerning Showtime until further discovery is conducted .

Note 11 Shareholders ’ Equity
CBS and Showtime
In connection with a television distribution agreement , the Company and Showtime , an affiliate of CBS , entered into a Subscription Agreement dated as of February 22 , 2008 pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue two warrants to Showtime ( the " New Warrants " ) each for the purchase of 2,000,000 shares of the Company 's Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 2.00 per share .
The first New Warrant vests immediately and is for a term of five years from February 22 , 2008 .
The second New Warrant vests in four equal tranches of 500,000 shares with each respective tranche to vest if an Event is broadcast pursuant to the Broadcast Agreement .
The term of each tranche is five years from the date that such tranche vests .
Pursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement between the Company and Showtime dated as of February 22 , 2008 , the Company granted to Showtime certain registration rights with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the New Warrants , and Showtime agreed that such shares and the New Warrants are subject to certain transfers restrictions until March 5 , 2009 .
The value of the first New Warrant computed using a Black - Scholes model was approximately $ 2.3 million .
As of June 30 , 2008 , management determined the warrants issued in 2008 in connection with the CBS distribution agreement had no future value as the likelihood of realizing gross profit on the CBS events was remote .
Therefore , the entire $ 2.3 million value of these warrants was charged to cost of revenue during the three months ended June 30 , 2008 .
The value of the second New Warrant computed using a Black - Scholes model was approximately $ 2.5 million and will be charged to operations on the dates of the first four broadcasts under the television distribution agreement .
Additionally , Showtime exercised part of the warrants previously issued to Showtime in January 2007 .
The exercise was for an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of the Company 's Common Stock ( the " Warrant Shares " ) resulting in proceeds to the Company of $ 4,000,000 .
On June 18 , 2008 in connection with the $ 3.5 million face value note payable , the Company issued to Showtime a three - year warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock at $ 0.01 per share .
The value of this warrant calculated using a Black - Scholes model was $ 149,040 and will be charged to interest expense over the term of the note using the effective interest method .
Stock - Based Compensation
The Company adopted its 2006 Stock Option Plan and amended the plan in 2007 , reserving a total of 8,000,000 shares .
The plan provides for the issuance of statutory and non-statutory stock options to employees , directors and consultants , with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company ’s common stock on the date of grant .
Options granted under the plan generally vest quarterly over four years and have a life of 10 years .
As of June 30 , 2008 , options to purchase 5,281,797 shares of common stock had been granted under the plan .
20
The Company accounts for stock - based compensation arrangements with its employees , consultants and directors in accordance with SFAS No. 123 ( revised ) , “ Share - Based Payment ” ( SFAS No. 123R ) .
Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 R , the Company measures stock - based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period , which is generally the vesting period .
For the quarters ended June 30 , 2008 and 2007 , the Company incurred approximately $ 0.7 million and $ 0.2 million , respectively , of expense related to stock based compensation under this plan and approximately $ 1.1 million and $ 2.8 million , respectively , of expense related to warrants .
For the six months ended June 30 , 2008 and 2007 , the Company incurred approximately $ 1.2 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively , of expense related to stock based compensation under this plan and approximately $ 1.7 million and $ 2.9 million respectively , of expense related to warrants .
Stock Options
The Company uses a Black - Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock - based awards with the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table .
Six Months Ended June 31 , 2008 Six Months Ended June 31 , 2007 Black - Scholes Model : Risk - free interest rate 1.84 % - 3.41 % 4.50 - 4.84 % Expected life , in years 5.8 - 6.0 5.8 - 6.5 Expected volatility 96.0 % 60.0 % Dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 %
Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the share price of companies operating in similar industries .
The volatility of industry peers is considered more representative of expected volatility because there is currently minimal daily trading volume in the Company ’s stock .
The expected term is based on management ’s estimate of when the option will be exercised which is generally consistent with the vesting period .
The risk - free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant .
The following table represents stock option activity for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 :
Plan Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at December 31 , 2007 4,875,859 $ 2.77 Granted 1,555,000 $ 2.23 Forfeited ( 192,395 ) $ 2.91 Expired ( 956,667 ) $ 2.00 Exercised - $ - Outstanding at June 30 , 2008 5,281,797 $ 2.74 Exercisable at June 30 , 2008 2,655,235 $ 2.31

Burnett Warrants
Effective June 15 , 2007 ( and as amended on June 28 , 2007 and June 1 , 2008 ) , the Company entered into an agreement ( the " Series Agreement " ) with JMBP , Inc. ( " MBP " ) , wholly - owned by Mark Burnett ( " Burnett " ) in connection with a possible television series involving mixed martial arts ( " Series " ) for initial exhibition during prime time on one of specified networks or cable broadcasters .
MBP ( or a separate production services entity owned or controlled by MBP ) will render production services in connection with the Series and will be solely responsible for and have final approval regarding all production matters , including budget , schedule and production location .
It is anticipated that , as a condition to involvement in the Series , each of the Series contestants will sign a separate agreement with the Company or an affiliate of the Company for services rendered outside of the Series .
MBP will own all rights to the Series .
The Company and MBP will jointly exploit the Internet rights in connection with the Series on ProElite.com and other websites controlled by ProElite.com .
The Company will be entitled to a share of MBP's Modified Adjusted Gross Proceeds , as defined .
Subject to specified exceptions , MBP and Burnett have agreed to exclusivity with respect to mixed martial arts programming .
The term of the Agreement , as amended effective June 1 , 2008 , extends until the earlier of the end of the term of the license agreement with the broadcaster of the Series ( the “ License Agreement ” ) or the failure of MBP to enter into a License Agreement by November 17 , 2008 .
Pursuant to the Series Agreement , the Company and Burnett entered into a Subscription Agreement ( the “ Subscription Agreement ” ) relating to the issuance to Burnett of warrants to purchase up to 17,000,000 shares of the Company 's common stock .
As amended effective June 1 , 2008 , the warrants are divided into nine tranches as follows :
Tranche Number of Shares under Warrants Vesting Date One 2,000,000 June 15 , 2007
Two 2,000,000 500,000 shares to be vested on each of June 15 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 and 2011 .
Three 1,000,000
The date that the pilot or first episode of a Series is broadcast on a Network or Cable Broadcaster .
Four 1,000,000
The date that the second episode of a Series is broadcast on a network or cable broadcaster .
Five 2,000,000
The date that the pilot or first episode of an additional Series is broadcast on a specified network or cable broadcaster .
Six 1,000,000
The last day of the first completed season of any Series .
Seven 2,000,000
The last day of any additional completed season of any series ( or the last day of the first completed season of any additional series ) .
Eight 4,000,000 1,333,333 shares to be vested on the last day of each additional completed season of any series .
Nine 2,000,000 1,000,000 shraes to be vested on the date of broadcast of each of the first two derivative pay - per - view events .
23
The vesting date of each tranche is subject to acceleration under certain circumstances .
However , the warrants are not exercisable if a License Agreement is not entered into by June 15 , 2008 , except for 1,000,000 warrants from tranche one .
Additionally , the warrants and any shares purchased through exercise of the warrants are subject to forfeiture , except for 1,000,000 warrants from tranche one , if a License Agreement is not entered into by November 17 , 2008 .
The warrants have an exercise price of $ 3.00 per share .
The exercise price is reduced if the Company issues or sells shares of its common stock , excluding shares issued as compensation for services or in connection with acquisitions , for less than $ 3.00 per share .
The expiration date for a particular tranche of warrants is the latest to occur of ( i ) June 15 , 2013 ; ( ii ) the date which is one year after the vesting date of any such tranche , and ( iii ) one year after the expiration of the term of the License Agreement .
The value of the warrants under the June 1 , 2008 amendment was less than the previously calculated value .
Therefore , the previous warrant values will be used for any expense to be recognized .
The value of the warrants was calculated as approximately $ 2.6 million for tranche one and $ 2.9 million for tranche two using a Black - Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions : expected term of 3 years ( for tranche one ) and from 3 to 4 years ( for separate 500,000 vesting blocks of tranche two ) , expected volatility of 60 % , risk - free interest rate of 5.07 % to 5.09 % and dividend yield of 0 % .
The value of the tranche one warrants was charged to expense in June 2007 .
The value of the tranche two warrants is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of each 500,000 warrant vesting block ( i.e. , from 1 to 4 years ) .
The current value of warrants in tranches three through nine was calculated as approximately : $ 1.8 million ( tranche three ) , $ 1.8 million ( tranche four ) , $ 3.6 million ( tranche five ) , $ 1.8 million ( tranche six ) , $ 3.6 million ( tranche seven ) , $ 7.3 million ( tranche eight ) , and $ 3.6 million ( tranche nine ) or approximately $ 23.7 million in aggregate .
The values were calculated using a Black - Scholes option pricing model with an expected term of 6 years , expected volatility of 60 % , risk - free interest rate of 5.1 % and dividend yield of 0 % .
The Company will begin expensing the value of these tranches once there is a reasonable likelihood of achieving the performance criteria of each tranche ( as described above ) and would be based on the current values at that time .
During the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 , the Company recognized approximately $ 0.3 million expense related to tranche three based upon the status of production of a series pilot .
No expense has been recognized related to tranches four through nine .
The Company , Burnett and Santa Monica Capital Partners II LLC , ( " SMCP " ) , one of the Company 's shareholders , entered into an Investor Rights Agreement providing certain registration rights with respect to the shares purchasable under the warrants , co-sale rights with SMCP , restrictions on resale and board observation rights .

Overview
Mixed Martial Arts , commonly referred to as MMA , is a sport growing in popularity around the world .
In MMA matches , athletes use a combination of a variety of fighting styles , including boxing , judo , jiu jitsu , karate , kickboxing , muay thai , tae kwon do , and wrestling .
Typically , MMA sporting events are promoted either as championship matches or as vehicles for well - known individual athletes .
Professional MMA competition conduct is regulated primarily by rules implemented by state athletic commissions and is currently permitted in twenty - one states .
Athletes win individual matches by knockout , technical knockout ( referee or doctor stoppage ) , submission , or judges ’ decision .
Since the Company ’s formation in August 2006 , we have established ourselves as a leading , global promoter of live MMA events and provider of a social - networking website focused exclusively on MMA .
We have agreements to distribute content by television and DVD throughout the world .
To date , we have focused our efforts primarily on events in the United States and United Kingdom and on our website .
In 2007 , we accomplished the following strategic objectives :
· Acquired well - regarded MMA live event brands throughout the world :
· King of the Cage , Inc. ( “ KOTC ” ) , a promoter of live MMA events , that has historically produced in excess of 20 events per year .
· Mixed Martial Arts Promotions , Ltd. and Mixed Martial Arts Productions , Ltd. ( together “ Cage Rage ” ) , a United Kingdom - based promoter of live MMA events .
26
· The assets of Future Fight Promotions , Inc. ( “ ICON ” ) , a Hawaii - based promoter of live MMA events .
· Invested in Entlian Corp. , a South Korea - based promoter of live MMA events .
· Launched our social - networking MMA community website , www.proelite.com.
During 2008 , the Company increased the number of live events that it promoted .
In February 2008 , the Company signed a television distribution agreement with CBS , which led to the first MMA event broadcast on network television on May 31 , 2008 .
In June 2008 , the Company amended its Series Agreement with JMBP , Inc. and Mark Burnett , extending the time to secure an agreement to run a MMA reality television pilot episode , which has been filmed .
The Company also began a series of reductions costs designed to reduce monthly expenditures and improve the profitability of live events .
There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its efforts to reduce expenses .
In 2008 , the Company encountered liquidity issues .
The Company ’s auditors have issued a going concern opinion in their report for the year ended December 31 , 2007 that states substantial doubt exists about the Company ’s ability to continue as a going concern .
In June 2008 , the Company secured $ 3.0 million proceeds from a note payable from Showtime .
Additionally , the Company is actively negotiating to consummate a financing of approximately $ 3.5 million in secured debt ( with a funded amount of $ 3.0 million after an original issue discount of $ 0.5 million ) and believes a successful closing is reasonably likely , but there is no assurance that it will be successful in doing so at all or on a timely basis .
Any such failure to obtain financing in the immediate future would have a material adverse effect on the Company ’s liquidity and capital resources and ability to continue as a going concern .
Even if the Company successfully closes on such financing , it expects that its capital resources are sufficient only until the end of the year , and only if the Company makes significant reductions in or cessation of operations and expenditures .
The Company is also actively seeking additional financing beyond the $ 3.0 million to enable the Company to execute its operating plans without significant reductions in operations , but there is no assurance as to whether any such financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all .
Liquidity matters are discussed in more detail below .
Results of Operations
For the three months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Revenue
Revenue from live events , consisting primarily of ticket sales , site fees and sponsorship , was $ 2,027,351 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 1,488,558 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The increase was due to higher operating activity in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007 when the Company commenced operations and to newly acquired subsidiaries .
The Company ’s EliteXC subsidiary earned revenue of approximately $ 1.3 million from promoting three events in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $ 1.5 million from promoting two events in the second quarter of 2007 .
Also , the Company ’s KOTC and Cage Rage subsidiaries , which were acquired in September 2007 , earned live event revenues of $ 0.5 million and $ 0.5 million , respectively , during the second quarter of 2008 .
Revenue from pay - per- view programming ( PPV ) and television licensing was $ 178,866 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 10,858 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The increase was primarily due to acquisitions in late 2007 .
The Company began earning television license fees in 2008 under the distribution agreement with Showtime and under the distribution agreement with CBS signed in 2008 .
In 2007 , the Company earned no television license fees from Showtime or CBS .
In the second quarter of 2008 , the Company received television license fees of $ 925,000 from Showtime and CBS .
27
Revenue from our website was $ 208,990 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 16,963 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
This increase was primarily due to licensing the Company ’s social networking technology .
Other revenues , which includes DVD sales and fees for licensing fighters under contract , was $ 346,442 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 0 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The increase was due to the Company releasing DVD titles of its live events for sale during the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 and to the acquisition of KOTC , which had DVD distribution agreements in place at acquisition .
Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue for live event production ( excluding expenses payable to Showtime and CBS ) was $ 2,865,002 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 2,495,618 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
Live event production costs consist principally of fighters purses , arena rental and related expenses ( e.g. , staffing , staging , and video equipment rental ) , event - specific marketing expenses ( e.g. , Internet , radio and television advertising , posters and street teams ) , and travel .
Live event production costs increased primarily due to inclusion of the KOTC and Cage Rage subsidiaries ( acquired in September 2007 ) .
Cost of revenue for KOTC and Cage Rage were approximately $ 0.3 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively , for the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 .
Our EliteXC subsidiary incurred costs of approximately $ 1.7 million to promote three events in the second quarter of 2008 compared to approximately $ 2.2 million to promote two events in the second quarter of 2007 .
The decrease in these expenses for the EliteXC subsidiary was primarily the result of “ Barker shows ” ( i.e. , event - specific promotional videos ) produced in 2007 ( for approximately $ 0.6 million ) but not in 2008 and to a charge of $ 0.3 million for set equipment abandoned in 2007 .
These decreases were partially offset by higher purses , marketing and travel .
Also included in non-cash cost of revenue was a non-cash expense of $ 2.3 million related to expensing prepaid distribution costs .
As of June 30 , 2008 , management determined the likelihood of realizing gross profit on the CBS events was remote .
Therefore , the entire $ 2.3 million prepaid distribution costs were charged to cost of revenue during the three months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Additionally , we incurred related - party production costs for television production by Showtime of $ 500,000 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 1,127,060 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The decrease was as a result of the terms of the distribution agreement with Showtime .
This agreement called for the Company to pay production expenses in 2007 but not in 2008 for events distributed on Showtime .
In 2008 , the Company used Showtime ’s production staff to produce the event broadcast on CBS in May 2008 and incurred expenses of approximately $ 0.5 million .
We expect cost of revenue for live events will increase in 2008 as we promote more events .
However , we expect television production costs payable to Showtime to decrease in 2008 in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement .
Cost of revenue for our website was $ 34,237 for three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 53,259 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 and consisted primarily of merchandise sold through our online store and Internet streaming expenses .
Marketing expenses
Marketing expenses primarily consist of marketing , advertising and promotion expenses not directly related to MMA events .
Marketing , advertising and promotion expenses related directly to MMA events are charged to cost of revenue .
Marketing expenses were $ 107,713 for the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 165,544 for the quarter ended June 30 , 2007 and primarily consisted of Internet and print advertising , public relations and marketing consultants .
We anticipate marketing expenses will decrease as we shift marketing efforts towards specific events ( which are recorded in cost of revenue ) and away from brand awareness campaigns .
28
Website operations
Website operations expenses were $ 666,201 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 772,008 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The decrease was due primarily to staffing reductions initiated in January 2008 .
Live events operations
Live events operations expenses were $ 1,381,590 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 395,609 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
Live events operations expenses consist primarily of wages and consultants ’ fees related to day - to - day administration of the Company ’s live events .
The increase was primarily the result of acquiring KOTC and Cage Rage in September 2007 .
KOTC and Cage Rage incurred operating expenses of approximately $ 0.3 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively , during the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 .
In 2008 , we expect expenses related to our fight operations to increase due to higher average staffing levels than 2007 and inclusion of a full year of operations of companies acquired in late 2007 .
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $ 3,247,118 for the three months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 4,394,153 for the three months ended June 30 , 2007 .
A significant component of general and administrative expenses was non-cash expense related to option and warrant grants of approximately $ 0.9 million in the second quarter of 2008 versus approximately $ 3.1 million in the second quarter of 2007 .
The decrease in option and warrant expense was primarily due to exercisable warrants issued to JMBP , Inc. in June 2007 .
The increase in general and administrative expenses was also due to higher employee head count resulting in wages of approximately $ 0.9 million in the second quarter of 2008 versus $ 0.4 million in the second quarter of 2007 and consulting fees of $ 0.4 million in the second quarter of 2008 versus $ 0.3 million in the second quarter of 2007 .
Also , legal expenses increased to $ 0.3 million in the second quarter of 2008 from $ 0.1 million in the second quarter of 2007 .
In the first and second quarters of 2008 , the Company reduced staffing and did not rehire for open positions resulting from employee turnover in an effort to cut costs .
However , we expect 2008 general and administrative expenses will increase over 2007 primarily due to higher average staffing levels .
During the three months ended June 30 , 2008 , the Company recognized impairment charges totaling approximately $ 10.3 million related to goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and other assets resulting from the acquisitions of Cage Rage , KOTC and ICON .
The impairment charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets to estimated fair value .
The Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $ 5.2 million related to a change in the operating plan of Cage Rage and a charge of approximately $ 0.9 million related to future realization of assets acquired .
The Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $ 2.4 million related to unfavorable industry trends ( i.e. , increasing fighter purses ) affecting KOTC .
The Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $ 1.8 million due to a recessionary economy affecting ICON ’s market .
For the six months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Revenue
Revenue from live events , consisting primarily of ticket sales , site fees and sponsorship , was $ 5,084,790 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 1,799,661 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The increase was due to higher operating activity in 2008 compared to 2007 when the Company commenced operations and to newly acquired subsidiaries .
The Company ’s EliteXC subsidiary earned revenue of approximately $ 3.7 million from promoting eight events in 2008 compared to $ 1.9 million from three events in 2007 .
Also , the Company ’s KOTC and Cage Rage subsidiaries , which were acquired in September 2007 , earned live event revenues of $ 0.9 million and $ 1.0 million , respectively , during 2008 .
Revenue from pay - per- view programming ( PPV ) and television licensing was $ 314,141 for 2008 compared to $ 10,858 for 2007 .
The increase was primarily due to acquisitions in late 2007 .
29
The Company began earning television license fees in 2008 under the distribution agreement with Showtime and under the distribution agreement with CBS signed in 2008 .
In 2007 , the Company earned no television license fees from Showtime or CBS .
In 2008 , the Company received television license fees of $ 2,125,000 from Showtime and CBS .
Revenue from our website was $ 235,454 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 20,463 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
This increase was primarily due to licensing the Company ’s social networking technology .
Other revenues , which includes DVD sales and fees for licensing fighters under contract , was $ 465,912 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 0 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The increase was due to the Company releasing DVD titles of its live events for sale during the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 and to the acquisition of KOTC , which had DVD distribution agreements in place at acquisition .
Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue for live event production ( excluding expenses payable to Showtime and CBS ) was $ 7,013,024 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 3,402,308 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
Live event production costs consist principally of fighters purses , arena rental and related expenses ( e.g. , staffing , staging , and video equipment rental ) , event - specific marketing expenses ( e.g. , Internet , radio and television advertising , posters and street teams ) , and travel .
Live event production costs increased primarily due to inclusion of the KOTC and Cage Rage subsidiaries ( acquired in September 2007 ) .
Cost of revenue for KOTC and Cage Rage were approximately $ 0.7 million and $ 1.5 million , respectively , for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Our EliteXC subsidiary incurred costs of approximately $ 5.0 million to promote eight events in 2008 compared to approximately $ 3.4 million to promote three events in 2007 .
The increase in EliteXC ’s expenses was primarily due to producing more events resulting in increases in fight purses to $ 2.4 million in 2008 from $ 1.2 million in 2007 , arena and related expenses to $ 1.2 million in 2008 from $ 0.4 million in 2007 , and event - specific marketing to $ 0.5 million from $ 0.3 million in 2007 .
These increases were partially offset by reduced production spending of $ 0.2 million in 2008 versus $ 1.0 million in 2007 primarily due to no Barker shows produced in 2008 ( i.e. , event - specific promotional videos produced in 2007 for approximately $ 0.6 million ) and a charge of $ 0.3 million for set equipment abandoned in 2007 .
Also included in non-cash cost of revenue was a non-cash expense of $ 2.3 million related to expensing prepaid distribution costs .
As of June 30 , 2008 , management determined the likelihood of realizing gross profit on the CBS events was remote .
Therefore , the entire $ 2.3 million prepaid distribution costs were charged to cost of revenue during the six months ended June 30 , 2008 .
Additionally , we incurred related - party production costs for television production by Showtime of $ 500,000 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 2,460,835 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The decrease was as a result of the terms of the distribution agreement with Showtime .
This agreement called for the Company to pay production expenses in 2007 but not in 2008 for events distributed on Showtime .
In 2008 , the Company used Showtime ’s production staff to produce the event broadcast on CBS in May 2008 and incurred expenses of approximately $ 0.5 million .
We expect cost of revenue for live events will increase in 2008 as we promote more events .
However , we expect television production costs payable to Showtime to decrease in 2008 in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement .
Cost of revenue for our website was $ 63,138 for six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 111,814 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 and consisted primarily of merchandise sold through our online store and Internet streaming expenses .
Marketing expenses
Marketing expenses primarily consist of marketing , advertising and promotion expenses not directly related to MMA events .
Marketing , advertising and promotion expenses related directly to MMA events are charged to cost of revenue .
Marketing expenses were $ 206,878 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 269,438 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 and primarily consisted of Internet and print advertising , public relations and marketing consultants .
We anticipate marketing expenses will decrease as we shift marketing efforts towards specific events ( which are recorded in cost of revenue ) and away from brand awareness campaigns .
30
Website operations
Website operations expenses were $ 1,390,464 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 1,187,167 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
The increase was due primarily to higher average staffing levels in 2008 than in 2007 .
In the first and third quarters of 2008 , the Company reduced staffing and did not rehire for open positions resulting from employee turnover in an effort to cut costs .
Therefore , we expect website operations expenses will decrease in 2008 .
Live events operations
Live events operations expenses were $ 2,722,882 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 731,558 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
Live events operations expenses consist primarily of wages and consultants ’ fees related to day - to - day administration of the Company ’s live events .
The increase was primarily the result of acquiring KOTC and Cage Rage in September 2007 .
KOTC and Cage Rage incurred operating expenses of approximately $ 0.7 million and $ 1.5 million , respectively , during 2008 .
In 2008 , we expect expenses related to our fight operations to increase due to higher average staffing levels than 2007 and inclusion of a full year of operations of companies acquired in late 2007 .
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $ 6,945,746 for the six months ended June 30 , 2008 compared to $ 6,223,907 for the six months ended June 30 , 2007 .
A significant component of general and administrative expenses was non-cash expense related to option and warrant grants of approximately $ 2.3 million in 2008 versus approximately $ 3.2 million in 2007 .
The decrease in option and warrant expense was primarily due to exercisable warrants issued to Burnett in June 2007 offset by additional option and warrant grants in 2008 .
Contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses were higher employee head count resulting in wages and consulting fees of approximately $ 1.8 million in 2008 versus $ 0.6 million in 2007 and consulting fees of $ 0.7 million in 2008 versus $ 0.6 million in 2007 .
Legal expenses increased to $ 0.6 million in 2008 from $ 0.3 million in 2007 related primarily to ongoing litigation .
Insurance expense increased to $ 0.4 million in 2008 from $ 0.1 million in 2007 as the Company expanded its policy coverage , and rent expense increased to $ 0.2 million in 2008 from $ 0.1 million in 2007 due to moving to new office space .
In the first and second quarters of 2008 , the Company reduced staffing and did not rehire for open positions resulting from employee turnover in an effort to cut costs .
However , we expect 2008 general and administrative expenses will increase over 2007 primarily due to higher average staffing levels .
During the quarter ended June 30 , 2008 , the Company recognized impairment charges totaling approximately $ 10.3 million related to goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of Cage Rage , KOTC and ICON .

washington --
The sharpening rhetoric between John McCain and Barack Obama over their competing plans to overhaul the nation ’s tax system has underscored one of the most profound differences between them -- how they would target America ’s wealthiest taxpayers .
Under McCain , the rich would see their tax burden ease .
Under Obama , their rates would rise dramatically .
For much of the campaign , the two candidates have talked sparingly and obliquely about how they would deal with affluent taxpayers .
But a recent volley of acid - edged campaign ads stirred up the tax issue , and a question posed last weekend by Orange County pastor Rick Warren zeroed in on how both men defined “ rich . ”
Obama said the dividing line was an income of $ 250,000 a year , while McCain responded somewhat flippantly that it was $ 5 million .
McCain aides said later that the senator was joking , but his remark quickly became a campaign flashpoint .

“ I guess if you ’re making $ 3 million a year , you ’re middle class , ” Obama sniped , prompting a McCain aide to fire back : “ It ’s not the job of the government to define who is rich . ”
Where to draw the line among the nation ’s wealthiest taxpayers is the central difference between rival tax blueprints that offer starkly differing formulas for reviving a faltering economy .
On Tuesday , new ads from both camps played on the public ’s rising anxiety about taxes , incomes and the volatile economy .
“ Three Times , ” an Obama television ad airing from Virginia to Colorado , savages McCain for lavishing $ 200 - billion tax “ giveaways ” on “ big corporations . ”
McCain responded with “ Millions , ” a radio ad that predicts Obama will “ raise taxes on your income , your electric bills , even your life savings . ”
The two camps immediately issued rebuttals , each claiming its position on taxes was being distorted by the opposition .
The Obama campaign contended that the overwhelming majority of Americans would not see a tax increase under his plan , only the wealthiest 5 % or so .
The McCain side retorted that the " $ 4 billion ” in tax breaks for oil companies mentioned in Obama ’s ad was misleading because McCain is proposing an across - the - board tax cut for all corporations and is not favoring the oil industry .

A close look at their proposals shows that the differences fall neatly along the traditional policy gulf that has long divided Republicans and Democrats : liberating the wealthy with tax cuts to stimulate the nation ’s prosperity versus raising their rates to redistribute the tax burden and pay for crucial government programs .
“ The real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets .
It gets to the heart of their economic philosophies , ” said Leonard E. Burman , a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center , a nonpartisan Washington - based tax reform group that has questioned the details of both tax plans .
Both candidates have promised to balance their tax relief programs with budget cuts designed to trim soaring deficits .
But the Tax Policy Center has warned that both plans -- coupled with the candidates ’ high - cost healthcare proposals -- would balloon the $ 9.6 - trillion national debt .
The center ’s analysis reported that McCain ’s tax proposals would add $ 5 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years , while Obama ’s would add $ 3.6 trillion .
“ Both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in Iraq , ” Burman said .
“ That ’s a big assumption . ”

McCain ’s plan would cater to wealthy taxpayers and corporations by extending and expanding President Bush ’s tax cuts , slashing corporate taxes and weakening the estate tax , but it would also aid taxpayers across the board by making the full Bush cuts permanent .
A deficit hawk and formerly a critic of the massive tax cuts launched in 2001 by the Bush administration , McCain now embraces the tax policies of supply - side economists who contend that lifting the tax yoke on the rich would encourage investment and stimulate the economy .
“ Wealth creates wealth , ” McCain said during a primary debate in Michigan last year .
Under his proposals , McCain would make all the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts permanent .
That would keep the two highest tax brackets at their current rates of 33 % and 35 % -- rather than reverting to 36 % and 39.6 % , where they were during the Clinton administration .
The tax cuts have “ been law for eight years now , and taxpayers are used to those rates , ” said J.D. Foster , a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington .
“ Allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase . ”

McCain also has proposed a sharp reduction in corporate taxes .
He would pare the two highest corporate tax brackets , 34 % and 35 % , down to 25 % .
The top bracket would be immediately eliminated , and the 34 % bracket would be phased down to 25 % between 2009 and 2014 .
He would also maintain the 15 % tax rates on dividends and capital gains for the highest - tier taxpayers .
And starting in 2010 , McCain would substantially reduce the estate tax .
He would increase the exemption on inherited funds from $ 3.5 million to $ 5 million and sharply lower taxes on remaining wealth from 45 % to 15 % -- moves that would enable affluent families to hold on to more of their wealth .
Democratic - leaning economists say McCain ’s plan offers little new aid to squeezed middle - class families .
And they question whether corporations and wealthy Americans would convert McCain - era tax savings into new investments that would bolster the economy .
“ McCain does nothing about income inequality , ” said John Irons , research and policy director for the Economic Policy Institute , a center - left think tank backed by labor interests .
“ It ’s skewed toward upper - income Americans to the exclusion of most everyone else . ”

Obama ’s tax plan skews the other way , aimed at strengthening benefits for lower - rung taxpayers and raising rates at the top .
His plan would restore the Clinton - era rates for the two highest tax brackets to 36 % and 39.6 % .
In Springfield , Mo. , last month , Obama pledged that if “ you ’re a family making less than $ 250,000 a year , you will not see your taxes go up . ”
Obama would exempt seniors making less than $ 50,000 a year from paying any income tax .
And he would make the Bush cuts permanent for poor and middle - class Americans , adding tax breaks such as a refundable credit for wage earners and a higher - education credit for students who agree to perform 100 hours of community service .
Under Obama ’s plan , the highest corporate tax tier would hold at 35 % -- a nod to Wall Street but higher than McCain ’s slashed rate .
Obama would raise the highest rate on dividends and capital gains from 15 % to 20 % .
And he would keep the estate tax in the same form approved by Congress for 2009 , with an exemption for the first $ 3.5 million and a top tax rate of 45 % .
That would mean a higher tax rate on the wealthy than McCain would allow .

As for the onerous alternative minimum tax , both candidates would allow more than 23 million middle - class taxpayers to avoid it by extending a 2007 “ patch ” that raises the amount of income triggering the AMT .
In 2007 , the AMT was triggered at $ 44,350 for single taxpayers and $ 66,250 for those filing jointly .
McCain would increase that income trigger each year by 5 % , starting in 2013 ; Obama would index it for inflation to maintain the patch .
Conservative economists caution that Obama ’s tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations would increase the drag on the sluggish economy .
“ It would lead to disincentives for savings and productivity , ” said Alan D. Viard , a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who is now a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
“ Over time , it would mean less capital accumulated and would ultimately force wages lower . ”
Former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers waved off those concerns in a recent Obama campaign conference call , recalling that similar conservative alarms preceded a “ seven - year stretch ” of good times during the Clinton years .
“ The Obama tax plan is to be preferred on grounds of [ tax ] equity , ” Summers said .
“ And because it ’s more fiscally responsible , it is also likely to lead to better economic growth . ”
But economists on both sides of the debate acknowledge that strong Democratic gains expected in Congress might lead to an Obama - like tax structure even if McCain wins the White House .

“ A lot of this debate could turn out to be academic , ” Viard said , “ if a Democratic Congress wo n’t extend the Bush tax program . ”

Science Idol was a contest sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists to find the best political cartoon dealing with science .
They just announced the winner : Justin Bilicki , for this cartoon :
It 's a good cartoon : funny , pithy , and makes its point .
But there were lots of other entries , and in the fine tradition of Monday - morning quarterbacking , I have to say I like some of them better ... like this one , and this one .
Still , most of them are pretty good , and the root mission was a good one : expose and air out political intervention in science .
I think we need a lot more vocal opposition to it , and I 'm glad to see it popularized in this way !
Fans of football teams with no hope of winning the league get their thrills from derbies or the occasional giant killing in the early rounds of the FA Cup .
In politics , the top prizes are sewn up even more tidily than the Premier League .
At Westminster , Labour and the Tories fight over first place , while the Liberal Democrats creatively explore different ways to come third .
A new season is about to get under way and , while no one can rule out a spectacular upset , it looks as if Team Cameron has the title in the bag .
Scotland and Wales have their own nationalist dynamics , of course .
But in England , too , there is action away from the centre that , like a good mid-table clash , makes for compelling viewing , even though less is ostensibly at stake .
The prize is fourth place and two parties - the Greens and the BNP - are in contention .
In London 's mayoral election , the Green candidate Sian Berry and the BNP 's Richard Barnbrook received 77,374 and 69,710 votes respectively .
The Greens also kept the BNP in fifth place in the ballot for the London Assembly , taking two seats to the BNP 's one .
Meanwhile , the far right beat the environmentalists in four out of 14 Assembly constituencies .
Nationally , at local council level , the Greens are just ahead of the BNP - 47 seats to 37 - though the far right made twice as many gains as the Greens in May 's elections .
In June 's Henley byelection , 73 votes separated the Greens and the BNP in third and fourth places .
Labour came fifth .
So what ?
First past the post makes it impossible for tiny parties to break through and , with around 1 per cent of the national vote each , these minnows would struggle under any voting system .
Westminster is not about to be overrun by hippies or fascists .
But the Green versus BNP competition matters .
For a start , if a party dedicated to saving the ' traditional British genotype ' from ' extinction ' by mixed - race marriages gets roughly as many votes as a party dedicated to saving the planet from climate change , something is wrong .
Of course , the Greens have had their issue poached by the big three , while the far right has anti-miscegenation policy all to itself .
But fringe parties do n't compete with the mainstream in the usual way .
If voters are simply shopping around for a party that sounds tough on immigration , for example , they could vote Tory or , for that matter , Labour , which has tacked steadily rightwards on the issue in recent years .
The point of the BNP is that they see everything - housing , the economy , crime - through the prism of race .
When mainstream politicians talk about immigration as a problem , the potential BNP voter takes it as confirmation of his fears , while retaining the suspicion that the Establishment wo n't do anything about it .
Green voters feel similarly about their cause .
Labour and Tory pledges on the environment are seen as empty rhetoric .
( The crucial difference is that the Greens ' cause is a good one . )
A fringe party represents people who meet two criteria .
First , they deeply distrust the three main players , seeing them as out of touch , dishonest and incapable of addressing some issue that matters to them above all others .
Second , they bother to vote .
Think of the Greens and the BNP competing to lead the political wing of British cynicism .
Clearly , that is another reason why we should care which of them does better .
That cynicism thrives when people feel alienated from a distant ruling class , believing that , for all their professed differences , the main parties are basically ' all the same ' .
That is not a difficult proposition to sell at the moment .
The great truism of English politics is that elections are won on the centre ground .
Tony Blair held it for 10 years , now David Cameron claims it .
A big argument these days amounts to the whether there should be more academy schools or loads more academy schools ?
Should the NHS be opened up to ' competition ' or just ' contestability ' ?
And that is the concrete stuff .
In the absence of competing policies , a bizarre battle has erupted for possession of abstract nouns .
Immigration Minister Liam Byrne , often dubbed a ' rising star ' of the Labour party ( can stars rise when the sky is falling ? ) , wrote an article last week rubbishing David Cameron 's claim to the idea of ' fraternity ' .
The Tories , meanwhile , in a bid to undermine a Gordon Brown comeback in the autumn , are campaigning this week on the issue of ' fairness ' , the Prime Minister 's new favourite word after he lost ' prudence ' to the credit crunch .
All this posturing is based on evidence that the voting public , as it showed by rejecting the Tories in their angry , sulking years , likes moderation .
But that does n't tell you anything about the non-voting public .
More people abstained in both of the last two general elections than endorsed the winning side .
That might be because we are a nation of sloths who only bother to choose between candidates if they are up for eviction via premium - rate phone line .
But it is also because political debate has become so arcane and is getting worse .
Is David Miliband Blairite , post - Blairite or Blair - lite ?
To people with better things to do than read think - tank pamphlets all day , the difference is not obvious .
All parties are in the centre , but with no clear direction of travel .
Their political compasses are liable to be influenced by whichever fringe manages to exert the strongest magnetic pull .
That gives influence to a maverick fourth party , especially when one of the big three is lost in the wilderness .
When the Tories were in disarray , they were further destabilised by the UK Independence party .
The presence of a militant anti-Europe wing over the past decade successfully skewed mainstream politics .
England now has a fixed Eurosceptic bias .
Ukip looks like a spent force .
It did n't achieve withdrawal from the EU , but helped to shape the debate .
The same process could affect the way mainstream parties talk about the environment or immigration , depending on how the Greens and the BNP perform .
The BNP 's recent local election results were surprisingly good given that the party is in schism .
Last year , a ' Real BNP ' faction formed in rebellion against party leader Nick Griffin , who is accused of failing to modernise , being ' arrogant ' ( just like in ordinary politics ) and deploying the ' security department ' of the party to burgle rebel members ' homes ( not so like ordinary politics ) .
Richard Barnbrook , who , as a London Assembly member , is the BNP 's highest elected official , has a different challenge building a substantial far right following .
He has to live down HMS Discovery : A Love Story , a film he made in 1989 that includes scenes of naked men frolicking and a soundtrack of apparently gay erotic poetry .
' It was an art film , end of story .
Not a bloody porn film , ' he says .
For the Greens , the problem has not been too many leaders , but none at all .
They have traditionally been led by two ' principal speakers ' mandated to represent the party in public , but not decide policy .
That will change next month when they hold their first leadership election , which is almost certain to be won by MEP Caroline Lucas .
She is intelligent and articulate .
Griffin just about manages louche charisma .
The question is : which of them would we rather see hogging the airwaves on election night ?
Both parties are hoping to gain their first Westminster seat at the next election - the Greens in Brighton Pavilion , the BNP in the new east London constituency of Dagenham and Rainham .
Both need the votes of disgruntled Labour supporters to win .
If , as looks likely , the Tories are cruising towards an easy victory , disproportionate attention will be paid to the impact of wild - card candidates .
( Remember a foaming Jimmy Goldsmith taunting David Mellor out of his seat in 1997 ? )
As Labour heads into the wilderness , there will be much opining on what the protest vote meant .
Everyone takes some interest in who tops the political Premier League .
After all , the winner gets to run the country .
But there are rewards available lower down the table .
There is a nail - biting competition for the Uefa Cup place of English politics - the opportunity to give political shape to much wider scepticism and disillusionment ; to be the flag - bearer for anti-Establishment feeling .
Our nation would be in a sorry state if the BNP beat the Greens to that prize .
· Andrew Rawnsley is away .
· This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008 .
In London 's mayoral election , the Green candidate Sian Berry did not comfortably beat the BNP 's Richard Barnbrook by 409,101 votes to 198,319 , as suggested in the article above .
The candidates received 77,374 and 69,710 votes respectively .
This has been corrected .

How to create a non-fiction bestseller
Yes , book sales are way down across the board in tech books ( actually all books , but tech books especially ) , but that does n't mean the market 's gone .
It does mean there are far fewer guarantees of success , though .
Even those who still have tech jobs are probably having to pay for books out of their own pocket , unlike the days when employers let us login to Amazon to click and buy with abandon .
So you can't just get something out there and expect it to sell , even if it is on the hottest topic , and even if you do have an established name and reputation , and even if your publisher is committed -- with marketing bucks and a plan - - to making a hit .
But what prompted me to write this is a disturbing trend toward viewing technical books as a crap shoot .
A big gamble .
You roll the dice and assume that most books wo n't be bestsellers , but hey -- you might get lucky .
Luck has nothing to do with it !!
( Well , I 'll qualify that : luck is a factor if you 're writing about a new , unproven topic because you 're trying to get a jump on the market , and you 're betting on the fact that the topic / technology will take hold . )
First , a disclaimer for those who do n't know me : I 'm a relative newcomer to books , ( two years ) , and what I 'm about to say conflicts with what many of the most experienced people in this industry are suggesting .
However , my partner Bert and I have five current bestsellers -- which is extremely rare in the tech book world today -- and all of these books are still in their first editions ( correction , we just released a second edition of one of our books ( Head First Java ) , and it 's just starting to show up in bestseller lists , so temporarily at least , we have six bestsellers , although the second edition will eventually cause the first edition to drop out ) .
In fact , every book we 've put out has been an instant bestseller , and taken over the top slot in its category .
But that 's not the amazing part .
The amazing part is that we 're not good writers , and we are n't established " names " .
But we refuse to believe that we just keep getting ridiculously lucky .
We 're making our living on this , so we can't afford to leave it to chance .
We believe there 's a formula , and that almost anyone can follow it .
Oh yes , one more disclaimer : the word " bestseller " does n't necessarily mean " big bucks " , because the total size of the market has dropped so low .
( I 'll say a little more on the numbers later . )
But a " bestseller " today does mean the difference between a book that does n't even earn back its advance , and one that gives you and your publisher a nice steady source of income long after you 've finished it and moved on to something else .
The formula ?
It 's multi-part .
What to do and what not to do .
First , do n't listen to this advice from Dave Taylor ( although you should listen to virtually everything else he says ... they guys knows frickin ' everything about everything , and has written way more books than we have .
This is the only area where I violently disagree with his advice ) :
" ... do n't go into writing a technical book with the expectation that you 'll make any money .
... unlike the heyday of the late 1990's , a technical book that sells 5,000 copies is considered a success in the industry today .
So why write a technical book ?
One good reason is because it's a great calling card , a demonstration that you 're a thought leader in your field and an expert on the subject . "
I hear this same thing everywhere from virtually every other tech book author I know , see , or read about .
It 's a trap !
I hardly know where to begin , but I 'll try ...
1 ) It 's unethical .
Unless you 're self - publishing , you are risking your time ( and opportunity costs ) while your publisher is risking real money .
Your publisher is not in business solely to help you pursue your career goals and build a better resume .
Would you willingly and enthusiastically go into business with someone who said , " well , it 's not like it 's going to make any money , but at least it 'll be good on my resume . " ?
But that 's what you 're asking your publisher to do .
And believe me , the downturn has hurt these folks hard .
Our main publisher is O'Reilly , and we feel like we 're in a partnership with them .
We want them to do well because it benefits everyone .
They 're a fabulous , innovative publisher interested in getting knowledge from one person and spreading / sharing it to others .
I believe that doing a book with the attitude that " it is n't going to make money , but it 'll help me " is taking advantage of the publisher .
There are lots of people at O'Reilly we care about who have jobs they 'd like to keep .
( Same with Osborne / McGraw - Hill , who published our very first book . )
But let 's say you do n't care about the publisher , and maybe you 've even heard they have a reputation for ripping people off at every turn .
That 's not our view , but it might be valid for publishers we do n't know anything about .
So there 's a far more important reason to not have this attitude , and it's the one that affects you the most :
2 ) It 's self - fulfilling .
If you go in with the attitude that you 're doing it solely for your reputation , and not to have it earn out , it dramatically increases the chances that this is exactly what you 'll get .
A book that does n't ( or barely ) earns back its advance .
We 've met many tech book authors who say they 've written multiple books that have never earned back their advance .
That is beyond our comprehension .
Given that these folks usually have way more real talent than we do , what 's the difference ?
For one thing , we had n't actually heard that advice when we started .
We were too ignorant to know that this is supposedly the reality , so we went in with the attitude of , " OK , we plan on earning back our advance and having this book do well , so what can we do to help guarantee that this happens ? "
This is dramatically different from asking , " I ca n't expect this to make money , so what can I do to make sure it helps my career / reputation . ? "
We asked a different question , and got a different answer .
But there 's more to it than that .
It 's not just that doing - it - for - the - resume is n't as likely to produce a successful book ... writing a book with the motivation of enhancing your reputation is more likely to HURT the book .
I wo n't go into all the details , but I said a lot about this in an earlier post , Users Should n't Think About YOU .
The main problem is this : the more focused you are on demonstrating how smart YOU are , the less likely you are to help the READER feel / become smart .
And that 's a formula for hurting sales .
The more you make the book about how much you know , the less you have something the reader can benefit from .
We write our books from virtually the opposite perspective -- we do n't care what they think about us .
All we care about is that they have an " I Rule ! " experience , and that can come only from them truly learning and understanding in a meaningful , efficient , and enjoyable way .
We care about their life , more than we care about anything else .
And that is the formula .
The downside ( if you care about it ) is that approaching books this way wo n't do as much for your reputation .
On any given day , we usually have five of the top ten bestselling Java books .
On many days , we have the top five bestselling Java books .
Yet , virtually nobody in the Java world thinks of us as The Java Experts .
No , they think of us as the people who 've written the books that have helped me learn this well , and actually made it easier and even enjoyable ... "
They do n't think of us as the experts .
But they thank us for helping THEM become experts .
And that 's the rest of the formula .
Because when they start talking , and they will , they 'll tell their friends , co-workers , and everyone else they talk to online that they know more because of your book .
And that carries a lot more weight than telling their friends that you , the author , sure know your stuff .
So here 's the formula :
The Author Kicks Ass : The book might earn out .
The Reader Kicks Ass : Bestseller .
Have I oversimplified ?
Of course .
But not as much as you might think .
I will put some assumptions / qualifiers on this just for completness :
1 ) The topic must be of interest to enough people .
I can't expect to earn out on a book about " Blogging to improve your bowling scores . " ( although Robert Scoble just might be able to pull that one off .
The rest of us could n't : )
2 ) The publisher keeps the book available .
Besides the authors who keep claiming you can't expect to have a bestseller , I also disagree with publishers who claim that a book 's success today is about the publisher 's marketing reach combined with the author 's following .
That can help , sure , but you can see from my graphic that I put those things on the weakest end of the factors contributing to a bestseller .
( Yes , I 'm even disagreeing with the publisher who ( to use the cliche ) has forgotten more about this business than I 'll ever know . )
But where the publisher is especially monumentally important is in keeping the book in stock .
And apparently that is no easy task .
The publisher 's reputation with the booksellers is vitally important , and this is where a great publisher can really make a big difference .
Key publishers like O'Reilly , Wiley , Pearson , etc. can make sure that once word gets around about your book , people can get their hands on it !
Now , there are some books , especially consumer books and those purchased by older / less - web - aware folks for whom discovering it in the store is the most important factor , but I 'm not really addressing that .
I 'm talking about technically - oriented books likely to be bought by those who are connected to one or more online communities in such a way that if word spreads about a book , they 're likely to hear it .
3 ) The author knows , or learns , how to show the reader what the reader needs and wants .
There are some skills here , of course , but the most important one is n't writing !
I 'd put writing skills fairly low on the list , assuming some baseline capability equivalent to , say , a sophomore in high school who might get a B in basic grammar / writing .
The most important thing is in teaching / communication / information design .
And that 's a lot of what we talk about in this blog .
( But in another post , I 'll offer more resources if you 're still looking to improve in these areas . )
And perhaps the best advice I can give to our authors is to simply not go into some kind of " writer mode " .
Most people who have a subject they want to communicate , could explain it just fine to a colleague over lunch , with a pencil , a napkin , and a conversation .
But something gets lost when they try to " write " about it , especially if they 're trying to impress others with their serious level of expertise .
Say it in your book almost exactly the way you 'd explain it to a friend , and you 're way way way up the curve .
And finally , the most important assumption :
The author genuinely , deeply , truly cares about enhancing the lives of the reader .
So , creating a bestseller is not such a big wild - ass gamble .
And the best news is that it 's a win for everyone if you follow that formula .
The publisher does n't bleed money on the book , the author is well - compensated for the time they spent , the reader 's life is improved through your work , and -- most importantly - - you get the indescribable joy of knowing that you made someone 's day / week / job / even life a little brighter .
And if you follow this formula , they 'll tell you !
Once again , let this be my huge thank - you to all our readers who take the time to write and tell us how they feel about the book ( good and bad , although -- gotta tell you -- we prefer the good ; ) ) or that they passed the exam , got a new job , or even just that they found themselves smiling while reading about a technical topic , and how they were delighted and surprised by that .
YOU are why we do this , and having the books be bestsellers means we get to continue .
Wow , I could n't possibly enjoy my work more !
( And thanks to O'Reilly for sharing this attitude and making this possible . )

This is it .
When I hired speakers for conferences I looked at people who shared themselves and their knowledge .
You nailed it .
I hope our book nails it too .
If not , we 'll know about it up front cause our readers will point out when we 're not doing well .

Just freaking " wow " ...
Or as Tom Peters would put it ...
WOW !!!
This is why I'm on O'Reilly 's list to review everything in the Head First series .
Armed with a HF book about a particular subject , I * do * feel like I can * kick ass * .
It 's also the reason I 've pushed this book hard in my intro Java sessions when I speak , and why it 's always the first title gone .
I 'm glad you exist , Kathy ...
Posted by : Thomas " Duffbert " Duff | Feb 25 , 2005 5:06:56 PM
Thomas , you 're a not - small part of * why * we exist .
As our brave early adopter and well - respected reviewer / speaker , you played a key role in helping evangelize the book to an audience we did n't even know existed .
The one really important thing I did n't put in this blog ( but will do a whole post on ) is that there * is* a bootstrapping process for getting the book out there .
It has to start somewhere , and a big part of getting the word out is getting it to the right people early on .
People who have listeners of their own .
Lots of people trust you , Thomas , so it * means * something when you recommend one of our books .
Thanks !!
And Robert , I can't wait for your book : ) [ p.s .
I was always more fond of the " Blog or Die " title , so I 'm glad your publisher picked that one . ]
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Feb 25 , 2005 5:15:12 PM
I 've enjoyed reading your blog for a while now .
This particular post seems to warrant a commment .
Of the two approaches to getting published , the one you critique and the one you advocate in its place , yours is clearly the preferrable place to stand .
There is though the tiny problem of how few writers will be able to write best sellers .
This is built into the structure of ranking books by how many copies they sell .
It is , by design , a " winner take all " model .
And much like the situation in which every talented teenage basketball player is n't going to become Michael Jordan or Tim Duncan , writers have to , at the end of the day , find viable niches .
The substance of what I hear you saying still applies though , which I believe is :
Pick a strategy that is about really winning and not simply settling for the " a half loaf is better than no loaf " approach that conventional wisdom would advise , and beware especially of advice that urges settling for a half loaf , but delivers no loaf at all .

Posted by : Jozef Imrich | Feb 26 , 2005 5:39:49 AM
Kathy , I applaud your logic , but ...
I think writing a book for reasons other than money is perfectly valid .
I certainly am not in it for the money , even if I 'm currently talking to publishers .
I like to think of the book idea as similar to a blog i.e. an opportunity to " spread pollen " .
Posted by : hugh macleod | Feb 26 , 2005 7:35:05 PM
Ah ...
Hugh , I agree -- I 'm not suggesting that money is the * reason * to do the book .
The reason that leads to a bestseller is " enhancing the reader 's life " .
But I am saying that it 's usually a bad idea to go into it with the attitude that it * wo n ' t* make money .
You said : " ... opportunity to spread pollen " .
That 's very different from " ... opportunity to make a bigger name for myself . "
And that difference is EVERYTHING .
If your book is a bestseller , that means more pollen , and the chance to ( if you want ) do more .
We figure we have a LOT of " pollen " ( passion ) we 'd like to keep spreading , and because the books are bestsellers , we 're able to keep doing it .
Your book , Hugh , has a message that a lot of people want -- and need -- to hear .
Why * not * go into it with the attitude that it can be a bestseller ?
( which , by the way , does n't seem like it 's gonna be much of an issue ; )
Is that so different from what you might suggest to your clients ?
I 'd say , " Do [ whatever it is that you make / do / sell ] for the right reasons -- give your users something real to believe in -- and the money to keep doing that will be a natural result . "
Do n't do it for the money ; do it to involve more people in the conversation .
A bestseller means a lot more people at the party having a great time : )

hi Kathy
i am in love with HF books , i have all the four books and i read them all the time .
You are abosultely right - the books make me feel smarter , confident , and educated .
Reading HF java i came away thinking one thought - someone finally figured out how to explain technical concepts to mere mortals .
Thanks so much !!
keep the books coming - i am looking forward to a head first web services with java - there are way too many non-reader friendly books in that space

I dunno ... the word " Bestseller " kinda short circuits my brain ...
I associate it with celebrity cookbooks , " Chicken Soup For The Soul " franchises and ( ugh ! ) the literary novel market .
Every now and then an excellent book comes along and surprises that market ( " Tuesdays with Morrie " , or " Trainspotting " , for example ) .... but for every " Tuesdays " there 's a 15 dozen " Bridges of Madison County " or " The Da Vinci Code " .
I see publishers as middlemen .
I see there are people who already want my book , and people who will want it once they see it in front of them .
Reaching these people is my reponsibility - it 's my job , first and foremost , not the job of some big city marketing ninja .
So my question to a publisher is always going to be the same , namely , " How are you going to make my job easier and what 's your cut ? "
Do n't get me wrong ; I 've made lots of mistakes and false starts over the years .
Education is expensive etc .
But I do think a major hindrance to first - time authors trying to break into publishing is their own mis-delegation of responsibilty to these hypothetical whizz - kids in New York who ( a ) they 've never actually met in person and ( b ) do n't actually give a damn about them .
What 's that line I like to use ?
" Power is never given .
Power is taken " ...?
That 's what I 'm talking about .
I appreciate your vote of confidence for " How To Be Creative " .
We 'll see what the market says , once it 's printed and hoisted onto trucks .
Posted by : hugh macleod | Feb 27 , 2005 9:46:39 AM
As someone who has written several books ( all but one made back their advance ) I would interpret your message as a suggestion to publishers to avoid certain demographics of writers .
Those who consult as part of their day job are motivated by increasing their own self worth .
It is all about return on investment and making change on book sales is secondary .
Maybe publishers should focus on authors who work for Fortune 500 enterprises .
They have nothing to sell per-say like consultants or CTOs of software companies , are n't required to be published like university professors and for the most part would only write in the spirit of giving back to the community .
I would also ask for the acknowledgement of the fact that some people have talent for writing books tend to not be ones that could make a lot of money in consulting .
The inverse tends to also hold true .

Post that all writers , not only technical writers , should find useful .
On the lighter side , It reminds me of the time when no one would publish my book and I was worried .
When my friend Brig Mukhtar foud out about the cause of my worry , he asked , " do you have any bank ballance , any thing you can sell or any assent that you can liquidate . "
My answer was of course NO .
He siad , " You are already leading a poor life , go get loan and publish . "
I did just that .
I am happy that I did that .
I had to print two edition of Reet Pe Tehreer ( Urdu ) .

This was an excellent post and covers lots of points that authors ( first time or otherwise ) can take to heart .
I 'd like to add one more .
I 've gotten 6 books published .
I never actually got an advance as I was working for Aetna then Microsoft and never thought to ask for one .
The single most important thing I worried about as a writer / author was hearing the following from my young daughters :
" Daddy , why is your book in this pile for a dollar ? "
Now THAT was motivation .

Kathy ,
I 've written 50 - something non-fiction books ( 11 in sociology and 40 something on computers ) , and while what you say is wonderfully encouraging , and I 'd say the right way to go about things , I still do n't have a clue as to why things work well or not with books .
Your books ( Head First series ) are brilliant because they get inside my head and lead me to understand complex issues -- and you make it fun .
I used to think that the closer I was to a novice programming wise , the better the book .
I could joke around with the reader and get inside her head because I was her head shortly before I wrote the book .
On one level that was ( and still is ) true , but now I realize that I wish I could have that same closeness to the reader and be a more sophisticated programmer .
My first computer book sold over 100,000 copies in 6 months , and my second sold 350,000 copies in the same period of time .
At the time I was new to programming ( about 2 years worth ) but I was able to make that connection .
Other books that I thought did the same thing , failed to spark ( and sparkle ) .
Then I tried something new , and got lucky and took the first royalty check and bought an airplane .
The second edition of the same book went south .
The others became a blur , some doing great , some ok , and some pretty bad .
However , tapping into the reader 's passion , and I think the absolute fun in learning , is the way to go .
Every now and then I can make that connection -- even trying to do so every time .
As for bestsellers , they 're important , especially for the publisher whose investment in you is important .
But trying to write a bestseller may not be the best way to write one .
Marketing wonks have the goofiest ideas that are at best based on what has gone before them -- I do n't believe that the Head First approach was from the brain of a marketer .
The wonderful ( and original ) DOS for Dummies has become a creepy series that lost the connection to the reader that the original forged .
Enough of this .
I will end with my favorite quote -- from the crystal mind of Dorothy Parker .
When asked if she liked to write , she replied , " No. I like to have written . "
Same here .

Very much enjoyed your perspective on achieving best sellers .
I 've had significant success developing a
variety of training and non-fiction products ( courses ,
seminars , workshops , books , videos , etc... ) and you
are certainly correct in pointing out the critical factor
of putting the reader first .
Find a compelling subject , understand exactly the sorts
of questions and reasons why your market asks those
questions makes the task of writing non-fiction so much
easier than other genres .
Great article - there is much traditional thought on
writing non-fiction that seems to have undergone perpetual
mis -direction , your article begins to unravel the truth .
Posted by : Jeff | Sep 6 , 2005 7:32:35 PM
It is fantastic .
The guide for writing best seller is available on line .
It is more than 100 % correct that readers enhancement must be kept in mind for writting a book .
I can not undersatnd that why anybody should write book and publisher publish it just for the sake of publication .
Book must be written for others .
It is correct that ideas should be original and personal .
One must have lived with these ideas for sometime .
He must have sleeped with these ideas peacfully .
He must have grown and prospered with those ideas for sometime .
Then only it is worth putting in the form of a book and making them available to people .
I have lived with such ideas for 20 years .
I have written in the book form .
It has come up very interesting that is what I feel .
They all are very useful for all the readers who are going to read them .
Being in the country like India , I am searching a publisher for last four months .
Till now I have not been able to search one .
But the day I get them , I believe that the book will be hit .
In developing country like India , any such new ventures takes lot of efforts and time .
That is not good for the nation .
The country must come out of these limitations .
Hope , the situation will improve in the days to come .
I am available at kamekish@yahoo.com , it would be pleasure to respond .
Thanks
