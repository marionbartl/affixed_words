ISTANBUL / SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Big oil producing nations denied a British newspaper report on Tuesday that Gulf Arab states were in secret talks with Russia , China , Japan and France to replace the U.S. dollar with a basket of currencies in trading oil .
The dollar eased in response to the report , which was written by The Independent ’s Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk and cited unidentified sources in Gulf Arab states and Chinese banking sources in Hong Kong .
It said the proposal was for trade in crude oil to move over nine years to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen , the Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new , unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council , which includes Saudi Arabia and Kuwait .
The report coincides with a wider debate on the role of the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency , which has come under question .
For most of this decade , the United States has struggled to maintain the dollar ’s value .
But top officials of Saudi Arabia and Russia , speaking on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings in Istanbul , denied there were such talks .
The two countries are the world ’s largest and second - largest oil exporters .
Asked by reporters about the newspaper story , Saudi Arabia ’s central bank chief Muhammad al - Jasser said : “ Absolutely incorrect . ”
He repeated the same response when asked whether Saudi Arabia was in such talks .
Kuwait ’s oil minister and a well - placed source in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries made similar remarks .
Russia ’s deputy finance minister Dmitry Pankin said : “ We did not discuss this at all . ”
The dollar slipped after the newspaper story .
The euro edged up as high as $ 1.4756 , although it fell back to $ 1.4701 when the Saudi Arabian and Russian officials denied the report .
Oil prices rose above $ 71 a barrel on Tuesday .
Algerian Finance Minister Karim Djoudi told Reuters : “ Oil producing countries need to stabilize revenues but ... I do n’t see a need for oil trade to be denominated differently .
“ But we are at the IMF conference where all sorts of subjects are raised and discussed , ” he added .
‘ NOT LIKELY ’
Analysts said that while individual countries would find it relatively easy to stop using the dollar in oil trades , as Iran has done , replacing the currency in which oil is priced would require a massive effort .
The newspaper story did not make clear how the change would work , and many analysts doubted it would occur any time soon .

“ I do n’t think this is a likely scenario in the short to medium term , ” said Carsten Fritsch , oil analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt .
“ Without Saudi Arabia ’s support it is difficult to imagine that the dollar will be replaced . ”
Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states peg their currencies to the dollar .
Russia has in the past raised the idea of shifting its oil trade away from the dollar , which has been undermined by the U.S. trade and budget deficits .
China has suggested that in the long term , the dollar should lose its role as the globe ’s top reserve currency .
But strong political links between Gulf nations and the United States , as well as the lack of convertibility for many Gulf currencies and the yuan top the list of practical hurdles to replacing the dollar .
“ If there was already a significant proportion of global oil trade being priced in non-U.S. dollar now , than perhaps there would be more pressure to price crude in another currency , ” said Victor Shum , analyst at Purvin & Gertz in Singapore .
“ But we ’re still far from that . ”
‘ WORTHLESS PIECE OF PAPER ’
Iran , which a few years ago began increasing its sales of oil in non-dollar currencies , has benefited by billions of dollars as a result , its finance minister said on Tuesday in Istanbul .
Shamseddin Hosseini said he had discussed with other countries the possibility of shifting oil trade away from the dollar in the past , but had not held any such talks in recent days .
“ Some of the countries right now accept this idea , ” he said .
“ But this is one of the subjects that needs more discussion and ( to be ) agreed on by everyone , ” he said through an interpreter .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called the U.S. currency a “ worthless piece of paper . ”
The Islamic state is under U.S. and U.N. sanctions over its nuclear programme .
The Independent ’s story said : “ Secret meetings have already been held by finance ministers and central bank governors in Russia , China , Japan and Brazil to work on the scheme , which will mean that oil will no longer be priced in dollars . ”
France had also been involved in the talks , it said .
The Independent said U.S. authorities were aware that the meetings had taken place but had not discovered the details and were “ sure to fight this international cabal . ”

DEA vs. ' House '
Does the DEA control what we watch on TV ?
Active tvsquad.com commenter bruce is stirring up controversy with recent accusations about the TV show ' House ' .
We have not been given , nor will we be given , an adequate explanation for why House 's chronic pain is suddenly manageable without painkillers .
Keep in mind House had a legitimate , verifiable medical condition ( infarction leading to muscle death ) in his leg , so it 's not like fibromyalgia or bad headaches some other painful condition that is hard if not impossible to medically verify .
The DEA has been writing letters to Fox complaining about House 's " flagrant use and abuse of narcotics without consequence " for years now , and finally the network , writers , and producers all caved in to the government 's demands ... in the worst possible way .
They decided to make the vicodin House had been taking for over a decade into a sudden hallucinogen , causing him to see dead people .
They showed him going through the painful detox , and now he 's just fine and dandy , no reference to his pain at all .
And there wo n't be any further reference to his pain , other than " it 's all manageable . "
Idiots will consider this to be " character growth " but you can do your own Freedom of Information
Act request and get the letters the DEA sent to Fox demanding that " House " no longer show a character using drugs and performing well ( exceptionally well , in fact ) at his job , without horrible consequences .
You know , " for the children . "
House 's chronic pain and need for vicodin ( in reality he should be on something much stronger and without the toxic acetaminophen that vicodin contains ) were a central part of the show and the character of Dr. Gregory House .
If they are going to destroy the character like this - at the request of the government , no less - then I wo n't be watching the show for much longer .
They gave the DEA final script approval over all episodes of House .
Talk about big brother .
Then again , " big brother " is the very essence of drug prohibition .
This thread also appears in tvsquad.com comments from the This thread also appears in tvsquad.com comments from the House season premier recap a few weeks back .
Viewers seemed disappointed that House 's hallucinations were blamed on Vicodin .
Not sure if this is a DEA conspiracy , pressure from lawyers in the Standards and Practices dept. , bad writing , or what , but the impression is that Vicodin was thrown under the bus for political reasons and House will now tell patients with chronic pain to suck it up and deal .

SAO PAULO , Brazil – A massive 2007 electrical blackout in Brazil has been newly blamed on computer hackers , but was actually the result of a utility company 's negligent maintenance of high voltage insulators on two transmission lines .
That 's according to reports from government regulators and others who investigated the incident for more than a year .
In a broadcast Sunday night , the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes cited unnamed sources in making the extraordinary claim that a two - day outage in the Atlantic state of Espirito Santo was triggered by hackers targeting a utility company 's control systems .
The blackout affected 3 million people .
Hackers also caused another , smaller blackout north of Rio de Janeiro in January 2005 , the network claimed .
Brazilian government officials disputed the report over the weekend , and Raphael Mandarino Jr. , director of the Homeland Security Information and Communication Directorate , told the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that he 's investigated the claims and found no evidence of hacker attacks , adding that Brazil 's electric control systems are not directly connected to the internet .
The utility company involved , Furnas Centrais Elétricas , told Threat Level on Monday , it " has no knowledge of hackers acting in Furnas ' power transmission system . "
A review of official reports from the utility , the country 's independent systems operator group and its energy regulatory agency turns up nothing to support the hacking claim .
The earliest explanation for the blackout came from Furnas two days after the Sept. 26 , 2007 , incident began .
The company announced that the outage was caused by deposits of dust and soot from burning fields in the Campos region of Espirito Santo .
" The concentration of these residues would have been exacerbated by the lack of rain in the region for eight months , " the company said .
Brazil 's independent systems operator group later confirmed that the failure of a 345 - kilovolt line " was provoked by pollution in the chain of insulators due to deposits of soot " ( .pdf ) .
And the National Agency for Electric Energy , Brazil 's energy regulatory agency , concluded its own investigation in January 2009 and fined Furnas $ 3.27 million ( .pdf ) for failing to maintain the high - voltage insulators on its transmission towers .
Cascading electrical failures like the one in Espirito Santo often have a number of contributing factors , and it's possible that the poorly maintained insulators were only the most conspicuous element in the 2007 incident .
Reports that hackers triggered at least one blackout outside the United States first got wide attention last year , based on comments made by the CIA ’s chief cybersecurity officer , Tom Donahue .
He declined , however , to identify any country or the specifics of the alleged attacks .
The blackout claim even made it into a speech given by President Obama in May .
" In other countries cyberattacks have plunged entire cities into darkness , " Obama said , not mentioning the cities .
In an interview with Threat Level last month , former cybersecurity czar Richard Clarke named Brazil as a hack - attack blackout victim , but did n't provide verifiable details .
In some versions of the story , the hackers were trying to extort money from the utility .
The 60 Minutes broadcast this week – which cited six unnamed sources in the intelligence , military and cybersecurity communities – was the first to peg the story to specific blackouts .
CBS did not repeat the extortion claim , reporting instead that the location and motives of the hackers are a mystery .
Fallout from the story kept telephones ringing in Brazil 's electricity sector Monday .
“ Everyone ’s been calling us all day about it , " said a beleaguered spokesman with the National Operator of the Electric System .

Ever wonder why The Reg continually comes up with scoops and insider information when our rivals seem content with rewriting press releases ?
Quite simple really .
Trusted sources and , more and more frequently , from readers .
However , while we have always been discreet and careful to keep our sources anonymous , recent changes in UK law makes this task more difficult .
We 're talking of course about the RIP Act .
Under the Act , police , security services and the like are legally entitled to monitor any information moving about within the UK .
This is no great concern in itself - IT stories are , let 's be frank , rarely threatening to the security of the nation .
However , the new law has given employers extensive rights to read and monitor employee email and phone calls .
Also , big companies are more tech - literate than ever .
Because of these two changes in mindset , it is crucially important for whistleblowers and sources of confidential information to be aware of what can be done to trace suspected leaks .
Hence this brief guide to keeping out of the eye of powerful companies - it's not perfect or foolproof but it's a damn sight better than not doing it .
Initial contact
If you are contacting us for the first time with the intention of handing over some damaging and / or confidential information , for God 's sake do n't do it at work .
Unless you want to fork out £ 50 for a phone scrambler ( and subsequently draw attention to yourself ) , DO NOT call direct from work .
Telephone logs are easily produced and checked and if only one person has called our phone number , then he or she is likely to face serious problems .
Email is also easily checked .
Hotmail will not give you any security - network surveillance tools are way beyond that now .
Again , the point is not that you will send a message and the boys in black will arrive at your desk five minutes later , it 's that if a company becomes suspicious it will launch an enquiry and work backwards through email logs .
Private keys - PGP etc ( www.pgp.com) - will stop a company being able to tell WHAT you 've written but not the fact that you have sent us an email .
If you really have to have to send us an email from work , the best thing to do is use a Hushmail account .
We have set up a secure email address : info1857@hushmail.com for just this purpose .
This is a fairly obscure email address and if you set up a Hushmail account ( www.hushmail.com or www.cyber-rights.net), then the message will be indecipherable .
However , again , retrospective analysis by a company will put anyone using a secure email tool under suspicion - until , that is , everyone uses it ( which wo n't happen anytime soon ) .
We also get a few network managers reading the site , so the address wo n't exactly be top secret either .
Plus , if your company is really paranoid it will have software on your network that will be able to read every keystroke you make , so all of this is academic .
So , the basic lesson is : if you think you could get reprimanded / sacked for the information you plan to send us , send it to us from your home PC .
The level of security you choose to use from there is up to you .
And for those really dangerous secrets
Let 's suppose you have some top secret information which will mean immediate dismissal and loss of livelihood but you feel strongly enough to blow the whistle you'd be wise to take some extra precautions - especially if it could be deemed illegal ( which is not difficult under the new RIP laws ) .
We would recommend buying a copy of Freedom ( www.freedom.net).
It 'll cost you $ 49.95 but then that 's nothing compared to loss of a salary .
Freedom will basically mask your identity while you are on the Net .
The company behind it - Zero Knowledge Systems - basically pings your IP packets through loads of anonymous servers and makes it nigh on impossible for anyone but the most determined investigator to track you down .
That said , use Freedom and your profile will be raised .
Equally , if you 're just paranoid / sick of spam , you may find $ 50 a fair price to pay for privacy .
They 're onto you
If you are British , or to be more precise if you live in Britain , your home is a risky place to store or send confidential information .
Your employer , should it suspect that you are the mole , can seek an Anton Pillar order against you .
Rarely used , because the legislation is so draconian , Anton Pillar orders are obtained in secret , and give companies the power to raid suspects ' homes ( it 's the police what does the raiding ) and seize anything they consider relevant to their case .
The PC and the filing cabinet will be the first things to go in the back of the police van for inspection .
Smell the coffee
Alternatively , go to a cyber café ( but watch out for those cameras ) and use a machine there .
This is n't a bad method - after all , when 15 - year - old maths prodigy Sufiah Yusof disappeared for a few weeks , contacting regularly her parents via email , the police were unable to track her down .
It was eventually her continual appearance at the Click N' Link Internet café in Bournemouth and the fact that her face was all over the national newspapers which led the café owner to contact the police .
You , of course , will be using the café far less frequently and will go to different cafes if the correspondence stretches on .
Chatrooms - just say no
Do n't go badmouthing your employer / ex -employer in Internet chatrooms .
You 'll get mad - but chances are they 'll get even when they subpoena AOL , MSN , Yahoo !
etc. for your name , address etc .
If you have to vent steam in public , at very least , use a free email account , and give a false name and address , wo n't you .
There is little reason , except for your own recklessness , why the audit trail should reach you .
Remember too , that Yahoo ! ( Nazi memorabila , Yeah ! ) and the like may spout all they like about freedom of speech .
But they do not really believe in this guff .
They are content aggregators - not content providers - and they will sell you down the river as soon as spit .
On the other hand , newspapers ( Americans are particularly good at this ) and publications like The Register will do their utmost to protect their sources .
Because that 's part of the deal .
And for Colombian drug dealers ?
Not that you 'd want to call us anyway - The Reg maintains the media 's blatantly hypocritical attitude towards drugs - do as I say -
Well , we suggest you set up your own ISP offshore ( £ 40,000 should do it ) .
Then use heavily encrypted messages under different codenames .
For vocal communication , attach a phone scrambler to a totally unsuspected phone line and make sure there 's another one at the other end , or perhaps buy a pay - as - you - go phone and use it exclusively and for a limited time to make contact .
That should cover it .
Alternatively , of course , you could get a pen , piece of paper , envelope and stamp .
Snail mail is the way forward , we tell you .
Remember kids : just because you 're not paranoid does n't mean they 're not out to get you . ®
Hundreds of British schoolgirls are facing the terrifying prospect of female genital mutilation ( FGM ) over the Christmas holidays as experts warn the practice continues to flourish across the country .
Parents typically take their daughters back to their country of origin for FGM during school holidays , but The Independent on Sunday has been told that " cutters " are being flown to the UK to carry out the mutilation at " parties " involving up to 20 girls to save money .
The police face growing criticism for failing to prosecute a single person for carrying out FGM in 25 years ; new legislation from 2003 which prohibits taking a girl overseas for FGM has also failed to secure a conviction .
Experts say the lack of convictions , combined with the Government 's failure to invest enough money in education and prevention strategies , mean the practice continues to thrive .
Knowledge of the health risks and of the legislation remains patchy among practising communities , while beliefs about the supposed benefits for girls remain firm , according to research by the Foundation for Women 's Health , Research and Development ( Forward ) .

As a result , specialist doctors and midwives are struggling to cope with increasing numbers of women suffering from long - term health problems , including complications during pregnancy and childbirth .
Campaigners are urging ministers to take co-ordinated steps to work with communities here and overseas to change deep - seated cultural attitudes and stamp out this extreme form of violence against women .
The author and life peer Ruth Rendell , who has campaigned against FGM for 10 years , said : " When I helped take the Bill through Parliament seven years ago , I was very hopeful that we'd get convictions and that would then act as a deterrent for other people .
But that has never happened and my heart bleeds for these girls .
This mutilation is forever ; nothing can be done to restore the clitoris , and that is just very sad for them .
I have repeatedly asked questions of ministers from all departments about why there has never been a prosecution and why we still do not have a register of cases .
But while they are always very sympathetic , nothing ever seems to get done .
Teachers must not be squeamish and must talk to their girls so we can try and prevent it from happening . "
FGM is classified into four types , of varying severity ; type 3 is the most mutilating and involves total removal of the clitoris , labia and a narrowing of the whole vagina .
An estimated 70,000 women living in the UK have undergone FGM , and 20,000 girls remain at risk , according to Forward .
The practice is common in 28 African countries , including Somalia , Sudan and Nigeria , as well as some Middle Eastern and Asian countries such as Malaysia and Yemen .
It is generally considered to be an essential rite of passage to suppress sexual pleasure , preserve girls ' purity and cleanliness , and is necessary for marriage in many communities even now .
It has no religious significance .
The most common age for the procedure is between eight and 11 but it can be carried out just after birth or just before marriage .
It carries the risk of death from bleeding or tetanus , and long - term problems include urinary incontinence , recurrent infections and chronic pain .
Reversal procedures are necessary in order to avoid major problems for a woman and baby during childbirth .
In the UK , some women have to travel hundreds of miles to one of 15 specialist clinics because services and training are so patchy .
There are no specialist clinics at all in Scotland , or Wales , and student doctors , midwives and social workers are not routinely taught to recognise or deal with FGM .

A DVD , paid for by Baroness Rendell , which shows health workers how to reverse FGM will be launched in January .
She hopes the next generation of health professionals will be better equipped to help affected women , many of whom suffer from long - term psychological effects such as flashbacks , anxiety and nightmares .
Amina , 55 , originally from Somalia , underwent type 3 FGM , with no anaesthetic , when she was 11 .
One of the lucky ones , she suffered no long - term physical health problems but still carries psychological scars .
She has been vilified by practising communities for campaigning against FGM and for refusing to allow four of her daughters to be mutilated ; the fifth suffered the procedure while in the care of her grandmother .
The government funding that allowed Amina to work with families in Yorkshire , going door to door , to schools and community centres , talking about legal and health risks , ran out in March .
The Somali model Waris Dirie was mutilated at the age of five .
She set up the Waris Dirie Foundation in 2002 to help eradicate FGM .
She said : " I am worried about the situation in Europe and the US , as FGM seems to be on the rise in these places .
In the 21st century , a crime this cruel should not be accepted in a society as developed as England .
No one can undo the trauma that is caused by this horrible crime ; it stays in your head for ever .
So what we should focus on is that there wo n't be another victim . "
Jackie Mathers , a nurse from the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board , said : " These families do not do this out of spite or hatred ; they believe this will give their daughters the best opportunities in life .
We would like a conviction , not against the parents , but against a cutter , someone who makes a living from this .
We have anecdotal information that the credit crunch means people can't go home , so they 're getting cutters over for ' FGM parties ' .
It is hard for people to speak out because they are from communities that are already vilified as asylum seekers , so to stand up against their communities is to risk being ostracised .
But we have to empower girls and women to address this , along with teachers , school nurses and social workers .
We can't ignore it ; it is mutilation . "
A Home Office spokesman said : " We have appointed an FGM co-ordinator to drive forward a co-ordinated government response to this appalling crime and make recommendations for future work . "
Silek , the Salahis ' attorney , said the watch was worth more than the amount owed , but he said he had no idea how much it would fetch if it were put on eBay .
The judge said the clerk 's office would hold on to the watch until the lawyers worked out the best way to sell it .
Some weeks ago , Lau Jensen implemented Brian ’s Brain but gave up making it go faster .
He reached for my advice but I was swamped in work .
First cut
Here is my take :
( defn neighbours - count [ rows i w ] ( count ( for [ j [ ( mod ( inc i ) w ) i ( mod ( dec i ) w ) ] r rows : when ( = : on ( r j ) ) ] r ) ) ) ( defn step1 [ rows ] ( let [ current ( second rows ) w ( count current ) ] ( loop [ i ( dec w ) , row ( transient current ) ] ( if ( neg ?
i ) ( persistent !
row ) ( let [ c ( current i ) ] ( cond ( = c : on ) ( recur ( dec i ) ( assoc ! row i : dying ) ) ( = c : dying ) ( recur ( dec i ) ( assoc ! row i :off ) ) ( = 2 ( neighbours - count rows i w ) ) ( recur ( dec i ) ( assoc ! row i : on ) ) : else ( recur ( dec i ) row ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn step [ board ] ( vec ( map step1 ( partition 3 1 ( concat [ ( peek board ) ] board [ ( first board ) ] ) ) ) ) )
A board is a vector of vectors ( rows ) containing either : on , : dying or :off .
If you look closely at step you should recognize torus - window from Lau ’s Brians functional brain .
I must confess I am the one who gave Lau the idea of the seq - heavy implementation — just to prove it was doable without indices .
This is why I chose to keep a clear , functional , indexless processing at the row level .
It is only the cell level that is worth optimizing .
step1 steps a single row .
It takes as only argument a seq of 3 rows ( above , current and below ) and use a transient vector to compute the next state of the current row .
I tried to keep neighbours - count simple while reducing the number of intermediate seqs ( less alloc , less GC , faster code ) by using a seq comprehension ( for ) rather than several higher - order functions .
How does it run ?
First a little utility to create random boards ( with one third of : on cells ) :
( defn rand - board [ w h ] ( vec ( map vec ( partition w ( take ( * w h ) ( repeatedly # ( if ( zero ? ( rand -int 3 ) ) :on :off ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Then the actual benchmark :
user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 80 80 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 1000 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 16734.609776 msecs " nil user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 200 200 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 100 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 10200.273708 msecs " nil
So I get 16.7 ms / step on a 80*80 board ( where Lau was stuck at 200 ms on his box ) and 102 ms / step on a 200*200 board .
Optimizations
Unrolling neighbours - count
neighbours - count is called once for each : off cell and is rather complex so making it go faster should yield sensible gains this is why I unrolled it :
( defn neighbours - count [ [ above current below ] i w ] ( let [ j ( mod ( inc i ) w ) k ( mod ( dec i ) w ) s # ( if ( = ( % 1 %2 ) : on ) 1 0 ) ] ( + ( + ( + ( s above j ) ( s above i ) ) ( + ( s above k ) ( s current j ) ) ) ( + ( + ( s current k ) ( s below j ) ) ( + ( s below i ) ( s below k ) ) ) ) ) )
I paired the sum terms because currently only math ops with two args are inlined .
user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 80 80 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 1000 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 7880.492493 msecs " nil user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 200 200 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 100 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil ) " Elapsed time : 4679.679401 msecs " nil
More than twice as fast !
7.9 ms / step for a 80*80 board and 46.8 ms / step for a 200*200 one .
Using java arrays
Since there is little sharing between two iterations , vectors are not that useful so why not to try using arrays to represent rows ?
The board is then a vector of arrays :
( defn neighbours - count [ [ above current below ] i w ] ( let [ j ( mod ( inc i ) w ) k ( mod ( dec i ) w ) s # ( if ( = ( aget # ^objects % 1 ( int % 2 ) ) : on ) 1 0 ) ] ( + ( + ( + ( s above j ) ( s above i ) ) ( + ( s above k ) ( s current j ) ) ) ( + ( + ( s current k ) ( s below j ) ) ( + ( s below i ) ( s below k ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn step1 [ rows ] ( let [ # ^objects current ( second rows ) w ( count current ) ] ( loop [ i ( int ( dec w ) ) , # ^objects row ( aclone current ) ] ( if ( neg ?
i ) row ( let [ c ( aget current i ) ] ( cond ( = c : on ) ( recur ( dec i ) ( doto row ( aset i : dying ) ) ) ( = c : dying ) ( recur ( dec i ) ( doto row ( aset i :off ) ) ) ( = 2 ( neighbours - count rows i w ) ) ( recur ( dec i ) ( doto row ( aset i : on ) ) ) : else ( recur ( dec i ) row ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn step [ board ] ( vec ( map step1 ( partition 3 1 ( concat [ ( peek board ) ] board [ ( first board ) ] ) ) ) ) ) ( defn rand - board [ w h ] ( vec ( map # ( into - array Object % ) ( partition w ( take ( * w h ) ( repeatedly # ( if ( zero ? ( rand -int 3 ) ) :on :off ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Benchmark numbers :
user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 80 80 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 1000 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 5155.422268 msecs " nil user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 200 200 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 100 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 2964.524262 msecs " nil
Arrays cut one third of the runtime : we are down to 5.2 ms / step for a 80*80 board and 29.6 ms / step for a 200*200 one .
This means the overall speedup is greater than 3 x !
Adding a swing frontend
I decoupled the rendering from the computation : 25 fps no matter how many steps are really computed .
If the computation is fast not all steps are rendered ( eg for a 80 * 80 board at 200 sps only one step out of eight is rendered to screen ) .
( import ' ( javax .
swing JFrame JPanel ) ' ( java . awt Color Graphics2D ) ) ( defn dims [ [ row : as board ] ] [ ( count row ) ( count board ) ] ) ( defn render - board [ board # ^ Graphics2D g cell - size ] ( let [ [ w h ] ( dims board ) ] ( doto g ( . setColor Color / BLACK ) ( . scale cell - size cell - size ) ( . fillRect 0 0 w h ) ) ( doseq [ i ( range h ) j ( range w ) ] ( when - let [ color ( { : on Color / WHITE : dying Color / GRAY } ( ( board i ) j ) ) ] ( doto g ( . setColor color ) ( . fillRect j i 1 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn start - brian [ board cell - size ] ( let [ [ w h ] ( dims board ) switch ( atom true ) board ( atom board ) panel ( doto ( proxy [ JPanel ] [ ] ( paint [ g ] ( render - board @board g cell - size ) ) ) ( . setDoubleBuffered true ) ) ] ( doto ( JFrame . ) ( . addWindowListener ( proxy [ java .

The rendering code is slightly different when using arrays :
( defn render - board [ board # ^ Graphics 2D g cell - size ] ( let [ [ w h ] ( dims board ) ] ( doto g ( . setColor Color / BLACK ) ( . scale cell - size cell - size ) ( . fillRect 0 0 w h ) ) ( doseq [ i ( range h ) j ( range w ) ] ( when - let [ color ( { : on Color / WHITE : dying Color / GRAY } ( aget # ^objects ( board i ) ( int j ) ) ) ] ( doto g ( . setColor color ) ( . fillRect j i 1 1 ) ) ) ) ) )
Putting all cores to work
The first attempt to parallelizing is to replace map by pmap in step .
( defn step [ board ] ( vec ( pmap step1 ( partition 3 1 ( concat [ ( peek board ) ] board [ ( first board ) ] ) ) ) ) )
This does not yield such a gain :
user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 80 80 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 1000 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 5624.407083 msecs " nil user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 200 200 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 100 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 2778.74241 msecs " nil
Performances are slighlty worse on the 80*80 board and slightly better on the 200*200 .
The reason is that the processing of a single row is not computationally intense enough compared to the parallelization overhead .
So I have to send each core more stuff at once .
Rich is working on some cool features in the par branch that will make such parallelization a breeze meanwhile I am going to show how to manually parallelize step .
The idea is simply to split the vector in N chunks where N is the number of cores .
( defn step [ board ] ( let [ n ( . available Processors ( Runtime / getRuntime ) ) l ( count board ) bounds ( map int ( range 0 ( inc l ) ( / l n ) ) ) ] ( apply into ( pmap # ( vec ( map step1 ( partition 3 1 ( concat [ ( board ( mod ( dec % 1 ) l ) ) ] ( subvec board % 1 %2 ) [ ( board ( mod % 2 l ) ) ] ) ) ) ) bounds ( rest bounds ) ) ) ) )
How does it fare ?
user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 80 80 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 1000 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil ) " Elapsed time : 3672.935876 msecs " nil user= > ( do ( let [ b ( rand - board 200 200 ) ] ( time ( ( apply comp ( repeat 100 step ) ) b ) ) ) nil )
" Elapsed time : 2154.728325 msecs " nil
3.7ms / step on a 80*80 board , 21.5 ms / step on the 200*200 board .
It is indeed better than plain pmap and cuts off 30 % of the run time .
Now this is nearly 5 times faster than my initial attempt !

New research suggests that a stereotypical programmer 's workspace — Star Trek posters , empty Mountain Dew / beer cans and all , according to the article — may be a significant reason why more women are not entering into computer science disciplines and fields .
While my formal training is as a chemical engineer , I have been programming since my parents enrolled me in computer camp when I was eight and did n't have many friends at home .
In the intervening 23 years , I can probably count on one hand the number of times my computer workspace has been clean as opposed to looking like a bomb went off , but it has never looked like a sophomore male 's dorm room ... except my second year of college when I took all those computer science classes .
Where other STEM fields ( Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics ) are seeing the percentage of women enrolled increase , computer science is going through a decline .
The study , published in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , finds that the feeling of ambient belonging — a sense of how well one feels they fit into a field — is not there for women in computer science .
" When people think of computer science the image that immediately pops into many of their minds is of the computer geek surrounded by such things as computer games , science fiction memorabilia and junk food , " said Sapna Cheryan , a University of Washington assistant professor of psychology .
The authors describe this feeling as one that is garnered on a first impression of a space .
" You look at the objects and make an instant appraisal of how you would fit with the objects and the people who are typically found in that environment .
You also make a judgment of ' I like it here ' or ' I do n't belong here , ' " said Cheryan .
To assess such a feeling , the authors set up a series of four experiments that were designed to aid understanding of whether stereotypical surroundings may cause women to choose fields of study over computer science .
The participants , over 250 male and female students not enrolled in a computer science course of study , and were ushered into a classroom that was either filled with stereotypical computer science objects , or one with generic crap .
They were told the room was being shared with another class , and after a few minutes were asked to fill out a questionnaire probing their feelings about the room .
The survey found that women who sat in the stereotypically decorated room expressed less interest in computer science than those who sat in the control room .
Men , on the other hand , did not show a similar drop in interest .
This lead the researchers to conclude that choices of classes or even major can be influenced simply by the decor of the offices , classrooms , and labs that a department has .
In a continuation on the theme , the researchers conducted three similar experiments .
When faced with the choice of joining one of two all - female teams , the only difference being the objects found in the team 's workroom — stereotypical versus nonstereotypical — women overwhelmingly ( 82 percent of the time ) choose to work with the team based in the nonstereotypically decorated room .
When men and women were asked about job offers at two companies who both had a 50/50 gender ratio , where one was decorated with the usual computer science gear and the other more generic stuff , both genders preferred the nonstereotypical setting , women more so than men .
The final experiment probed thoughts about working at a nondescript
Web design company ; again , women would choose a work environment that was not decorated in the stereotypical computer science way .
The work does show a definitive trend of nontechnical people not liking work environments that have stuff a 17 - year - old male would have hanging on the walls of his room .
However , outside of the occasional computer science TAs office or undergraduate dorm room , I cannot see how this stereotypical setup seems very , well ... stereotypical — especially in the latter of the three experimental setups .
While my personal workspace may look like an utter mess , it is not the image that my company ( or any I have visited , worked with , or interviewed at ) as a whole projects themselves to potential hires and customers .
Judging simply from the image that accompanies this article , the brightly colored Star Trek poster and game boxes strongly draw one 's eyes and attention — after all , it 's what they were designed to do !
I would be curious if the disparity in ambient belonging remains if even just these two focal objects were removed from the " stereotypical computer science " workspace .
Technical books and papers are one thing , but a huge color poster and unrelated video games are not what I would consider to be present in any sort of professional environment ( short of a movie studio , or game development office ) , nor what I would think appropriate for a general use classroom at a University .
Prior work has shown that kids and teens ( and by extension , I 'll wager college - aged young adults ) do n't actually feel that the common stereotypes are descriptive of people who work in STEM fields .
While I will agree that certain aspects of technical fields can be off - putting to individuals who do n't know the field — compounded by arrogant jerks who revel in their smug superiority over such unenlightened people — it has been shown that by and large , people are interested if someone gives them the time of day to answer questions .
Many STEM fields suffer from a chicken - and - egg type problem .
A group that is not adequately represented in teaching or high - ranking positions is by definition not present to mentor new people from that group , hence perpetuating a cycle that is very hard to break .
While cleaning up the first impressions that may be perceived by those outside or new to the field will help , it will not instantly resolve the underlying issues .
As the cryand for more competent technical individuals increases , however , every little bit of information that helps bring more people in is good .

It ’s considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world , and starting soon Baghdad International will be under the protection of the same private security empire whose embassy guards in Kabul engaged in a range of misconduct and drunken hazing rituals , including those now infamous vodka buttshots .
Recently , Iraq ’s governing council selected ArmorGroup to take over airport security , replacing a company called Sabre International , which has held the contract for the past year .
The security contract is worth $ 22.5 million , according to Agence France Presse , and comes a little over two months after the Project on Government Oversight exposed a pattern of misbehavior by ArmorGroup employees protecting the US Embassy in Kabul under a $ 189 million State Department contract .
The controversy led to the firings of more than a dozen ArmorGroup personnel , prompted an ongoing investigation by the State Department ’s Inspector General , and could eventually end up costing the company the embassy contract .
The embassy guards were employed by ArmorGroup North America ( AGNA ) .
The company is part of the same Danish - British security conglomerate , G4S , as ArmorGroup Iraq , the division that will be providing security at Baghdad International .
For G4S and ArmorGroup , the Kabul embassy scandal could n’t have happened at a worse time .
Weeks earlier , on August 9th , an ArmorGroup employee gunned down two of his colleagues and seriously wounded a third during a drunken confrontation in Baghdad ’s Green Zone .
The contractor , an ex-British paratrooper named Daniel Fitzsimons , had a history of psychiatric problems , drug and alcohol abuse , and violent behavior .
His parents described him as a “ human timebomb , ” suffering from serious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following deployments in war zones including Kosovo and Afghanistan .
Fitzsimons , who maintains he acted in self defense , had been dismissed by two other private security companies operating in Iraq , one of which cited “ extreme negligence ” as the cause for his firing .
When ArmorGroup brought Fitzsimons on , he was facing trial in the UK on assault charges , having already been convicted of robbery and possession of ammunition .
Weeks after Fitzsimons ’ arrest , ArmorGroup officially fired him “ on the grounds of gross misconduct . ”
The company claimed to have evidence that he “ falsified information during the recruitment process ” and insisted “ his screening was not completed in line with the company ’s procedures . ”
Patrick Toyne - Sewell , an ArmorGroup spokesman , told me that following the Green Zone shooting the company “ installed an additional team of screening professionals who checked through every single employment file to make sure the records were up to date and contained everything required to confirm suitability for employment with the company and deployment to Iraq and other hostile environments .
We also introduced new processes to ensure that these standards were applied strictly to future recruitment . ”
He said he was unable to go into further detail , adding , “ we have done everything we can to make sure that employees cannot be deployed without all of the necessary checks being in place in the future . ”
ArmorGroup ’s vetting practices have been called into question before .
A lawsuit [ PDF ] filed in September by AGNA ’s former director of operations , James Gordon , alleges the company ’s management placed “ corporate profit over safety ” and relied on lax hiring standards when it came to fielding a guard force to protect the US embassy in Kabul .
AGNA staffed the embassy contract , he says , with “ unqualified , poorly vetted personnel . ”
Among them , he says , was a security operator “ who had been fired from a previous project for pulling a pistol on another employee while drunk ” — an episode that could have easily escalated into the type of situation that has Fitzsimons cooling his heels in an Iraqi jail and potentially facing the death penalty .
According to Gordon ’s whistleblower retaliation and false claims act suit against his former employer , repeated warnings about the quality and competence of ArmorGroup ’s personnel — and the fact that “ the training program run for new hires ” was “ plagued with hazing and intimidation ” — went unheeded by the company ’s top management .
Like the US embassy in Kabul , Baghdad ’s airport is a high - risk target .
Lying at the end of a once treacherous seven - mile stretch of road known as “ Route Irish , ” the airport is a hub for visiting dignitaries , press , contractors , and many others transiting to or from Baghdad .
( In the past , the airport and its environs have been a frequent target for rocket and mortar attacks . )
Though the security situation in Iraq has vastly improved , this is not the type of place where you can afford to take chances .
Perhaps ArmorGroup has convinced Iraqi officials that it ’s up to the job .
Or has the Iraqi government seriously overlooked the baggage of its new airport security provider ?

The presidents of the nation ’s major private research universities were paid a median compensation of $ 627,750 in the 2007 - 8 fiscal year  a 5.5 percent increase from the previous year  according to The Chronicle of Higher Education annual executive compensation survey .
The highest paid private university executive was Shirley Ann Jackson , president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y. , with a pay package totaling $ 1,598,247 in fiscal 2008 .
Ms. Jackson , a physicist and former chairwoman of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission , has been at Rensselaer since 1999 , and first became the highest - paid university president just two years later .
In this year ’s survey , she was followed by David J. Sargent of Suffolk University in Boston , the top earner in last year ’s survey , who took in $ 1,496,593 in fiscal 2008 , and Steadman Upham of the University of Tulsa , whose pay package was $ 1,485,275 .
According to the survey , published in Monday ’s edition , 23 private college presidents made over $ 1 million in total compensation , and 110 made more than $ 500,000 .
Such large pay packages are still relatively new in higher education : as recently as 2002 , there were no million - dollar presidents , only four earning more than $ 800,000 , and 27 earning more than $ 500,000 .

15.7 million people are unemployed in the US according to official figures
With the US unemployment rate above 10 % for the first time in 27 years , a sense of urgency is growing .
On Thursday in Washington , President Barack Obama held a jobs summit , attended by 130 business leaders , union leaders and economists .
To the assembled experts , President Obama said that the US government must act quickly in the fight against unemployment , but cautioned that he had only limited funds to create jobs .
" We can not hang back and hope for the best , " he warned .
Indeed , any new spending plans aimed at reducing joblessness will run into opposition from Republicans in Congress .
They are already irritated by the billions of dollars spent on emergency bail - outs for banks and carmakers , begun under one of their own , President George W Bush .
Running up budget deficits to be paid for by future generations has a bad name in Washington .
So does " big government " .
Recession fears
But an economist on the conservative side ( he advised Republican presidential candidate , John McCain in 2008 ) , Mark Zandi of Economy.com , says deficits are a big concern , but not something we can afford to worry about right now .
" That 's a problem not for 2009 , not for 2010 .
That 's a problem for 2011 , 2012 and beyond , " he says .
" We have to make sure that we do n't go back into a recession , because if we go back into recession , the cost to taxpayers will be even greater .
" The deficits will be measurably larger , so I think it 's important to spend more money now . "
Mr Zandi says some government spending needs to be focused on state and local governments , whose tax revenues have fallen , so that they do not have to lay off workers .
Barack Obama is searching for new ways to fight unemployment
Another top priority is unemployment benefits , which normally run out after six months in the US , though they have been extended in states with the highest unemployment rates .
Mr Zandi sees continuing benefits to unemployed workers as key to maintaining demand , because people who do not have money do not buy things .
That can lead to a downward spiral : if consumers do not consume , businesses cut back on workers , who then have no money to spend either .
Long - term solutions
Another area where Mr Zandi feels the government can make a unique contribution is providing credit to small and medium - sized businesses .
After last year 's credit crisis , banks are still reluctant to lend .
However , traditionally they have provided capital to smaller companies for start - up and expansion , and these smaller companies typically create the majority of new jobs in America .
Even when the economy gets back on its feet , we 're going to have very high unemployment ... for a long time to come
Mark Zandi , Economy.com
Subsidising labour , in the form of tax cuts or subsidies for newly hired workers , could help get the ball rolling , by providing businesses with the confidence and certainty they need to move forward and add staff .
These are all short - term , cheque - book solutions .
America also needs long - term policies to help educate and retrain workers in the hardest - hit industries , such as car manufacturing and construction , two sectors claiming half of all jobs losses during this recession .
Historically , the expense of retraining has been shouldered by workers themselves , but the scale of permanent job losses in some industries warrants a government response .
Mr Zandi insists : " It 's clear that even when the economy gets back on its feet , we 're going to have very high unemployment in many parts of the country for a long time to come .
" One reason is that the people out of work do n't have the skills and education necessary to be employed in the jobs of the future . "
States and localities jealously guard their responsibility for education , but they rarely turn down federal money .
As a start , the federal government could fund expanded programmes and study at two - year community colleges which offer technical degrees in growing fields such as healthcare : radiology , nursing and more .
' Shadow unemployment '
Policy makers targeting job creation will need to broaden their view of how many people need help .
While the number of unemployed workers according to official counts stands at 15.7 million , another 9.3 million Americans are under - employed , working part - time because they cannot find full - time work , or have had their hours cut back .
An additional 2.4 million people who are out of work are not even counted as unemployed if they did not look for work during the four weeks preceding the latest household survey .
Statisticians consider them " marginally attached " to the workforce .
One in three of the marginally attached qualifies as a " discouraged worker , " who has given up looking for work , because he does not believe there is a job available for him .
So what many are now calling the " shadow unemployment rate " tops 18 million , 27 million including the involuntary part - time workers .
Circling back to the political realities behind the jobs summit , Congressional mid-term elections are less than a year away .
If dissatisfied voters turn out some of the fractious Democrats who currently lend the president a small and unreliable majority , he could end up with even less support for government stimulus programmes .

A lawsuit filed by EBay against Craigslist heads to a Delaware state courtroom next Monday , for a trial that promises to reveal the inner workings of two benchmark Web companies .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
It 's a story fraught with accusations of broken promises , backroom deals and deception , leaving an established Internet giant fighting to preserve its valuable stake in a well - loved classified advertising website .
A lawsuit filed by EBay Inc against Craigslist heads to a Delaware state courtroom next Monday , for a trial that promises to reveal the inner workings of two benchmark Web companies and bring to the witness stand two Internet pioneers : former eBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman and Craigslist founder Craig Newmark .
The twice - delayed trial will likely underscore the glaring differences in the companies ' approaches to business .
EBay , one of the high - flyers in the dot - com boom , pioneered online auctions and spurred millions of people around the world to sell and buy on the Web .
Despite generating $ 8.5 billion of revenue in 2008 and employing thousands of people , the San Jose - based company has been forced to broaden its market to better compete and expand beyond its traditional online auctions .
In contrast , privately held Craigslist , with only a few dozen employees , is now the top U.S. online classifieds site , beloved for its mostly - free service to help people find homes , adopt pets or sell junk from their garages .
Craigslist executives say they are driven by community , not a lust for profit .
At issue is eBay 's minority ownership in San Francisco 's Craigslist , a company that eBay says could potentially be worth several billion dollars .
In its April 2008 lawsuit , eBay claimed that Newmark and Chief Executive James Buckmaster hatched a " coercive plan " in 2007 and conducted " clandestine transactions " that diluted eBay 's stake to 24.85 percent from 28.4 percent .
Because eBay 's ownership fell below 25 percent , it lost its seat on Craigslist 's board .
EBay said an original shareholder agreement to be produced in court clearly outlined each party 's rights and responsibilities .
" We are very confident we acted properly throughout the relationship , " Deputy General Counsel Mary Huser said in an interview .
" We were open and honest regarding what we were doing and our intentions . "
A Delaware Chancery Court judge in October dismissed two eBay charges , but five counts including breach of fiduciary duty and issues related to the dilution of eBay 's stake remain .
UNCLEAN HANDS ?
Craigslist , in a separate lawsuit , filed in San Francisco Superior Court a month after eBay sued in Delaware , charged eBay with unfair competition , misappropriation of proprietary information , false advertising , trademark infringement and other deceptive practices .
In both cases , Craigslist claims that eBay used its seat on the board to obtain information and expertise to launch a competing classified advertising business , all the while denying that was its intention .
In the run-up to the trial of the Delaware lawsuit , which is expected to last two weeks , Craigslist has depicted its larger rival in an unsavory light .
" EBay has unclean hands , " fueled by a frustrated desire to own Craigslist outright , Craigslist said in a pretrial brief .
Craigslist claimed that after eBay in 2004 bought shares from one of Craigslist 's original investors , worried perhaps that a rival such as Google Inc might swoop in if it tarried , Whitman maintained that eBay had no designs on the company , and that Craigslist would become its " play in classifieds . "
But Craigslist said eBay never revealed that it was developing its own classified site , Kijiji , which it launched internationally in 2005 and in the United States in 2007 .
" If it could not own Craigslist , eBay would exploit its position as an insider and use Craigslist 's confidential information , experience , skill and innovations against Craigslist , " Craigslist wrote .
Whitman is now a Republican candidate to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of California .
Her spokesman declined to comment , referring questions to eBay .
STEALING CUSTOMERS ?
Craigslist also claims that eBay used deceptive tactics to direct traffic away from its site .
Legal briefs show online ads allegedly paid for by eBay used Craigslist 's name but diverted users to Kijiji or eBay .
Craigslist also contended that eBay , through its board seat , obtained confidential information such as traffic and listings data , and passed it to Kijiji executives .
Former eBay board member Josh Silverman spearheaded the Kijiji launch , it said .
Current eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe is not expected to testify .
He has tried to play down the significance of the trial , saying it is simply an issue of whether eBay owns 25 percent or 28 percent of Craigslist .
He calls eBay 's stake in the company a " nice investment . "
The Delaware case is eBay Domestic Holdings Inc v Newmark , et al , Delaware Chancery Court , No. 3705 - CC .

Infowars
December 2 , 2009
Infowars has posted numerous stories and videos documenting police and security guards harassing photographers and videographers in public spaces .
In the United States , it is entirely legal for you to photograph people , buildings , infrastructure , and even criminal activity in public , so long as you do not interfere with the police .
You do n’t need permission and the cops cannot legally stop you or confiscate your camera , film , or video tape .
It is legal to take photographs in public — even of police .
Earlier this year , Aaron Dykes was threatened with arrest in downtown Kansas City , Missouri after filming the local branch of the private Federal Reserve building .
Security guards working for the Fed approached Infowars reporters at a city park that houses the National WWI memorial and demanded that they provide their names and disclose why they were filming the building .
Dykes and the Infowars crew were legally photographing the Federal Reserve building but this did not stop over - zealous rent - a- thugs from threatening them .
Infowars posted a video of the confrontation , but YouTube removed it claiming it violates their terms of use .
Apparently Google ( who owns YouTube ) does not want people to know Americans are denied their right to photograph in public , especially when they are photographing buildings where criminal activity is planned and carried out .
In February , an independent videographer attempted to photograph the Federal Reserve building in Washington from a public sidewalk and was told he was violating the law by a Fed cop .
See the video :
In 2007 , WeAreChange founder and activist Luke Rudkowski was threatened with arrest by New York police for refusing to stop filming on a public sidewalk outside the offices of Larry Silverstein .
Cops dressed in street clothes accused Rudkowski of having a gun and a bomb in his backpack .
“ It is a serious federal and state crime to publicly state that someone has a bomb and is a terrorist when not true — like extreme example of yelling fire in a theater — and needs to be prosecuted , ” Alex Jones and Aaron Dykes wrote for the Jones Report on April 27 , 2007 .
In Britain , under section 44 of the Terrorism Act , citizens taking photographs can be stopped , have their film or digital media confiscated or deleted , and can even be arrested and charged as terrorists .
[ efoods ]
The police state is not as advanced in the United States .
For now , a photographer has the right to photograph in public , but that may change .
Below is a link to an information sheet that details your rights as a photographer .
It is based on the Bust Card and the Know Your Rights pamphlet that used to be available on the ACLU website .
According to Bert P. Krages
II , who distributed the sheet , you may distribute the guide to others , provided that such distribution is not done for commercial gain and credit is given to the author .
“ The right to take photographs in the United States is being challenged more than ever , ” writes Krages .
“ People are being stopped , harassed , and even intimidated into handing over their personal property simply because they were taking photographs of subjects that made other people uncomfortable .
Recent examples have included photographing industrial plants , bridges , buildings , trains , and bus stations .
For the most part , attempts to restrict photography are based on misguided fears about the supposed dangers that unrestricted photography presents to society . ”
Ironically , unrestricted photography by private citizens has played an integral role in protecting the freedom , security , and well - being of all Americans .
Photography in the United States has an established history of contributing to improvements in civil rights , curbing abusive child labor practices , and providing important information to crime investigators .
Photography has not contributed to a decline in public safety or economic vitality in the United States .
When people think back on the acts of domestic terrorism that have occurred over the last twenty years , none have depended on or even involved photography .
Restrictions on photography would not have prevented any of these acts .
Furthermore , the increase in people carrying small digital and cell phone cameras has resulted in the prevention of crimes and the apprehension of criminals .
As the flyer states , there are not very many legal restrictions on what can be photographed when in public view .
Most attempts at restricting photography are done by lower - level security and law enforcement officials acting way beyond their authority .
Note that neither the Patriot Act nor the Homeland Security Act have any provisions that restrict photography .
Similarly , some businesses have a history of abusing the rights of photographers under the guise of protecting their trade secrets .
These claims are almost always meritless because entities are required to keep trade secrets from public view if they want to protect them .

Imagine that you visit Restaurants.com and purchase a gift card for a friend .
During the checkout process , a screen asks if you want to save ten dollars on the purchase you just made , and it shows a single " Continue " button , as though this is just one more step in the process .
On the next page , you are offered information about some kind of discount club that will give you cash back on the purchase you just made , and there 's a box for entering your e-mail address .
You do so , thinking to yourself , " What can they do with my e-mail address , right ?
I 'll at least get some more information on what this is all about , or maybe I 'll sign up for this free trial .
Ca n't hurt , since they do n't have my payment info . "
You think nothing of it for months until , on one rainy Saturday , you look more closely at your credit card statement and wonder why you 're being charged $ 12 a month for something you do n't remember signing up for .
Digging through your previous statements , it 's clear that the mysterious charge recurs monthly , and has been going on since you purchased that gift certificate .
When you call the 1 -800 number listed next to the charge , you find out that you 're a member of a " rewards club ! " Congratulations !
That $ 10 savings has now cost you $ 70 plus twenty minutes on the phone — and all from entering an e-mail address at a retailer you thought to be legitimate .
Actually , you do n't need to imagine the scenario ; in reality , it happens all the time .
As one frustrated user wrote about her membership , " Becoming an on - line member to an organization seems obvious when entering an e-mail address , but paying for it is another matter .
I did not give my credit information for the purpose of signing up for a membership .
I gave my credit card information to Restaurants.com for a purchase of a gift certificate only .
If my credit card information was used for more than that purpose , it was done so without my knowledge or authorization . "
She 's not alone .
The Senate Commerce Committee issued a scathing report ( PDF ) about similar practices today , a report in which it tore into three specific online marketers ( Affinion , Vertrue , and Webloyalty ) which " use highly aggressive sales tactics to charge millions of American consumers for services the consumers do not want and do not understand they have purchased . "
It 's a lucrative business to be in .
The companies have pulled in more than $ 1.4 billion in revenue over the last decade , splitting the take ( which is pure profit ) with the merchants who provide access to their checkout process .
The " membership programs " that the companies offer have racked up 35 million enrolls , and the committee estimates that four million Americans are enrolled in the programs right now .
Although it 's easy to work up righteous indignation over the tactics on display here , the report notes that culpability goes beyond the marketers .
After all , these memberships appeared at well - known sites like Priceline , and the committee says that 88 websites have earned more than a million dollars a piece by participating in such programs .
Classmates.com raked in over $ 70 million .
And remember , that 's not revenue — it 's profit .
Did they know ?
But , to rehash the well - worn question , what did these marketing companies know , and when did they know it ?
Perhaps they had no idea that so many customers ended up repeating the words of the despairing Ophelia : " I was the more deceived . "
Commerce Committee investigators dug up plenty of evidence that this was n't accurate .
" Affinion , Vertrue , and Webloyalty ’s customer service centers are almost entirely dedicated to handling the large volume of calls from angry and confused consumers requesting cancellations , " says the report .
" One Webloyalty employee acknowledged in an e-mail that most of its calls were from members who are questioning charges or want to cancel their membership , while a Vertrue employee had estimated that cancellation calls represent approximately 98 percent of call volume .
The companies ‘ internal manuals train their call center representatives to answer questions such as , ' what is this charge ? ' or ' who are you ? ' "
An internal Vertrue customer survey found that 43 percent of visitors to its " membership center " were trying to find out about " the charge on my credit card that I did not recognize . "
Another 44 percent had come to " cancel the program . "
A single person showed up to " find out more about my membership benefits . "
The whole scheme was made possible by " card on file " agreements in which customer credit card information was passed directly from the retailer to the marketing firm after customers entered an e-mail address .
Most customers did not understand this was happening , and the marketing companies knew it , says the report .
" In another presentation to a partner , Webloyalty bluntly stated that requiring the consumer to re-enter credit card information would hurt conversion .
It noted , ' with data collection on the page [ y ] ou can expect at least a 70 % decrease in conversion . ' "
That is , asking people to enter credit card information would essentially dismantle the program .
Affinion told a partner that the conversion would be up to four times higher if the data was passed directly , rather than re-entered by customers .
The Commerce Committee even got its hands on the information that customers entered into a Vertrue suggestion box online .
These are the sort of responses that no marketer wants to see :
Spawn of Comp - U- Card
One interesting footnote to the investigation : all three of the companies singled out are based in Connecticut , and all three were started by former execs of Comp - U - Card , " a Connecticut company that pioneered the marketing of discount membership clubs . "
Comp - U- Card was launched in 1973 and had a checkered history .
After a merger with a company called Cendant in 1997 , Cendant soon announced that " CUC had falsely inflated the number of club memberships it had sold , thereby overstating its 1995 - 97 earnings by at least half a billion dollars .
A later investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission determined that CUC had been filing false financial statements since 1985 , and that the company ‘s misstatement of its income ' was of historic proportions . ' "
CUC 's founder was sentenced to 12 years in prison , and the company 's vice chairmen got a decade .
The men also had to repay $ 3.2 billion .
In a statement today , Webloyalty CEO Rick Fernandes defended his company and said it had changed its ways .
" Webloyalty offers subscription programs that can save consumers hundreds of dollars each year on entertainment , shopping and dining out , " he said .
" We believe the changes we have made over the years and continue to make show that we are committed to learning from our experience and continuously improving the way we engage with consumers . "
On August 1 , 2009 , Webloyalty changed its enrollment process so that subscribers had to enter the last four digits of their credit card to confirm the signup .
On November 13 , Affinion followed suit .
Vertrue , which has not issued a press release since 2008 , does not appear to have issued a statement .
Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , who launched the investigation earlier this year , presided over a hearing on the topic today .
In his opening remarks , he made sure to spread the blame around — especially to the merchants who partnered with these marketing companies .
" What 's happening is that many online merchants have decided to betray their customers ' trust , " he said .
" For a few extra bucks in profits , these merchants pass their customers ’ personal billing information on to mysterious companies with names like Affinion , Vertrue , and Webloyalty — companies that have a long , troubling history of misleading sales practices American consumers should n’t have to worry that their favorite websites are ripping them off during the checkout process . "
And Rockefeller ended with a threat : " Starting with this hearing today , I think this Committee needs to start thinking about the legislative steps we can take to end these practices . "
The final insult here to consumers is that almost none actually received their promised reward .
" According to information provided by the three companies , of the 34,262,674 members who were promised automatic cash gifts or other incentives , only 3 percent actually received the promised enrollment benefit . "

An 84 - year - old veteran and two volunteers in their sixties took on an armed robber at an east end Legion , chasing and tacking an armed man who tried to rob them as they counted money from poppy sales .
The assailant approached the men just after noon at Royal Canadian Legion branch on Robinson Avenue , near Danforth Avenue and Danforth Road .
They were counting about $ 10,000 in poppy money at the time .
Second World War Veteran John Dietsch grabbed the man ’s arm and refused to give him the money .
He told CP24 that he could n’t bear the thought of losing the funds they ’d worked so hard to collect over recent weeks .
“ Because of the time we served in the military and the fact that we ’d been out all last week counting money for poppies , that ’s what made me react , ” he said .
“ I thought , ‘ You ’re not getting away with that . ’ ”
The suspect pushed the Dietsch away but was then tackled by a Legion volunteer , Earl Gray , who is in his sixties .
The thief managed to get away , but escaped empty - handed .
Dietsch ’s daughter works at the Legion .
She says she was n’t surprised but could n’t be more proud .
Police are looking for a man in his late twenties .
Greek mythology as a video game genre is one of the few that has n’t been regurgitated to death .
The God of War franchise does a very good job of melding actual Greek mythology with custom storylines , compelling characters , and great gameplay .
Couple the non -stop action with some brilliantly designed levels , and God of War becomes a recipe for an epic saga .
Any PlayStation fan who is n’t familiar with the PS2 series now has the perfect opportunity to get acquainted before the release of God of War III .
The hero of this series , or anti-hero as it typically goes , is Kratos , a brutal Spartan captain who quickly amasses loyal troops .
His legendary army was a near unstoppable force until they were overwhelmed in battle by a Barbarian King and his ruthless followers .
With his men fallen , Kratos called upon Aries , the God of War , to aid him in during his darkest hour .
Aries heard his pleas for help and bestowed Kratos with the Blades of Chaos , weapons which were forged in the depths of Hades .
This heavenly request certainly comes with a price as Aries fuels Kratos ’ blood lust by making him his emissary of death .
Though the Blades of Chaos truly make Kratos unstoppable , they end up costing him more then he could ever imagine .
What was initially a gift quickly transforms into a curse , so much so that Kratos is later referred to as the “ Ghost of Sparta ” because of his pale white skin .
How that happens though is up to the player to find out .
Kratos ’ tale is ultimately one of ambition turned to hubris .
Greek gods tend to be more fickle and petty than humans , and this proves to be too much for Kratos as he seeks to exact revenge on the inhabitants of Mount Olympus .
The Blades are a violently elegant weapon , empowering their wielder with a ballet of death and a great gameplay mechanic .
Along his journeys , Kratos will receive other powers from both the Gods and Titans alike .
While the early part of the story primarily features Greece , the entire dark odyssey spans various regions , including the depths of Hades and the heights of Mount Olympus .

UPDATE : The Cantwell people wanted to know if this letter was " signed or anonymous " ?
I asked this question to the people at True Justice for Meredith Kercher and recieved this response :
The people at True Justice for Meredith Kercher , a website that has covered every inch of this case , and is very pleased with the verdict , have just sent Senator Cantwell , who is not happy with the verdict , this letter .
So , as a group of concerned Seattle area constituents who have been following every detail of this case since poor Meredith Kercher was murdered , we humbly offer you our assistance towards bringing things into proper perspective .
We ’re confused because it seems to us that if you had been following the case closely enough to be certain that not enough evidence had been presented by the prosecution that you would consequently have a very clear idea of how the Italian judicial system functioned and know whether or not anti-American sentiment had impacted the ruling .
We wonder because you said you were saddened by the verdict and had serious questions about the Italian judicial system and whether anti-Americanism had tainted the trial .
But then you went on to describe how you knew for a fact that the prosecution in the case did not present enough evidence for an impartial jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Amanda Knox was guilty .
A number of your well - informed constituents are wondering about your motivations for suddenly injecting yourself into the Meredith Kercher murder trial debate , immediately following last week ’s unanimous guilty ruling for American Amanda Knox in Perugia , Italy .
Ms Bongiorno has said nothing about anti-American sentiment having influenced the ruling against her client , nor has she complained about fundamental problems with the way this trial was run .
Instead , she is now completely focused on looking ahead to the appeal process as her next opportunity mitigate sentences or argue for her client ’s innocence .
This should assuage some of your concerns .
But perhaps you are referring to the extra year Ms. Knox received in comparison to Mr. Sollecito ’s 25 - year sentence as a clear example of anti-American sentiment ?
That ’s a fair concern ; however , in Italy the jury panel for a trial is required to submit a report within 90 days of a ruling describing in great detail the logic used to convict and sentence , or absolve a defendant .
For example , in Rudy Guede ’s fast - track trial for the murder of Meredith Kercher last year Judge Paolo Micheli issued an exhaustive 106 page report outlining the panel ’s labored decision - making process , in sometimes excruciating detail .
We can expect no less for the trial of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito , and when that report is issued we will have our best look yet at the evidence that was used to convict the pair .
We suggest that you seriously reconsider “ bringing ” Hillary Clinton and the State Department into the debate .
Consider that State Department spokesman Ian Kelly stated that the US embassy in Rome had been tasked with monitoring the trial and had visited Ms. Knox in jail , and several embassy representatives were known to have attended the reading of the ruling last week .
In addition , an American reporter based in Italy who has followed the case from the outset said last night on CNN that the trial had been monitored from the outset .
Secretary Clinton has clearly been very busy with far more critical tasks than to have maintained a personal familiarity with the Kercher murder case ; however , Kelly did state that in response to recent press reports Secretary Clinton had taken time to look things over and has yet to find any indication that Knox did not receive a fair trial .
You surely realize that Secretary Clinton will not be interested making public comments regarding an ongoing legal process in a sovereign , democratic nation that is a long - time ally of the United States .
Also note that on the Italian side or the equation , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told his countrymen that he has yet to receive any criticisms of the trial from the office of the US Secretary of State and that the fierce criticism of the case by the Seattle based Amanda Knox support group should not be confused as the position of the US government .
And Luciano Ghirga , Knox ’s own Italian lawyer , has stated that he does not question the validity of the trial and that he believes it was conducted correctly .
Furthermore , regarding your desire to have Clinton become involved , Ghirga concluded , “ That ’s all we need , Hillary Clinton involved … this sort of thing does not help us in any way . ”
Perhaps he is referring to the heated discussions in the Italian press these days regarding the strong criticisms of Italy ’s legal system coming from a country that supports Guantanamo Bay , the death penalty , and other perceived injustices of a far - from - perfect American legal system .
As these examples demonstrate , and from your own humble constituents ’ well - informed perspective , there is nothing out of the ordinary or alarming about the Meredith Kercher murder trial process .
The prosecutors and defense teams will continue to debate the evidence throughout the appeal process , just as we should expect them to .
If you do decide to go forward with your inquiry , despite significant opposition from your constituents , we recommend that you do so only after becoming more familiar with the evidence presented during the trial , as presented by a neutral source .
The family and friends of the US citizen recently convicted are probably not neutral .
If you take a good look , you will see that there are checks and balances in the Italian way of achieving justice , just as there are in the American system .
In the final analysis , it is completely as Beatrice Cristiani , deputy judge for the Kercher murder trial , put it : “ As far as I am aware our system of justice does not make provision for interference from overseas . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) - If Opus Dei had a rough ride in the blockbuster movie based on Dan Brown ’s “ The Da Vinci Code , ” it looks set for an altogether more sympathetic portrayal in another film that deals with the Catholic organization .

REUTERS / Handout
British director Roland Joffe , renowned for Oscar - nominated “ The Killing Fields ” and “ The Mission , ” is making “ There Be Dragons , ” a film set during the Spanish Civil War that focuses in part on the life of Opus Dei founder Jose Maria Escriva .
Principal photography is complete , and Joffe is now in the editing room aiming to have the movie , which stars Bond girl Olga Kurylenko , ready for theatres by autumn next year .
Joffe originally intended to turn down a project which , owing to its religious theme and Opus Dei ’s controversial profile , promises to draw closer scrutiny than the average film .
In The Da Vinci Code , Opus Dei was cast as a secretive cult that resorted to murder to defend a fictional , 2,000 - year - old Catholic cover - up .
It has also been criticized by church liberals suspicious of its power and reach and by estranged members telling of coercion and corporal mortification .
But when he saw a video of Escriva addressing a large crowd , Joffe changed his mind .
The priest , who was made a saint in 2002 , was asked by a Jewish girl if she should convert to Catholicism .
Knowing it would upset her parents , Escriva told her that she should not .
“ One of the things that impressed me a lot about Jose Maria was the fact that he saw that saintliness did n’t require that you withdraw into a religious order , it did n’t require that you become a priest , ” Joffe said on a recent conference call .
“ But actually saintliness , saintly acts , could be performed by perfectly ordinary people in their everyday lives , which at the time was a very radical idea . ”
PROPAGANDA FOR CULT ?
Opus Dei ( “ God ’s work ” ) teaches Catholics to strive for holiness through their work .
The far - flung , conservative Catholic organization was founded in 1928 and has around 85,000 members , some 2,000 of them priests .
Rather than making a biopic of Escriva , Joffe wrote a script that surrounded the priest with fictional characters and dealt with universal themes of love , betrayal and redemption .
The film ’s $ 30 million budget came from a mixture of a media company and some 100 investors led by producer Ignacio Sancha , a Spanish financier and Opus Dei member .
Sancha also provided Joffe with a leading Opus Dei member to advise him on set .
But despite his clear sympathies with Escriva ’s teachings , and the financial and logistical backing by members of the organization , Joffe rejected concerns that There Be Dragons will become a propaganda piece for Opus Dei .
“ When I wrote it ( letter of acceptance ) I said to the producers , one of whom is an Opus Dei member , ‘ Will I be free to write what I want ? ’
He said the only reason we ’re coming to you is so that you ’re free to write what you want . ”
Sancha agreed .
“ Roland would never get involved in propaganda , left wing or right wing , ” he told Reuters .
Propaganda or not ,
There Be Dragons will be welcome by Opus Dei members who feel their organization has been wrongly maligned because of misrepresentations in popular culture .
“ I used to think that Opus Dei was a cult , ” said Sancha , adding that he joined the group around 20 years ago .
“ I was a bit tired of hearing on one hand it was a cult and on the other it was fantastic .
I went to them and they gave me access to everything and I came to the conclusion that it is not a cult but one of the most modern parts of the Catholic church . ”
Joffe said Opus Dei ’s influence had been exaggerated .
“ How could it be influential ? ” he said .
“ It could have influence , I suppose , in the church .
I checked up to find out how many cardinals were Opus Dei and I think there may be one . ”
I LOVE my iPhone .
I just wish it were matched with Verizon Wireless , the carrier with the most envied reputation as fast , ubiquitous , reliable , nigh perfect .
Consumer Reports has just released its annual survey of cellphone service , and its respondents collectively agree with me about the rankings : AT&T occupies the bottom and Verizon , the top .
My sense of Verizon ’s superiority is confirmed every time I see a “ there ’s a map for that ” Verizon commercial , graphically showing how far more extensive Verizon ’s 3G network coverage is in less populated areas .
And it is reinforced when AT&T executives publicly confess  as Ralph de la Vega , the chief executive and president of AT&T mobility and consumer markets , did last week at an industry conference  that the company ’s wireless service in New York and San Francisco was “ below our standards . ”
When I set about looking for independent data , however , to confirm the superior performance of Verizon ’s network , I was astonished to discover that I had managed to get things exactly wrong .
Despite the well - publicized problems in New York and San Francisco , AT&T seems to have the superior network nationwide .
Britain 's economy performed marginally better than expected in the third quarter , according to official statistics published yesterday , but the revised figures still confounded hopes of a return to growth .
The report , produced by the Office for National Statistics , shows gross domestic product contracted by 0.2 per cent in the three months to September , a minor upward revision from previous estimates of 0.3 per cent .
But GDP was still 5.1 per cent lower than in the same quarter of 2008 – and six per cent below its early 2008 peak – leaving the UK on course for a 4.5 per cent contraction over 2009 as a whole , the worst slide since 1921 .
Other revisions put the depths of the worst of the recession even lower than originally thought – with growth figures for 2008 taken down from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In the third quarter of 2009 , output in manufacturing and the services sector was weaker than originally thought , while a surprisingly strong performance in the construction sector – up by 1.9 per cent rather than down by 1 per cent – helped push up the headline GDP figure .
But even with the improvements , the UK is still lagging behind its international rivals ( see graph ) .
Economists were disappointed that yesterday 's revisions did not go further .
Commentators were shocked when the first round of Q3 GDP numbers , published in October , showed a contraction of 0.4 per cent rather than the anticipated return to growth .
Then last week 's positive business investment statistics – down by just 0.6 per cent , rather than the forecast three per cent – renewed hopes that the overall GDP contraction could go up to just a 0.1 per cent fall .
On a more positive note , balance of trade numbers published separately yesterday show a narrowing deficit .
Although Britain 's imports were still worth £ 4.7 bn more than its exports in the three months to September , the gap represents only about 1.3 per cent of GDP , compared with deficits of nearer four per cent during the boom years .
The balance is being helped by depressed consumer demand and the weak pound .
But some economists maintain the deficit would have been smaller without the car scrappage scheme the Government introduced to boost the ailing auto sector .
By failing to specify that replacement cars must be made in the UK , the majority of the scrappage subsidy went abroad .
South Korean manufacturers did particularly well , with Hyundai 's sales up by 203 per cent by August , SsangYong 's by 167 per cent and Kia 's by 65 per cent .
Less encouraging for the UK 's economic health is that businesses of all kinds are still preferring to run down their stocks than buy more .
Inventories dropped by £ 4.6bn in the last quarter , even faster than the £ 3.7 bn fall in the three months to June .
Howard Archer , at IHS Global Insight , said : " Significantly , the economy would actually have achieved growth of 0.1 per cent in the third quarter , but for an increased running down of inventories . "
Of more ambivalent implication is the saving ratio .
Households saved a whopping 8.6 per cent of their income in the third quarter , compared with 7.6 per cent in the previous three months , and just 0.9 per cent in the same period of 2008 .
The spike is a mixed blessing , according to Jonathan Loynes , at Capital Economics .
" There is a contradiction in what policy - makers are trying to achieve , " he said .
" In the short term they want people to keep spending and lift us out of recession , but over the longer term they need to rebalance the economy away from excessive dependence on household borrowing and consumption . "

Men earn on average $ 66,690 a year .
Women earn $ 11,000 a year less .
This is a 17 percent difference .
Why ?
A recent Parliamentary report called Making It Fair suggested some reasons .
Over a lifetime women take time off to have and look after kids .
They predominate in low paid industries like nursing and retail .
More women work part time than men , again partly because of family responsibilities and partly because of the pay disparity .
Far better to lose some of the less well paid worker ’s salary than that of the better paid wage earner’s .
Women are also over - represented in the lower paid sections of the workforce and under - represented in the higher paid echelons of the workforce .
Thus for example over 50 percent of law students are women yet they make up less than ten percent of partners in law firms .
Almost 60 percent of the lower paid workforce in the public service are women .
Women make up not much more than a third of the senior levels .
These sorts of imbalances are systemic .
Women ’s lower status in terms of pay and work responsibilities is an integral part of capitalism .
It flows from the very way the system is organised .
Capital needs its next generation of workers .
It gets them on the cheap through the family unit , a unit in which women both bear and then raise ( as a generalisation ) the kids and do the house work .
This means a number of things .
Ideologically the capitalist state and the media portray the family as the bedrock of society , which is part of the reason Rudd Labor is about to overturn the ACT ’s civil unions laws passed a week ago .
When capitalists talk about bedrocks or foundations or building blocks of society they mean of course of capitalist society and the process of exploitation in which we create profits for the bosses and they steal them from us .
The family unit and the oppression of women that flows from it is a cheap way for capital to raise its next generation of workers .
It is overwhelmingly women workers who bear that cost .
The report said Australian society did not truly value traditional women ’s work , paid or unpaid .
This can lead to reactionary conclusions about women ’s choice to work or care , and being paid for home duties .
Such suggestions reinforce the role of women as homemakers and carers and trap them in unproductive work .
Cooperative work is what makes us human .
It fulfils us ( at the same time as under capitalism it alienates us ) .
The women ’s liberation movement did n’t fight for women to become home bodies ; it fought for real liberation , the first step of which was for women to enter the workforce as equals with men .
43 years ago some communist party women chained themselves to a rail outside the arbitration commission as part of the fight for equal wages for women .
What the figures from the Making It Fair report show is that formal equality is not the same as real equality .
The gender pay gap has been widening since 1992 .
This is an indictment of the leadership of the trade union movement and shows why unions in particular are unattractive to women .
Yet when unions with a majority female workforce do strike for better wages and conditions ( eg nurses and teachers ) women queue up to join because at last the union is doing something to improve their economic value and with it their sense of worth and work pride .
A concerted strike movement from major unions to improve the abysmal pay of groups like teachers , nurses and lower paid public servants would go some way to redressing the pay gap .
Of course a society which abolished hierarchy would also do that .
The report recommends bureaucratic manoeuvring like beefing up Fair Work Australia to enforce , educate and research on pay equity .
There would be some reporting requirements and eventually penalties .
Manoeuvring does n’t win real gains , action does .
What about paid maternity leave ?
The ACTU cut a deal with Rudd labour to pay the minimum wage for 18 weeks .
The scheme is so bad that a stay at home mum will receive $ 10,000 in Government benefits while a woman on the Government scheme will receive $ 9792 before tax .
The cost of this pathetic scheme , which does n’t start till January 2011 , is only $ 260 million .
By contrast the Government found $ 52 billion ( most of which has gone into the bosses ’ pockets ) for a stimulus package and is giving up to $ 20 billion of our money to the big polluters under its emissions trading scheme .
A fully paid scheme for 24 months ( for both partners ) is perfectly affordable .
The bosses have billions .
Impose the cost on them .
Most people who work part - time want to work more hours .
Cut the working week to 30 hours on full pay would partly address this issue .
As to the burden of housework , communal eateries and free household cleaning services would in part address that .
Free child care would help women back into the workforce .
None of this is particularly outlandish .
Other developed Western countries recognise the value women give to society and have paid maternity leave , free child care and the like .
The missing element is both a trade union movement serious about an industrial campaign for equal pay , and a women ’s liberation movement putting liberation back into the movement .
As the Builders ’ Labourers ’ Federation said many years ago : ‘ If you do n’t fight , you lose . ’
Let ’s organise in our workplaces for real equality for men and women .
I had a somewhat disturbing conversation yesterday with Steve Fussell , the senior VP of human resources at pharmaceutical maker Abbott .
His basic message , which I may pursue in a column down the road , was that Abbott is going to be hiring tons of people for high - paying jobs over the next decade , but not many of them will be Americans because we study the wrong things in college and we ’re not willing to work overseas .
The key quotes :
1 ) “ I hate to say we do n’t have the world ’s best universities .
We may have the best minds , the best liberal arts education .
The problem is it does n’t match the work anymore . ”
( That is to say , not enough students are getting science and math degrees . )
2 ) “ I do n’t have these graduates in Europe and Asia telling us they want to live with mom and dad or they do n’t want to relocate to Asia . ”
I do n’t know what I can do about the second issue , but here ’s my contribution ( via Robert Waldmann ) to persuading American college students to change their majors before it ’s too late :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9dpTTpjymE]
Update :
As this post has taken on something of a life of its own , I feel compelled to confess that one phrase above is really not the most accurate representation of what Fussell said .
I write that of Abbott ’s hires in the decade to come , “ not many … will be Americans . ”
Depends on how you define “ many , ” but what Fussell really seemed to be trying to get across was that not as many as he would like will be Americans .
Also , in the comments , omarlittle says that :
American citizens have to pay US taxes even if they work abroad ( one of the only countries to have such a system ) , they will also not be paying into social security and lose out on future pension payments .
I ’m sure there are some situations where what omarlittle says is true , but as somebody who worked overseas ( in London ) for a U.S. - based company ( Time Warner ) , I can report that I still paid in to Social Security and that , because foreign income taxes are deductible on U.S. tax returns and because the UK has this great system where you ’re exempt from their taxes every day you spend out of the country , my tax burden went down during the two years I lived there .

The message appeared on GM 's page on Facebook
General Motors ( GM ) has been subjected to a stinging attack on Facebook by someone claiming to be the daughter of its recently - departed boss .
An expletive - laden message , posted under the name Sarah Henderson , said Fritz Henderson did not resign as chief executive but was " asked to step down " .
It goes on to criticise acting boss Ed Whitacre as " selfish " , who " cares about himself " and not the company .
The post has since been removed .
GM declined to make any comment on it .
On Tuesday , GM announced that Mr Henderson , who was appointed as chief executive by the government in March , had resigned .
GM chairman Ed Whitacre is currently acting as an interim replacement until a permanent one can be found .
The message was posted on GM 's page on Facebook within minutes of the announcement .
It was removed by GM , but not before it was picked up by car industry blog Jalopnik.com , which copied the page and reposted it on its own site .
" We consider children of GM employees to be private citizens , " GM said in a statement .
" We do not believe a brief Facebook post by a child who had no actual knowledge of critical business issues , and which was removed almost immediately , moves a person from ' private ' to ' public ' status , and makes her a legitimate source for a major global business story . "

Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have done something that , apparently , no one has done before : rigorously collect data on debt and risk management ( or lack thereof ) over the past 800 years , rather than only since 1980 .
Their conclusion : excessive debt accumulation is always and everywhere a very , very bad thing .
Also : credit booms and busts happen over and over throughout history , with only the details changing ; public sector debt crises are common and devastating ; banking crises hit every country , rich and poor alike ; and when credit bubble pop , everything pops along with it .
And finally , a fifth lesson , as summarized by Martin Wolf :
The final lesson is that financial liberalisation and financial crises go together like a horse and carriage .
It is no surprise , therefore , that the last 30 years have seen waves of financial crises , of which the latest one is merely the biggest .
The current crisis is the worst since the Great Depression .
Yet , argue the authors , no one should have been surprised by this outcome .
The US showed all the classic symptoms of a country heading for crisis : a huge current account deficit ; soaring house prices ; headlong credit growth ; and , let us not forget , excessively complacent regulators .
It always comes back to debt and leverage , does n’t it ?
There are lots of other things to watch out for too , but the bottom line is that if you keep leverage at reasonable levels , your financial crises are likely to be manageable .
If not , not .
Tim Geithner , please take note .
Go ahead .
Break the chains .
Stop paying on your mortgage if you owe more than the house is worth .
And most important :
Do n't feel guilty about it .
Do n't think you 're doing something morally wrong .
That 's the incendiary core message of a new academic paper by Brent T. White , a University of Arizona law school professor , titled " Underwater and Not Walking Away : Shame , Fear and the Social Management of the Housing Crisis . "
White argues that far more of the estimated 15 million American homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages should stiff their lenders and take a hike .
Doing so , he suggests , could save some of them hundreds of thousands of dollars that they " have no reasonable prospect of recouping " in the years ahead .
Plus the penalties are nowhere near as painful or long - lasting as they might assume .
" Homeowners should be walking away in droves , " according to White .
" But they are n't .
And it 's not because the financial costs of foreclosure outweigh the benefits . "
Sure , credit scores get whacked when you walk away , he acknowledges .
But as long as you stay current with other creditors , " one can have a good credit rating again - meaning above 660 - within two years after a foreclosure . "
Better yet , you can default " strategically " : buy all the major items you 'll need for the next couple of years - a new car , even a new house - just before you pull the plug on your current mortgage lender .
" Most individuals should be able to plan in advance for a few years of limited credit , " says White , with minimal disruptions to their lifestyles .
What kind of law school professorial advice is this ?
Are n't mortgages legal contracts ?
In an interview , White said that in so - called anti-deficiency states such as Arizona and California , mortgage lenders have limited or no legal rights to pursue defaulting homeowners ' assets beyond the house itself .
In other states , lenders may decide it is not worth the legal expense to pursue walkaways , or consumers may be able to find flaws in the mortgage documents , disclosures or underwriting to challenge the original contract .
The main point , he says , is that too often people 's " emotions " get in the way of clear financial thinking about mortgages , turning them into what he calls " woodheads " - " individuals who choose not to act in their own self - interest . "
Most owners are too worried about feelings of shame and embarrassment following a foreclosure , and ignore the powerful financial reasons for doing so .
Buttressing these emotions is a system that White labels " the social control of the housing crisis " - pressures and messages continually sent to consumers by the " social control agents , " namely banks , government and the media .
The mantra these agents - all the way up to President Obama - pound into owners ' heads , says White , is that " voluntarily defaulting on a mortgage is immoral . "
Yet there is an inherent imbalance in the borrower - lender relationship which makes this morality message unfair to consumers :
Banks set the rules during the housing boom , handing out home loans with no down payments , no income checks , and inflated appraisals .
Now that property values have dropped 20 percent to 50 percent in many areas , banks have been slow to modify troubled mortgages and reluctant to reduce principal debts .
Only when homeowners cut through the emotional fog and default strategically in large numbers ,
White argues , will this inequitable situation be seriously addressed .
How does White 's 52 - page manifesto go over with mortgage lenders ?
Predictably , not well .
Officials at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - investors who fund the bulk of all new mortgages in the country - disputed White 's characterization of how quickly after foreclosure a walkaway borrower can obtain a new loan .
It 's not three years , they said , it 's a minimum of five years , absent extenuating circumstances such as medical or employment problems that caused the foreclosure .
" Borrowers who walk away from their mortgage obligations face serious consequences " including severely depressed credit scores for extended periods , said Brian Faith of Fannie Mae .
In addition , he said , " there 's a moral dimension to this as homeowners who simply abandon their homes contribute to the destabilization of their neighborhood and community . "
Lewis Ranieri , CEO of several major mortgage - related companies and one of the pioneers of the mortgage securities industry , called White 's entire argument " incredibly irresponsible and misinformed . "
Not only is the professor urging consumers to break legally binding contracts , said Ranieri , but if large numbers of them did so it would send home mortgage rates soaring and " tear apart the very basis " upon which mortgage lending rests - the understanding that borrowers will honor their commitments and pay back the money they borrowed .

We 've spent this week talking about horror in all its myriad forms : scary sex scenes , terrible monsters , and mental horrors .
But some of the most haunting and terrifying horror stories are n't merely terrifying ; they 're also terribly sad .
Advertisement
I have to confess , it 's very hard for me to watch horror movies .
It 's not that I do n't enjoy the occasional scare , and it's not that I 'm worried about ghosts and monsters following home ( although I will confess to a mild fear of zombies ) .
No , it 's just that when the body count starts rising , I start feeling , well , sad .
I do n't come out of the theater pumping with adrenaline ; I 'm too distracted thinking about the people who died and the loved ones they 've left behind .
The plots of several pieces of horror are discussed below , so be warned there may be spoilers .

The movie that really hit this home for me is not a science fiction movie , but Wes Craven 's Scream .
In the movie 's opening sequence , Drew Barrymore is terrorized by a knife - wielding serial killer one night while she 's home alone .
As the killer is chasing her down , her parents pull up in the driveway .
For a brief moment , it looks like she 's saved , but in the next shot , we see the parents , happy from a pleasant evening out , and their daughter pulled down by the killer before she has the chance to cry out for help .
How horrible .
It 's a suspenseful moment to be sure , but one that evokes horror more than terror .
Horrifying that she was so close to salvation only to meet a brutal end , and horrifying that her parents will find their daughter mutilated on their lawn and spend the rest of their lives wondering what would have happened if they have come home just a little sooner .
It 's a scene tinged with more tragedy than terror .

Horror is a genre that picks and pokes at our deepest anxieties .
It 's a reminder that we live in an unstable world , and that no matter how careful or good we are , we could at any time be struck with death , disfigurement , or madness .
A lot of horror movies appeal to our limbic systems , to that part of our brain that wonders what lurks in the shadows and triggers a happy release of hormone every time someone shouts " Boo ! "
And there is undeniably an artistry to that , to the sort of jumps and thrills so frightening that , weeks later , you 're still checking under the bed for demons from Hell .
But often the horror that still lingers for years afterwards are the ones that play on the less primal — but still very human — fears of losing the ones you love and being left alone in the world .
When Heartbreak Drives the Horror
Horror protagonists do n't always make the best choices .
They insult powerful witches , run up the stairs when they should run out the door , and try to capture the man-eating alien instead of killing it .
And when Louis Creed buries his son Gage in the Micmac burial ground in Stephen King 's Pet Sematary , we know it 's a bad idea .
He knows it 's a bad idea .
But he so desperately hopes that he can repair his wounded family that he is willing to make a terrible and utterly wrong decision .
And when Gage comes back only to murder his mother , Louis too easily manages to talk himself into burying his wife in the same graveyard .
Advertisement
It should be a forehead - slapping moment , but it 's depressingly relatable .
That Gage comes back as an undead monster is pretty horrifying ( he did make our list of scariest characters in film ) , but what 's more horrifying is what grief can drive Louis to do .
His grief is so potent , so unbearable that he 's willing to make monsters out of his loved ones in the hope that seeing them again will mend his heart .
It 's an idea that harkens back to WW Jacobs ' " The Monkey 's Paw , " that famed exercise in truly depressing horror .
After the Whites receive a wish - granting monkey paw , they wish for money , only to lose their son in an accident and receive compensation for his death .
In that moment , they understand the nature of the monkey paw : it grants wishes , but in a perverse way .
Still , the husband defers to his wife 's terrible , maddening grief and wishes their son back to life .
But , like Louis Creed , Mr. White must make his son dead again — knowing what comes back could n't possibly be right — doubling his guilt and grief .
Advertisement
There are reasons why stories like " The Monkey 's Paw " endure , and why its ideas find its way into so many other works of horror .
They force us to access our fears of losing those closest to us , asking us how far we would go to keep them with us .
Perhaps the most frightening thing about these stories that many of us will face terrible grief in our lives — and perhaps even guilt at the deaths of our loved ones — and we could be capable of making the same terrible decisions as the people in these stories , even if we do n't get the opportunity to act on them .
When Losing Someone Makes Things That Much Worse
Even when grief and loss are n't the focus of a horror story , a moment of terrible loss can have more impact than even the most terrifying monster .
28 Days Later adds a frightening bit of realism to the zombie apocalypse , but it never forgets that the fear of losing your life is little match for the sadness that comes in a world suffused with death .
When Jim discovers that his parents committed suicide in the face of violent death ( leaving a note begging him not to wake from his coma ) , it 's a bright spot of pain in a movie already filled with terror .
But when our merry band of survivors becomes something of a family , with Frank playing the wise and protective father , the apocalypse seems survivable , almost manageable .
Then Frank becomes infected with the Rage virus , and it's not just another zombie movie death .
It puts a lump in your throat and reminds you that the zombie outbreak is n't all fun and killing the Infected — it 's actually horribly sad .
Advertisement
This threat of loss adds dimension to other horror movies as well .
Take The Ring , a film already terrifying in its J - horror weirdness .
That The Ring turns a VHS cassette into an object of terror is incredibly impressive , but it's when Rachel 's son Aidan watches the tape that the clock really starts ticking .
Faced with the death of her son , Rachel must not only save herself , but survive long enough to keep Samara from killing her son as well .
It adds a deeper , driving motivation to an already scary movie .

Joss Whedon is perhaps the master of this particular brand of horror .
Though the series was filled with man-eating monsters , death in Buffy the Vampire Slayer is often random , senseless , and poignant .
Few moments in the show stand out as clearly as Joyce 's death from an aneurysm , or Tara 's from a stray bullet .
The central theme in Buffy is that family and friends make life grand , even when your life is filled with mayhem and violence .
In such a world , few things are as horrifying as losing part of your family , and such deaths always left the characters unbalanced , even psychotic with grief .
Even the show 's most calculated death , Angelus ' slaying of Jenny Calendar , is designed to maximize heartbreak .
It 's not enough that Angelus kills her ; he also has to place her in Giles ' bed with a trail of roses leading up to it , in a mockery of romantic seduction .
And that heartache , far more than fear , drives Giles to hate and try to destroy Angelus .
When Your Loved One Turns Monstrous
This is a staple of vampire and zombie movies , when you find you must destroy the creature wearing your loved one 's face .
Buffy tried this in the very first episode , turning Willow and Xander 's friend Jesse bloodsucker and forcing Xander to kill him an episode later .
It 's not the strongest instance of this particular trope ( I 'm not sure if Jesse is even mentioned later in the series ) , but it 's a solid introduction to the horrible nature of vampires .
Zombie movies are stronger in this regard .
Even Shaun of the Dead , a movie mostly devoted to the funny side of the undead , goes suddenly tearjerker when we learn Shaun 's mother has been bitten by a zombie .
This bit of sadness is then compounded by the ensuing debate over shooting Shaun 's dead mother in the head .
Even though everyone knows it has to happen , Shaun can't bring himself to let it happen , and even the normally logical Liz argues against it .
And when his mother inevitably rises from the dead , Shaun is the one who must shoot her body , a shockingly tearful moment from the zombie romantic comedy .
Advertisement
It 's another work from Stephen King , The Shining , that offers a more realistic view on why this concept is so horrifying .
Jack Torrance is a man so driven to drink that he gives his soul over to the hotel for alcohol .
In the movie , it 's played more as slasher horror , with Jack Nicholson gleefully hunting down his wife and child , but it 's a grim reminder that the people we love could become the people we fear , or that we ourselves might be capable of inflicting terrible harms on our loved ones .

When Hope Is Your Worst Enemy
Advertisement
Few genres are as relentlessly obsessed with death as post - apocalyptic fiction .
In Cormac McCarthy 's The Road , death abounds ; most of the world is dead , bands of rapists and murderers prowl the road , and the protagonist 's wife has killed herself .
The protagonist is not concerned for his own survival — he 's already dying — but for his son's .
He 's confronted with the wrenching knowledge that he might have to kill his son to save him from an even worse fate .
But he hopes for something better , hopes that he will find good people with whom his son could make a future .
The whole book is a dirge for civilization , but the father 's hope might only leave his son open to future horrors — and tragically , the father dies without knowing his son will fall in with good people after all .
In The Walking Dead , zombies are less agents of fear than they are death incarnate , and the comic often plays on themes of hope and how we cope with loss .
Hope is tragic as much as it is necessary for survival .
A farmer keeps his undead family in a barn by his house , hoping there will someday be a cure .
The survivors hope to rebuild some semblance of civilization , but lose some of their number every time they think they 've found peace .
And as brutal and horrible as death is for the ones who die , the grief of the survivors is far more powerful and frightening .

The Fear of Dying Alone
It 's telling that the very first episode of The Twilight Zone , " Where Is Everybody ? " deals with loneliness , and the human need for companionship .
It 's a theme that inspired one of the more unnerving episodes of Star Trek : The Next Generation .
In " Remember Me , " Dr. Crusher sees the her son and everyone else aboard the Enterprise disappear , until she 's the only one left ( of course , it turns out that she 's the one who has actually disappeared , in this case into a static warp bubble ) .
The episode has a Twilight Zone quality to it , but it 's especially bleak that Crusher is at the center of it .
Here is a woman who has already lost a husband to the hazards of Starfleet , whose closest friends routinely put their own lives in danger , and whose son is joining the very military organization that took her husband .
" Remember Me " is , more than anything , a metaphor for the very real possibility that she could end up alone .
Even Garfield , of all things , played with this idea in its surprisingly depressing 1989 Halloween run , where the orange fat cat wakes to a future where his house is abandoned and he never exists .

Even the episode of The Twilight Zone that was most optimistic about the apocalypse , " Time Enough at Last , " deals with loneliness .
After a nuclear attack wipes out everyone around him , Burgess Meredith is about to commit suicide until he realizes there 's a library full of books to keep him company .
It 's only when he breaks his glasses that he feels truly alone , and that loneliness is more frightening than anything that goes bump in the night .

Not so fast .
Gretchen Carlson , the host of Fox and Friends on Fox News Channel , highlighted poll results Dec. 4 claiming that 94 percent of Americans suspect scientists of using falsified climate data .
The totals figures in the poll added up to 120 percent .
Carlson , the Daily Show‘s Jon Stewart noted , claims to have been so uneducated that she needed to Google the terms “ czar ” and “ ignoramus . ”

Turns out that she was valedictorian of her high school class and graduated with honors from Stanford .
The Daily Show revealed her academic past Tuesday : she also studied at Oxford University , and plays classical violin .
“ How do you get a job on television if you appear to be one of those people who need to pin their address to their coat so a stranger can help them find their way home ? ”
Stewart asks .
Fox producer Lauren Petterson , executive producer of Fox & Friends , said in an interview Tuesday that the 120 % graphic was n’t erroneous .
“ We were just talking about three interesting pieces of information from Rasmussen , ” Petterson said .
“ We did n’t put on the screen that it added up to 100 percent . ”
The video from Tuesday night ’s Daily Show follows .
Broadcast 5 January 1995 , the first episode looks at how plants are able to move .
The bramble is an aggressive example : it advances forcefully from side to side and , once settled on its course , there is little that can stand in its way .
An altogether faster species is the birdcage plant , which inhabits Californian sand dunes .
When its location becomes exposed , it shifts at great speed to another one with the assistance of wind — and it is this that allows many forms of vegetation to distribute their seeds .
While not strictly a plant , the spores of fungi are also spread in a similar fashion .
One of the most successful ( and intricate ) flowers to use the wind is the dandelion , whose seeds travel with the aid of ‘ parachutes ’ .
They are needed to travel miles away from their parents , who are too densely packed to allow any new arrivals .
Trees have the advantage of height to send their seeds further , and the cottonwood is shown as a specialist in this regard .
The humidity of the tropical rainforest creates transportation problems , and the liana is one plant whose seeds are aerodynamic ‘ gliders ’ .
Some , such as those of the sycamore , take the form of ‘ helicopters ’ , while others , such as the squirting cucumber release their seeds by ‘ exploding ’ .
Water is also a widely used method of propulsion .
However , most plants use living couriers , whether they be dogs , humans and other primates , ants or birds , etc. , and to that end , they use colour and smell to signify when they are ripe for picking .
Governments are pumping euros into the financial system
Bank lending to companies operating in the eurozone fell in September for the first time on record , according to the European Central Bank .
Lending fell at an annual rate of 0.3 % , compared with a modest annual growth of 0.1 % in August .
The fall comes at a time when European governments are pumping money into their economies to try to lift lending .
The worry is that weak lending from banks will hinder any recovery in the eurozone economy .
Survival
The annual rate of lending to households also fell by 0.3 % , following a fall of 0.2 % in August .
Mortgage lending fell at an even faster pace , by 0.6 % .
" The September credit data reinforce concerns that weak bank lending could hold back eurozone recovery , " said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight .
He added that restricted lending could remain a " serious handicap " to recovery .
But some analysts pointed out that the fall in lending did not necessarily show that government stimulus policies were not working .
The money may be available to lend , but companies may simply not want to borrow it , as they are concentrating on survival rather than expansion , they argued .
" You still ca n't say there is a credit crunch , " said Michael Schubert at Commerzbank .
" The breakdown shows that it is mainly the lower demand on the part of businesses because of the recession that has led the fall in credit . "
The eurozone is still officially in recession , although most analysts expect upcoming figures to show that the bloc returned to growth between July and September .
A British court issued an arrest warrant for Israel 's former foreign minister over war crimes allegedly committed in Gaza this year – only to withdraw it when it was discovered that she was not in the UK , it emerged today .
Tzipi Livni , a member of the war cabinet during Operation Cast Lead , had been due to address a meeting in London on Sunday but cancelled her attendance in advance .
The Guardian has established that Westminster magistrates ' court issued the warrant at the request of lawyers acting for some of the Palestinian victims of the fighting but it was later dropped .
The warrant marks the first time an Israeli minister or former minister has faced arrest in the UK and is evidence of a growing effort to pursue war crimes allegations under " universal jurisidiction " .
Israel rejects these efforts as politically motivated , saying it acted in self - defence against Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza .
Livni , head of the opposition Kadima party , played a key role in decisions made before and during the three - week offensive .
Palestinian officials and an Israeli human rights organisation say about 1,400 people , mostly civilians , were killed in the Gaza offensive .
Israel says 1,166 Palestinians died and claims most were combatants .
Israel says it acted in self - defence against Hamas rockets from Gaza .
Thirteen Israelis died .
No one involved in the Westminster episode was prepared to confirm , on the record , what had transpired in a chaotic series of highly sensitive legal moves .
But a pro-Palestinian group welcomed news of the abortive move as " long overdue " .
The Foreign Office , clearly deeply embarrassed by the episode , said in a statement : " The UK is determined to do all it can to promote peace in the Middle East and to be a strategic partner of Israel .
To do this , Israel 's leaders need to be able to come to the UK for talks with the British government .
We are looking urgently at the implications of this case . "
Livni's office said she had decided in advance not to come to the UK but lawyers seemed unaware of that when they approached the court last week .
The judge refused to issue the warrant until it was clear Livni was in fact in the country , as he was erroneously informed on Sunday .
The former minister had been scheduled to speak at a Jewish National Fund conference .
" Scheduled meetings with government figures in London could not take place close to the conference and would have necessitated a longer - than - planned absence from Israel , " her office told the Ynet website .
It is the second time in less than three months that lawyers have gone to Westminster magistrates court asking for a warrant for the arrest of an Israeli politician .
In September the court was asked to issue one for the arrest of Ehud Barak , Israel 's defence minister , under the 1988 Criminal Justice Act , which gives courts in England and Wales universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases .
Barak , who was attending a meeting at the Labour party conference in Brighton , escaped arrest after the Foreign Office told the court that he was a serving minister who would be meeting his British counterparts .
The court ruled he enjoyed immunity under the State Immunity Act 1978 .
According to Israeli sources , ministers who wish to visit the UK in a personal capacity have begun asking the Israeli embassy in London to arrange meetings with British officials .
These offer legal protection against arrest .
Livni , crucially , cannot enjoy any such immunity as she is an ex-minister .
Ehud Olmert , the former prime minister , is in the same position .
Because of the potential damage to UK - Israeli relations – and because of legal pitfalls facing those who disclosed information about the application – few people with any detailed knowledge of it were prepared to comment today .
The Ministry of Justice , Scotland Yard and clerks at the magistrates court refused to discuss the matter .
A statement issued by HM Court Service implied that there had been no application for an arrest warrant , stating " there is no record of any such hearing " .
A spokeswoman maintained that this was not a misleading statement .
Samuel Hayek , chairman of the Jewish National Fund UK , the charity whose conference Livni had been due to attend , said : " I am not at liberty to confirm her precise reasons for not attending . "
He added : " In any event , it is regrettable that the British government is unable to conduct free dialogue with Israel 's most senior statesmen and politicians . "
Tayab Ali , the solicitor who tried to obtain a warrant for the arrest of Barak on behalf of 16 Palestinians , said his firm was " ready , willing and able to act for clients to seek the arrest of anyone suspected of war crimes " who travelled to the UK .
Livni's office described her as " proud of all her decisions regarding Operation Cast Lead " .
It added : " The operation achieved its objectives to protect the citizens of Israel and restore Israel 's deterrence capability . "

President says that a US travel ban against people infected with the HIV virus will end early next year
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Barack Obama said today that a US travel ban against people infected with the HIV virus will be overturned early next year .
The order will be completed on Monday , Obama said , finishing a process begun during the administration of George Bush .
The United States is one of about a dozen countries that bar entry to travellers based on their HIV status .
The ban has been in place for more than 20 years .
Obama said it will be lifted just after the new year , after a waiting period of about 60 days .
" If we want to be a global leader in combating HIV / Aids , we need to act like it , " Obama said at the White House before signing a bill to extend the Ryan White HIV / Aids programme .
Begun in 1990 , the program provides medical care , medication and support services to about half a million Americans with HIV or Aids , mostly low - income people .
The bill is named for an teenager who contracted Aids through a blood transfusion at age 13 .
Ryan
White went on to fight Aids - related discrimination against him and others like him in the late 1980s and to help educate Americans about the disease .
He died in April 1990 aged 18 .
His mother , Jeanne White - Ginder , attended the signing ceremony , as did several members of Congress and HIV / Aids activists .
In 1987 , at a time of widespread fear and ignorance about HIV , the department of health and human services added the disease to the list of communicable diseases that disqualified a person from entering the United States .
The department tried in 1991 to reverse its decision but was opposed by Congress , which in 1993 went the other way and made HIV infection the only medical condition explicitly listed under immigration law as grounds for inadmissibility to the country .
The law effectively has kept out thousands of students , tourists and refugees and complicated the adoption of children with HIV .
No major international Aids conference has been held in the United States since 1993 because HIV - positive activists or researchers could not enter the country .
Obama said lifting the ban " is a step that will save lives " by encouraging people to get tested and to get treatment .
Rachel B Tiven , executive director of Immigration Equality , said the ban pointlessly has barred people from the United States , and separated families with no benefit to the public health .
" Now , those families can be reunited , and the United States can put its mouth where its money is : ending the stigma that perpetuates HIV transmission , supporting science and welcoming those who seek to build a life in this country , " said Tiven , whose organisation works for fairness in immigration for gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender and HIV - positive people .
Under a programme begun by Bush , the United States spends billions of dollars annually to fight HIV / Aids in Africa .
November 9 , 2009
Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights , says that the conviction in Italy of 23 Americans , most of them CIA employees , for the kidnapping and torture of an Egyptian cleric is some good news , for a change , on the issue of torture .
YOU MAY recall the case .
The CIA was accused of a 2003 kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric , Abu Omar , from the streets of Milan , Italy .
He was rendered to Egypt where he was tortured .
A courageous Italian prosecutor , Armando Spataro , had been pursuing the case since that time over the objections of the Italian government .
Luckily , in Italy , the prosecutors are independent of the political branches of the government , and Spataro , despite many attempted roadblocks , went ahead .
Now the court has come back with convictions and jail sentences .
Robert Seldon Lady , the former CIA station chief in Milan got eight years , and 22 other Americans got five years each .
Utterly remarkable !
The only problem is none of the defendants showed up for trial , and Italy was unwilling to ask for their extradition .
Despite this , the convictions are really earth - shattering news , although the New York Times asserts they will have " little practical effect . "
Just ask the 23 convicted operatives if they agree with that sentiment .
They are considered fugitives in 25 countries of the European Schengen area , and are subject to arrest .
Upon arrest , they will be sent to Italy to serve out their jail sentences .
Italian prosecutor Armando Spataro
Already , one of those convicted is suing the U.S. , claiming that she should have received diplomatic immunity .
And I wonder what those agents think about Stephen R. Kappes , who at the time of the kidnapping was the assistant director of the CIA 's clandestine branch , and is said to have planned the rendition ?
He was not a defendant , having not been in Italy , but is currently President Obama 's second - ranking CIA official .
So he is off the hook , at least for the moment , and can still enjoy Rome and Paris .
So no wonder a U.S. spokesmen said the administration was " disappointed " in the verdicts .
Just think about the message these convictions send for the future , even if these agents do not spend a day in jail .
If you were a CIA agent , would you kidnap again ?
Would you waterboard ?
This is why prosecutions work .
They act as deterrence .
No matter what happens now , no matter what the Obama administration does to get rid of these convictions -- e.g. , getting Italy to grant clemency - - a clear message has been sent .
Committing human rights atrocities , even if done in the name of national security and for the most powerful state in the world , does not give you immunity .
I do n't think all such lawbreaking will cease , not by a long shot .
However , the Italian courts have taken a powerful first step toward giving substance to the expression that no one is above the law .
The lesson the Obama administration should learn is that unless and until it holds U.S. officials accountable , other counties will .
The Schengen countries where the U.S. officials will be arrested include : Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia , Spain , Sweden and Switzerland .

Kari Ferrell , the crazy pathological liar and scammer now legally known as the " Hipster Grifter , " is already an internet superstar !
We have new stories about her from unfortunate acquaintances .
And the cops are everywhere !
Ferrell made the Salt Lake City PD 's most wanted list because she has six outstanding warrants for stealing a total of $ 60,000 .
And Det. Mark Evans , who is leading the grifter hunt , says he now has an extradition order that allows him to fly out to any state where she 's arrested and drag her back to Utah .
" Normally , the only times SLC extradites is for rapists and murderers , but since she 's left such a large path of victims here , we were able to convince a judge to make her extraditable . "
Evans did n't have any new info about her whereabouts , but he said he got a call last week from someone claiming to be Ferrell 's friend .
" I 've never spoken to her , though , " he says , " so it could have been her trying to get the details on how extensive our investigation is . "
It is very extensive , Kari .
If you think you may know where she is , be sure to let us know .
Online posses have already formed Myspace and Facebook groups to hunt her down .
Victims of her lies are speaking out on their blogs .
[ Doree Shafrir has started a meme ! ]
And a few people have emailed us already about their run-ins with Kari .
One guy says he thinks he met her at a gallery show in Brooklyn last Saturday and had dinner with her , and that she said she was pregnant .
Another tipster says he had the misfortune of living with Kari , just this month :
My roommate and I had the pleasure of Kari living with us for maybe a week this very month .
There 's a reason she 's made the rounds without being tarred and feathered .
She 's LIKABLE .
We found her via Craigslist and were happy to have found so personable and fun a girl to live with .
Then , by luck , I came across Vice Magazine 's blog entry about her , titled " Oopsies .
We hired a grifter . "
That evening I told her we quite sadly must part ways .
Among her stories were :
" Someone stole my XBox account number and bought $ 3,000 of media content with it . "
" That check from my last roommate bounced ?
That bastard !
I 'll pay you tomorrow . "
" What you do n't get is that I was the victim in Utah .
I was simply trying to protect myself when this all went down . "
" I cleared up that little thing in Utah .
It 's nothing more than a missed court date . "
Five warrants for $ 60,000 and a line of Internet denizens looking for your head on a platter ... because of a missed court date ?
Oh Kari .
We hardly knew ye , and are glad that it stayed at " hardly " .
Not as bad as it could have been !
But the most detailed tip we got was from a guy who says he knew her back in Utah , and that she has n't changed a bit .
His story is below :
For starters , Kari is a bona fide sociopath .
She grew up in South Jordan in one of the many stucco middle to upper - middle class neighborhoods that emerged overnight in the Salt Lake Valley .
She was adopted , had a younger brother ( also adopted ) who lived with their mother in Arizona .
I always felt bad for her dad , Terri .
He bore much of the brunt of her frequent damage until he finally Pontius Piloted her out of his life , refusing to help or do anything else to enable her .
I knew Kari when I was 19 .
One of my favorite Kari-tales goes as follows :
She invited me to go to a midnight showing of The Shining at an art house theatre down the street from me .
She had told me she lived downtown , but , for some odd reason , she needed to pick her up in South Jordan 20 miles away in the heart of mouth - breathing Mormondom .
Not a problem , I thought .
I met her in a parking lot and drove back .
On the way , she told me a. ) she was a vetrinary assistant , b. ) while a vetrinary assistant she was the victim of racial prejudice and c. ) this racial prejudice resulted in her dog being killed by a co-worker .
Uh , what ?
This was a pretty typical sort of chain - lie that Kari would tell , but should show that Kari lied about EVERYTHING , not just select things .
I digress .
We went to the movie .
It was crowded ; packed , even .
The lights went down and , almost instantly , her clammy hand made way for the Croatian Coast .
Yes , right there , in the middle of a crowded theatre .
I had hardly known her a week and was sitting in a crowded theatre so I was n't having it .
I pushed her hand away .
We sat in silence the rest of the movie and drove home , largely in silence .
When I finally dropped her off , she made an attempt at a kiss .
Shudder .
Anyway , it was amusing for a minute , but got old real quick when she staged a fake trip to the hospital complete with maudlin , bathos - ridden texts .
I had had enough and cut her off .
Completely .
Nevertheless , every couple of months I would get unsolicited statements like " I joined the Peace Corps and now I 'm off to Mozambique " or " I 'm having a book of poems published . "
Ha , fucking ha .
In addition to the texts , Kari would invade different circles of friends , triggering their sympathies through a chain of predictable - albeit - unmanaged lies while tempting them with her cool , fictional connections or professions .
The scam always worked , for a while anyway .
I 'm amazed at how many people I meet around the city in the 18 - 27 range that have been duped by her .
The worst , however , was last summer , when Kari had infiltrated a group of friends , against my advice and common fucking sense .
She dated one friend , Brandon ; but he dumped her when she wound up in jail for , drum roll , check fraud .
After Brandon threw her curbside , she made a move for Brian , who requited .
During this time , she still maintained that she worked for TicketMaster and totally had connections to national touring acts .
The coup de grace came in July came when she told all of them , again , against mine and everyone elses ' adivce , that she could get them backstage all - access passes to the festival and even arrange to meet Sonic Youth after they played Daydream Nation in its entirety .
They all bought , pricey tickets and even gave her some money on the side .
The day before they are scheduled to leave , Kari outright disappeared , emerging a week later with some lie about a stolen phone or hospital visit .
Brian continued to date her ( ' cause , you know , masochism totally rawks ! ) and even posted bail the last and final time she was busted before leaving for Brooklyn to work that totally not - fake TicketMaster job .
She broke parole , missed court dates and Brian had to eat the entire hat , $ 6,000 price tag and all .
I 'm not surprised that she repeated the same patterns in Brooklyn .
I would almost re-lose faith in humanity if she did n't , actually .
I just can't believe how quickly it blew up .
I 've already been texting people that were either totally boned or , like me , just endlessly annoyed and occasionally entertained by her .
Ah , schadenfreude , more enriching than mother 's milk .
Good luck finding that blood tic .

Attorney General Opens Investigation into Los Angeles Sheriff ’s Department Regarding Mitrice Richardson
February 12 , 2016
After six ( 6 ) years and countless efforts with various agencies Michael Richardson , Father of Mitrice Richardson who vowed he would never give up , finally received a letter on February 10 , 2016 , from California Attorney General , Kamala Harris ’ office indicating that her office would be investigating the conduct of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department as it relates to the legal review disappearance and death of Ms. Richardson .
Michael L. Richardson , Father of Mitrice Richardson send 's heartfelt and emotional letter one ( 1 ) day after Christmas 2015 to Attorney General , Kamala Harris .
December 26 , 2015
" I was just angry at this point !
Dr. Rhonda Hampton , a mentor to Mitrice and who has put in countless hours in trying to help the family seek justice for Mitrice was sent a denial letter from the Inquiry Unit of the Attorney General Office less than three ( 3 ) weeks after submitting over five - hundred pages of information for them to review .
I said to myself , they could not have possibly reviewed all that information in such a short time . "
That Angelic voice I often hear and look forward to when no one else is around said , " hey Pop , you on the Peoples Court , you have less then thirty ( 30 ) minutes to make your case in 1500 words or less , what do you do ? "
After multiple edits , I was able to produce this letter .
" I do n't know if it was this simple letter indicating certain things that have taken place in Mitrice case , or the fact that previous Los Angeles County Sheriff , Leroy Baca was arranging a deal to go to Federal Prison for six ( 6 ) Months , but I would like to think it was a little of both but mostly Attorney General , Kamala Harris said something like ,
" HELL TO THE NO ! NOT ON MY WATCH ! "

By Susan Abram , Los Angeles Daily News
Nearly six years after Mitrice Richardson ’s remains were found in a rugged Malibu canyon , the California attorney general ’s office agreed to conduct a criminal investigation of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department when they handled the young woman ’s case .
The decision to review the department is a sharp reversal of a previous response made by the attorney general ’s office three months ago .
Richardson ’s family and their supporters had sent nearly 500 pages of documents and reports about the case about the mitrice playing poker online before she lost to Attorney General Kamala Harris ’ office hoping she would find cause for criminal action against deputies of the Sheriff ’s Department .
Ronda Hampton , a family friend who once mentored Mitrice Richardson and who submitted the 500 page request , received a response from their office in November that denied calls for an investigation .
Legal Case Update 2020
Criminal investigation in the Mitrice Richardson case is a process in gathering some facts related to the loss of the woman .
The principle of this crime has lasted a long time , the surprising fact of this case is that Mitrice had visit online gambling sbobet and post a message on twitter before he disappeared .
In Februaty 2020 the judges are now getting confused to reveal their criminal cases .
This case is waiting for some evidence that is being collected .

Cooking skill level 2 : A Bit Crap i. Cheese on toast Instructions Some of you may have found the toast recipé a bit basic .
That 's because it is .
And while it makes a good breakfasting snack , it doth not a satisfactory lunch make .
No sirree .
For that you are definitely looking at toast with something .
Something nice .
Something tasty .
Something like cheese .
Yep , you 've guessed it .
Cheese .
Now you can be extravagant with your cheese on toast ( just look at the Italians with their pizzas ) , but this recipé is back to basics .
The idea is to focus on the taste of the melted cheese , without detracting too much from it .
For this reason , it is ideal that you get decent quality cheese .
Preferably , it should be full fat cheese , as half - fat cheese does not bubble and melt and go deliciously golden brown under the grill as much as the real stuff .
If you are conscious about what you eat ( and the calories therein ) , just run to the shop when you buy it , or something .
Step 1 - Prepare the ingredients Fig 1 shows the ingredients .
As well as the good quality cheese , it is recommended that you use a fresh tomato , decent sliced bread , and some Lea & Perrins ' Worcestershire Sauce .
They ( Lea & Perrins , that is ) do other stuff ( probably ) , but this is their signature product .
It gives extra flavour and colour to the cheese on toast .
Now , where the toast recipé used the toaster , this one uses the grill .
A toaster is most definitely not practical for cheese on toast , as the cheese will all drip down to the bottom of the toaster .
Which is not good .
So , heat the grill to a hot heat ( consult your instruction manual ) .
Meanwhile , slice the cheese into thin -ish slices .
About 8 slices are usually needed for 2 slices of bread ( although , obviously , it depends on the relative sizes of the block of cheese and the slices of bread ) .
Use common sense here .
Figs 2 to 4 show the slicing process in all its glory .
Then slice the tomatoes into slices , in a slicing fashion .
Just like fig 5 in fact .
And that is all the preparation stage in a nutshell .
Step 2 - Make the toast go brown
Once the grill has heated up sufficiently , place the bread in the middle of the baking tray ( see fig 6 ) and place directly under the grill ( see fig 7 ) , the closer the better ( although obviously not too close ) .
If you are anticipating getting distracted by something or someone , it might be better to provide yourself a bit of insurance by not putting the toast really , really close to the grill .
Just be sensible , ok ?
After about 5 minutes , the bread will be brown on one side .
That is good enough .
Step 3 - Do the cheese topping bit Remove the baking tray from under the grill , flip the half - toast , half - bread ( so that the half - bread side is facing vertically upwards ) and place the cheese on the bread side , covering all the available surface with the cheese .
Then put a few small glugs of Worcestershire Sauce over the uncooked cheese and place the cheese covered half - toast , half - bread under the grill .
A step by step animation of this is lovingly depicted in fig 8 .
Now this is the fun bit .
As the cheese cooks , it starts to bubble and go golden brown .
How exciting .
Fig 9 shows this beautifully .
Look at it bubble !
And go golden brown !
And kinda drip down the sides of the toast .
Once a gorgeous golden brown colour , remove from under the grill again , and distribute the sliced tomatoes evenly over the cheese on toast .
Finally , a few grinds of the old pepper mill over the top ( to taste ) .
Put it back under the grill for a minute to warm , but not cook , the tomatoes ( as we all know that cooked tomatoes have enough latent heat to power a small African village for several months ) .
Look at fig 10 if you did n't understand a word of that .
Allow the cheese on toast to cool slightly , and then serve .
There are many additions that can be made to the basic cheese on toast recipé .
For example , by adding chopped onion at the putting the cheese on the half - toast , half - bread stage , or by adding chopped ham , or by putting a slice of ham underneath the cheese , or by putting lots of chopped things on there .
It 's really up to you .
If you can do the cheese and tomato combo , then perhaps push yourself by trying one of the crazy suggestions above .
And then , finally , people might start to respect you .
But not want to come near you .
( Because of the onion breath . )
You can also add various condiments , such as tomato ketchup , brown sauce , or pickle .
But back to the simple recipé - it 's time to eat ...
Utensils required Baking tray ( or grill pan ) Knife Chopping board Ingredients Bread ( 2 slices ) Cheddar cheese 2 tomatoes Worcestershire sauce Pepper ( to taste ) Serves 1 Preparation time 1 minute Cooking time 10 minutes
ANCHORAGE ( Reuters ) - Sarah Palin , the former Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate , will step down as Alaska ’s governor on Sunday with her political future clouded by ethics probes , legal bills and dwindling popularity .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin waves to the crowd after Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain delivered his concession speech at their election night rally in Phoenix , November 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
Palin made a surprise decision on July 3 that she would resign , raising questions about her next move and whether she was planning to mount a run for president .
She has cited a variety of reasons for quitting -- the burden of fighting nearly two dozen ethics charges , which she has dismissed as “ frivolous , ” her desire to avoid being perceived as a powerless “ lame - duck ” governor , and a “ higher calling , ” among others .
The handover to Alaska Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell will take place at an annual picnic hosted by the governor in Fairbanks , where Palin intends to deliver a farewell speech and Parnell will take the oath of office .
This year ’s Fairbanks picnic , usually a low - key event , will be attended by armies of national reporters and camera crews .
Making time for family or to address legal issues could have pushed Palin to resign , said Michael Josephson , a former law professor in California who regularly advises Alaska lawmakers on ethics issues
“ The problem is she has n’t been as coherent or clear as I would have liked her to be , ” Josephson said .
Palin ’s ethics woes have helped batter her image .
A new Washington Post - ABC poll puts her favorability rating at 40 percent , with 53 percent giving her an unfavorable rating .
Her official legal - defense fund , formed to help Palin pay more than $ 500,000 in lawyers ’ costs , is itself an ethics violation because it uses her state government job for personal financial benefit , according to a report from an independent investigator hired by the state .
Although Palin still has devoted followers who want her to run for president , that notion is scorned by many political experts .
“ I think she might run .
I do n’t see how she would win , ” said Michael Carey , a political columnist , broadcasting host and former Anchorage Daily News editorial writer .
“ I do n’t see how you win the presidency with ‘ Quitter ’ on your resume . ”
Palin has signed a book deal for an autobiography to be published next spring and has been touted as a possible TV talk - show host .

Advertisement Remarkable footage has been captured of falling Alsomitra vine seeds , which use paper - thin wings to disperse like giant gliders .
The seeds , which are produced by a football - sized pod , can glide hundreds of metres across the forest .
That ensures that the seeds fall far from their parent , giving the next generation of vines a head start .
A BBC team captured the film of the gliding seeds for the natural history series Life .
The Alsomitra ( Alsomitra macrocarpa ) vine is a type of climbing gourd , and is also known as the Javan cucumber .
It grows in the forests of Java , Indonesia .
Each pod contains up to 400 individual seeds , each of which peels away from the parent tree in the wind .
Dispersing its seeds in this way is vital to the vine , which must avoid producing new plants that land close , competing for sunlight and soil nutrients .
The wings decay upon landing
The aerodynamics of the giant Alsomitra seeds were studied by two Japanese engineers , Akira Azuma and Yoshinori Okuno more than 20 years ago .
They found that design of the seed is so good that it achieves a descent angle of just 12 degrees , a property that has led to the seed 's shape inspiring the design of aircraft .
That means it falls just 0.4 m each second , compared to 1 m per second for many winged seeds that rotate as they fall .
Once the seed has fallen to the ground , the wings decay , rotting away to leave the germinating seed .
A new vine then grows skyward toward the canopy and sunlight .
At up to 15 cm across , and weighing around 300 mg , they are among the largest winged seeds produced by any plant .
Yet the seed 's wings are less than 10 micrometres thick .
Generally , the seeds fall to the ground in broad circles up to 6 m across .
However , compared to many other plant seeds , those of the Alsomitra vine can glide in a relatively straight line with a following wind , helping them fall further away from the parent plant .
" Gliding seeds " is broadcast within the Plants episode of the BBC series Life at 2100GMT on BBC One on Monday 7 December .

Elementary and high schools spend so much time on the content - laden curriculum that students are unprepared for the analytic and conceptual thinking they 'll need at university
Has Ontario ’s educational system taught a decade of students not to think ?
There is growing evidence that the combination of standardized testing with a content - intensive curriculum that ’s too advanced – both introduced by the Conservative government between 1997 and 1999 – has done exactly that .
A dramatic indication that there could be a serious problem was the performance of my introductory physics class on their November test last year .
It was identical to one given in 1996 , but the class average over this 10 - year period had plummeted from 66 to 50 percent .
There is about a five - percent fluctuation in this test grade from year to year due to variation in student ability and the difficulty of the questions but , when I looked at the class average over the many times I have taught the course since 1981 , I found that four of the five lowest grades have occurred in the last four years , with the lowest this year .
When I enquired elsewhere at Trent University , I found the same pattern in the mathematics department , where the first test in linear algebra was down some 15 percent from its historic mean , and the calculus average had dropped nine percent from the year before .
But this is not just a Trent phenomenon .
Brock University has seen a significant increase in the failure rate for students in first - year physics with similar results in mathematics .
Both Brock and Trent are considering remedial teaching this school year .
The University of Guelph , where reliable data is also available , experienced a similar drop in performance in the first - year physics course .
There is general dissatisfaction about student preparation from physics instructors at other Ontario universities although it is difficult to get reliable numerical data as course structure and instructors change relatively frequently , and final grades are often bell - curved to maintain an acceptable distribution .
In contrast , there is no evidence of the same rapid decline in other provinces , according to the four other physics departments I ’ve contacted in the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia .
This appears to be a made - in - Ontario phenomenon .
Professor James Côté and co-author , Anton Allahar , in their recent book Ivory Tower Blues : A University System in Crisis ( see a review in this issue ) , blame a general student disengagement with learning as source of the problem .
However , most of the students I see are not so much disengaged as poorly trained for university expectations .
Students ’ ability to do analysis and synthesis seems to have been replaced by rote memorization and regurgitation in both the sciences and the humanities .
This is a complaint that I hear from instructors in senior high - school classes through to professors in the humanities .
Trent philosophy professor , Bernie Hodgson , tells me that his students want “ philosophy paint - by - numbers ” – a memorized , fill - in - the - blanks approach to passing tests and writing assignments — and this is exactly what I and many of my colleagues are seeing in science and mathematics disciplines .
While we still get some students with excellent analytical ability , there has been a serious decline on average .
In mathematics and physics , it means that students do not really understand what they are doing even when they have covered the material in high school .
This problem is reflected in the learning approach of most students , which has changed along with their test performance .
All term , students were asking me when I was going to teach them what they need to know for the exam , as though physics has only a fixed number of facts or kinds of problems that need to be memorized and fed back to the instructor .
However , memorization / regurgitation is not an approach that works in physics or in other analytical fields such as philosophy , English , mathematics or the visual arts , where the main emphasis is on constructing one ’s own knowledge and approaches .
There is always a certain amount of material that must be memorized , but knowledge of facts makes up only a small component of one ’s learning .
More important is the ability to relate these facts in new ways , to see them in a new light , and to bring quite disparate ideas together to solve new problems or create new forms of art .
This ability to analyze and synthesize is what makes good scientists , writers , philosophers and artists .
It is the ability needed to drive a knowledge - based economy .
The dependence on memorization also affects work habits , with a third of students in some university classes not handing in assignments or failing to pick up graded work to find out where they ’ve gone wrong .
Why should they , if they believe the way to better grades is to memorize more material rather than understand ?
The resulting high failure / drop - out rate in the first two years of university has enormous cost to society , although the students who do persevere and graduate clearly have or develop the requisite skills .
What could have caused this dramatic shift in the approach of our students ?
I do not believe the problem is with the teachers , who are generally well trained and dedicated .
The main possible explanations seem to be the following :
1 . In 1997 , the Ontario government introduced a new , content - intensive curriculum for grades K to 8 in mathematics and language , followed in 1998 by the science and technology curriculum .
The design of this curriculum was top - down , unlike earlier curricula that had been designed by local teachers and their school boards under general guidelines from the Ministry of Education .
Much of the new curriculum in the junior grades is considered by many experienced teachers to be beyond the mental development of students at that level .
This encourages blind memorization rather than understanding .
Moreover , the new curriculum significantly reduces time spent on the visual arts , and was so content - heavy that it greatly limited the amount of time available for developing analytical and conceptual - understanding skills from kindergarten on , even though the development of these skills was a stated goal of the curriculum .
Students first exposed to the science curriculum in Grade 5 are now starting second year of university .
Two high - school English teachers recently told me that this curriculum is the main cause for the loss of analytical ability .
This problem was aggravated by the retirement , shortly after 1997 , of many established teachers who understood the importance of developing analytical skills but had become disenchanted with the state of education .
Then in 1999 , a new four - year curriculum was imposed on high schools , starting with Grade 9 and advancing one year at a time to the 4U ( 4th - year , University - preparation ) courses in Grade 12 .
As a result , 2003 saw the graduation of the “ double cohort ” of the 4U students and the last of the OAC five - year students .
2 . In 1997 , the Ontario government also introduced standardized province - wide testing in math and reading / writing in Grades 3 and 6 , with a math test in Grade 9 .
I am told that much of the teaching at the elementary level is now directed to passing those tests , as schools are rated publicly on the results .
Students must also pass a standardized literacy test to graduate from high school .
This emphasis on passing standardized tests which cover too much material at too advanced a level increases the dependence on rote memorization and takes time away from the development of conceptual understanding and analytical skills .
3 . With the elimination of the Ontario Academic Credit ( OAC ) high - school year ( Grade 13 ) in 2003 , our students entering university are a year younger .
The teenage brain is still developing its “ executive functions ” during this time , so students enter university with a year ’s less ability to analyze and plan ahead .
4 . Are we just admitting poorer students to university ?
The average entrance grade of students from high school has not declined over the last few years , but grade inflation is clearly present : the percentage of academic - stream Ontario Scholars , those graduating students with averages over 80 percent , has risen from about five percent of the graduating class in the early 1960s to almost 50 percent now .
5 . The trend among young people to move away from reading and towards video and video games , means they spend less time developing reading / writing / analytical skills .
6 . Young people ’s general belief that the web is the source of all knowledge puts a greater emphasis on memorizing facts and much less on the ability to develop one ’s personal ability to think .
They do not appreciate that , even as students , they will be expected to develop new knowledge , not just regurgitate existing facts .
Of these explanations , the last three should have caused a gradual decline over the last 10 years , rather than a fairly abrupt change over the last five years ; so , while contributors , these are not likely the main culprits .
That our students are a year younger is not likely the main cause of the problem , as there was no obvious difference between the OAC and the 4U students in 2003 - 04 when they arrived at university together .
Moreover , the younger age would have caused an abrupt shift in student performance in years 2003 - 05 which should have been constant after this , whereas the decrease in performance has been most apparent in 2006 - 07 .
This leaves the first two options as the main causes of the decline in student performance .
My personal belief is that it is the content - heavy curriculum that is the main culprit .
When I speak to primary and secondary teachers with experience from before 1997 , this is the outstanding complaint that they have with the educational system .
A retired Grade 1 teacher whom I respect greatly for her expertise in teaching at this level tells me that they used to spend part of two weeks developing the idea of “ fiveness ” in her students .
How many different ways can you make up five , using different objects as well as cuisenaire rods ( coloured rods that come in varying lengths , such as 1 , 2 , or 3 cm ) .
Which of several groupings is less than or greater than five ?
And so on .
When they were done , students understood the number five at a broad conceptual level , and they carried this understanding to other numbers .
She says there is now little time for such activities if a student is to be ready to pass the standard tests which are tied to the new curriculum ; all a student has to do is memorize that 2+2+1=5 .
This view of the curriculum is not restricted to teachers at the K - 12 level .
A review panel of university physics professors has just recommended that some 30 percent of the Ontario high - school physics curriculum be removed to allow more time for the development of conceptual understanding and analytical skills .
Moreover , the review teams for all of physics , chemistry , biology and earth sciences agreed that : “ a ) The existing curriculum is too ambitious and focuses on breadth instead of depth ; b)
Some topics are clearly too advanced for grade 11 /12 students and should be dropped ; c ) There is a yawning gap between the ambition of the curriculum and the reality of students entering University .
Students continue to demonstrate serious deficiencies in problem solving skills , basic math skills , and hands - on laboratory skills when they arrive at the university level . ”
These potential problems with the curriculum were , of course , pointed out years ago .
For example , in 2000 Margaret McNay , at Western ’s Faculty of Education , wrote an article on the new curriculum in the Journal of Curriculum Studies in which she said , “ Grade 1 students can learn to parrot ‘ right ’ answers , and grade 7 students to memorize incomprehensible definitions , but no educational advantage is gained when the conceptual demands of what is taught are beyond the comprehension of the students . ”
The question arises as to why we are only now becoming aware of this problem at universities , 10 years after the new curriculum was introduced .
One would not expect that the shift in a student ’s mode of learning , from one based on understanding to one based on memorization , would occur instantly , and many teachers continued to teach the way they always had , regardless of the new curriculum .
However , a student first exposed to the new science curriculum in Grade 5 in 1998 is now entering second year of university .
I believe that the rapid decline in performance over the last five years has its roots in the teaching at the elementary level ; a university student ’s ability to think decreases with the length of time they were exposed to the new curriculum .
I recently reviewed the drop - out rate from my introductory physics class that I have taught quite regularly from the 1980s .
Over this time , the drop - out rate has increased gradually from eight percent in the early 1980s to more than 20 percent now , with one glaring exception .
In the Ontario double - cohort year of 2003 - 04 and the next year , ( which included about 25 percent of the four - year students who stayed in high school for an optional fifth year ) , the drop - out rate plummeted to eight and 10 percent , even though the class performance was not exceptional .
Similar results were seen at Brock and Guelph universities .
The best explanation is that these students were told that they would have to work very hard to gain one of the limited places at university .
The work and study habits they developed then carried into university , and helped them through their first year .
The lesson is that at least some student problems can be reversed very rapidly if the incentive is large enough .
The indications are strong that we have taught students to memorize and not to think .
If we do have such a problem , we must move quickly to determine its magnitude , and deal with its causes .
A new Ontario curriculum was introduced for K - 8 in Mathematics and English in 2005 and 2006 , respectively , and a new high - school science curriculum is currently under review as mentioned above .
Let ’s hope that local teachers and school boards are bringing their expertise to the development of this new curriculum , and will be involved in its monitoring and evaluation .
There may be 10 years of students who have been taught not to think , and reversing that effect will be not be easy without a determined effort .

Jon Corzine is definitely open to running Bank of America .
There have n't been any formal talks between the outgoing New Jersey Governor and the board of Bank of America , according to news reports .
Part of the reason for this might be that the chairman of the board , Walter Massey , is on vacation .
The bank is expected to select someone before Thanksgiving .
Corzine returned from his vacation in St. Barts energized and ready to get back to work .
A person familiar with the matter tells us that staffers are already prepping for the transition from working for a governor to working in finance .
Some are anticipating a substantial pay hike if they move with Corzine .
Guns and roses :
The photographer who literally shoots his subjects

A photo shoot usually requires a photographer to just point a camera and snap - but U.S. artist Alan Sailer takes the process much more literally .
The California - based photographer , 54 , has captured a series of otherwise unassuming items as they explode on contact with a bullet .
The dramatic results feature everything from flowers to fruit , as well as more unexpected items such as bacon and even snow globes .
An expert at high - speed photography , Mr Sailer takes the pictures in a dark room positioned around 20 cm from the target .
The camera , which features a unique home - made flash , is set at a one - second delay .
Point and shoot : A red rose in liquid nitrogen explodes on contact with a bullet in one of Alan Sailer 's dramatic high - speed photographs
Mr Sailer , who describes the process as ' beyond dangerous , says : ' The special item is the flash .
It is a home - built unit based on the design of Harold Edgerton * .
The flash is about .5 microsecond in duration and runs at 17,000 volts .
It is beyond dangerous , it 's deadly .
' The flash is triggered when the pellet from a rifle travelling at about 200 metres per seconds passes through a laser beam .
Its the same principle as those beams that set off a chime when you walk into a store , ' he continues .
' The camera is set at one second and an f - stop of 9 - 13 depending on the reflectivity of the subject .
The flash stops the action .
The one second gives me time to click the camera shutter with one hand while I pull the trigger on the rifle with the other . '
Explosive : ' I love most of the things I shoot , but I do n't like brussels sprouts , ' says Sailer , who shot the vegetable steamed and piping hot
Hot stuff : A radish feels the impact of Sailer 's rifle pellet .
He describes the photography process as ' beyond dangerous '
' I have a delay circuit that I can use to time the flash , so that it goes off when the pellet hits the target .
The explosion is the shock of the pellet hitting the target . '
Mr Sailer , who experimented with a huge range of objects for the series , snapped everything from Bratz dolls to mushrooms in his efforts to take the most visually effective images - and in some cases liked the idea more than the result .
Of his exploding Camembert cheese , he said : ' All the time I was planning to shoot this cheese , I kept thinking of Monty Python : " Ah !
We do have some Camembert , sir ...
It 's a bit runny , sir ... "
' So even though the shot is not that good , I have to publish it so I can quote Monty Python . '
Frozen in time :
This strawberry was dipped in liquid nitrogen before it was shot
Say cheese : A wheel of Camembert was inspired by a Monty Python quote , reveals Sailer
The artist deemed both okra and mushrooms boring , while carrots were out of focus .
One successful subject , however , was one of Hershey 's chocolate ' Kisses ' .
' Kisses were promising , ' he said .
' It took a lot of shots to get this one .
And I really hate candy , that sticky mess it leaves behind . '
Some of the most stunning photographs featured everyday objects - a radish was particularly successful , as was a wasabi peanut from a local bar .
' Water - filled things explode well , dry things just crack to pieces , ' he explained .
' The term for the process is hydrostatic shock . '
But Mr Sailer , who uses a rifle for his work , admits that he does n't like guns : ' I owned a gun once but I got rid of it .
The whole process is kind of nerve - racking .'
* Harold Edgerton ( 1903 - 1990 ) was a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and is regarded as the father of high - speed photography .

Nov. 19 , 2009  --
A member of the panel that unleashed a firestorm of controversy when it recommended a change in the age and frequency at which women should get mammograms today answered critics ' claims that the new recommendations could prove harmful to women .
" This is not a recommendation to not screen .
It 's a recommendation to provide women with the facts , " Dr. Timothy Wilt , a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , told " Good Morning America . "
" Our recommendations support an individualized decision - making process with the women so that they have knowledge about the risks and benefits associated with mammography screening . "
The recommendations , issued Monday , suggested among other things , that women between the ages of 40 and 49 should not necessarily get regular breast cancer screenings and that 50 - to 59 - year - old women should have them every two years instead of every year , as the American Cancer Society recommends .
Since the recommendations were published Monday the panel has come under fire from critics , some of whom claim the new guidelines were influenced by insurance and health care costs , and that they were based on a single study .
Wilt denied both allegations .
" Cost is not considered at all .
This is about providing high - quality health care for the individual [ and ] providing the information they need to know to make an informed decision , " he said .
" The information is based on eight very large , randomized , controlled trials of mammograms in women , a series of six different databases and a variety of other studies . "
Wilt said that according to the task force 's research , the benefits of saving about one life out of every 2,000 through mammograms for women between the ages of 40 - 49 " needs to be balanced " with the sometimes serious harms that come with incorrect treatment and overtreatment .
" We place great value in being able to reduce a death occurrence in breast cancer , [ but ] that occurs very rarely -- one in about 2,000 .
The other 1,999 would n't benefit , " Wilt said .
" Up to 30 percent of breast cancers would never progress to the point that they would ever be noticed in a woman 's lifetime .
We often treat those .
They may be unnecessary treatments [ resulting in ] pain and disfigurement from surgery .
" Those harms that occur with many women need to be balanced out with the benefits for a few , " he said .
Unnecessary treatment was also a concern to the panel when it suggested women should not be taught to perform breast self - exams , Wilt said .
" There have been several large , well - designed trials that have looked at teaching breast self - exam .
Women who did more breast self - exams , did more high - quality exams , found more lumps , had more biopsies , had more breast cancer surgeries , " Wilt said .
But , according to Wilt , the heightened self - testing " did not have a reduction in breast cancer mortality . "
" Not to say that if a woman does n't feel a lump she should n't bring it to the attention of her physician , " he added .
Wilt 's comments come the day after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius defended the panel 's methods but clarified the guidelines as recommendations , not policy .
" The United States Preventative Service Task Force have done what they 've been asked to do , which is routinely review data and look at preventive services across the board and make recommendations , " Sebelius said .
" They do n't make policy .
Do what you have always done .
Figure out your own health situation with your doctor , your family history .
Those are really the important ingredients . "
Experts , Officials Weigh In on New Recommendations
Wednesday , Good Morning America consulted its medical team -- ABC News chief medical editor Dr. Timothy Johnson , ABC News senior health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser and ABC News medical contributor Dr. Marie Savard -- to find out their opinions of the new recommendations .
What all three doctors said was that the updated recommendations , while they may be well - intentioned , raise significant concerns and that women , at least for the time being , should adhere to previous guidelines .
" I was so surprised about these recommendations , " Savard said .
" I think women should stay put in terms of what they 're doing . "
Johnson said that a question that naturally accompanies such a change concerns alternatives to mammography , of which , he said , there are currently no good ones .
" Right now , a screening mammogram is the best tool we have , " he said .
" That 's why we recommend it . "
And Besser said that in terms of lives saved -- 1 in 1,300 for women 50 and over , one in 1,900 for women 40 - 49 -- he does not believe there is enough difference in benefit between these groups to warrant a difference in recommendations .
Meanwhile , the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology are among the many groups that supported the old guidelines and have stood firmly by them since the Preventive Serivces Task Force released its new recommendations .
" When you see two prestigious bodies , this task force and the American Cancer Society , looking at the same information and coming up with wholesale different conclusions , that raises red flags for me in saying , ' OK , smart people can disagree ; let 's not do anything rash before these are looked at in great detail , ' " Besser said .
It 's not just professional organizations that are bucking the new guidelines .
Since they were issued Monday , the changes in recommendations have met a groundswell of rejection from many medical centers , breast cancer survivors and numerous doctors , some of whom have advised their patients to ignore the recommendation .
According to most of the medical centers that ABC News has heard from , they will not follow the new screening guidelines .
MD Anderson , the Mayo Clinic , Baylor , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Fox Chase Cancer Center were among many hospitals that said they are sticking with the current guidelines , recommended by the American Cancer Society .
The task force has defended its rationale for the change .
Dr. Diana Petitti , vice chairwoman of the task force , said it reviewed a number of studies to compile the benefits of mammograms , such as how many cancers were detected and how many lives were saved , and the " harms " of mammograms , such as how many false positives popped up , how many unnecessary tests were done and how much extra radiation women were exposed to during the false positive testing .
The task force then used calculations and mathematical models to see how these benefits and " harms " would change if women started getting routine mammograms at different ages and different intervals .
The recommendations are also only for women considered to be at normal risk for breast cancer .
Women who are at a known high risk -- for instance , women who tested positive for the BRCA - 1 and BRCA - 2 genes -- would not fall under the guidelines .
In recent months , some sentiments have arisen opposing increased screening .
A study released in September brought to light some of the potential risks of false positives .
While efforts have been made to increase cancer screenings , many patients are unaware of the potential consequences of false positives , including unnecessary anxiety , testing and possibly treatment .
" [ Some ] women do n't understand how screening can cause problems , " said Dr. Bob Crittenden , an associate professor in family medicine at the University of Washington .
" Personally , I think this is symptomatic of many people in medicine promising good health if you get screened .
As we know with PSAs and other screenings of asymptomatic people , we have only a few things we can do that actually help extend life and then usually only marginally . "
Crittenden explained that in his own practice , patients are screened on request before age 50 and screenings are strongly encouraged after that age .
Several family doctors contacted by ABC News said the recommendations reflect some of the sentiment against screenings because of the possibility of unnecessary treatments , and expressed hopes that they will lead to more open conversations with pateints about mammograms and cancer screening .
Sources of Medical Opposition
Dr. Gary Lyman , a breast cancer oncologist at Duke University who researches comparative effectiveness , said guidelines like those issued by the task force may cause a great deal of harm .
" This is a reversal of the position they took in their previous recommendations , and this flies in the face of previous guidelines from other groups in the U.S. , " he said .
" [ While ] the risk of breast cancer is less in the younger age group , 40 to 50 , mammograms save lives in those age groups . "
Lyman said his primary criticism is that in between the last set of screening guidelines in 2002 and the current ones , only one study has come out in the area , and it did nothing to change what doctors know about mammograms .
" I 'm puzzled why , when the evidence has n't really changed , when the estimate in benefit and risk has n't really changed , why they reversed their position , " he said .
Lyman said he was also worried about potential confusion among women over 50 , since under the new guidelines they are being told to get screened every other year , while previously they had been told to get screened every year .
" I do n't know if we know that 's going to cause harm or not , " he said .
" What I 'm worried about the most , however , is confusion on the part of women and their physicians that may make them question whether mammograms will do anything . "
His concerns were borne out in at least one New York hospital Tuesday .
" I spoke to our breast imaging department today , and they said that the ' no - show ' rate doubled today , " said Dr. Susan K. Boolbol , the chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York .
" That means that twice as many patients today decided not to show for their mammogram appointment .
That is a very concerning rate .
We will monitor this to see if it continues . "
But Boolbol said she is also worried that " controversies such as these really create a feeling of mistrust for the medical community at large . "
Lyman said the benefits of mammography have been clear , particularly since insurers and Medicare began reimbursing for them , noting that mortality rates have fallen by 25 percent since then .
" I can't say all that 's due to mammography , but it 's pretty clear that part of that and maybe most of that is due to early detection with routine mammographic screening , " he said .
Breast Cancer Screening Recommendations ' Devalue ' Lives , Survivor Says
Doctors ' offices and hospitals have been fielding calls from women wanting to know what these new guidelines will mean for them .
One of these calls came not from a woman concerned about getting breast cancer but from one who has already had it .
Beth Thompson , 44 , a mother of four who lives in the suburbs of Baltimore , was first diagnosed with breast cancer following a mammogram at age 40 .
" I had no risk factors and no family history , " Thompson told ABCNews.com .
" Under the new guidelines I would n't be screened .
That 's why I 'm so upset about this .
I firmly believe I would not be here today if I had not had a screening mammogram at 40 . "
Thompson explained that in removing the tumor detected by the mammogram , doctors found a faster - growing tumor underneath , one that would not have been found until it became a palpable lump .
" It really makes me shudder to think of what a different situation I would have been in if that were the case , " she said , explaining that she needed four surgeries , four rounds of chemotherapy and took Herceptin , an adjuvant for an aggressive form of breast cancer , for a year .
" That 's the treatment that I needed even for an early - stage cancer , " Thompson said .
" There 's just no reason that I would have been screened and no way that it would have been found at the time , except for mammography . "
While false positives may create problems for some patients , many seem to believe that those are outweighed by the deaths that can result if the screening is not done , something that would present a challenge to any desire to change screening guidelines .
" At the Methodist Breast Center , we diagnose and / or treat about 500 patients with breast cancer every year , " said Dr. Luz Venta , medical director of the Methodist Breast Center in Houston and fellow at the Society of Breast Imaging , in a statement .
" And about 21 percent of these are women under age 50 .
Should these women be sent away and told the cost of screening for breast cancer is not justified in the number of lives that can be saved ? "
That sentiment was echoed by many , some of them survivors of breast cancer , who flooded the message boards of breast cancer groups like breastcancer.org and the Susan Love Foundation to protest the new guidelines .
Thompson , whose sentiments run along those same lines , said she worries about getting her own daughters , the oldest of whom is in her teens , proper screening when they reach the right age , and is concerned that future recommendations might change how soon they get screened .
" I will move heaven and earth to have them screened at 30 , " said Thompson , affirming the recommendation that women with a first - degree relative with breast cancer get screened 10 years before cancer first appeared in that relative .
But Thompson , reflecting the sentiments of other survivors of breast cancer , also said she worries that any recommendation for screening that would have excluded her also devalues the lives of other potential breast cancer survivors .
" It 's disheartening to hear the new guidelines , when they talk about the few lives that are saved , " she said .
" It 's hard not to feel a little devalued by that . "

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Israeli President Shimon Peres rejected a United Nations report on his country 's incursion into Gaza as " one- sided " and " unfair " in an interview with CNN .
Israeli President Shimon Peres calls a U.N. report on events in Gaza " one- sided " and " unfair . "
The U.N. Council for Human Rights last week approved the report , which accuses both Israel and the Palestinian movement Hamas of " actions amounting to war crimes , possibly crimes against humanity " during the three - week offensive which ended in January .
Peres insisted that Israel had a right to defend itself , and said the United Nations was in danger of " supporting the terrorists instead of supporting the fight against terrorists .
" If you can't fight terrorists , then ... nobody is defending us .
We never asked any other people to fight instead of us , but the right of self - defense is non-negotiable , " Peres said during Monday 's interview .
Watch Peres speak to CNN
" I think we have shown courage in war and we have shown devotion in peace and we shall continue to struggle for peace , " he said .
Israel said its offensive in Gaza , which it called Operation Cast Lead , was designed to stop Palestinians from firing rockets and mortars into Israel from Gaza , which is controlled by Hamas .
There is an ongoing dispute about the number of people killed in Operation Cast Lead .
The Gaza - based Palestinian Center for Human Rights put the death toll at 1,419 and said 1,167 of those were " non-combatants . "
The Israeli military released its own figures earlier this year , saying that 1,166 people were killed , 60 percent of whom were " terror operatives . "
Peres also warned that the international community must maintain its focus on keeping Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
" At the beginning the purpose of the negotiation was to prevent a nuclear bomb , " he said .
" I am afraid that now people are moving from prevention to inspection .
It 's not the same , particularly when it comes to Iran , " he said .
Israel prefers peaceful means to prevent a nuclear - armed Iran , Peres said , but he left open the door to a military attack .
" I think if it can be settled by peaceful means -- by sanctions or on other ways to impress the Iranians -- better than a war .
I do n't think that we have to announce all the options ahead of time , " he said .
He remained typically evasive about whether Israel has nuclear weapons .
Many experts believe it does .
Peres said that suited Israel .
" We are aware that Israel is being suspected that we have nuclear bombs .
I answer this with a smile , " he said .
" If we are suspected , that 's enough .
If suspicion can serve as a deterrent , that is our purpose . "

Teens who listen to music that mentions marijuana are significantly more likely to use the drug , a new study finds .
The research was based on surveys with 959 ninth - graders .
" Students who listen to music with the most references to marijuana are almost twice as likely to have used the drug than their peers whose musical tastes favor songs less focused on substance use , " said University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine researcher Dr. Brian Primack , who led the study .
" Interestingly , we also found that exposure to marijuana in music was not associated with other high - risk behaviors , such as excessive alcohol consumption , " Primack said .
" This suggests that there is a real link between the marijuana lyrics and marijuana use . "
Among the study participants , 12 percent identified themselves as current marijuana users , with 32 percent identifying themselves as having previously tried the substance .
The researchers analyzed the content of songs that the students reported listening to .
The average participant listened to 21.8 hours of music per week and heard about 40 marijuana references in music per day .
Researchers controlled for such demographic variables as age , race , gender , parental education and school grades in analyzing the data .
" Although it may be that heavy exposure to music about marijuana causes marijuana smoking , it may also be that those who smoke marijuana seek out music with lyrics related to marijuana , " Primack said .
The study , published online by the journal Addiction , was funded by National Institutes of Health , the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Maurice Falk Foundation .

Introduction
This project extends the technique I created for imprecise line - drawing to create an entire vector graphics application , similar to Inkscape .
It is written almost entirely in Javascript , except for a server - side program that renders text .
See below if you are interested in the implementation and coding parts .
Features
Download and share your drawings in PNG , PDF , or SVG formats .
Box , circle , lines , and curve primitive shapes
Shadows when supported by browser
Text in several hand - drawn fonts rendered on the server
Rotate & scale shapes individually or in groups
Select colours using an HSV colour wheel .
Unlimited levels of Undo / Redo
Usage
List of keyboard shortcuts
Users who are familiar with vector graphics programs such as CorelDRAW !
or Inkscape will have no problem using it , because the some of the most common keyboard shortcuts work the same way .
Otherwise , it will take some getting used to .
The keyboard is the only way to do some things .
C Start drawing a new curve L Start drawing a new line Ctrl+D Duplicate selection Page Up Move selected shapes toward you Page Down Move selected shapes away from you Home Bring selected shapes to front End Send selecting shapes to back Ctrl + G Group selected shapes Ctrl + Shift +G

Saving and loading
Drawings can be stored on the website by clicking on " Save " .
If you do not have an account , the drawings will be deleted in a few hours , or if you close your web browser .
As soon as you create an account , the drawings will be transferred to long term storage .
If you do n't want to create an account , the " Save " option will also allow you to download your drawing as an image .
Drawing simple shapes
Click on the rectangle or circle tool in the toolbar , and the desired shapes will immediately appear in the upper left of the drawing area .
You can then drag them to where you want to go .
No two shapes are alike .
If you create two circles , they will be slightly different .
However , if you duplicate a shape using Ctrl+D , the duplicate will be exactly the same .
Drawing lines and curves
To draw a line , click the line tool in the toolbar , then click anywhere in the drawing window to place the first point .
You can then click again to place the second point , and so on .
To end the line , double click .
If you end the line or curve close enough to where you started it , then it will create a closed shape .
Hint :
The line tool can be activated by pressing " L " , and the curve tool can be activated by pressing " C " .
Lines have a sloppiness property that can be set after drawing it .
To set the property , select on the line you have drawn .
The options pertaining to the line will appear to the left of the drawing window .
Curves do not have sloppiness , but smoothness .
By increasing smoothness , the curve is modified to make rounder corners .
Drawing text
Text is placed the same way as circles or rectangles .
Click on the text tool , and some default text is placed in the upper left of the image .
You can change what the text says by clicking on the text , and then modifying the " text " property that appears to the right of the canvas .
Example : Editing text using the properties area
You can move , scale , or rotate text .
However , in this version of the drawing software , scaling will result in loss of quality .
Instead , change the font size in the properties area .
Selecting things
While not in line or curve mode , you can select things by dragging a box around them using the mouse .
The box must fully enclose the shapes to select them .
You can also add a shape to an existing selection by pressing the shift key while clicking it .
Overlapping shapes
Point edit mode
You can move a shape to the front using the Home key on the keyboard .
Send it to the back using the End key .
For some shapes , you can move the corners around by entering " Edit " mode .
You can enter edit move by clicking on an already - selected object .
In edit mode , the corners that you can move are highlighted using a blue box .
Example : Point edit mode
Delete
Grouping
Delete all objects in the selection by hitting the Delete key on the keyboard .
To avoid having to repeatedly select complex groups of shapes , you can " group " the current selection using Ctrl+G .
Now , when you click on any one of the group members , all will be selected .
You can break apart any selected groups using Ctrl + Shift +G.
Copy / Paste

Zooming in
Bugs
Scaling text reduces its quality .
There 's no way to set the background colour of a drawing .
Implementation Notes
You can copy pieces of your drawings between documents and browser windows .
While there are shapes selected , click on " Copy " and they will be transferred to the zwibbler clipboard , stored in your browser .
You can then open another document later or in another browser window and paste the shapes there .
While there are shapes selected , you can duplicate them by pressing Ctrl+D. Copies of the objects will appear over the existing ones .
You will have to move them aside to see the effect .
Increase magnification by pressing +.
Decrease by pressing -. Restore to original magnification by pressing Shift +'+'.
While zoomed in , you can move around using the arrow keys on the keyboard .
The last 10 % of work to make a polished program takes 90 % of the time .
I know about these bugs :
I should write something about the implementation .
Hmm , the undo stack is pretty standard stuff but may be new to some people .
But the thing I was happiest to find was the concept of abstracted Mouse Behaviours .
Design patterns for mouse behaviour are slim pickings .
When a novice programmer designs a mouse - intensive application , he or she will tend to make a very complex function that deals with all possible cases when the mouse is clicked or moved .
It can quickly grow to be unmaintainable .
To deal with this complexity , we separate the possible states of the system into various MouseBehaviour objects , which implement on MouseDown ( x , y ) , onMouseUp ( x , y ) , and onMouseMove ( x , y ) .
( This is a variation on the State design pattern ) .
The default mouse behaviour is the selection mode .
If you press the mouse button while over something , it then replaces the default mouse behaviour with a new mouse behaviour .
When you lift the button , the new behaviour ends and reverts back to the previous behaviour .
This keeps everything simple .
There are several mouse behaviours :
DefaultBehaviour --
Depending on where you click , it replaces the current behaviour with a new instance of one of the other behaviours .
SelectBoxBehaviour -- if you click on an empty area of the image , it handles drawing the select box .
When you lift the button , it selects everything in the rectangle you have drawn .
TransformSelection -- if you clicked on a selection handle , then it transforms the selected shapes as you move the mouse .
MoveEditNodeBehaviour --
If you click a blue edit node , then it moves the node .
DrawLinesBehaviour --
Places points in a line shape until you double - click to end it .
These objects can be found in DrawView.js

Universities face a move towards two - year degree courses as the Government dramatically reduces higher education spending .
The announcement of the cuts , which will see £ 518 m lopped off university funding next year , provoked an outcry from vice - chancellors , students , lecturers and opposition MPs last night .
Sally Hunt , general secretary of the University and College Union , which represents lecturers , said : " We will see teachers on the dole , students in larger classes and a higher education sector unable to contribute as much to the economy and society . "

Key elements of the plan , outlined by the Business Secretary , Lord Mandelson , include a shift away from the traditional three - year degree to two - year courses .
In addition , universities that recruited more students in the autumn than ministers had budgeted for will face fines of £ 3,700 per extra head .
One estimate indicated that 22,000 additional students were taken on as demand for places reached an all - time high because of the recession .
Universities were allowed to recruit 10,000 extra undergraduates because of the increased demand .
Even so , about 130,000 students eligible for a clearing place failed to find one in the summer .
Lord Mandelson made it plain there would be no repeat next year and reduced the funding for higher education from the £ 7.8 bn grant for 2009 - 10 to just under £ 7.3 bn for 2010 - 11 .
This , coupled with the fines , lowers the Government 's chances of meeting its oft - stated aim of recruiting 50 per cent of young people into higher education courses , though ministers will hope that introducing more two - year courses might be enough to achieve it .
Vice - chancellors will now put more pressure on the government review into top - up fees to increase the current cap of £ 3,240 .
They have already indicated that they would like to see it doubled to more than £ 6,500 .
The review is due to report next year , after the election .
Research funding – which helps the more selective universities like Oxford and Cambridge retain world - class research contracts – is to be maintained .

In a letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England , which is responsible for allocating university cash , Lord Mandelson said he wanted more programmes " such as foundation and fast - track degrees that can be completed full - time in two years " .
He added : " Over the next spending review period [ to 2014 ] , we will want some shift away from full - time , three - year places towards a wider variety of provision . "
Professor Les Ebdon , chairman of the university think - tank million + and vice - chancellor of Bedfordshire University , said the shift towards two - year degrees was " tinkering with the edges " .
" Two - year degrees work for some students , who do not have to fund themselves with part - time jobs , " he said .
" They will only be offered by a limited number of universities for a small number of courses . "
Examples of two - year degree courses already running include one for higher level teaching assistants at Stroud College in Gloucestershire and a fast - track nursing degree at King 's College London for those with a degree already .
In his letter , Lord Mandelson went on to warn that any further over - recruitment next autumn could again provoke fines .
The £ 3,700 is equivalent to the average cost of providing one student with teaching and access to facilities for one year .
The Conservatives immediately attacked the Government for fining universities that were trying to meet its own target of getting 50 per cent of young people into higher education .
Even with the increase in student numbers allowed by the Government this autumn , the overall participation rate remains at around 43 per cent when , ironically , because of the demand created by the lack of employment prospects , ministers had a realistic chance of nearing the 50 per cent target for the first time this year .
" We now have the bizarre situation that universities are being fined for meeting targets set by this Government , " said David Willetts , the Conservatives ' universities spokesman .
Lord Mandelson 's letter described the extra 10,000 places this year as a " one-off " .
However , Mr Willetts said : " In contrast to Lord Mandelson , who is restricting access to university ... we will be offering an additional 10,000 extra fully funded university places to enable more young people to enter university next year . "
Wes Streeting , president of the National Union of Students , said the cuts " will sound chimes of doom for existing students in cuts - hit universities and for talented school leavers set to fail to secure a university place " .
Professor Steve Smith , vice - chancellor of Exeter University and president of Universities UK , which represents all UK vice - chancellors , said : " A reduction in the public funding per student could seriously threaten our ability to offer the high - quality experience our students deserve and expect . "
Wendy Piatt , director general of the Russell Group of universities , which represents 20 of the leading research institutions in the UK , welcomed the commitment to retain research funding , but added : " With other countries investing more , not less , in their leading universities , we are in danger of losing our international competitive edge . "
Making contacts : Mandelson 's university days
* When Peter Mandelson went to St Catherine 's College , Oxford , in 1973 , no one seriously expected the life of an undergraduate to be all study and no socialising .
Oxbridge students , particularly , were part of an elite , for whom the friends and contacts they made were as important as their degree .
Mandelson had to resit the exams he took at the end of his first year , after spending too much time running the university 's United Nations Association .
This setback did not deter him from going on to be a leading light in the university 's Labour Club .
He emerged from Oxford with only a second class honours degree , but the contacts he made – including Charles Clarke and Benazir Bhutto – were more valuable to his future .
The one contemporary he missed was Tony Blair , who was more interested in rock and religion than politics .
I was going to save my SS gifts for actual Christmas , but the first one arrived today and I could not resist !
The sender , Michelle H , did n't include a username or a note , but I hope they will - I love everything in the box and want to say thanks !!!
Edit So !
It seems that there was a mixup , making this box of random even randomer !
From my SS :
" Hello !
I 'm the one that sent you the Random box of Random .
Funny thing : I was leaving town to go to race car driving school , so I left the shipping duties to my mom , Michelle H , while I was away .
It seems she sent the wrong present to the wrong SS !
I had assembled a similar kit of random for you - but instead of the shaver and Star Trek , I had bought [ redacted , until the other person receives it ] .
Doh !
So , Ed Alchemist has your present , but I do n't think he 's received it yet .
But , since you 're happy with what you 've got , success ! "
Success indeed !

Katrina Hodge is a part - time model and a soldier in the British Army
A soldier has been given leave from her duties to represent England in the Miss World competition .
L/ Cpl Katrina Hodge , 21 , from Tunbridge Wells , will take over from the previous Miss England who stepped down after her arrest over an alleged nightclub brawl .
Organisers of Miss England said 21 - year - old Rachel Christie wanted to concentrate on clearing her name .
Miss Hodge , nicknamed Combat Barbie after being commended for bravery in Iraq , will take on beauty queen duties .
Gladiator Tornado
She was first runner - up in the 2009 national contest .
L/ Cpl Hodge has been given leave from her duties as a soldier in the British Army and will represent England in the Miss World final in Johannesburg , South Africa , on 12 December .
She was previously given an award by her unit in the Royal Anglian Regiment for her actions during a posting in Basra and has earned the nickname Combat Barbie .
Rachel Christie is the niece of former Olympic sprinter Linford Christie
Miss Christie became involved in a dispute with another beauty queen , Miss Manchester , Sara Beverley Jones , at a Manchester nightclub earlier this week .
Miss Jones , 24 , was allegedly punched in the face after an argument said to be about Tornado , a 22 - year - old Gladiator who appears in the Sky1 series and whose real name is David McIntosh .
It is believed that Miss Jones , a club promoter and would - be actress , is an ex-girlfriend of Mr McIntosh while Miss Christie is his current partner .
Miss Christie , athlete Linford Christie 's niece , was the first black woman to be crowned Miss England and is also a heptathlete who hopes to win a medal at the 2012 Olympics .
Transport Canada banned carry - on items on all United States - bound flights Monday afternoon except for limited items like purses , laptops , infant and medical supplies .
Krista Kealey , spokesperson for the Ottawa International Airport , said the measures are effective immediately , but will be temporary .
This restriction extends to all U.S. flights leaving any airport in Canada .
Spokesperson Patrick Charette confirmed the ban with CTV Ottawa on Monday a few hours before the directorate was released by Transport Canada .
" Be patient .
Bear with us .
We are asking people to be ready , " said Charette .
RCMP , local police will assist with boarding
The directorate outlined the " enhanced " security measures , adding that the RCMP and local police officers will help airport security officials with " some procedures specific to the screening process . "
Those procedures were not identified , but Transport Canada added the extra police presence would speed up the process as passengers are cleared through the border .
Only the following items are allowed on board as carry - on luggage :
medication
medical devices
small purses
cameras
coats
infant care items
laptops
crutches , canes and walkers
containers with " life - sustaining items "
musical instruments
diplomatic or consular bags .
" These measures are expected to be in place at least for several days , " read the release .
Check with airlines before flying
Officials recommend passengers to U.S. destinations check with their airlines for possible delays , and come at least three hours ahead of the flight to allow for bag searches and full - body pat - downs .
Passengers are now screened twice , once at the gate and once before boarding .
Transport Canada brought in the extra precautions after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , who claims links to al - Qaeda , tried to detonate firecrackers in the final minutes of an Amsterdam to Detroit flight on Christmas Day .
' I think it 's totally critical '
" I think it 's warranted , given the situation that happened in the U.S. , " said passenger David Rattway , who was waiting at the Ottawa airport .
" I think it 's totally critical that we take all the security we can during the holiday season as well , with so many people travelling . "
Despite the longer lineups , few flights have been delayed in Ottawa due to passenger backlogs .
Passengers flying from Ottawa to Toronto may face cancelled flights if they are going on to the United States , as Air Canada has eliminated some short - haul trips across the border to reduce the lineups at Pearson International Airport .
In the wake of a shooting rampage at Fort Hood by a military psychiatrist of Middle Eastern lineage , the hosts at Fox News have begun suggesting that all Muslims in the military should be treated as potential threats .
“ Do you think it ’s time for the military to have special debriefings of Muslim Army officers — anybody enlisted ? ” Fox ’s Brian Kilmeade asked Geraldo Rivera on Friday morning .
“ Because if I ’m going to be deployed in a foxhole , if I ’m going to be sticking in an outpost , I got to know the guy next to me is not going to want to kill me . ”

Rivera pivoted .
“ But is n’t this the headline , Brian , that there are four or five million American Muslims and how scant and few and far between these horrifying incidents are ? ”
“ I ’ve been in Afghanistan with these guys , ” Rivera continued , “ in Iraq with these guys .
They are treasured for their bilingualism , their multiculturalism , the fact that they can bridge and understand and translate for us . ”
Fox ’s Gretchen Carlson , however , joined the bandwagon .
“ Our society has become very politically correct , ” she objected .
“ Could it be that the military was also exercising political correctness , even though he had a poor performance report and even though he spoke openly about being a radical Muslim and had those supposed postings online ? ”
Fox News legal analyst Peter J. Johnson jumped in , asking Rivera , “ You wo n’t countenance special screening for Muslims will you ? ”
“ It ’s a hard step for me to take , ” Rivera replied .
“ This is an American born person .
This is not a naturalized citizen . ”

FORD SYNC GOES WIFI TURNING CAR INTO MOBILE INTERNET HOT SPOT FOR PASSENGERS WHILE ON THE GO
Next - generation SYNC ® system to incorporate in - car WiFi system powered by customer 's USB mobile broadband modem , turning entire car into hot spot
New capability will be standard on select SYNC - equipped vehicles with no additional hardware or subscriptions required beyond the user - supplied mobile broadband modem
Standard WiFi Protected Access 2 ( WPA2 ) security protocols will be in force , and only owner - permitted devices will be able to access the network , helping ensure secure , robust connectivity for in - car users
The SYNC system offered by Ford in most of its models just got a lot more interesting .
In addition to giving vehicle owners super simple connectivity with virtually any phone or music player and the best voice recognition in the biz , the next generation of SYNC will add mobile internet compatibility to its USB ports .
What does this mean ?
It means that if you 've got one of those fancy 3G modems for your laptop , you can plug it into the USB port of your SYNC - equipped Ford and voilà !
Your entire vehicle is a WiFi hotspot .
Imagine the effect of adding easy in - car WiFi to a family of five 's cross-country trip in a Ford Flex and you get the idea .
In - car WiFi has been around for a couple of years already , but all instances have required extra dealer - installed hardware ( a receiver and router , specifically ) and an additional monthly fee .
General Motors announced just last week that it 's adding optional in - car WiFi to seven Chevy models , but like most systems , you 'll have to pay $ 500 up front ( $ 199 after mail - in rebate through December 31st ) for the hardware and $ 29 / month for the service .
With a simple software upgrade of SYNC next year , Ford customers will be able to use the 3G modem they may already have and get the same effect , without having to pay extra for new equipment and , most importantly , another monthly fee for internet .
It 's also an easy way for Ford to get WiFi in the car for SYNC 's upcoming mobile apps SYNC was already a big reason for infotainment - obsessed car shoppers to consider a Ford , but at least when it comes to browsing the internet in your car , SYNC 2.0 with in - car WiFi just leap frogged the entire auto industry .
Not only is the technology impressive , but this new feature actually saves the customer money rather than asking for more .
Ford 's official word on the matter , plus a video of SYNC 2.0 broadcasting its pirate signal , can be found after the jump .

DEARBORN , Mich. , Dec. 21 , 2009 – Ford Motor Company will turn vehicles into rolling WiFi hot spots when it introduces the second generation of its popular SYNC ® in - car connectivity system next year .
Inserting an owner 's compatible USB mobile broadband modem – sometimes called an " air card " – into SYNC 's USB port will produce a secure wireless connection that will be broadcast throughout the vehicle , allowing passengers with WiFi- enabled mobile devices to access the Internet anywhere the broadband modem receives connectivity .
" While you 're driving to grandma 's house , your spouse can be finishing the holiday shopping and the kids can be chatting with friends and updating their Facebook profiles , " said Mark Fields , Ford president of The Americas .
" And you 're not paying for yet another mobile subscription or piece of hardware because Ford will let you use technology you already have . "
Studies by the Consumer Electronics Association show that as many as 77 million adults make up the so - called technology enthusiast drivers population , more than half of whom express the desire for a connected communications and information system in their vehicles .
Even among the general population , more than one third of Americans would be interested in the ability to check email and access Web sites in their vehicles .
Upgradeable and secure
The USB port provided by SYNC lets owners leverage a variety of devices , including the mobile broadband modem .
And through simple software updates , SYNC can be adapted to connect with the latest devices .
" The speeds with which technology is evolving , particularly on the wireless front , makes obsolescence a real problem , " said Doug VanDagens , director of Ford 's Connected Services Solutions Organization .
" We 've solved that problem by making SYNC work with just about any technology you plug into it .
By leveraging a user 's existing hardware , which can be upgraded independent of SYNC , we 've helped ensure ' forward compatibility ' with whatever connectivity technology comes next . "
The SYNC WiFi capability is a simple solution for bringing internet into the vehicle , versus competitive systems on the market .
Being factory - installed , the hardware is seamlessly integrated into the vehicle , whereas competitor 's systems are dealer - installed and require a bulky bolt - in receiver and transmitter that take up cabin space .
Also , competitive systems cost approximately $ 500 for equipment and installation , not to mention the monthly subscription fee .
" Using SYNC with existing mobile devices helps Ford provide the most value , the most flexibility and the most convenience for owners , " said Fields .
" Constant connectivity is becoming a routine part of our customers ' lives , and we 're making existing technology more accessible without adding costs :
That 's the kind of value Ford drivers have learned to expect . "
Using the SYNC WiFi system , a signal will be broadcast throughout the vehicle .
Default security is set to WiFi Protected Access 2 ( WPA2 ) , requiring users to enter a randomly chosen password to connect to the Internet .
When SYNC sees a new WiFi device for the first time , the driver must specifically allow that device to connect , preventing unauthorized users from " piggybacking " on the SYNC - provided signal .
Can you really smell memories ?
How childhood scents get ' etched ' onto the brain
Scientists have shown that ' odour memories ' get ' etched ' onto the brain
From the sudden whiff of school cabbage to the pungent smell of hospital disinfectant , nothing transports people back to their childhood more than an unexpected smell .
Now scientists think they have discovered how scents from the past make such a lasting impression .
Using brain scans , they have shown that new ' odour memories ' - such as the association of a perfume with a person - really do get ' etched ' onto the brain .
The ' signature ' of the memory is different from other types of memories , they found .
Dr Yaara Yeshurun , who led the study at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel said early smells had a ' privileged ' status in our memories .
Scientists have long known that smells are one of the best ways to evoke the past .
Past studies have shown that memories triggered by smells are more vivid and more emotional than those triggered by sounds , pictures or words .
The new study , reported in the journal Current Biology , tried to mimic the creation of childhood memories of smells in 16 adult volunteers .
In a laboratory , the volunteers were shown a picture of an object as they were exposed to a whiff of either a pear or fungus .
Ninety minutes later they were shown the same picture with the other smell .
A week later , the scientists tested which of the associations was remembered more strongly by exposing the volunteers to the same smells .
All the tests were carried out while the volunteers were inside a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) scanner which monitored brain activity .
Overall , the volunteers found it easier to remember unpleasant smells rather than pleasant ones .
But the MRA scans also showed that part of the hippocampus region of the brain ' lit up ' in a peculiar way when the volunteers were exposed to the first smell they had been exposed to the week before .
But their brains did not respond in the same way when the volunteers sniffed the second smell .
The experiment was repeated using sounds rather than smells to see if they had the same impact on memory .
' We found that the first pairing or association between an object and a small had a distinct signature in the brain , ' said Dr Yaara .
' This " etching " of initial odour memories in the brain was equal for good and bad smells , yet was unique to odour . '
The researchers also found that they could predict what a person what remember later based on the activity in their brains on the first day .
Dr Yeshurun said it makes good evolutionary sense for people to remember unpleasant memories .
But the findings show that there is something ' particularly special ' about early memories of smells , he added .
Smells may trigger such strong memories because our ancestors were more dependent on their noses to avoid poisonous plants , rotten food or enemies than modern people .
Last week we saw the first evidence that iPhone 4.0 was in testing with reports that it was already being spotted in web site logs .
We pointed out at the time that while interesting , such user agent logs could easily be faked .
This week , we 've received slightly more evidence that iPhone OS 4.0 is indeed undergoing testing .
One iPhone developer has since noted a single instance of iPhone OS 4.0 being used in their Pinch Media analytics .
The new operating system first appeared this week in their application 's logs .
While such data can still be faked , it seems less likely to be .
Testing of iPhone OS 4.0 may correspond with reports of new iPhone hardware also being tested .
Any new iPhone would require a new version of the iPhone operating system to support the new hardware .
Apple is widely expected to release a new iPhone in the summer around WWDC 2010

We 're watching results as they 're coming in tonight , while continuing to comb through various problem reports as they 've been coming in throughout the day ( the usual " hiccups " " glitches " " snags " and " snafus " reportage --- anything but the proper word for them all : " failure " ! )
As we always find necessary to remind readers on such nights , the bulk of election failures tend to reveal themselves in the hours and days --- and sometimes even weeks --- after Election Day .
With that in mind , of the most potential note that we 've seen so far today --- though mostly downplayed as minor " glitches " in most of the stories reporting them --- we 've found reports of : Diebold touch - screen machine failure in OH's Montgomery and Greene Counties ; new e-pollbooks failing in Suffolk County , NY ; new Sequoia / Dominion optical - scan systems failing in St. Lawrence County , NY , and ; Sequoia touch - screen failures in Essex , Somerset and Goucester Counties , NJ .
Fortunately , turnout has been light today , so the problems that have cropped up seem to have been handled by quickly replacing machines ( a luxury available during slow , off - year elections when there are extra machines to go around ) or in such a way that delays --- and the voter disenfranchisement that goes with them --- were minimal .
At least as so far reported .
Whether any of the results tabulated in secret , with secret software , are actually accurate , well , that 's anyone 's guess as usual .
In any case , we 're monitoring , and will let ya know if there 's anything you need to know about .
Please feel free to let us know about anything you think we should know about in comments .
Other than that , we 're just stunned that ACORN did such a terrible job , yet again , at " stealing the election " in New Jersey !
UPDATE 9:29 pm PT : New Sequoia op - scan systems fail in Fulton County , NY and are impounded by court order .
Emergency paper ballots are used .
Fulton is part of the hotly contested NY - 23 Congressional special election .

A group of University of Kansas researchers working with Chinese colleagues have discovered a venomous , birdlike raptor that thrived some 128 million years ago in China .
This is the first report of venom in the lineage that leads to modern birds .
" This thing is a venomous bird for all intents and purposes , " said Larry Martin , KU professor and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum and Biodiversity Institute .
" It was a real shock to us and we made a special trip to China to work on this . "
The KU - China team 's findings will be published in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences during the week of Dec. 21 .
" We think it 's going to make a big splash , " said Martin .
The article 's authors are Enpu Gong , geology department at Northeastern University in Shenyang , China , and researchers Martin , David Burnham and Amanda Falk at the KU Natural History Museum and Biodiversity Institute .
The dromaeosaur or raptor , Sinornithosaurus ( Chinese - bird - lizard ) , is a close relative to Velociraptor .
It lived in prehistoric forests of northeastern China that were filled with a diverse assemblage of animals including other primitive birds and dinosaurs .

" This is an animal about the size of a turkey , " said Martin .
" It 's a specialized predator of small dinosaurs and birds .
It was almost certainly feathered .
It 's a very close relative of the four - winged glider called Microraptor . "
The venom most likely sent the victim into rapid shock , shrinking the odds of retaliation , escape or piracy from other predators while the raptor manipulated its prey .
" You would n't have seen it coming , " said Burnham .
" It would have swooped down behind you from a low - hanging tree branch and attacked from the back .
It wanted to get its jaws around you .
Once the teeth were embedded in your skin the venom could seep into the wound .
The prey would rapidly go into shock , but it would still be living , and it might have seen itself being slowly devoured by this raptor . "
The genus had special depressions on the side of its face thought by the investigators to have housed a poison gland , connected by a long lateral depression above the tooth row that delivered venom to a series of long , grooved teeth on the upper jaw .
This arrangement is similar to the venom - delivery system in modern rear - fanged snakes and lizards .
The researchers believe it to be specialized for predation on birds .
" When we were looking at Sinornithosaurus , we realized that its teeth were unusual , and then we began to look at the whole structure of the teeth and jaw , and at that point , we realized it was similar to modern - day snakes , " Martin said .
Sinornithosaurus is represented by at least two species .
These specimens have features consistent with a primitive venom - delivery system .
The KU - China research team said it was a low - pressure system similar to the modern Beaded lizard , Heloderma , however the prehistoric Sinornithosaurus had longer teeth to break through layers of feathers on its bird victims .
The discovery of features thought to be associated with a venom - delivery system in Sinornithosaurus stemmed from a study of the anatomy and ecology of Microraptor by the joint Chinese - KU team .
They now are seeking to discover if Microraptor may have possessed a similar poison - delivery system .
Want to give a unique , Seattle - inspired and locally made gift this holiday season ?
Buy a CHS shirt !
Or check out ZoneFour , a new apparel and print shop sandwiched between Lucky Devil Tattoo Parlor and The Capitol Hill Market on 12th Ave. and E. Howell Street .
Owner and designer Ian Anderson creates Seattle - inspired tee shirts and hoodies for men and women .
The most popular design is the dripping Seattle skyline graphic .
And while repping the city could turn off some locals , the graphics have a cool , relaxed tone without appearing too kitschy .
If that ’s still not your style , do n’t worry , there are plenty of other looks and images to choose from .
Plus , Ian said new designs will pop up every month .
“ I wanted to create cool shit that is n’t available anywhere else and really represents Capitol Hill and Seattle … interesting clothes I would want to wear that are n’t tied to a specific trend or style , ” said Ian .
The shop also features prints by local artists and designers , with new featured graphics planned for every other week .
They feature BLT ’s work prominently right now .
He is Ian ’s mentor and business partner who designed concert posters for Seattle greats Pearl Jam and Death Cab for Cutie , among others .
ZoneFour is named for the neighborhood parking zone .
The store got its start working with The Comet Tavern and Zion ’s Gate Records , plus local bands and art projects .
While I was there , I took advantage of the opportunity to got some holiday shopping done .
I picked up a cool montage of Pike Place Market for my mom , who recently moved out of the state , and a framed print of the Space Needle with a splash of green paint exploding from behind it .
I figured my 13 year - old sister would love it since she moved to Texas and likes to remember Seattle .
A ZoneFour Etsy listing
As the business grows , Ian hopes to include other local artists in the mix , making the shop a kind of artistic hub on the Hill .
“ ZoneFour is all about collaboration with other businesses , Capitol Hill artists and local people , ” he said .
The shop took over the small space once inhabited by People ’s Republic of Koffee , which moved two storefronts closer to Pine in a renovated house .
It ’s now a full cafe and art gallery with great outdoor seating potential .
People ’s Republic helped ZoneFour take over the space and they have plans to promote and work with each other in the future .
( Ian told me about summer plans to host community bbqs and epic beer pong tournaments in the coffee house courtyard .
Should be a party ! )
Slog recently posted about the new Republic and included a picture of the new space .
In addition to its offline presence , ZoneFour operates an online Etsy store for the holidays .
Mention CHS and you ’ll get 10 % off your order .
The store is open 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays ( closed Mondays ) and 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends .
You can also find them at Pike Place Market .
This week I was working on reimplementing Benjamin Werner ’s model of Z / ZF / ZFC in Coq by bringing it up to date and using the classical subset of constructive logic rather than assuming classical axioms .
Benjamin ’s work shows how to build a model of Z in Coq .
Under some additional choice - style axioms this model can be shown to be a model of ZF or ZFC .
My work lead me to the Wikipedia article on ordinal analysis , which has shaken my belief in the consistency of Z .
As I understand , Gentzen showed that believing in the consistency of PA is equivalent to believing in the well - foundedness of ε 0 .
This can be rephrased as a claim that a particular program , say the hydra game , terminates on all inputs .
Therefore , if you believe in the well - foundness of ε 0 and you believe Gentzen ’s argument , which is done in PRA , then you believe PA is consistent , even if it has impredicative induction principles .
PRA has consistency strength equivalent to the well - foundness of ωω , which can be stated again as the termination of some other program on all inputs .
Presumably this equivalence is proved in a still weaker system .
I wonder if this process can be iterated down to the well - foundness of ω , as a sort of modified Hilbert ’s program ?
Looking up in the ordinal hierarchy , we see that the consistency of Martin - Löf type theory is equivalent to the well - foundedness of Γ 0 .
I have not studied this ordinal , but it appears to have a well defined ordinal notation which would presumably convince me of its well - foundedness .
As I understand , Agda 2 is an implementation of Martin - Löf type theory , thus Benjamin ’s model of Z can not be ported to Agda 2 .
Indeed , the definition of the model uses the impredicativity of Coq at one point to prove that it satisfies the power set axiom .
On a recent weekday morning , Tom and Jo Heindel strode to the top of a hill at the edge of town and held hands , savoring the panoramic views below of elk grazing in alfalfa fields , strips of willows along streams and elm trees glistening with the remnants of rain .
Then Tom , 73 , and Jo , 71 , got down to business .
“ A few dozen scaup , 10 eared grebes , 12 Clark ’s grebes , 20 canvasbacks and a Northern harrier gliding low and fast , ” Jo said , peering through a spotting scope .
“ Got it , ” said Tom , transcribing the information on a tally sheet spread across the hood of their aging white mini-pickup truck .
“ It is 8:50 a.m. and 66 degrees , with 2 - mile - per - hour winds from the north under clear blue skies . ”

Theirs is a love story that dates to a spring day in 1953 when Tom , 16 , asked Jo , 14 , out on their first date -- bird watching in the Santa Monica Mountains .
Thus began the ornithological passion that has carried the Heindels through 55 years of marriage and careers as high school science teachers in the United States , Bolivia , Ecuador and Saudi Arabia .
But the most significant and enduring contribution of the relationship -- one Jo likes to call “ a menage a trois , with birds being the third party ” -- began in 1972 as a plan to produce a little guide to the birds of the Eastern Sierra .
Now the Heindels are nearing completion of what has grown into a 500 - page draft manuscript of a comprehensive scientific survey of every species and subspecies ever documented in Inyo County over the last 150 years .

The tentative title : “ The Status and Distribution of the Birds of Inyo County Including Death Valley National Park . ”
The 200,000 - plus entries document species , behavior , date , time , temperature , wind direction -- even the make and power of the binoculars or telescope used by the observers .
They also include the first recorded sightings of a particular species , its highest recorded elevation and whether it is a resident , migrant or summer visitor .
The Heindels say their project has cost them tens of thousands of dollars for computer equipment , file cabinets , travel , phone calls , research materials , cameras and scopes -- not to mention time .
“ If we took minimum pay for all the time we ’ve put into it , ” Jo said , “ we could pay off the federal debt . ”
Now , with the book “ 95 % done , ” Tom said , ornithologists have been urging them to shop for a publisher .

The Heindels ’ book will be among the most ambitious of its kind published in the last 50 years , experts say .
“ There are thousands of counties in the United States , yet most states do not have a single county bird book , ” said James Van Remsen , a professor of biological sciences at Louisiana State University ’s Museum of Natural Science .
“ So I admire the Heindels .
In retirement and at their own expense , they are making a rare contribution : a total , all - out description of avifauna in one of the largest and most complex counties of them all . ”
In a home office bulging with files , photographs , maps , correspondence , bird books and copies of naturalists ’ field notes , Jo sighed : “ Our friends are questioning whether we will ever get the darned thing done .
We ’re wondering too . ”
Shaking his head , Tom added : “ The most important thing left to do is set a cutoff point for accepting new information , which may be soon . ”

Their effort has become the stuff of legend among premier ornithologists , who liken it to the inventory of California life forms compiled a century ago by Joseph Grinnell of UC Berkeley ’s Museum of Natural History .
“ Tom and Jo are compiling data down to the level of subspecies , which many bird analyses do not do , ” said Kimball Garrett , ornithology collections manager at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County .
“ But there is so much variation within species in Inyo County that they have doubled and tripled their workload by investigating birds at that level . ”
Avian diversity comes with the territory in Inyo County , a land of striking geographic contrasts where the High Sierra and the Mojave Desert collide .
More species of birds have been recorded in Inyo County than in each of 29 states .
Ironically , the workload has all but transformed the Heindels into recluses , leaving them with little time for contact with birds in the field .

They have given up bird - banding efforts at Death Valley National Park , breeding - bird surveys in remote corners of Inyo County and bird - watching trips closer to home .
Tom even turned down a recent opportunity to see a wood thrush , which he ’d never seen here before , because it would have taken valuable time away from the book .
An annual trip to a birding hot spot in Texas , Ohio or Florida is out of the question .
“ We ’re not writing for today ’s bird watchers , ” Jo said , leafing through a thick stack of field notes .
“ We ’re creating a window into Inyo County ’s bird life for people living 100 years from now . ”
Of the 425 species of birds ever seen in Inyo County , Tom has personally identified 408 .
“ I ’m a few birds behind Tom , ” Jo said .
For all their experience and knowledge , they still get a special kick out of scanning local ponds and fields through matching Questar telescopes .

“ There is nothing more exciting than a rare bird , ” Jo said .
“ Your blood starts pumping and you ’re skin gets flushed .
You ’re a mess . ”
“ I get goose bumps and teary eyes , ” Tom said .
That kind of talk has made their modest home in Big Pine , about 200 miles north of Los Angeles , a base camp for visiting birders whose first question is : “ When is the book coming out ? ”
Visitors rarely leave before hearing many stories that take on the quality of myth :
The time Jo and Tom hacked through Bolivian jungle , then plunged into dense brush on their hands and knees to become the second and third people in the world , respectively , to see a small , secretive forest species known as the rufous - faced antpitta .
Or the time 27 birders with no money and no other place to stay dropped in unannounced one winter night and slept on their floor .

“ We are thrilled to have them as part of our community , ” said Pete Pumphrey , president of Eastern Sierra Audubon .
“ They have collected all this information that will be valuable for years and years to come on issues from habitat to climate change and have opened lots of eyes to how magical are living things that can fly . ”
Jon L. Dunn , co-editor of the National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America , is a close friend who has forwarded his field notes to Tom and Jo since the early 1980s .
“ I ’ve seen them in action from Death Valley to the High Sierra , ” said Dunn , who lives in nearby Round Valley .
“ So I know that everything that goes into that book is believable . ”
In the field , the couple have nurtured roles suited to their gifts .

Tom tends to identify birds by their song .
During a recent outing at the outflow of a nearby trout hatchery , he said : “ Here in Owens Valley -- marsh wren to the right -- we occasionally -- Virginia rail just ahead in the reeds -- get -- song sparrow behind us -- a foot of snow in winter . ”
Jo favors shapes and color variations .
As a result , the Heindels are prone to heated debates when looking at the same bird .
“ Those are n’t streaks , they ’re spots ! ”
Jo has been heard to say .
Their infatuation with birds started early in life .
Tom was a young boy driving a tractor on the family farm in Pennsylvania when , he recalled , “ the images of bright birds -- red - winged blackbirds , meadowlarks , cardinals , blue jays -- first caught my attention . ”
When he was 12 , he said , “ my father deserted the family and I went to live on the farm of an uncle , who helped me learn the names of those birds . ”

At 15 , Tom moved with his mother and sister to Los Angeles .
Tom was attending Hamilton High School in Los Angeles and Jo was at Culver City High when they met at a Lutheran church event .
They were still in high school when they were married in 1954 .
After graduation , Tom served in the Air Force until 1958 .
Both earned teaching credentials at Cal State Long Beach , then became teachers at Big Pine High School .
Six years later , they began landing teaching jobs in South America and Saudi Arabia , where they explored remote oases that were rest stops for migrating birds .

The Heindels moved back to Big Pine in 1990 .
They have four children -- a daughter and three sons -- all avid bird watchers .
On a recent weekday afternoon , Tom and Jo peered through binoculars at nearby Klondike Lake , which reflected snow - clad Sierra peaks towering in the background .
Tom noted that it was 4:30 p.m. , 82 degrees and 100 % clear .
“ Bingo ! ” Jo shouted .
“ Pacific loon loafing near a common loon .
It ’s a juvenile . ”

Tom smiled and said , “ Amazing , Jo . Might be the only one we see all year . ”
That night , they compared fields notes in preparation for the tedious work of entering the afternoon ’s sightings and vital statistics into computer files reserved for the book .
“ There is still so much we do n’t know about birds around here , ” Tom said to Jo .
“ But I ’ll never forget the most beautiful bird I ’ve ever seen .
I was 16 at the time .
She was 14 . ”

( CNN ) --
In the early days of " Sesame Street " -- that is , B.E. ( Before Elmo ) -- Sesame Street was a pretty grimy place .
The brownstone at 123 Sesame Street looked like it needed a serious power washing , the storefront of Mr. Hooper 's shop was intentionally dingy and the Fix - It Shop 's window was cluttered with toasters .
It was gritty , but gritty in a magical way .
When the show started in 1969 ( " Sesame Street " will celebrate its 40th anniversary on November 10 ) , the concept of educational television programming was nothing short of revolutionary .
" Sesame Street " was originally intended as a learning tool for inner-city children -- not only as a supplement to their lessons in math and the ABCs but to teach them to be good people and show them that learning can be fun .
Those early years are now available on DVD ; and the discs contain a disclaimer that essentially states that they are intended for nostalgia purposes only .
The warning reads as follows :
" These early ' Sesame Street ' episodes are intended for grown - ups , and may not suit the needs of today 's preschool child . "
Say what !?
Never did I ever think I 'd see " Sesame Street " and " intended for grown - ups " in the same sentence .
iReport :
What letter of the alphabet would you like to pay tribute to ?
On the DVDs , Cookie Monster can be seen as his character of Alistair Cookie in his " Monsterpiece Theatre " segment ( a spoof of Alistair Cooke 's " Masterpiece Theatre " ) smoking a pipe .
Yep , Cookie Monster smoked .
He later eats the pipe because , as he was often prone to doing , he thinks the pipe is a cookie .
Cookie Monster used to become so overwhelmed by his desire for cookies that he'd start seeing ( hallucinating about ? ) cookies that were n't actually there .
He 'd eat ( rotary ) telephones , typewriters ( what are those ? ) , pencils , almost anything .
It was funny .
Today , Cookie Monster 's diet is much more balanced , as he has adopted the philosophy that cookies are a " sometimes food . "
Cookie coincidentally changed his tune in 2006 amidst reports that childhood obesity had reached epidemic proportions .
Early " Sesame Street " had some other elements that would not pass muster today .
Oscar the Grouch is just plain nasty , children are seen riding their bikes without helmets , and there 's even a sketch where the human character of Gordon can be seen approaching a little girl on the street .
He takes her by the hand and brings her into his house for milk and cookies ( again with the cookies ! ) .
Clearly , that could be misinterpreted by today 's standards .
Now , some 4,000 episodes later , 123 Sesame Street has gotten that power washing .
Peeling paint is nowhere to be found , and the only visible garbage can has a tenant .
It 's much more sanitized .
I 'm tempted to make fun of this , but then I notice the bottle of anti-bacterial hand gel on my desk and bite my proverbial tongue .
For better or worse , today 's preschooler is very different from the 1969 version .
And children 's television programming simply has to reflect that .
But one thing has n't changed on " Sesame Street " : the unflinchingly genuine attitudes of its residents .
For 40 years , they have taught us that sometimes we are going to get hurt , cry and be lonely .
They 've taught us that there 'll also be times when we 're downright jovial .
All the while , those characters have remained sincere .
We may never see Cookie Monster eat a pipe again , but luckily the memories are preserved on DVD , and in our hearts .
Concerns about Dubai 's financial health have hit world markets
The Dubai government has said it will not guarantee the debt of Dubai World , which caused global panic because it cannot pay back creditors immediately .
The statement came after stock markets in Dubai and Abu Dhabi saw sharp falls .
" [ Creditors ] think Dubai World is part of the government , which is not correct , " said finance minister Abdulrahman al - Saleh .
Abu Dhabi's main stock market lost a record 8.3 % , while Dubai dropped 7.3 % - the most in a year .
" Creditors need to take part of the responsibility for their decision to lend to the companies , " Mr al - Saleh told Dubai Television .
The central bank of the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) has said it is setting up a facility to provide banks with extra liquidity , as it seeks to battle perceptions that Dubai cannot support its own companies .
Greece and Latvia are paying more for their debt , thanks to Dubai
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Greece acknowledges debt fears
Send us your comments
Mr al - Saleh 's statement caused some surprise in Dubai as people who invested in Dubai World effectively did so on the assumption that the government would guarantee them , BBC Middle East business reporter Ben Thompson said .
There is a very grey area between business and government in Dubai , he added .
Dubai World said it was hoping a restructuring plan would cover $ 26 bn ( £ 15.8 bn ) of debt .
In a company statement , Dubai World said the proposed restructuring process will only include its main property firms , but leave other companies , which it described as " on a stable financial footing " , untouched .
' West exaggerates '
On the Dubai bourse , construction and financial stocks slumped nearly 10 % .
The debt - ridden Dubai World fell 15 % .
ANALYSIS By Ben Thompson , Middle East business reporter , Dubai
When it came the fall was hard and fast .
After the Eid holiday , this was the first opportunity investors here had to make their feelings known .
And that they did .
Foreign investors , it seems , were the ones pulling out their money .
Locals were choosing to sit out the storm .
But whilst the falls were severe , it was n't the bloodbath that had been expected .
Some analysts had predicted that a 10 % fall was all but inevitable .
And so there is some comfort that the losses were n't as steep , but there 's still unease .
The biggest concern here is what this does to Dubai 's international reputation .
Investors have left .
Will they ever come back ?
Dubai 's property developer , Nakheel , asked for the trading of some of its Islamic bonds to be suspended .
" This was expected because markets have panicked over exaggerated reports in the Western media , " Hamam al - Shamaa from Al - Fajr Securities said .
He added that many foreign investors were withdrawing from the market and that Tuesday would probably be a similar day .
European markets were all lower .
The UK's FTSE 100 closed down 1.05 % , Germany 's Dax also fell 1.05 % and France 's Cac 40 slid 0.99 % .
US shares were similarly muted with the Dow Jones barely changed , opening down 0.1 % to 10,298.81 points .
Banks fell more sharply in the UK .
RBS was down 4.45 % while Lloyds was even worse hit - falling by 5.89 % .
While shares in the Middle East dropped sharply , Asian shares rebounded on Monday on hopes the Dubai debt crisis would not spread to other financial markets after the UAE 's central bank said it would support banks when necessary .
Bank assistance On Sunday , the UAE central bank said it was setting up a facility to provide banks with extra liquidity .
What went wrong in Dubai Dubai does not have the enormous oil wealth enjoyed by its neighbours such as Abu Dhabi .
Its main source of wealth has historically been as a port .
In recent years it has sought to make money from property development and luxury tourism , building impressive hotels such as the Burj al - Arab .
The global downturn left many financial workers unemployed .
The population fell an estimated 17 % , meaning there was little demand for new properties .
There was also less demand for luxury holidays .
Dubai companies have borrowed money to fund huge building projects such as " The World " and are now unable to repay it .
There are jitters on financial markets about who lent all the money .
European banks are estimated to have lent more than £ 50bn to the whole of the United Arab Emirates .
Dubai state - backed companies may also have to sell - off some of their assets overseas such as luxury property in London and the Turnberry golf course in Scotland .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
The liquidity will be available to all UAE banks as well as foreign banks operating in the Emirates .
The bank added that the banking system in the UAE was more sound and liquid than a year ago .
That came after Wednesday 's announcement from Dubai World asking for a suspension on its debt repayments , which sent world stock markets tumbling .
Meanwhile , neighbouring Abu Dhabi has said it will " pick and choose " how to assist Dubai .
" We will look at Dubai 's commitments and approach them on a case - by - case basis , " an Abu Dhabi government official said on Saturday .
" It does not mean that Abu Dhabi will underwrite all of their debts , " he added .
Paying the price
The BBC 's economics editor Stephanie Flanders said the situation in Dubai had alerted investors to the idea that you can lose money on government bonds - even if they appear to have implicit guarantees .
The repercussions of Dubai 's debt problems are already making it more expensive for countries with large deficits to sell their debt .
" There are lots of other governments out there who do n't have rich neighbours with oil to bail them out , who may have trouble in the next few months or years , " she commented .
" Greece and Latvia are paying more for their debt , thanks to Dubai . "
Greece 's finance minister George Papconstantinou told the BBC that he understood international concern about the country 's credibility but said that was down to the actions of the previous government .
He said that the Socialist government , which was elected 50 days ago , has a plan in place to reduce the deficit and that by " 2010 you will be seeing a reduction " .

Australia 's competition watchdog ( ACCC ) has issued a warning to Microsoft Australia , stating that the software vendor should be more careful when advertising the security capabilities of its latest operating system , Windows 7 .
During the Windows 7 launch event in Sydney in October ( see photo gallery top right ) , journalists were shown a number of advertisements that would feature in a television campaign - including one touting the operating system 's security capabilities .
The advertisement in question featured an elderly gentlemen with what looked to be his grandson .
They were playing with a very grand toy castle and talking about IT security .
" A while back something just popped into my head : ' My PC should have more security ' , " said the grandfather .
" Like 50 - foot castle wall - type security .
Next thing I know , whammo !
There 's Windows 7 .
Now it keeps all my personal info safer and I do n't have to worry about bad stuff getting through .
Victory is mine .
How 's that for secure ? "
At this point a wall of flames surrounded the castle .
During the ensuing Q&A session , journalist Nick Ross asked Jeff Putt , who heads up the Windows consumer team , if he thought the advert was misleading .
" Do n't you worry that [ the advert ] might just be misleading a few people into not buying antivirus software ? "
Ross asked .
" Because you 're still going to have to , are n't you ? "
Putt responded by saying consumers should get " more sincere guidance " from a third party .
The advertisement - and others - have since been aired in New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , South Australia and Western Australia .
They also ran in Canberra for a short period of time .
" They are running across all three [ major ] channels , " a Microsoft spokesman said .
" Channel ten , channel seven and channel nine " .
A spokesman from the ACCC told iTnews on Thursday that its staff investigated the advertising campaign touting Windows 7's security .
The ACCC agreed that the advert could be detrimental , but said its likely impact " would be small " .
" Some people might have read it as an absolute claim , " the spokesman said .
The competition watchdog conceded that there were " always shades of grey " when it came to advertising - and because of this , " the ACCC have written to Microsoft and let them know " .
The spokesman said the claim made by Microsoft should have been " comparative " if it was going to tout the security of its operating system .
Microsoft Australia said it was " not in a position " to comment at the time of publication .

The governor of the southern Colombian province of Caqueta has been found dead less than a day after he was kidnapped by suspected rebels , authorities say .
President Alvaro Uribe said the kidnappers had cut Luis Francisco Cuellar 's throat as they were being chased by security forces .
Mr Cuellar was seized from his house on Monday in the provincial capital .
Officials are blaming the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) guerrillas for his killing .
Mr Cuellar was the most high - profile politician abducted since Mr Uribe came to power in 2002 .
Luis Francisco Cuellar had been kidnapped several times before " The terrorists burned the vehicle in which they kidnapped the governor , further ahead they killed him , they slit his throat , they killed him miserably , " said President Uribe , in a nationally televised address .
" They slit his throat to avoid making noise because they knew that the armed forces were in the surrounding area .
" In the midst of pain we reiterate today all our determination to defeat these terrorists . "
Earlier , Mr Uribe , whose father was killed in 1983 during a botched kidnapping by rebels , had said Colombia could not be " held captive by the whim of terrorists , terrorists who bathe the country in blood and who trick us every day " .
Ransom offered Mr Cuellar was taken from his home by about 10 gunmen , who lobbed grenades at the building .
One policeman was killed in the attack and two more were wounded .

More than 2,000 military personnel had been deployed in the search for the kidnappers .
The authorities had also offered 1bn pesos ( $ 500,000 ; £ 312,000 ) to anyone giving information leading to Mr Cuellar 's safe return .
But his body was found hours later , close to a burnt - out vehicle on a road about 15 km ( 9 miles ) outside Florencia .
He had been bound and gagged and had several bullet wounds in his body .
Explosives had been placed around him .
It remains unclear whether the kidnappers initially intended to kill Mr Cuellar , says the BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Colombia .
In the past , high - profile figures have been kidnapped to try to force the government to make prisoner exchanges .
Mr Cuellar had previously been kidnapped four times in the past 23 years , but for ransom , his wife told the Associated Press news agency .
New leadership Caqueta has been a stronghold of the Farc - Colombia 's oldest and largest left - wing rebel group - for many years .
Profiles : Colombia 's armed groups Q&A : Colombia 's civil conflict
It was where French - Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 .
The Farc has not claimed responsibility for the attack on Mr Cuellar , but is widely thought to have been behind it .
The acting governor of Caqueta , Patricia Vega , told local media she had no doubt that the Farc was responsible .
The guerrillas , who finance their operations through drugs trafficking , were thought to number some 16,000 fighters , but analysts suggest their ranks have fallen to about 9,000 .
They suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the security forces in 2008 , but the rebels appear to have rallied under new leadership and to be seeking to regain the initiative in the country 's 45 - year civil conflict , our correspondent says .
Attacks and kidnappings have lessened , but the guerrillas are still holding more than 20 police officers and soldiers , often referred to as high - profile hostages , who were seized more than a decade ago .
It is also believed to have kidnapped hundreds of other people , mainly for ransom , over the years .

Researchers found that modern - day hectic lifestyles , fussy children and spouses who work long hours mean mums are stuck in a rut when it comes to dinner - time .
Nine in 10 mothers polled admitted to cooking the same meals over and over again , while one in four made the same meals on the same day of the week .
The most common dish was spaghetti bolognese , followed by the classic roast dinner , shepherd 's pie or cottage pie and a pasta dish .
Merchant Gourmet , who conducted the study of 4,000 Britons , said : " It ’s not surprising , given the demands of modern family life , that home cooks revert back to the recipes they know and love .
" People are put off experimenting with new meals and ingredients as they ’re convinced it will be time - consuming or expensive . "

The Manor Grand Prix team will run under the Virgin Racing name in 2010 , according to the latest entry list issued by the FIA today .
Richard Branson 's company entered Formula 1 as a sponsor of the Brawn team this year , but has long been linked with a larger role with Manor .
The FIA document confirms that this will be the case , although an official announcement from Virgin is still awaited .
John Booth 's squad will use chassis created by former Simtek and Benetton designer Nick Wirth 's Wirth Research company , which designed the Acura LMP cars .
Timo Glock has been signed as Virgin 's first driver .
The other news confirmed by the FIA 's entry list was that Red Bull Racing will continue with Renault engines .
The team had been linked with a switch to Mercedes power earlier in the year .
But the entry list did not resolve the issue of the 13th entry .
The Sauber team is hoping to get back into the field now that Toyota had pulled out of F1 - having previously committed to the new Concorde Agreement - but the FIA said it could not make an announcement about this situation yet .
" Toyota Motorsport GmbH remains formally bound by the Concorde Agreement to put forward a team for participation , though it has indicated that it will not be in a position to do so , " said a statement from the governing body .
" An announcement will be made regarding this entry in due course . "
Champion team Brawn GP remains listed under its 2009 name on the entry , but the FIA noted that it " has indicated its intention to change its team name to Mercedes Grand Prix prior to the start of the 2010 season " following its purchase by the Germany company .

While Russia 's actions are not easily understandable when considered as those of a country , they are much easier to interpret rationally when you look at who the actual players behind the scenes are .
Conversely , public European reactions which sound logical are , in fact , incredibly naive if you know the industry a bit and , given that the people involved are certainly not naive , they are other things at stake .
We 've recently heard more veiled threats from Putin about Ukraine being unable to pay for gas ( thus presumably leading to new attempts at cutting them off ) , which suggests that Russia is getting itself ready to start a new crisis .
That means two things :
First , as a reminder , since 1994 , there have been two separate bits in the Russian - Ukrainian gas trade :
the official part , whereby Gazprom delivers gas to Naftogaz ( roughly 20 - 25 bcm / y ) , the Ukrainian national gas company , and uses Naftogaz 's network of pipelines for its gas exports to Europe ( including Turkey ) - roughly 130 - 150 bcm /y of transit ; this trade roughly balances itself out , ie is settled without any ash payments .
Given that gas prices are more volatile than transit prices , Gazprom regularly tries to get paid something more for the gas it delivers , arguing that it has become worth more than the transit services , and Ukraine refuses to ( or can 't ) pay .
This is the public dispute , and it is , in reality , a sideshow ;
the unofficial part , whereby semi-mysterious traders like RosUkrEnergo and its predecessors deliver gas to Ukrainian clients using Gazprom 's pipelines but gas formally sourced elsewhere .
As I have explained in detail in this paper for the IFRI research institute , this business was created by Gazprom managers , jointly with large Ukrainian gas consumers , to get around the impossibility for Gazprom to get paid by Naftogaz under the official trade : Ukrainian gas users get gas cheaper than if they bought if from Naftogas , and the suppliers get some money from gas deliveries from Gazprom 's network to Ukraine ; the initial customers can then on - sell more gas to other Ukrainian users and make additional money for them and their Russian accomplices .
This is fundamentally an unstable business because ( i ) it has to be done in the shadows , as it goes directly against the interests of Naftogas , the national company , and it uses Gazprom 's network at no benefit for the company , ( ii ) all the major Ukrainian gas users ( mainly the big steel - bashing companies in the East ) want to be the privileged intermediary that gets first access to the gas and a cut on further sales , ( iii ) various clans within Gazprom ( and their associates in the Kremlin ) want their hands on that juicy business .
Amongst unavoidable players in this game , you thus have the big customers in Ukraine , the people with formal authority over gas transit both in Ukraine and in Russia , the people with access to gas inside Russia or in Central Asia , and their counterparts within Gazprom ...
Fights on the second front can spill on the first front , as the two businesses largely use the same pipelines and gas inside the system is fully fungible .
The West 's error has been to try to interpret what 's going on in light purely of the first , public , conflict .
Of course , one reason this happened was that in 2006 , some players in the West had very strong motivations to suddenly make a big deal of what had been a recurring , and mostly ignored , conflict .
The UK government was facing the very real prospects of gas cuts as domestic production was shrinking and inadequate plans for import and gas storage were in place ; the Russian - Ukrainian gas crisis offered a perfect opportunity to turn a domestic policy failure into an international conflict , with blame nicely thrown at a familiar enemy .
In parallel , the US administration had cooled on Putin following the takeover of the Russian oil industry by oligarchs unfriendly to the Western majors which he oversaw ; that crisis was a perfect opportunity to paint him as a dictator bent on oppressing his neighbors , especially in the wake of the " colour " revolutions in Ukraine or Georgia .
Once that interpretation was pushed unto an unsuspecting public , it took hold - and the Russians , focused on the behind - the - scenes conflict , did little to behave in ways that could have changed that perceptions .
That interpretation of the conflict also had the added benefit of make the US and UK look like the defenders of freedom and markets in Europe , against the weak and compromising French , German and Italians , too cowardly or corrupt to confront the Russians , and too busy coddling their national energy companies against from the " fair competition " of more nimble markets which would otherwise spontaneously create alternatives to Russian gas imports .
By 2009 , it was obvious that things were not completely black and white , and the narrative of Russia imperialistically exercising the " energy weapon " against the plucky freedom - loving Ukrainians and other neighbors was not enough to explain things .
Europeans , collectively , started taking a harder look at Ukraine 's behavior - but they continued to focus almost exclusively on the first conflict , which was much easier to grasp .
Russia decided to push its advantage , to push the blame on official Ukraine , and hopefully get Europe to finally pay them something for the gas delivered to Ukraine - thus the much longer cuts that took place in January , and what appeared to be a successful resolution through European loans to Ukraine .
But of course , as I predicted then , Ukraine failed to meet the conditions to get that loan ( which , contrary to the loans extracted from Russia , they 'd actually have to repay ) , dumping the problem once again in Russia 's lap .
Fundamentally , even with the new pipelines Russia is building , Ukraine has a stranglehold over Russia 's exports , and can go on not paying for its official gas deliveries , effectively offsetting these with the transit service ; and it should be noted that , even with variable prices for natural gas , this is not a bad deal for Gazprom ( which know it ) .
So while there is a lot of theater around the first conflict , and continued attempts to change the stable solution that has been reached , this is not an equilibrium likely to change , unless Russians and Ukrainians ( which have a common interest there ) somehow manage to make the European cough up some money along the way .
Thus the continues crises , and the fearmongering about Russia 's " energy weapon , " which is basically encouraged by Russia to some extent as it seems to give them a bit more leverage and importance in the public eye .
The second conflict is much more intractable , much less subject to the restrictions of traditional diplomacy , and its players are likely to continue to use and abuse the instruments of State they control for their private purposes , thereby creating confusion for international onlookers .
So it is likely that further crises will erupt , and that gas deliveries to Europe will be temporarily shut down , typically in January .
Before going into predictions , an aside : gas consumption is very seasonal , with winter consumption typically double or triple summer levels , which means that quite a bit of storage capacity is needed to smooth out deliveries and ensure adequate supplies through the winter ( deliveries in winter are often lower than demand ) .
Most consumer countries - and in particular big importing countries - have significant buffers , and these are usually full at the beginning of the winter , ie when the crises happen .
So , other than for a very small number of East European countries that have little storage and fully depend on Russian deliveries , Russian gas cuts have no impact whatsoever on actual gas availability for consumers in most countries , which can simply draw on their stored reserves a bit more than usual .
As a final point of background , and as I have argued many times before , electricity market deregulation in Europe has encouraged investment by players in gas - fired power plants , because they are the easiest and least risky to finance ( given that electricity prices are largely driven by gas prices , as gas - fired plants are the marginal cost suppliers most of the time , gas - fired plants are almost always going to be in the market , or near enough , to be viable , as opposed to plants with high fixed costs like nuclear or wind which , unless they benefit from specific regulation , can find themselves making short term losses for longer than investors can afford , even if their long term average price is competitive ) .
Over the past 10 years , Europe has built only two kinds of power plants : wind farms , thanks to the specific renewable energy rules , and gas - fired plants :
So , if one is worried about the gas supplies from Russia , there are two very simple steps fully under our control :
change power market regulation to eliminate its proven bias towards gas - fired power plants and limit the growth of European demand for gas , a large portion of which , in the long run , can only be supplied by Russia ; pointing a finger at Russia 's supposed " energy weapon " when one could very easily be less dependent on gas is a sign of incompetence or a distraction from the other priorities of such energy policies ( which are , in fact , a jobs programme for City commodity traders , M&A advisors and associated parasites ) ;
for countries that do not have sufficient gas storage capacity , urgently work on building these , or getting permanent access to friendly neighboring countries that may have more favorable locations available ; lack of storage capacity may have been a valid excuse 15 years ago for many former Soviet Bloc countries which had built infrastructure predicated on Soviet deliveries , but today it should not wash - and blaming Russia for gas delivery cuts is , again , a distraction from incompetent domestic policies .
So , finally , my predictions :
Individuals who drink more coffee ( regular or decaffeinated ) or tea appear to have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes , according to an analysis of previous studies reported in the December 14/28 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine .
By the year 2025 , approximately 380 million individuals worldwide will be affected by type 2 diabetes , according to background information in the article .
" Despite considerable research attention , the role of specific dietary and lifestyle factors remains uncertain , although obesity and physical inactivity have consistently been reported to raise the risk of diabetes mellitus , " the authors write .
A previously published meta- analysis suggested drinking more coffee may be linked with a reduced risk , but the amount of available information has more than doubled since .
Rachel Huxley , D. Phil , of The George Institute for International Health , University of Sydney , Australia , and colleagues identified 18 studies involving 457,922 participants and assessing the association between coffee consumption and diabetes risk published between 1966 and 2009 .
Six studies involving 225,516 individuals also included information about decaffeinated coffee , whereas seven studies with 286,701 participants reported on tea consumption .
When the authors combined and analyzed the data , they found that each additional cup of coffee consumed in a day was associated with a 7 percent reduction in the excess risk of diabetes .
Individuals who drank three to four cups per day had an approximately 25 percent lower risk than those who drank between zero and two cups per day .
In addition , in the studies that assessed decaffeinated coffee consumption , those who drank more than three to four cups per day had about a one - third lower risk of diabetes than those who drank none .
Those who drank more than three to four cups of tea had a one - fifth lower risk than those who drank no tea .
" That the apparent protective effect of tea and coffee consumption appears to be independent of a number of potential confounding variables raises the possibility of direct biological effects , " the authors write .
Because of the association between decaffeinated coffee and diabetes risk , the association is unlikely to be solely related to caffeine .
Other compounds in coffee and tea — including magnesium , antioxidants known as lignans or chlorogenic acids — may be involved , the authors note .
" If such beneficial effects were observed in interventional trials to be real , the implications for the millions of individuals who have diabetes mellitus , or who are at future risk of developing it , would be substantial , " they conclude .
" For example , the identification of the active components of these beverages would open up new therapeutic pathways for the primary prevention of diabetes mellitus .
It could also be envisaged that we will advise our patients most at risk for diabetes mellitus to increase their consumption of tea and coffee in addition to increasing their levels of physical activity and weight loss . "

The ongoing battle over gay marriage in California -- legalized by the courts then overturned by voters who supported Proposition 8 in November -- has prompted some intriguing new questions .
Can anyone prove gay marriage harms traditional marriage ?
What 's " harm " and what would " proof " be ?
U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn
Walker brought these up during a hearing on a lawsuit , brought by gay Californians and supported by the state 's attorney general , claiming that Prop. 8 is unconstitutionally discriminatory .
According to an Associated Press story , Charles Cooper , lawyer for the group that sponsored Prop. 8 argued that it is " constitutionally valid because it furthers the states ' goal of fostering ' naturally procreative relationships . ' " But Cooper was flummoxed when the judge asked him where 's the harm .
With no examples of harm at hand , Cooper argued that Californians are still " entitled " not to take the risk .
Walker , however , ruled that the case could go forward .
The AP quotes Andy Pugno , general counsel to the coalition of religious and social conservative groups behind Prop. 8 , who says the real impact is that the voters who overturned gay marriage " continue to be accused of being irrational and bigoted for restoring the traditional definition of marriage . "
The idea that having babies is the one true purpose of marriage is rooted in a traditional , literal reading of the Bible , a reading that not everyone shares these days .
What do you think is the purpose of marriage ?
Are childless couples less truly married ?
What about couples who limit the number of children ?
Is their marriage not as valid ?
Has your marriage been harmed by gay couples , married or unmarried ?

William Lobdell ’s journey of faith — and doubt — is one of the most compelling spiritual memoirs of our time .
Lobdell became a born - again Christian in his late 20s when personal problems drove him to his knees in prayer .
As a newly minted evangelical , Lobdell — a veteran journalist — noticed that religion was n’t covered well in the mainstream media , and he prayed for the Lord to put him on the religion beat at a major newspaper .
In 1998 , his prayers were answered when the Los Angeles Times asked him to write about faith .
What happened next was a roller - coaster of inspiration , confusion , doubt , and soul - searching as his reporting and experiences slowly chipped away at his faith …
Last week it was announced that a new excavation near La Brea has unearthed the largest known cache of fossils from the last ice age — including an 80 - percent intact mammoth ( named Zed ) .

The Greatest Story Ever Garbled
by Tim Callahan
Perhaps the worst aspect of “ The Greatest Story Ever Told , ” Part I of Peter Joseph ’s Internet film , Zeitgeist , is that some of what it asserts is true .
Unfortunately , this material is liberally — and sloppily — mixed with material that is only partially true and much that is plainly and simply bogus .
Joseph ’s main argument is that Jesus never existed and is in fact a mythical character based on earlier sun gods .
He sees all the motifs and characters of the New Testament as coded astrological or solar references .
The argument that Jesus was a mythical construct has been made before — for example by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy in their 1999 book , The Jesus Mysteries , though Freke and Gandy made their argument with a far greater level of scholarship .
In reducing Jesus to a sun god , Joseph ignores — as Freke and Gandy did before him — the powerful current of messianic apocalypticism prevalent in first century Judea .
The fact that there were references back to earlier dying and rising gods in the Christ myth can lend an air of spurious scholarship to Zeitgeist , as long as one ignores the equally important messianic myth and the fact that there is a viable basis for an actual historical Jesus .
Joseph totally ignores the messianic / apocalyptic aspects of the New Testament writings and erroneously asserts that there is no evidence for a historical Jesus .
I will return to this issue later .
For now , let us consider Joseph ’s solar deity argument .
The Solar Cross & Sloppy Solar Symbolism
The first assertion made in Zeitgeist is that the cross is a solar symbol and not a representation of the instrument of Jesus ’ execution .
That ’s true enough , as far as it goes , which is n’t very far .
What Jesus was crucified on probably looked more like a capital “ T , ” the crossbeam to which Jesus ’ wrists were nailed being hoisted to rest atop an already anchored upright post .
It was then probably secured in place by a spike .
The Christian cross probably represents a melding of this “ T ” shape with the solar cross as a bit of religious syncretism .
This can be seen if one considers that many Christian crosses are shown enclosed by or intersecting a circle , as in the Celtic cross .
The cross is also a symbol of the four cardinal directions and the four winds .
However , the solar associations of the cross , while adding solar connotations to the Christ myth , do not militate against it also being a symbol of the Crucifixion .
Joseph next asserts that the gods Horus , Krishna , Mithra and Attys all paralleled Jesus .
Again , there is some truth to this , but Joseph mingles so much falsehood with whatever truths he reveals as to give ample ammunition to evangelical Christians who might want to shoot holes in his thesis .
First of all , he says that the Egyptian god Horus was adored by three kings , had twelve disciples and was crucified .
He says much the same thing about Mithra , as well as noting that Krishna was born on December 25 .
Almost none of this is true .
When it comes to Egyptian sources of the Christ myth , Joseph seems to have conflated Horus with his father , Osiris .
The Osiris / Horus myth , in much simplified terms , goes as follows :
Set , the evil brother of the good Osiris , murders that god and cuts his body into 14 pieces .
Isis , the wife of Osiris collects and reassembles the pieces , having to substitute a wooden phallus for that part of the dead god ’s anatomy .
She copulates with the dead god in the form of a bird , conceives Horus and gives birth to him in secret , raising him on an island in the Nile amidst the reeds .
She also raises Osiris from the dead , although this very physical resurrection is in the underworld .
When Horus comes of age he does battle with his uncle Set .
Set tears out the eye of Horus , while Horus rips off Set ’s genitals .
Eventually , peace is made between the two , both are healed , and they divide the rule of the year by seasons of life and death .
The physical resurrection of Osiris , even though it is in the underworld , is a significant precursor to Jesus as a dying and rising god , as is the physical resurrection of Dionysus , after he is killed , dismembered and partially eaten by the Titans .
Surprisingly , Joseph fails to mention this bit of classical mythology .
Horus being born and nursed in the rushes of an island in the Nile is an important parallel to the infant Moses being found among the rushes .
However , beyond the resurrection of Osiris , the main parallels between the Egyptian myth and the New Testament are iconic .
Isis with the dead body of Osiris prefigures the imagery of the Pieta .
More importantly , Christians co-opted the imagery of Isis and the infant Horus in the form of the Madonna and child .
I have absolutely no idea where Joseph got the notion that Horus had 12 disciples or that he was ever crucified .
As to the god who is born on December 25 — this was not Krishna , but Mithra in his solar aspect as Sol Invictus ( Latin for “ Unconquered Sun ” ) .
The reason Mithra / Sol Invictus was born on December 25 was that in the Roman calendar of that day , that was the Winter Solstice , the 24 - hour period having the fewest number of daylight hours .
From that date the days get longer and the nights get shorter until the Summer Solstice .
Owing to imperfections in the Roman or Julian calendar , the solstice gradually shifted to December 21 , until corrections were made resulting in our present Gregorian calendar .
Christianity seems to have deliberately co-opted the birthday of Mithra as a way of occupying a rival ’s holiday , rather than this being the result of Jesus being a solar savior .
Joseph ’s confusion continues when he tries to tie Isis into the Annunciation narrative of Luke .
He says that an Annunciation scene from Luxor shows Isis being told by angelic beings she will bear Horus .
Actually , the panels from Luxor depict the mother of Hatshepsut being told she will bear the divine child .
Next , the god Amon - Ra consorts with Hatshepsut ’s mother .
Then the divine child ( Hatshepsut ) is adored by gods and mortals .
This is probably the source of Luke ’s Nativity .
Mary is told by the angel Gabriel she will bear the divine child .
The Holy Spirit overshadows her .
Then angels and mortals ( shepherds ) adore Jesus .
However , it has nothing to do with Isis .
It was part of the standard Egyptian royal myth that each Pharaoh was engendered by Amon Ra , taking his father ’s mortal form to have sexual relations with the Pharaoh ’s mother .
The reason Hatshepsut ( ruled 1498 –1483 BCE ) had to emphasize her divine origins is that , as a female , she was assumed to have ordinary mortal origins .
So there probably is an Egyptian origin to the Lucan Nativity , but it has nothing to do with Isis , Osiris or Horus .
Three Kings & Other Astrological Nonsense
Zeitgeist continues to find not only solar but astrological sources for the Christ myth .
The star followed by the wise men is Sirius , in the constellation Canis Major , which lines up with three bright stars on Orion ’s belt .
These stars are often called the “ three kings , ” hence the three kings following the star in the Nativity story .
Mary is a virgin because she represents the constellation Virgo , which is also referred to as the “ House of Bread , ” or , in Hebrew beth - lehem , or the town of Bethlehem , The death of Jesus by crucifixion represents the sun being in the Southern Cross , a constellation that in antiquity was visible from the Mediterranean .
Thus , the sun was , at its lowest point in the sky ( when it “ died ” ) “ crucified , ” in that it was ensnared in the Southern Cross .
Jesus rose from the dead at Easter because it was then , at the Vernal Equinox , that the sun conquered darkness .
Jesus had 12 disciples because they represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac .
His crown of thorns at the Crucifixion represents the rays of the sun emanating from his head .
This story , like most of Part I of Zeitgeist , is a pastiche of factoid , fiction and ingenious invention .
It also betrays a certain naïveté on the part of Peter Joseph in regard to his knowledge of the Bible .
This is obvious when he sees in the “ Three Kings ” of Orion ’s belt pointing at Sirius , the source of the magi following the star in the Nativity story of Matthew .
At this point , let me ask readers a question :
Without looking at a Bible , tell me how many wise men or kings followed the star to Bethlehem .
Most likely you answered “ Three . ”
After all , we ’ve all heard and sung the popular Christmas carol “ We Three Kings of Orient Are . ”
So were n’t there three kings ?
Let ’s look at the Bible , specifically at Matthew 2:1,2 :
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king , behold , wise men from the East came to Jerusalem , saying , “ Where is he who has been born king of the Jews ?
For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him . ”
Two things are readily apparent from this passage .
First , those who saw the star are wise men , not kings .
In the original Greek of the New Testament , what is translated as “ wise men ” is magi , that is , Zoroastrian holy men .
The Greek word magos is the source of our words mage , magic and magician .
Second , Matthew nowhere says how many magi came to Jerusalem .
So where did we ever get the idea there were three of them ?
Also , if they were actually following a star , it would have led them directly to Bethlehem .
The star does n’t actually lead the magi until they have been told by Herod ’s scribes to go to Bethlehem .
Only then does the following happen ( Mt. 2:9–11 ) :
When they had heard the king they went on their way , and lo , the star which they had seen in the East went before them , till it came to rest over the place where the child was .
When they saw the star , they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy ; and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother , and they fell down and worshipped him .
Then , opening their treasures they offered him gifts , gold and frankincense and myrrh .
This is odd .
One wonders why the star did n’t just lead the magi to Bethlehem right off .
This has led many to speculate that the “ star ” was n’t an actual star , but perhaps a conjunction of astrologically significant planets in one constellation or another .
It would be tedious to go into them here .
Suffice it to say that Joseph ’s “ three kings ” in the belt of Orion bear no relation to the actual myth in Matthew ’s account of the Nativity .
The only reason conventions of art and caroling gave us three wise men ( not kings ) is that the magi give Jesus three gifts : gold , frankincense and myrrh .
It is in these three gifts , along with the eastern origin of the magi , that we see the key to the actual myth in Matthew ’s Nativity , which is political .
Throughout the Mathean Nativity account , the gospel ’s author takes great pains to find fulfilled prophecies showing Jesus to be the messiah of the Davidic line of kings .
He is born in Bethlehem because that was David ’s home town , and Jesus must be born there to fulfill the prophecy in Micah 5:2 , which the chief priests and scribes quote to Herod when the magi ask where the baby is that is born to be king of the Jews ( Mt. 2:5 , 6 ) :
They [ the priests and scribes ] told him [ Herod ] , “ In Bethlehem of Judea ; for so it is written by the prophet : ‘ And you , O Bethlehem , in the land of Judah ,
are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah ;
for from you will come a ruler
who will govern my people Israel ’ ”
So Bethlehem ’s mythic associations have to do with Davidic kingship , not astrology .
The three gifts also reflect Davidic kingship , since the Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon rich and kingly gifts ( 1 Kings 10:10 ) .
These included a great quantity of gold and , by implication , since Sheba , or Saba was located in modern Yemen , at the southern end of the Red Sea , frankincense and myrrh .
Sheba , or Saba , in Yemen is at the southern end , the point of origin of an ancient caravan route that stretched from Yemen to Damascus called the “ Incense Route , ” since what was traded from the southern end of the Red Sea were two forms of incense , frankincense and myrrh .
Thus , the infant Jesus received from the magi the same gifts given to Solomon by the Queen of Sheba .
Other astrological fantasies in Zeitgeist regarding the Christ myth are that Mary is a virgin because she personifies the constellation Virgo , that the Crucifixion represents the sun in the constellation of the Southern Cross , that Easter is related to the sun ’s triumph over darkness at or shortly following the Vernal Equinox , that Jesus ’ 12 disciples represent the signs of the Zodiac , and that his crown of thorns represents solar rays emanating from his head .
The astrological associations of all of these elements are tenuous at best .
Certainly , the virgin birth and the elevation of the Virgin Mary in the Gospel of Luke reflects pagan influences on the Christ myth , which can be seen in the Lucan Nativity and which sharply contrast to the messianic / Davidic kingship motifs of Matthew .
As previously noted .
Luke ’s Nativity seems to be based on Egyptian panels from Luxor dating to the 18th dynasty and the reign of Queen Hatshepsut .
So Mary could relate to the constellation Virgo , but also took on the iconography of Isis
As to the sighting of Easter near the time of the Vernal Equinox , we must remember that the Passion is staged during Passover .
There is a complex layering here that is lost if we simply relegate Easter to a celebration of the Vernal Equinox .
The Christ myth relates not only to previous dying and rising gods , like Osiris and Dionysus , but as well to Jewish messianic , apocalyptic and historical myths .
Thus , situating Easter in the Passover season probably relates more to messianic myth than to the sun .
Passover itself was probably originally a festival of first fruits , that is , a seasonal , agricultural festival relating to rebirth .
However , Jewish seasonal festivals relating to a cyclic view of time were recast in messianic , apocalyptic terms as historical and related to a linear concept of time .
In the case of Jewish belief , I believe it ’s safe to say that the linear , historical view effectively eclipsed the original seasonal festival .
Since the Christian Passion and Resurrection narratives reintroduce a dying and rising god meme into the holiday , the layering of Easter becomes far more complex .
Easter blends apocalyptic messianism , emphasizing Christ ’s death and resurrection as the critical turning point in God ’s war with Satan , and portraying Jesus as the culmination of Israel ’s hopes and dreams , with the dying and rising god motif , and the promise to Christians that they , too , would transcend death .
It must also be remembered that the cult of Isis and Osiris , which spread through the Roman Empire about a century before the time of Jesus , was not entirely the same as the millennia old Egyptian fertility cult it had originally been .
Rather , it was , in all probability , Hellenized and showed some of the refinements of Greek philosophy .
This was , likewise , probably the case with the much younger cult of Dionysus , another dying and rising god .
Jesus having 12 disciples also relates more to Jewish messianism than to astrology .
The 12 disciples relate to the 12 tribes of Israel , which , though they no longer existed as political entities , were important genealogically to the extent that Paul could confidently claim to be of the tribe of Benjamin ( Romans 11:1 ) .
Actually , there were 13 tribes , 12 plus the priestly tribe of Levites .
Each tribe originally supported the Levitical priesthood and maintained the central shrine for one month a year .
The division of the tribes worshipping Yahweh into 12 divisions may well reflect influences of what was originally a lunar cult , but such influences had been subsumed by the apocalyptic , messianic monotheism of post - exilic Judaism well before the time of Christ .
Had the 12 disciples represented the signs of the Zodiac , as Joseph asserts , then we would expect to find the disciples individually given specific zodiacal characteristics in the canonical gospels .
Instead , most of the disciples are little more than names and lack any character whatsoever .
Jesus ’ crown of thorns , along with most of the specific details of the Passion — his being clothed in a purple robe and given a reed as a scepter , the mocking and scourging by the Roman troops , even his being put to death — were probably elements of the Zagmuku Festival , which the Jews brought back with them from Babylon after their captivity there ( 587–538 BCE ) .
Elements of this festival are to be found in the entirely fictional Book of Esther and the celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim .
This , by the way , is not to say that Jesus ’ crucifixion was not a real , historical event , merely that its details were heavily fictionalized in the process of dramatization and storytelling .
It is the historiscity of Jesus that will tell us whether the Crucifixion was real or merely symbolic of the sun descending into the constellation of the Southern Cross .
I will deal with that subject later .
The End of the Age
Zeitgeist continues its assertion of the astrological basis of Christianity and even of the Jewish Scriptures with the assertion that both Moses and Jesus based their words and actions on a belief in astrological ages of roughly 2,000 plus years dominated by a specific sign of the Zodiac .
According to this scheme the Age of Taurus ( the Bull ) was ending or had ended when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt and was being superceded by the Age of Aries ( the Ram ) .
This age was , in turn , superceded by the Age of Pisces , in which we live , but which is now winding down .
It will soon be followed by the Age of Aquarius , hence the song by the same name from the musical Hair .
Moses , Peter Joseph says , condemned worshipping the golden bull calf because it was a throwback to an earlier age .
The blowing of the shofar , specifically a ram ’s horn , and other symbols indicate that Judaism came , initially , out of the Age of Aries .
Since Christianity came into being at the beginning of the Age of Pisces , fish symbolism is particularly common in the New Testament .
Thus Jesus tells the fishermen he recruits ( Mark 1:17 ) , “ Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men . ”
Thus he feeds the multitude with loaves and fishes , and thus the fish is a Christian symbol .
There are also , according to Joseph , references in the Christian Scriptures to the coming Aquarian Age .
Jesus tells his disciples to follow a man bearing a jar of water ( i.e. Aquarius , the water bearer ) in Luke 22:10 :
He said to them , “ Behold , when you have entered the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you ; follow him into the house which he enters , and tell the householder , ‘ The Teacher says to you , Where is the guest room , where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’ ”
Finally , Jesus tells his disciples ( Mt. 28:20 ) referring to the Age of Pisces and its transition into the Age of Aquarius , “ I am with you always , to the end of the age . ”
So , was the fish imagery in the New Testament a reference to the Age of Pisces ?
When Jesus spoke of the “ end of the age , ” was he referring to the transition from the Piscean to Aquarian age some 2,000 plus years into the future ?
The answer to all these questions is , “ No . ”
Consider the antagonism against bull imagery implicit in Moses condemning the people ’s worship of the golden calf .
This Yahwistic prejudice seems to have evaporated by that time of the building of Solomon ’s Temple , as can be seen in this description of the “ molten sea , ” a huge vessel containing water that was one of the principle furnishings of the Temple ( 1 Kings 7:25 ) : “ It stood upon twelve oxen , three facing nth , three facing west , three facing south and three facing east ; the sea was set upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward . ”
Oxen also decorate the panels of ten stands made of bronze , along with lions and cherubim ( 1 Kings . 7:28 ) .
Yet , for all the rich imagery of the interior of Solomon ’s Temple , it is utterly devoid of any image of rams .
Thus , we must assume that the story of the golden calf in Exodus refers , as it would seem , to idolatry .
Fish certainly are common images in the New Testament .
Yet so are olive trees , fig trees , sheaves of grain , and , particularly , sheep and lambs .
In fact , lambs and lost sheep probably figure more prominently in the New Testament than do fish .
Does this mean that Jesus actually wanted to turn the clock back to the previous Age of Aries ?
Joseph would probably counter such an objection by pointing to the Christian fish symbol .
Does n’t this point to Christianity as the faith of the Piscean Age ?
The Christian fish symbol has been interpreted as referring back to the “ fishers of men ” phrase from Mark 1:17 and has also been seen as a vaginal symbol lying on its side .
However , it appears most likely that the Greek word for fish , ichthys , was an acronym for ( in Greek ) Iasos Christos Theos Yios Soter , or “ Jesus Christ , son of God , savior . ”
The assertion in Zeitgeist that when Jesus tells his disciples in Mt. 28:20 he will be with them until the end of the age , he is referring to a time roughly 2,000 years into the future is absurd considering the apocalyptic outlook of early Christianity .
Consider what Jesus has to say in Mark 8 : 38 –9:1 :
“ For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him will the Son of man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . ”
And he said to them , “ Truly I ay to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power . ”
Despite the efforts of Christian apologists to rationalize this as something other than a prediction of the end of the world in Jesus ’ own generation , there is little else to which it could refer .
The parallel verses in Matthew even throw in the Last Judgment ( Mt. 16 : 27 , 28 ) :
For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father , and then he will repay every man for what he has done .
Truly , I say to you , there are some standing here who will not tastes death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
Though there are no parallel verses to this in the Gospel of John , it also proclaims the imminent end of the world ( John. 5 : 28 , 29 ) :
Do not marvel at this , for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his [ Jesus ’ ] voice and come forth , those who have done good to the resurrection of life , and those who have done evil , to the resurrection of judgment .
Paul also proclaimed the end of the world in his generation in this passage from 1 Thessalonians ( 1 Thess . 4 : 15-17 ) :
For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord , that we , who are alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , shall not precede those who have fallen asleep [ i.e. died ] .
For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command , with the archangel ’s call , and with the sound of the trumpet of God And the dead in Christ will rise first ; then we who are alive , who are left , shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air ; and so we shall always be with the Lord .
These are but a few of the apocalyptic references salted throughout the New Testament .
However , lest anyone doubt that early Christians believed the world would end in their generation , consider what John of Patmos says at the opening of Revelation , that vivid and detailed description of the end of days ( Rev. 1:1 , 2 , emphasis added ) :
The revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants what must soon take place ; and he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John , who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ , even to all that he saw .
“ What must soon take place ’ ” cannot refer to the end of the Piscean Age some 2,000 years into the future any more than it can refer to a series of events triggered by Russia invading Israel in 1988 .
History vs. Myth
Again mixing facts with sloppy assumptions , Part I of Zeitgeist concludes with an assault on the historicity of Jesus , claming that , outside the New Testament , there is no indication that Jesus ever existed .
Joseph correctly points out that the biblical flood myth has its origins in material antedating the earliest sources of the Hebrew Scriptures .
He specifically cites the Epic of Gilgamesh .
However , he could just as well have cited the Sumerian flood hero Zuisudra , whose account greatly antedates the flood account in Gilgamesh .
Was there a real Jesus ?
While the historical evidence is meager , it does exist .
In his Antiquities of the Jews , book 20 , chapter 9 , item 1 , referring to the execution of James , Josephus refers to him as the brother of “ Jesus , who was called the Christ . ”
It is quite plain that Josephus did n’t see Jesus as the Christ ( Christos , the Greek word meaning “ anointed ” ) , he merely recorded that James ’ brother was the Jesus who had been called or was alleged to be the Christ .
Beyond this scrap , valuable though it is , we can imply the existence of a historical Jesus from the criteria of embarrassment and difficulty .
The criterion of embarrassment says that people do not make up embarrassing details about someone they wish to revere .
So , if they say such things about the person , they are probably true .
Now let ’s apply this to what the Roman historian Tacitus had to say about Jesus early in the second century .
Concerning rumors that had spread that Nero had deliberately set fire to the city of Rome , Tacitus says ( The Annals of Imperial Rome , Book 1 , Chapter 15 ) :
To suppress this rumor , Nero fabricated scapegoats — and punished with every refinement the notoriously depraved Christians ( as they were called ) .
Their originator , Christ , had been executed in Tiberius ’ reign by the governor of Judea , Pontius Pilatus .
But in spite of this temporary setback the deadly superstition had broken out afresh , not only in Judea ( where the mischief had started ) but even in Rome .
All degraded and shameful practices collect and flourish in the capitol .
That Tacitus is obviously a hostile witness makes it much more likely that he accepted Jesus as a real person .
Had he reason to suspect he was nothing more than a fabrication , Tacitus would certainly have said so .
That author ’s claim that Jesus had been executed by Pontius Pilate could only have come from one of two possible sources : Either Tacitus knew this to be true from extant imperial records or he was repeating what Christians themselves had said of Jesus .
Were Jesus a mythical character they had invented , they certainly would n’t have gone out of their way to invent his being a criminal who had been executed .
In like manner , people do not go out of their way to invent difficulties for a character they have invented .
It is clear from the Nativity narratives of the gospels of Matthew and Luke that they were faced with having to explain why Jesus grew up in Galilee if he was born in Bethlehem .
Both gospels had to invent rather convoluted means to get Jesus born in Bethlehem in accordance with the messianic prophecy in Micah 5:2 , then get him moved to Nazareth .
Clearly they were stuck with a real person known to have come from Galilee , when he should have come from Bethlehem .
Had they been making Jesus up out of whole cloth , they would simply have said he came from Bethlehem : end of story , no complications .
So the evidence for Jesus as a real , historical personage , though meager , is solid .
A Roman Plot ?
Considering that Part II of Zeitgeist asserts that the destruction of the World Trade Center was a conspiracy on the part of the powers that be , and that Part III is an attack on the Federal Reserve Board and income tax as unconstitutional plots devised by hidden powers bent on reducing all of us to poverty , one might wonder why Peter Joseph even bothered to open his film with an attack on Jesus and Christianity .
Summing up at the end of Part I , Joseph asserts that Christianity was , in fact , developed by the Romans as a means of social control .
He cites the Council of Nicaea in 325 as the beginning of this social control .
So this is the connection between Part I and the rest of the film :
Everything you ’ve ever believed to be true is all a pack of lies foisted on you by the secret manipulators who really run things .
They faked the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon to manipulate us into a war .
They are undermining our financial and other freedoms through manipulation of our money and — guess what ?! — they ’ve been at it since the creation of Christianity , back in the time of the Roman Empire !
Zeitgeist is The Da Vinci Code on steroids .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- A BBC expedition exploring inside the crater of an extinct volcano in Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) has discovered a lost world of dozens of weird new species and rare animals , including new frogs , a giant rat , many new insects and spiders , giant caterpillars , and a new bat species .
Steve Greenwood , producer of " Lost Land of the Volcano " said the expedition to Mount Bosavi for the series follows on from expeditions to remote rainforests in Borneo for " Expedition Borneo " and Guyana for " Lost Land of the Jaguar " .
The Mount Bosavi crater is 2.5 miles wide and over 3,300 feet high , and is located in the remote and mountainous southern highlands of Papua New Guinea .
The mountain and its pristine , extinct crater are so inaccessible that even the few people in the Kasua tribe who live in nearby villages rarely enter the area .
One of the village elders told Greenwood , " if you fall when climbing in , no one will ever find your body . "
The expedition , from 30 January to 4 March 2009 , included two directors , two cameramen , two sound recordists , support staff , a medical expert , expert tree climbers and cavers , trackers from the Kasua tribe , and several scientists , led by Professor George McGavin , an Oxford University Research Lecturer and Assistant Curator of Entomology in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History .
The number of new species found cannot be confirmed until the biologists have finished evaluating the finds , but they believe there may be up to 40 previously undescribed species .
This includes 20 new species of insects and spiders , 16 species of frogs , a new bat , and at least three fish species .
Many of the new species discovered are believed to exist only in the Mount Bosavi crater .
Some of the weird animals they discovered included a fish that uses its swim bladder to make grunting sounds , a frog with fangs , a camouflaged gecko , fantastic spiders , a rat almost three feet long , and the rare Doria 's tree kangaroo .
The animals had no fear of the expedition team , suggesting they had not encountered people before because the huge crater 's inaccessibility had effectively excluded them .
One of the expedition scientists , Dr Kristofer Helgen from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History , said the giant rat they found was one of the largest in the world .
It was first spotted at an elevation of over 3,300 ft by an infrared camera trap set up in the forest by cameraman Gordon Buchanan , and this was followed by finding a live specimen .
The captured rat measured 32 inches from the tip of the tail to the nose , and weighed about 3.3 pounds .
The scientists have tentatively named the animal the Bosavi woolly rat , and think it belongs to the genus Mallomys , which includes several other giant rats .
The television series on this amazing crater and its lost world of strange animals is called " The Lost Land of the Volcano " and premieres on Britain 's BBC1 on 8 September 2009 .

Facebook just released a list of its top status trends for 2009 .
The list features mainly mundane topics such as Farmville , Michael Jackson , and Lady Gaga .
It may also , however , need to include divorce .
Facebook is cited in one out of every five divorce petitions , according to some new research published this week .
Apparently , the ability to " poke " with such ease is simply too tempting to resist .
Facebook Status : Divorced
The research comes by way of a British divorce center called Divorce - Online ( a convenient concept , no ? ) .
According to the Telegraph , the center claims about 20 percent of all divorce documents include some type of reference to Facebook .
The root of the problem should come as no surprise :
Too many spouses are using the social network for flirting -- or more .
" The most common reason seemed to be people having inappropriate sexual chats with people they were not supposed to , " Mark Keenan , Divorce - Online 's managing director , is quoted as saying .
The Telegraph suggests the sudden popularity of sites such as Facebook is somehow encouraging people to cheat on their spouses .
My response ?
Bollocks .
Causal Confusion
It does n't take a genius to figure out that the problem is n't actually Facebook -- the problem is faithless spouses too stupid to realize they 're leaving an electronic trail .
More and more people may be discovering their significant other 's indiscretions via social networks , but there 's no reason to believe that one is causing the other .
Cheating is cheating ; Facebook is just a medium ( albeit one that creates an easily findable path of breadcrumbs ) .
Truth is , the Internet 's not always as far of a leap from reality as it sometimes seems .
A recent Pew study found that social networks are n't making us any more socially maladjusted than we already were .
And despite the fact that some of us are social network narcissists ( are you ? ) , the majority of us have Facebook profiles that accurately reflect our real - life personalities .
So , yes , if we 're cheating slimeballs in the regular world , we 'll also be cheating slimeballs in the virtual world .
Otherwise , we 're probably fine .
With all of that said , I 'm sure it 's only a matter of time until someone sues Facebook for " forcing them " to cyber - copulate with strangers .
And if and when that happens , you 'd better believe I 'll be first in line to mock the plaintiff .

Between thought and expression
Comparing computer languages can usually be interesting , sometimes informative , often amusing and in lots of cases just damn annoying !
Still this recent Hacker News post about Python vs Clojure did catch my eye .
Despite the fact the author of the blog post had pulled the Python code from answers to Project Euler the pythonista ’s quite correctly cried foul because it was n’t well written idiomatic python example and so was an unfair comparison .
There ’s a lot of code out there posted on those intertubes over the years .
However languages and practises evolve but unfortunately intertube posts can remain set in stone !
Perl is often weighed down by its past history on the intertubes .
One good way forward is just to produce more Modern Perl posts .
Anyway i digress , so moving on lets take a look at the Euler 4 – Finding Palindroms .
This was the Clojure example that was put forward in the blog post :
( reduce max ( filter #( let [s ( str % ) ] ( = ( seq s ) ( reverse s ) ) ) ( for [x ( range 100 1000 ) y ( range 100 1000 ) ] (* x y ) ) ) )
Now in reply to this a much more idiomatic python example was provided :
print max(s for s in ( x * y for x in range ( 111 , 1000 ) for y in range ( x , 1000 ) ) if list ( str (s ) ) == list ( reversed ( str ( s ) ) ) )
This uses Python ’s list comprehension .
Definitely a very powerful construct .
However i do find i get lost very quickly when trying to follow long nested comprehension ’s 😦
In this same Python post there is also mention of a twitter post by Yukihiro Matz , the creator of Ruby .
Matz provided the following Ruby example :
p [ *100..1000 ] .product ( [ * 100.. 1000 ] ) .
map{|x , y| x*y}.select{|s|s=s.to_s ; s==s.reverse}.max
Despite being formatted for twitter ( ie. one line ) i found it easy to follow through the logic .
Ruby & Python are not the only languages that can produce an elegant solution !
So not to be out done here is a Perl example .
In fact its the exact same code repeated three times but formatted differently :
use Modern :: Perl ; use List :: Util q( max ) ; # twitter one liner say max grep { $ _ eq reverse $ _ } map { my $ x = $ _ ; map { $ x * $ _ } 100.. 1000 } 100..1000 ; # again in lispy style format say max grep { $ _ eq reverse $ _ } map { my $ x = $ _ ; map { $ x * $ _ } 100..1000 ; } 100..1000 ; # and finally in my preferred more perlish alignment say max grep { $ _ eq reverse $ _ } map { my $ x = $ _ ; map { $ x * $ _ } 100.. 1000 ; } 100.. 1000 ;
The perl code speaks for itself .. its wonderfully clear and succinct .
Also its fast , each version runs in under a second on my machine !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Construction of new homes in the United States hit a six month low in October , providing more evidence of the economy ’s sluggish recovery , while a surge in the cost of new and used vehicles lifted consumer prices .
The data came a day after a report showed U.S. industrial output barely budged last month , suggesting the recovery stalled somewhat after a growth spurt in the third quarter .
Analysts said slow healing in the housing market , relatively benign inflation and excess slack in the economy meant the Federal Reserve would be able to honor its commitment to keep interest rates near zero for an extended period .
“ It ’s going to be a slow , uneven recovery .
There has been a bit of a pause in the last month or so .
We have a low growth situation here , but I would n’t say it ’s big enough to return to recession , ” said Nick Kalivas , vice president of financial research at MF Global in Chicago .
The Commerce Department said housing starts dropped 10.6 percent to an annual rate of 529,000 units , the lowest since April .
It was the biggest decline in 10 months .
Financial markets had expected starts to rise to a 600,000 units pace .
U.S. stocks fell on the surprise drop , ending three days of gains that had hoisted the major indexes to 13 - month highs .
Stocks ended just off their 2009 highs .
Separately , the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month as the cost of new vehicles rose by the most in more than 28 years .
The increase in consumer prices was a touch above market expectations .
However , widespread price pressures were absent and analysts attributed the rise in vehicle prices to the government ’s now expired “ cash for clunkers ” program , which had depressed auto prices by offering discounts .
Given weak auto sales , it was unlikely the rise in vehicle prices would be maintained in the months ahead , they said .
U.S. government bond prices slipped on the inflation data .
Core consumer prices , which exclude food and energy costs , rose 0.2 percent last month , the same as in September .
Over the past 12 months , core prices are up 1.7 percent , higher than in September but still well below the year - earlier measure .
“ We continue to expect weaker inflation in 2010 as a result of the substantial amount of spare capacity in the economy , ” said Anna Piretti , an economist at BNP Paribas in New York .
Construction of new homes in the United States hit a six month low in October , providing more evidence of the economy 's sluggish recovery , while a surge in the cost of new and used vehicles lifted consumer prices .

CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DROPS
Groundbreaking for single - family homes fell 6.8 percent last month to an annual rate of 476,000 units , the lowest since May .
Starts for the volatile multifamily segment tumbled 34.6 percent to a 53,000 annual pace , extending September ’s slide .
High vacancy rates , especially in the multi-family segment , and tight credit will slow building projects for a while , analysts said .
The slump in activity is a blow to the housing market , which had shown signs of stabilization after a three - year slump .
Homebuilding contributed to economic growth in the July - September period for the first time since 2005 .
Some analysts said the Fed may even need to step in with fresh support for the economy .
“ Amid disappointing housing numbers , it would certainly be no surprise if the Fed decides to extend its purchases of mortgage - backed securities beyond the first quarter of 2010 in order to support the housing market , ” said Harm Bandholz , an economist at UniCredit Markets and Investment Banking .
Driven by government stimulus , the U.S. economy expanded in the third quarter after four straight quarters of decline , likely breaking the back of the recession .
President Barack Obama told Fox News in Beijing on Wednesday it was important to contain the nation ’s budget deficits , warning if too much debt piled up , it could lead to a double - dip recession .
Still , he repeated that his administration was considering ways to accelerate economic growth , with tax measures among the options to give companies incentives to hire .
The recovery in the housing market has been led by a popular $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time buyers .
It had been due to expire this month , but has since been extended and expanded .
In October , it was unclear whether the incentive would be extended and this could have contributed to the slide in construction activity last month .
New building permits , which give a sense of future construction activity , fell 4 percent in October to a 552,000 unit annual rate .

The inventory of homes under construction touched a record low 560,000 units , while the number of permits authorized but not yet started tumbled to an all - time low of 93,900 units .
On the eve of U.S. President Barack Obama ’s visit to China , a major Chinese official has criticized U.S. monetary policy in unusually harsh language .
Liu Mingkang , China Banking Regulatory Commission chairman said the zero interest rate policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve posed a “ new systemic risk . ”
Liu , using language reminiscent of warnings by NYU economist Nouriel Roubini and speaking at a financial forum in China ’s capital Beijing , said :
This situation has already encouraged a huge dollar carry trade and had a massive impact on global asset prices …
It is boosting speculative investment in stock and property markets and will pose new , insurmountable risks to the global recovery and , particularly , to the recovery in emerging markets .
In my view , this is pure political posturing by the Chinese in order to defuse any U.S. criticisms of Beijing ’s currency peg .
Call it a pre-emptive strike .
The U.S. has seen the unemployment rate rise to 10.2 % and the trade deficit rise quite dramatically as well .
Many are blaming the Chinese and their currency peg to the U.S. dollar .
When Barack Obama visits China this week , the Chinese expect him to focus on the yuan dollar peg .
His administration will find it increasingly difficult to hold protectionist pressures at bay given the yuan ’s firm peg to the U.S. dollar even while the dollar has plummeted .
To prevent the U.S. from successfully painting the Chinese peg as the sole major risk to the global economic recovery , the Chinese must therefore point to the destabilizing effects from measures taken by the U.S. to reflate its domestic economy .
The Chinese have shown success thus far .
Last week , Tim Geithner penned an Op - Ed in the Wall Street Journal along with the Finance Ministers of Indonesia and Singapore which pointed a critical finger at China by asking for “ market - oriented exchange rates . ”
Yet when the APEC ( Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation ) summit in Singapore ended that same language was cut from the final commiunique .
On the other hand , there has been little change in the prospects of a revaluation of the yuan peg .
Reuters reports :
Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Chen Jian on Sunday played down talk of a shift in the central bank ’s currency policy as well as mounting expectations of a rise in the yuan ’s exchange rate .
Speculation that China might let the yuan resume its climb after a 16 - month pause swirled after a change last Wednesday in the long - standing wording used by the People ’s Bank of China to describe its currency stance .
In its third quarter monetary policy report , the central bank failed to refer to keeping the yuan " basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level " when discussing the outlook for the exchange rate .
Asked whether the PBOC was heralding a return to the gradual appreciation of the yuan against the dollar seen from July 2005 - July 2008 , Chen told Reuters : " I do n’t think the central bank meant to say that . "
And all indications suggest that we are now returning to the same unbalanced pre-crisis growth model – but with the global economy in a considerably more fragile state .
In this climate , the issues of the yuan currency peg and low interest rates in the U.S. will continue to be front and center for some time to come .
LOS ANGELES - NASA ’s latest space telescope will scan the sky in search of never - before - seen asteroids , comets , stars , and galaxies , with one of its main tasks to catalog objects posing a danger to earth .
The sky - mapping WISE , or Wide - Field Infrared Survey Explorer , is scheduled to launch no earlier than before dawn Friday from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California .
If all goes as planned , WISE will orbit some 325 miles above the earth and produce the most detailed map yet of the cosmos .
It is designed to detect objects that give off infrared light or heat .
Infrared light is ideal for uncovering dusty , cold , and distant objects that often ca n’t be seen by optical telescopes .
The mission is expected to find millions of hard - to - see objects , said its principal investigator , Edward Wright of the University of California at Los Angeles .
“ It ’s really a mission to survey everything that ’s out there , ’’ Wright said .
“ What we ’re trying to do is make a map of the universe . ’’
Scientists estimate it will take six months for WISE to peruse the entire sky .
The spacecraft will circle the earth 15 times a day and take about 7,500 images a day in four infrared wavelengths .
WISE will catalog the locations and sizes of near - earth objects such as asteroids and comets that could threaten the planet .
The spacecraft will also look for brown dwarfs , gaseous balls that never quite gathered enough mass to set off the nuclear fires that cause stars to shine .
Also of interest are galaxies that shine with the brilliance of more than a trillion suns .
The $ 320 million mission should help current and future spacecraft zero in on the most interesting objects for detailed studies .
WISE will join two infrared space telescopes in orbit - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ’s Spitzer Space Telescope and the European Space Agency ’s Herschel Space Observatory .

Jack Horner is a renowned director of porn , all his movies financed by " Colonel " James .
He has his regular stable of cast and crew , most who have issues in their lives .
They include : actress Amber Waves , who acts as the mother figure to the group in the absence of being a real mother to her biological son , about who she has told no one in her porn circle ; actor Reed Rothchild , who wants to live up to his on - screen alpha male status ; actor Buck Swope , who works as a stereo salesman on the side and whose country & western style seems to be problematic in getting ahead ; actress Rollergirl , a high school drop - out who never takes off her skates ; and assistant director " Little " Bill , whose marriage is threatened by his wife being both a nymphomaniac and an exhibitionist .
Their collective lives are punctuated by excess in everything , whether it be sex , cocaine use , or the need to amass flashy material possessions .
Into their lives comes Eddie Adams , a seventeen year old high school dropout from a dysfunctional family in Torrance .
Eddie , who renames himself Dirk Diggler , is Jack 's latest discovery , and whose success in the industry is largely predicated on being well - endowed .
Because of the validation he receives for the first time in his life , Dirk is easy prey to be sucked into the excesses of the group .
Although largely an innocent beyond the few dollars previously earned here and there by showing his penis to anyone who would pay , Dirk also changes as a person as he displays more and more bravado in relation to the amount of validation he receives .
The next few years lead to changes in the group , not only because of changes in technology , namely the advent of video , but as the excesses in their lives start to take their toll , and as their association with the business may affect what their post - porn life will look like .

The number of marijuana smokers in the world has grown to more than 160 million people , a report released yesterday shows , which has Canadian advocates renewing calls for legalization of the drug .
An Australian study , citing United Nations data from 2006 and published in the journal Lancet , found that about 166 million people aged 15 - 64 -- or an estimated one in 25 in that age range -- reported using cannabis .
That 's up from about 159 million people in 2005 .
" It 's not going away .
So should one in 25 people be criminalized for smoking pot ? " asked Eugene Oscapella , an Ottawa professor and spokesman for the Canadian Foundation For Drug Policy .
It is urging Ottawa to allow people to grow their own and tax sales .

This is just sad .
Counter Culture : This Saturday , on Halloween , Sears ( SHLD ) is launching a campaign called “ Black Friday Now , ” with “ doorbuster ” deals on Christmas trees , work boots , diamond - stud earrings and other select items .
The deals will take place every Saturday until Christmas .
The retailer is saying that the move is a response to customers wanting deep - discount deals before the traditional Black Friday , which falls on the day after Thanksgiving .
But we ’re thinking it ’s more of a move to combat Sears ’ dismal sales results .
Suffice to say , this year , the war for holiday shoppers is going completely nuclear .
Wal - Mart ( WMT ) is going to cut prices like crazy .
Toys 'r '
Us is opening hundreds and hundreds of extra " pop up " stores , so that you wo n't be able to turn around without seeing one .
Awesome news for consumers .
Devastating for profits and margins .
Public mistrust of the United States also stems from regional issues , specifically policies concerning India .
I know it is the conventional wisdom in Washington that my nation is obsessed with India .
But even to those of us who are striving toward accommodation and peace , the long history and the unresolved situation in Kashmir give Pakistanis reason to be concerned about our neighbor to the east .
Just as the Israeli - Palestinian dispute cannot be resolved without accommodating the Palestinian people , there cannot be permanent regional peace in South Asia without addressing Kashmir .
The recent upset in Pakistan over the Kerry - Lugar legislation , which President Obama signed into law and which requires the secretary of state to report to Congress on military and civil progress in Pakistan , shows how sensitive many here are to what they see as unfair treatment by the United States .
It would be helpful if the United States , at some point , would scrutinize India in a similar fashion and acknowledge that it has from time to time played a destabilizing role in the region .
The perceived rhetorical one - sidedness of American policy often fuels the conspiracy theories that abound here  theories that blame the West for all of our ills .
Pakistan ’s elected democratic leadership is itself a victim of some of these conspiracy theories , but our American partners must understand their origins and work with us to turn public opinion around .
Although we certainly appreciate America ’s $ 7.5 billion pledge over the next five years for nonmilitary projects in Pakistan , this long - term commitment must be complemented by short - term policies that demonstrate American neutrality and willingness to help India and Pakistan overcome their mutual distrust .
It could start by stepping up its efforts to mediate the Kashmir dispute .
In recent days , I have thought often of something my wife , Benazir , wrote in the days before her death : “ It is so much easier to blame others for our problems than to accept responsibility ourselves . ”
Benazir added that conspiracy theories and “ toxic rhetoric ” were “ an opiate that keeps Muslims angry against external enemies and allows them to pay little attention to the internal causes of intellectual and economic decline . ”
The free world stands with President Obama in the effort to defeat the extremism that threatens us all .
Pakistanis are on the frontlines in this battle .
But we need help .
We need the support of our allies in war but also to help build a new Pakistan that promises a meaningful future to our children .
We are not looking for  and indeed reject  dependency .
We do n’t need or want ( nor would we accept ) foreign troops to defeat the insurgency , and we seek trade more than aid from you in the future .
It is an economically viable and socially robust democratic Pakistan that will be the most effective long - term weapon against terrorism , extremism and fanaticism .
This is the necessary endgame .
And this is how history will judge victory .

Following on the heels of bird flu and swine flu , there are now reports from the Netherlands of an outbreak of goat flu .
Online news sources report that up to 2,300 people have been infected by goat flu and that six individuals have died of the disease .
Goat flu , also known as Q fever or Q flu , affects both goats and sheep .
It is caused by bacteria called Coxiella burnetii , which are released when pregnant goats or sheep experience a spontaneous abortion .
The bacteria spread very easily according to experts .

The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed that the virus has been detected at 55 to 350 Dutch farms , with the most affected areas being the cities of Eindhoven and Tilburg .
According to the Dutch News , agriculture ministers announced on Wednesday afternoon at a news conference that they will begin culling herds of goats .
The unofficial number of animals to be killed is between 15,000 and 20,000 , mainly goats , to help prevent further spread of the disease .
All infected sheep and goats that have been vaccinated will be slaughtered , as will all pregnant goats and sheep on farms where the disease has been identified .
Symptoms of goat flu include severe headache , chills , perspiration , aching muscles , diarrhea , slow pulse , and general illness .
The acute version of the disease lasts for up to 14 days , but individuals who get a chronic type may have the disease for up to two years .
In the chronic version , fatigue is the main symptom .
The disease can also cause lung and heart problems .
All of the six individuals who died of goat flu had other health problems .
At this point , there are no recorded cases of transmission of goat flu infection from person to person .
A spokesperson from the public health institute RIVM , Roel Coutinho , told Trouw that the goat flu epidemic may be the result of an aggressive goat farming initiative in the Netherlands .
In 1995 , there were 7,600 goats in the country , but today there are more than 350,000 .
Unfortunately , the flu epidemic is about to change those numbers significantly .

You have heard , probably , about how Connecticut Senator Joe " Wallace Wimple " Lieberman inserted himself into the health care debate by announcing that he'd join a Republican filibuster against Harry Reid 's bill .
But no one has explained why !
Back when establishment Democrats ( like Obama ! ) were trying to convince us loony internet liberals not to campaign against Joe Lieberman , you heard a lot about how Lieberman is only a conservative on foreign policy , and not domestic issues .
( How his full - throated support for any bombing campaign against any Muslims anywhere in the world is supposed to be not as big a deal as the fact that he does n't want to publicly execute gays or whatever has always been beyond us , but that is what we were told . )
Now he 's pissed that distinction away .
We all know that Vinegar Joe Lieberman is a sanctimonious , thin - skinned , self - satisfied monster .
And a pious , amoral scumbag .
And a narcissistic , deluded underminer who represents everything that is wrong with the United States Senate .
And a war - mongering , concern - trolling religious zealot .
And , generally , a bastard .
And probably a racist .
But why would this weasel - human hybrid who is actually literally slowly receding into his own asshole a little bit every day suddenly pipe up on health care reform with a position at odds with most Connecticut residents and a vast majority of the Democrats he claims to represent ?
Because no one had been paying attention to him !
( And also because he is owned by the various insurance companies of Connecticut .
Like he is literally Aetna 's personal offensive Jeff Dunham puppet .
Well , they have to share him with AIPAC . )
This is the thing , Joe .
The opt - out public option is a conservative compromise .
It is a compromise from a non -opt - out public option , which is a compromise from a non -opt - out public option tied to Medicare rates , which is a compromise from a non -opt - out public option tied to Medicare rates and open to everyone , which is a compromise from single - payer .
You would like a further compromise , to " no health care reform , at all , unless the Democrats all kneel down and blow me , as I will demand they do whenever they might need my vote , from now until I finally decide to caucus with the Republicans , which will only happen if the Republicans take the majority and the Democrats stop blowing me periodically . "
And , obviously , his literal , stated objections to the bill are not based in any way on reality .
So the question basically is , what is his end - game here ?
What the fuck is he doing ?
Whether Joe Lieberman will run for reelection in 2012 is currently a mystery .
He has $ 1.4 million in the bank , which is a lot , but not as much as he had in 2006 .
He also is polling rather terribly in Connecticut , where Democrats and independents both prefer real Democrats .
He could run as a real Republican , but , as we said , those independent voters he needs to win do not like him , at the moment .
So our " what is Joe Lieberman doing " possibilities are :
He is just following the golden path of his own of self - delusion , thinking he will be remembered as a mavericky hero who bucked the status quo once he retires in 2012 .
He 's going all - in as a Republican in the desperate hope that a 2012 GOP landslide will win him one more term .
He is just trying to sink health care completely for his insurance company friends , who will give him a lucrative post - Senate job .
He is just trying to force Harry Reid to pay him fealty once again , because it makes him feel nice .
He is just a prick .
Weirdly , Lieberman said he'd vote to bring the bill to the floor , and then he 'd support a GOP filibuster .
A GOP filibuster is decidedly not a sure thing , though it certainly moves one step closer to a sure thing every time Joe Lieberman opens his mouth .
Christ , what an asshole .
Pressing to begin the Senate ’s landmark floor debate on healthcare legislation this week -- and to finish by the end of the year -- Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) is considering new ways to fund the bill by raising the payroll taxes that upper - income workers pay for Medicare .
Reid is studying the idea , senior Democratic aides say , because of criticism of a plan approved by the Senate Finance Committee that would impose new taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive healthcare plans .
But Reid is meeting resistance from centrist Democrats who believe the tax on expensive insurance plans could rein in the growth of health costs overall , while a payroll tax hike would not .
The competing tax proposals pose the most momentous decision facing Reid as he writes the version of the health bill that he will take to the Senate floor .

That work is being done in private deliberations that are arguably the most important and least visible stage of the legislative process so far .
Indeed , the Medicare tax increase has not been included in either of the two bills approved by the Senate ’s finance and health committees , which Reid is trying to meld into a single measure .
By Friday , Reid hopes to hold a crucial procedural vote on a motion to formally bring the bill to the floor for debate .
Sixty votes will be required to overcome Republican efforts to block it with a filibuster .

The House this month passed a $ 1 - trillion version of the healthcare bill , which included a surtax on individuals earning more than $ 500,000 a year .
That idea is not well received in the more conservative Senate , where the Finance Committee instead approved a 40 % excise tax on insurance companies that offer “ Cadillac ” health plans that cost more than $ 8,000 for individuals .
Labor unions and other critics say the Cadillac tax would hit too many middle - income consumers whose health premiums are high because they live in high - cost areas , not because the plans offer luxury benefits .
Reid , who is facing a tough reelection campaign with the strong backing of organized labor , is exploring ways to scale back the Cadillac tax .
He is considering the Medicare payroll tax hike to make up for the revenue that would be lost if the Cadillac tax applied to fewer plans .

Under the current system of financing the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund , employers and employees pay a tax of 1.45 % on wages .
Reid is reportedly considering increasing the rate about half a percentage point for workers earning more than $ 250,000 a year .
Some Democrats and analysts see the proposals as a way to offset the cost of the healthcare bill , shore up the Medicare trust fund -- and keep the burden of both efforts on upper - income people .
Another approach under consideration would expand the tax to cover unearned income , such as capital gains , not just wages .

The idea of raising payroll taxes on employers as well as employees may be a tough sell in the current recession .
And the plan is meeting resistance from Democrats who worry that it would do nothing to help reduce the growth of healthcare costs -- a major aim of the overhaul effort .
The Cadillac tax , by contrast , might help control the growth of health costs by discouraging insurers and employers from offering lavish health plans , they say .
“ If you really want to change policy , you discourage taxpayer subsidies for Cadillac , Mercedes and Ferrari plans , ” said Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , a member of the Finance Committee .

By breaking the human genome into millions of pieces and reverse - engineering their arrangement , researchers have produced the highest - resolution picture ever of the genome 's three - dimensional structure .
The picture is one of mind - blowing fractal glory , and the technique could help scientists investigate how the very shape of the genome , and not just its DNA content , affects human development and disease .
" It 's become clear that the spatial organization of chromosomes is critical for regulating the genome , " said study co-author Job Dekker , a molecular biologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School .
" This opens up new aspects of gene regulation that were n't open to investigation before .
It 's going to lead to a lot of new questions . "
As depicted in basic biology textbooks and the public imagination , the human genome is packaged in bundles of DNA and protein on 23 chromosomes , arrayed in a neatly X - shaped form inside each cell nucleus .
But that 's only true during the fleeting few moments when cells are poised to divide .
The rest of the time , those chromosomes exist in a dense and ever - shifting clump .
Of course their constituent DNA strings are clumped , too :
If the genome could be laid out end - to - end , it'd be six feet long .
For decades , some cell biologists suspected that the genome 's compression was n't just an efficient storage mechanism , but linked to the very function and interaction of its genes .
But this was n't easy to study :
Sequencing the genome destroys its shape , and electron microscopes can barely penetrate its active surface .
Though its constituent parts are known , the genome 's true shape has been a mystery .
In April , a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences linked patterns of gene activation to their physical proximity on chromosomes .
It still provided the most persuasive evidence to date that genome shape matters , even though the researchers ' chromosome map was relatively low - resolution .
The topography described in the latest research , published Thursday in Science , is far more detailed .
" It 's going to change the way that people study chromosomes .
It will open up the black box .
We did n't know the internal organization .
Now we can look at it in high resolution , try to link that structure to the activity of genes , and see how that structure changes in cells and over time , " said Dekker .
To determine genome structure without being able to directly see it , the researchers first soaked cell nuclei in formaldehyde , which interacts with DNA like glue .
The formaldehyde stuck together genes that are distant from each other in linear genomic sequences , but adjacent to each other in actual three - dimensional genomic space .
The researchers then added a chemical that dissolved the gene - by - gene linear sequence bonds , but left the formaldehyde links intact .
The result was a pool of paired genes , something like a frozen ball of noodles that had been sliced into a million fragmentary layers and mixed .
By studying the pairs , the researchers could tell which genes had been near each other in the original genome .
With the aid of software that cross-referenced the gene pairs with their known sequences on the genome , they assembled a digital sculpture of the genome .
And what a marvelous sculpture it is .
" There 's no knots .
It 's totally unentangled .
It 's like an incredibly dense noodle ball , but you can pull out some of the noodles and put them back in , without disturbing the structure at all , " said Harvard University computational biologist Erez Lieberman - Aiden , also a study co-author .
In mathematical terms , the pieces of the genome are folded into something similar to a Hilbert curve , one of a family of shapes that can fill a two - dimensional space without ever overlapping — and then do the same trick in three dimensions .
How evolution arrived at this solution to the challenge of genome storage is unknown .
It might be an intrinsic property of chromatin , the DNA - and - protein mix from which chromosomes are made .
But whatever the origin , it 's more than mathematically elegant .
The researchers also found that chromosomes have two regions , one for active genes and another for inactive genes , and the unentangled curvatures allow genes to be moved easily between them .
Lieberman - Aiden likened the configuration to the compressed rows of mechanized bookshelves found in large libraries .
" They 're like stacks , side - by - side and on top of each other , with no space between them .
And when the genome wants to use a bunch of genes , it opens up the stack .
But not only does it open the stack , it moves it to a new section of the library , " he said .
The segregation of active and inactive genes adds to evidence that genome structure affects gene function .
" It 's a great description of the structure of the nucleus , and if you put that on top of what we did , it forms the big picture , " said Steven Kosak , a Northwestern University cell biologist and co-author of the April PNAS paper that linked rough outlines of chromosome arrangement to gene activation .
Whereas that study only looked at a few chromosomes , the Science paper " looks at fine resolution over the whole genome , " said Kosak .
" Now you can produce these genome maps , and superimpose them with genome - wide analyses of gene expression .
You can really start asking how changes in spatial organization relate to changes in genes turning on and off , " said Tom Misteli , a National Cancer Institute cell biologist who studies how glitches in chromosome structure may turn cells cancerous .
Neither Misteli nor Kosak were involved in the Science study .
Connecting genome shape to gene function could also help explain the connection between genes and disease , which remain largely unexplained by traditional , sequence - focused genomics .
" It 's perfectly reasonable and almost inevitable that the 3 - D structure of DNA is going to influence how it functions , " said Teri Manolio , director of the National Human Genome Research Institute 's Office of Population Genomics .
Researchers also want to study how genome shape is altered .
That appears to happen constantly during the transition from stem cell to adult cell , and then during cell function .
" How much variation is there in structure across cell types ?
What controls it ?
Exactly how important is it ?
We do n't know , " said Dekker .
" This is a new area of science . "

Brandon Keim's Twitter stream and reportorial outtakes ; Wired Science on Twitter .
Brandon is currently working on a book about ecosystem and planetary tipping points .
The state Legislature is quietly seeking to block a steep cut in lawmakers ’ salary and perks .
Executives of the Assembly and Senate have asked the state attorney general to determine whether the scheduled 18 % pay reduction and additional 18 % cuts to living expenses and car allowances are illegal .
The lowered benefits are due to kick in next month , while base pay is set to be slashed from $ 116,000 to $ 95,000 , starting with lawmakers elected starting year .
Senate Secretary Greg Schmidt , who co-signed the letter requesting the legal opinion , said the Legislature ’s top attorney has said the citizens commission that ordered the reductions lacked the power to cut the per diem and car allowances .
“ We want to make sure they are legal actions , ” Schmidt said .
“ If the compensation commission thinks the action is OK and the legislative counsel says it ’s not , we need to go to a third party . ”

Charles Murray , the Los Angeles businessman who is chairman of the Citizens Compensation Commission , said the panel has a legal opinion from an attorney at UC Hastings College of Law that says the panel acted within its authority .
Murray also cited a narrow legal opinion by the attorney general ’s office in June that indicated that the panel could not cut pay for sitting legislators but that it appears to have the power to do so for those elected in the future .
Murray said the challenge by the Legislature could “ backfire ” for elected officials at a time when most state employees are being forced to take three unpaid furlough days each month and many taxpayers are suffering .
“ I do n’t think this is the right time to oppose the action of the Citizens Compensation Commission , ” Murray said .
The challenge was approved by the office of Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) .
A spokeswoman said that a separate state board sets per diem payments .
Advertisement
“ We respect the Citizens Compensation Commission , but they have to follow the Constitution , ” said spokeswoman Shannon Murphy .
“ Getting legal clarity about what they can truly do under the Constitution is absolutely appropriate , especially when their actions directly conflict with those of the state board that oversees issues involving per diem . ”
A representative of Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) said the leader did not approve the challenge before it was filed by Schmidt and Jon Waldie , the chief administrative officer of the Assembly .
“ It ’s something they did on their own , ” said Nathan Barankin , a spokesman for Steinberg .
Schmidt reports to Steinberg and Waldie to Bass .
Barankin said Steinberg was not available for comment but will abide by whatever the attorney general finds .
The letter from Schmidt and Waldie asks Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown to rule on whether the commission acted legally when it voted May 20 to impose the cuts .
Its members , the letter said , “ apparently lacked the authority to make a salary adjustment at that time based on the condition of the state budget . ”
Murray countered that state officials had announced a budget shortfall before the commission took action .

The pair also complained in their letter that a resolution the commission adopted regarding expenses focused on legislators to the exclusion of other elected state officials .
“ The fact that the resolution has been tailored in this fashion to single out the Legislature suggests an abuse of discretion on the part of the commission , ” the two executives wrote .
In its final action , however , the panel did cut expenses for other elected officials .
The letter also contends that “ travel and living expenses for members of the Legislature are not addressed ” in the section of the state Constitution that gives the commission its responsibilities .
Advertisement
To bolster their argument , they sent a legal opinion from Legislative Counsel Diane F. Boyer Vine that says “ the determination of per diem reimbursements for members of the Legislature is not a benefit within the jurisdiction of the commission . ”

After The Dark Knight failed to earn a Best Picture Oscar nomination , the Academy expanded the number of nominees for its top honor from five to ten .
With luck , these improved odds will prod popcorn movies to aim a little higher and license Oscar - bait films to let themselves be a little more entertaining .
We ” ll see in another year or two .
The first side effect , however , has been to exacerbate the crush of year - end Oscar - qualifying releases .
For example , Fox Searchlight had intended to release Crazy Heart , a bittersweet indie production about the redemption of a drunken old country singer played by Jeff Bridges ( looking like Kris Kristofferson on a bender ) , in the traditional dead spot of early spring , when it would have served as a welcome respite .
Instead , it ’s being rushed out Wednesday , December 16th in Los Angeles and New York for Academy Award consideration .
< object width = “ 390 ” height = “ 180 ” ; style = “ FLOAT : left ; MARGIN : 10 px 10 px 10 px 10 px ” >< param name = “ movie ” value= “ http://www.youtube.com/v/ZMLApBQspSc&hl=en_US&fs=1&”>
is a good little movie .
Maggie Gyllenhaal , who looks like a sad cartoon turtle , is more plausibly cast here as a single mom desperate enough to take a chance on an irresponsible ex-star than she was as the heartbreaker who bedazzles Bruce Wayne in
Colin Farrell , Hollywood ’s
It Boy of the first half of this decade , is also well cast as the old singer ’s former guitarist , now a Nashville superstar who wants to make it up to his one - time mentor by persuading him to sober up enough to write him some more hit songs .
Farrell ’s trademark lack of confidence in his own star power , which undermined his leading man career in busts like Oliver Stone ’s Alexander , serves him well here in his role as a nervous realist trying to look out for the ornery old drunk who taught him everything he knows without his ex-boss ’s bad karma rubbing off on him .
The fine original music ” strong electric guitar country in the mode of Steve Earle “ is overseen by old reliable T - Bone Burnett .
( The most prominently featured country classic on the soundtrack is Waylon Jennings ”  awe - inspiring “  Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way ? “  )
Bridges and Farrell sing well enough .
Given the chance , a surprising fraction of famous actors turn out to be good singers ( for example , Meryl Streep started singing in her movies as she approached 40 ) , perhaps because high school musicals serve as a key filter for an acting career .
Even with ten Best Picture slots open , however , Crazy Heart seems a little too under - scripted to snag a nomination .
As with many low budget indie films these days , Scott Cooper ’s screenplay is oddly lacking in jokes and plot twists ( which , you would think , would be more affordable than , say , the film ’s lovely dawn and dusk cinematography of Santa Fe ) .
Rather like the Ray Charles and Johnny Cash biopics of a half decade ago , the plot , such as it is , revolves around the singer ’s struggle to go on the wagon so he can live long enough to pen another hit .
( As Mickey Kaus has cynically pointed out , however , if you study the timelines of famous musicians like Charles and Cash , the happy endings in their movies when they finally get sober turn out to be when they stopped composing great tunes . )
The studio is giving Crazy Heart a big Oscar push not because the film deserves the Best Picture award , but because it just seems about time for Jeff Bridges to finally win his Best Actor Oscar , 38 years after his nomination for The Last Picture Show .
Thus , Robert Duvall is on hand in Crazy Heart to play Bridges ’s bartender friend , and to remind us that he won an Oscar for a similar role as a country has - been in 1983 ’s Tender Mercies .
Bridges has enjoyed a long , pleasant , but slightly odd career .
The popularity and energy of his father , Lloyd Bridges ( who played scuba diver Mike Nelson on Sea Hunt , which I watched each afternoon upon coming home from first grade ) , propelled Jeff and his older brother Beau into early stardom .
“  I ’m a product of nepotism .
The doors were open to me , ”  he readily admits .
Hollywood thought young Jeff looked like a leading man , and he rewarded the moguls ”  faith in him with numerous skillful and idiosyncratic performances .
For example , in the 1970s alone , he was excellent as a moonshiner turned stock car racer in The Last American Hero , as Clint Eastwood ’s assistant bank robber in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot , and as the brother of an assassinated Kennedyesque President in Richard Condon ‘s intriguing follow - up to The Manchurian Candidate , Winter Kills .
Yet , the public never seemed to take Bridges to heart ( in fact , it seemed unable to reliably distinguish Jeff Bridges from Jeff Daniels ) … until 1999 , when a box office flop called The Big Lebowski started playing on cable TV .
Therefore , Crazy Heart ‘s opening is constructed to remind us of what ’s now Bridges ’s most famous role , El Duderino ( if you ” re not into the whole brevity thing ) , the “ 60s radical turned foul - mouthed bowler .
During the opening credits of Crazy Heart , Bridges drives his beat - up van across New Mexico to get to his next gig , which turns out to be in a less than dignified venue .
His first line in Crazy Heart , as he pulls up in the parking lot , is “  Fucking bowling alley … ”  
Yet Crazy Heart might have a better chance of picking up a Best Picture than a Best Actor nomination because the Actor category is still stuck with only five nominees , even though it ’s often the most competitive race .
Last year , for instance , there wasn ” t enough room in the Best Actor derby for Robert Downey Jr. ’s triumphant star turn in Iron Man .
( Instead , Downey got squeezed into the Best Supporting Actor competition for Tropic Thunder . )
The problem with doubling the number of Best Actor nominations , however , is that it would be ungentlemanly to add slots for Best Actor without an equal increase for Best Actress .
Yet the Academy already has a hard time filling out its five Best Actress nominations .
Last year , for instance , one of the Best Actress nods went to Melissa Leo for Frozen River , which grossed all of $ 2.5 million .
Hollywood , at present , is very much a man ’s world .
I have opposed the Iraq war since before it began , but it only became personal for me about a year and a half ago , on April 29 , 2008 .
I remember the moment well .
I had flipped open the Washington Post and there , on the front page , was a color photo of a 2 - year - old Iraqi boy named Ali Hussein being pulled from the rubble of a house that had been destroyed by American missiles .
The little boy was wearing shorts and a T - shirt and had on his feet flip - flops .
His head was hanging back at an angle that told the viewer immediately that he was dead .
That small boy looked remarkably like my little grandson , similarly attired , who was sitting beside me eating his cereal .
When I gasped at the photo , my little guy looked up at me and grinned , wondering why grandpa was crying .
Four days later , on May 3 , a letter by a Dunn Loring , Va. , woman named Valerie Murphy was printed by the Post .
Murphy complained that the Iraqi child victim photo should not have been run in the paper , because it would " stir up opposition to the war and feed anti-U.S. sentiment . "
I suppose the newspaper thought it was being impartial in printing the woman ’s letter , though I could n’t help but remember that the Post had generally been unwilling to cover anything antiwar , even ignoring a gathering of 300,000 protesters in Washington in 2005 .
Rereading the woman ’s complaint and also a comment on a Web site suggesting that the photo of the dead little boy had been staged , I thought to myself , " What kind of monsters have we become ? "
And in truth we have become monsters , bipartisan monsters wrapped in the American flag .
Bill Clinton ’s secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , once said that killing 500,000 Iraqi children through sanctions was " worth it . "
Every day our Democratic administration continues the policies of the preceding Republican administration as it bombs and kill farmers in their fields , children in their schools , doctors and patients in hospitals , and families in wedding parties .
We do it using pilotless drones , helicopters , and airplanes flying so high in the sky that they are invisible to those on the ground .
The slaughter is strictly 21st - century high tech , death from the skies , bloodless , without looking into the eyes of those we are killing .
We do it because our leaders tell us we need to kill to keep others from attacking us , but we all know it is a fraud .
Does any American really believe that what is going on in either Iraq or Afghanistan has anything to do with genuine threats against the United States ?
The more we kill , the more we give cause to those who hate us , guaranteeing that the bloodshed will never end .
Whatever our government does or does not do , we will surely leave Iraq and Afghanistan some day , and those two countries will quickly learn to live without us .
Last Thursday , U.S. Army Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters at the Pentagon , “ I ’m not sure we will ever see anyone declare victory in Iraq , because first off , I ’m not sure we ’ll know for 10 years or five years . "
If Odierno had deliberately sought to define his war in terms borrowed from National Lampoon , he could not have done any better .
One thing that is for sure is that there will be no friendly crowds as the last C - 17 lifts off from Bagram Airbase , and we will leave only hatred behind us – hatred and the dead , hundreds of thousands of dead .
These days , as the pattern of endless war seems to be locked into the DNA of all our leaders , be they Democrats or Republicans , I grieve particularly for our fellow countrymen who have given up their lives in service to their country over the past nine years .
I remember well the young faces of my former Army comrades who died in Vietnam in a war that none of us understood , faces frozen in time from lives now lost forever .
The numbers tell us that 4,348 Americans have died in Iraq and 869 in Afghanistan , with no end in sight on either front and the death rate in Afghanistan escalating dramatically .
I carefully read the obituaries of soldiers and Marines in the newspapers , men and women just like me who leave behind shattered families , who will never see their children grow , who will never have their dreams realized .
Dead Afghans and Iraqis are a huge and almost unimaginable human tragedy , but the Americans who have died are truly flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood .
As John Donne put it , the dead are of us , so " Do not ask for whom the bell tolls , it tolls for thee . "
And they have shed their blood not to nourish the tree of liberty , but rather a garden of deceit planted by our politicians , who have forgotten the cardinal rule that asking any American to die on foreign soil should be a last resort , not a " policy option . "
Eight years of the sacrifice of our children has not made us safer , has not made us better , and has only made much of the world hate us .
In the obituaries that I read this past week there were real lives and real people .
Soldiers dead and families destroyed .
On Saturday alone , eight American soldiers died in a series of attacks in Nuristan province , and two more were killed in Wardak province on the previous day when an Afghan policeman they were training shot them .
The two soldiers killed in Wardak were identified as Sgt. Michael M. Smith of Manhattan , Kan. , and Pfc. Brandon Owens of Memphis , Tenn .
Four of the eight men killed in Nuristan were Sgt. Joshua Kirk of South Portland , Maine ; Michael Scusa of Villas , N.J. ; Spc. Christopher Griffin of Kincheloe , Mich . ; and Pfc. Kevin C. Thompson of Reno , Nev .
Americans need to unite to tell the Bushes , Clintons , and Obamas that they will not have any more of our children for their wars .
It is time for all of us to say to Gen. McChrystal and Gen. Petraeus , as well as their enablers in Congress and the media , " Enough . "
Every American should pause to remember Smith , Owens , Kirk , Scusa , Griffin , and Thompson , who gave their lives over the weekend .
And all Americans should think first of their grandsons , sons , and daughters and their friends and loved ones who might be consumed in the long war that the politicians and generals continue to embrace .
There must not be one more senseless death , be it of an American or an Iraqi or an Afghan or an Iranian .
Not one .
We must make this demand to our politicians , and , if they do not agree , we must do whatever it takes to remove them from office .
They will undoubtedly be replaced by men and women only slightly better than they , but if we repeat the lesson often enough they will eventually get the message and possibly restore the United States envisioned by our founding fathers , ending a perpetual state of war and instead offering " peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations . "
Scores of men have responded to the hijab campaign
Iranian opposition supporters have launched an online campaign to free a student activist accused of dressing as a woman to try to avoid arrest .
Hundreds of men have posted photos of themselves wearing Islamic headscarves as part of the " Be a man " campaign to show solidarity with Majid Tavakoli .
He was arrested during protests in Tehran on Monday and state media showed images of him in headscarf and robes .
The opposition say the pictures were staged in a bid to discredit him .

They say he was not wearing the headscarf and robes when he was arrested .
Iranian state media say Mr Tavakoli was arrested as he sought to leave Tehran 's Amir Kabir university " disguised as a woman " after Student Day protests .
He is a leading activist who spent 15 months in jail along with two fellow students after being arrested in 2006 on charges of insulting religion and the country 's leadership in student publications , AFP news agency reports .
One US - based website for Iranian expatriates , iranian.com , has posted scores of photos submitted by readers .
" Iranian men are showing their solidarity with Tavakoli by wearing a hijab and posting their photo on the web , " reads its appeal to send in photos .
Some of the website 's readers argue that the campaign is also a gesture of solidarity with Iranian women , who are obliged by the authorities to wear the hijab in public .
Many of the contributors openly show their faces , in headscarves , while some have all but their eyes covered .
" Life is so short and so many fine , fine men around , " one woman reader quipped .
" It is getting harder to be a girl these days . "

Dec. 23 , 2009  --
A Brazilian court today took another step toward returning nine - year - old Sean Goldman to the arms of his father , David .
The court ordered that Sean be reunited with David Goldman by 9 a.m. , 6 a.m. EST , Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
The boy 's Brazilian family decided to give up its fight for custody of Sean and will not appeal the court 's decision the family 's lawyer , Sergio Tostes , confirmed in an e-mail , bringing a five - year custody battle to an end .
Sean 's maternal grandmother , Silvana Bianchi , told ABC News that her grandson does not want to leave Brazil .
" He said he is very sad because he does not want to , and he is very sad because he had , he has the right to speak and to explain himself , but the judge here cut his right , " Bianchi said .
The grandmother said she continued to fight for custody of Sean because he wanted to stay in Brazil .
" He wanted to stay with us .
Now I want …him to be happy …
And if he goes to United States and stay … the best thing for him will be ( to ) stay there , " Bianchi said .
Rep. Chris Smith , R - N.J. , who is traveling with Goldman , said the ruling was welcome news .
David Goldman has spent more than a week in Brazil in hope of bringing his son back to New Jersey .
" David and his team are encouraged that the nightmare is coming to an end , " Smith told the AP .
" No more delays .
It 's time to do this . "
Yesterday the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that the boy " be handed over to his father and should be returned to the United States . "
Smith said Goldman was " elated " when he heard the court 's decision yesterday .
" A big smile came to his face , but he said , ' I 'm not going to let my guard down until it 's wheels up , " Smith told the AP yesterday .
David Goldman , 42 , was granted custody of the boy last week only to have a legal motion block his long - sought reunion with nine - year - old Sean .
The boy went to Brazil with his mother when he was 4 , but the mother never returned to the U.S.
She divorced Goldman and remarried , but died giving birth to a daughter she had with her second husband .
The mother 's family assumed custody of Sean and has fought Goldman 's claims for custody for the past five years .
Yesterday 's Supreme Court ruling came as Silvana Bianchi , the Brazilian grandmother of Sean Goldman , wrote a passionate letter to the president of Brazil , pleading with him to intervene and prevent the boy from being taken away just before Christmas .
" Our moral foundation values the mother 's role .
In the absence of the mother , the raising should be done by the grandmothers .
This is custom in Brazil from north to south , " she wrote , calling the custom " authentically Brazilian . "
David Goldman Versus Grandmother
Bianchi claimed in her letter that she has become the " target of an international campaign of unbelievable proportions .
American authorities give public declarations saying I am a kidnapper , " she wrote .
The grandmother said all the legal arguments did not take into consideration what the boy wants .
" Mr. President , this is not a cry of a grandmother in agony .
This is the clamor of a Brazilian fighting with all of the strength that she has left so the justice of this country would apply the laws with humanity , " she said .
Bianchi said sending Sean to New Jersey would tear him away from the family he has lived with for the past five years , and from his three - year - old sister , Chiara .
" To do this , especially on Christmas Eve , is inhumane , " she said .
The grandmother 's letter is n't the first time the case has been brought up to the Brazilian president .
It was raised during talks between him and President Obama .
In addition , last week New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg blocked the renewal of a $ 2.75 billion trade deal that would lift tariffs on some Brazilian exports .
But the hold was lifted and the bill passed after Tuesday 's ruling by the Brazilian Supreme Court , the AP reported .
Christine Brouwer , Kate McCarthy and The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Declaration of Orly Taitz
1 . My name is Orly Taitz .
I am over 18 years old , am of sound mind and free of any mental disease or psychological impairment of any kind or condition .
2 . I am a citizen of the United States of America and a resident of the state of California .
3 . I am an attorney and an officer of the court licensed in all courts of the state of California , Supreme Court of the United States , Federal District Court in the central District of the State of California and have practiced pro hac vice in the states of Texas , Pennsylvania and Georgia .
4 . This declaration is made in response to the October 29th order in above captioned case .
5 . During the October 5 hearing in the above mentioned case Judge David O. Carter stated that I encouraged my supporters to call him .
6 . I declare under penalty of perjury that this is not true .
7 . During the hearing I tried to protest this defamatory allegation against me and asked to speak .
However , Judge Carter refused to let me speak and respond to this allegation .
8 .
In the same order on page 29 , Judge Carter has stated that he received letters with affidavits , claiming that I asked potential witnesses to perjure themselves .
9 . I declare that this is absolutely and categorically not true , and it constitutes an outrageous defamatory and slanderous accusation .
Those letters were ex parte communications , highly prejudicial against me and my clients and I had no opportunity to respond and deny those accusations .
10 .
I believe that the court referred to the letters from Larry Sinclair and Lucas Smith .
Both parties were contacted and asked to be witnesses during the motion hearing on September 8 , 2009 .
11 .
I have asked Larry Sinclair to authenticate an affidavit he submitted to the Chicago police regarding the homicide of Mr. Donald Young .
In fact , the statements to which Mr. Sinclair would testify are already a matter of public record .
1 .
In the affidavit submitted to the Chicago Police and in his book , recently published , Mr. Sinclair stated that Mr. Donald Young contacted him repeatedly and told Mr. Sinclair that he had a lengthy homosexual relationship with Mr. Obama .
2 . The affidavit further said that Mr. Young was found dead , shot in the back of his head at the onset of the Democratic primaries for 2008 presidential election .
3 .
Any allegation that I asked Mr. Sinclair to perjure himself is not only completely defamatory , but lacks any sense or reason , as Mr. Sinclair ’s affidavit regarding Mr. Young ’s homicide can be found filed with the Chicago police department and in his book , that can be purchased on the Internet .
12 . I asked Mr. Lucas Smith to authenticate Kenyan birth certificate for Mr. Barack Hussein Obama , which he previously tried to sell to the highest bidder on E - bay .
Again , any allegations that I asked Mr. Smith to perjure himself is absolutely not true , defamatory and ludicrous , as he made this information available to the public long before he ever met me .
13 .
As of now I am the only attorney with the courage , integrity and strength of character to not only bring forward information of Mr. Barack Obama not being eligible for the office of the presidency , but I am also to submit to court information from two licensed investigators , showing that Mr. Obama has used 39 different social security numbers according to national databases , including social security numbers of deceased individuals .
14 . I am bringing forward evidence showing that Mr. Barack Hussein Obama , sitting president , is guilty of multiple felonies , for which he might need to spend the rest of his life in prison .
15 .
I believe , that I am being targeted in an effort to silence me , which involves targeting my law license in an attempt to try to prevent me from proceeding with legal actions on the above issues .
I solemnly swear under penalty of perjury that all the facts stated and circumstances described above are true and correct statements .
Respectfully submitted ,
NOVEMBER 5 , 2009

The unique wildlife of the island that inspired Robinson Crusoe is teetering on the edge of annihilation , according to the Chilean government , which has launched a last - ditch attempt to save it .
The Juan Fernández islands lie 600 km out into the Pacific ocean and host an extraordinary number of unique plants and animals which occur nowhere else in the world .
The threat comes from alien invaders , including rats , goats and even brambles .
" This is a key challenge for Chile , " says Miguel Stutzin Schottlander , head of the Chilean government 's Department for the Protection of Natural Resources .
" This is a starting point , bringing together stakeholders from civil society and the scientific community to set priorities .
We are dealing with the threat of extinction of an important part of our heritage and it's a big responsibility . "
" This is one of the global jewels of biodiversity , " says Peter Hodum , an ecologist from the University of Puget Sound , US , who leads the conservation organisation Oikonos , " Although it does not have the cache of the Galápagos , it is just as important . "
The Juan Fernández islands include the island on which the castaway Alexander Selkirk spent four lonely years .
His story became Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe , after whom the island is now named .
From the windy look - out from where Selkirk scanned the horizon for ships , conservationists dream of rescue too .
" The important thing about this biodiversity is that it has a meaning for itself , but it 's up to us to take care of it , " says Ivan Julio Leiva Silva who , as director of the Juan Fernández national park , has been struggling with its problems for 15 years .
The Juan Fernández firecrown – a tiny , ginger hummingbird found solely on Robinson Crusoe island , and one of the rarest birds in the world – is being forced from the last 250 hectares of pristine forest to find food in the village gardens , where it is attacked by domestic cats .
Trouble first came to the islands in 1540 when their discoverer , Juan Fernández , dropped off four goats to provide food for future mariners .
Subsequent overgrazing by goats , cattle , sheep , horses and rabbits led to irreversible erosion .
Rats and mice also jumped ship to become predators of birds and gnawers of rare plants .
New plants arrived with immigrants and flowers skipped over garden fences to colonise disturbed land and oust vegetation which had evolved over 4 million years .
The native magellan thrush unwittingly spreads alien seeds far and wide .
Legend has it that South American coati were released to provide more wildlife interest when the islands were designated a national park in the 1930s only to become predators of the Juan Fernández petrel , a seabird which nests in burrows there and nowhere else .
Later , in the 1960s , someone thought the European blackberry would make a good hedge .
Now bramble grows into enormous thickets , smothering native trees .
The consensus among conservation scientists is for drastic action : shoot the goats , poison the rats , grub out the bramble .
Alan Saunders , who manages New Zealand 's invasive species management programme is optimistic : " They say you can't turn the clock back but I say we can get awful close in restoring islands to their previous state .
We 've eradicated introduced species from New Zealand islands , such as Tiri Tiri Matangi , and we can have a good go with this . "
Many in the 600 - strong local community on Robinson Crusoe island also back such measures : " We must act now , " says one islander , " our islands are dying . "
TD Bank , a unit of Canadian banking giant TD Bank Financial Group , is facing accusations from customers that the bank allowed their accounts to be emptied without their approval .
Investors allege the bank 's actions may have helped Florida attorney Scott Rothstein carry out a possible fraud .
Mr. Rothstein , the former chairman of a 70 - lawyer firm in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , started a business to sell court settlements to investors at a discount , according to investors , who say they paid cash upfront in exchange for the right to recover the full amount of a court settlement at a later date .
Investors , however , allege that Mr. Rothstein sold settlements that did n't exist , according to court papers in which his firm asked to be dissolved by the court .
Further details about the nature of the alleged fraud also came to light Wednesday , including the possibility that the business venture had been in place about three years .
Mr. Rothstein and his attorney did n't answer a request for comment .
Mr. Rothstein created accounts at a Fort Lauderdale branch of TD Bank to hold funds from investors in Mr. Rothstein 's settlements business , according to Stuart Rosenfeldt , a co-founder of Mr. Rothstein 's law firm .
Mr. Rosenfeldt says the accounts held about $ 500 million as recently as Oct. 23 but had a zero balance by Oct. 30 .
The U.S. attorney 's office in Miami is currently investigating Mr. Rothstein , according to a spokesman for Mr. Rothstein 's law firm , Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler P.A. , which is cooperating with authorities .
SANTA CRUZ , CA -- An international team of planet hunters has discovered as many as six low - mass planets around two nearby Sun - like stars , including two " super - Earths " with masses 5 and 7.5 times the mass of Earth .
The researchers , led by Steven Vogt of the University of California , Santa Cruz , and Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , said the two " super - Earths " are the first ones found around Sun - like stars .
" These detections indicate that low - mass planets are quite common around nearby stars .
The discovery of potentially habitable nearby worlds may be just a few years away , " said Vogt , a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC .
The team found the new planet systems by combining data gathered at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Anglo - Australian Telescope ( AAT ) in New South Wales , Australia .
Two papers describing the new planets have been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal .
Three of the new planets orbit the bright star 61 Virginis , which can be seen with the naked eye under dark skies in the Spring constellation Virgo .
Astronomers and astrobiologists have long been fascinated with this particular star , which is only 28 light - years away .
Among hundreds of our nearest stellar neighbors , 61 Vir stands out as being the most nearly similar to the Sun in terms of age , mass , and other essential properties .
Vogt and his collaborators have found that 61 Vir hosts at least three planets , with masses ranging from about 5 to 25 times the mass of Earth .
Recently , a separate team of astronomers used NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope to discover that 61 Vir also contains a thick ring of dust at a distance roughly twice as far from 61 Vir as Pluto is from our Sun .
The dust is apparently created by collisions of comet - like bodies in the cold outer reaches of the system .
" Spitzer 's detection of cold dust orbiting 61 Vir indicates that there 's a real kinship between the Sun and 61 Vir , " said Eugenio Rivera , a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC .
Rivera computed an extensive set of numerical simulations to find that a habitable Earth - like world could easily exist in the as - yet unexplored region between the newly discovered planets and the outer dust disk .
According to Vogt , the planetary system around 61 Vir is an excellent candidate for study by the new Automated Planet Finder ( APF ) Telescope recently constructed at Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton near San Jose .
" Needless to say , we 're very excited to continue monitoring this system using APF , " said Vogt , who is the principal investigator for the APF and is building a spectrometer for the new telescope that is optimized for finding planets .
The second new system found by the team features a 7.5 - Earth - mass planet orbiting HD 1461 , another near - perfect twin of the Sun located 76 light - years away .
At least one and possibly two additional planets also orbit the star .
Lying in the constellation Cetus , HD 1461 can be seen with the naked eye in the early evening under good dark - sky conditions .
The 7.5 - Earth - mass planet , assigned the name HD 1461b , has a mass nearly midway between the masses of Earth and Uranus .
The researchers said they cannot tell yet if HD 1461b is a scaled - up version of Earth , composed largely of rock and iron , or whether , like Uranus and Neptune , it is composed mostly of water .
According to Butler , the new detections required state - of - the - art instruments and detection techniques .
" The inner planet of the 61 Vir system is among the two or three lowest - amplitude planetary signals that have been identified with confidence , " he said .
" We 've found there is a tremendous advantage to be gained from combining data from the AAT and Keck telescopes , two world - class observatories , and it 's clear that we 'll have an excellent shot at identifying potentially habitable planets around the very nearest stars within just a few years . "
The 61 Vir and HD 1461 detections add to a slew of recent discoveries that have upended conventional thinking regarding planet detection .
In the past year , it has become evident that planets orbiting the Sun 's nearest neighbors are extremely common .
According to Butler , current indications are that fully one - half of nearby stars have a detectable planet with mass equal to or less than Neptune's .
The Lick - Carnegie Exoplanet Survey Team led by Vogt and Butler uses radial velocity measurements from ground - based telescopes to detect the " wobble " induced in a star by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet .
The radial - velocity observations were complemented with precise brightness measurements acquired with robotic telescopes in Arizona by Gregory Henry of Tennessee State University .
" We do n't see any brightness variability in either star , " said Henry .
" This assures us that the wobbles really are due to planets and not changing patterns of dark spots on the stars . "
Due to improvements in equipment and observing techniques , these ground - based methods are now capable of finding Earth - mass objects around nearby stars , according to team member Gregory Laughlin , professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC .
" It 's come down to a neck - and - neck race as to whether the first potentially habitable planets will be detected from the ground or from space , " Laughlin said .
" A few years ago , I 'd have put my money on space - based detection methods , but now it really appears to be a toss - up .
What is truly exciting about the current ground - based radial velocity detection method is that it is capable of locating the very closest potentially habitable planets . "
###
The Lick - Carnegie Exoplanet Survey Team has developed a publicly available tool , the Systemic Console , which enables members of the public to search for the signals of extrasolar planets by exploring real data sets in a straightforward and intuitive way .
This tool is available online at www.oklo.org.
This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and NASA .
In addition to Vogt , Butler , Rivera , Laughlin , and Henry , the coauthors of the 61 Vir paper include Rob Wittenmyer , C. G. Tinney , and Jeremy Bailey of the University of New South Wales ; Simon O'Toole and Hugh Jones of the University of Hertfordshire ; Stefano Meschiari of UCSC ; Brad Carter of the University of Southern Queensland ; and Konstantin Batygin of Caltech .

Every year , some college football fans are filled with disappointment of a fall come and gone , their hopes and dreams dashed by a miserable season on the gridiron .
2009 is no different , so we decided to offer a list of who were the worst offenders of underachievement .
And please note , that unless specified , this list is only based on the merits of the current season .
ACC Bobby Bowden Florida State
A classic example of a coach who did n’t know when to quit .
You surely ca n’t take Bowden ’s National Titles away , but we ’re a decade removed from his last title–which was his last BCS win as well .
The biggest gripe about Bowden in the last decade is the perennial underachievement of his enormously talented squads .
But this year , the ‘ Noles have been as maddening as any team in the nation .
They drilled a then Top 10 BYU team in Provo , nearly lost to a FCS division Jacksonville State team at home before winning in the final seconds and lost three straight winnable games before winning their last two to get their current 4 - 4 record .
Still , in the mediocre / dreadful ACC , they ’re still in position to make a run at the conference title game if they win their last 3 conference games before closing the season at # 1 Florida .
Also considered : Ralph Friedgen , Maryland
Big East Steve Kragthorpe Louisville
So what do you do when someone gives you the keys to a Ferrari ?
If you ’re Steve Kragthorpe , apparently fit it with 14 inch tires with hubcaps , put fuzzy dice on the rear - view mirror and equip it with the General Lee ’s horn .
In 2007 , Kragthope took over a Louisville club that won the Orange Bowl , finished 6th in the country and returned 17 players that are or were on NFL rosters .
Easy to win with that in the Big East , right ?
Well not for Krags .
In his third game of 2007 , he lost to arch rival Kentucky and never recovered , finishing 6 - 6 and since has gone 5 - 7 and is 3 - 5 this season and has n’t beaten a BCS team in over a year .
Needless to say , the fan base has noticed with only 21 K showing up on Halloween to watch the Cards ( barely ) defeat lowly Arkansas State .
And this great website about sums up the feeling of most of UofL ’s fan base .
Mercifully for Cardinal fans ( like yours truly ) , it appears this reign of misery should come to an end in about four more weeks .
( And for Louisville fans , this would be enough to make us forget the last three years . )
Also considered : none - no one has come close the level of failure of Kragthorpe .
Big 10 Jim Tressel Ohio State
The Sweater Vest could be forgiven for losing to U$C , if he had n’t lost every single important non-conference game in the last decade while being embarrassed in most of them .
But he has .
Furthermore , he ca n’t be forgiven this year for :
Failing to utilize the incredible talents of Terrell Pryor ( remember the Buckeye camp claiming he ran a sub 4.4 40 in the spring .
Hilarious . )
Losing to a dreadful Purdue team in a game that was n’t even that close Nearly losing at home to Navy .
With games remaining at Penn State , against # 4 Iowa , and at their biggest rival Michigan still looming , OSU may not win the Big 10 ( 11 ) for the first time since 2005
Also considered : Mark Dantonio , Michigan State
Big 12 Mark Mangino Kansas
Of all the BCS conferences , the Big 12 was probably the toughest place to find an under performing coach .
We could have gone with Mike Gundy at Oklahoma State , but his team is still 6 - 2 and in the hunt for a decent bowl game ( and we probably should have because he is , after all , a man ) .
Dan Hawkins at Colorado is about to get whacked for his under achievements , but they beat Mangino ’s club to start the Jayhawks ’ three - game skid in conference .
Since the loss to CU , Kansas has been hammered by both an injury - ravaged Oklahoma team and Texas Tech .
They are currently tied for last ( 1 - 3 ) in the Big 12 North .
With trips to suddenly rejuvenated Kansas State and # 2 Texas looming , Mangino ’s squad is looking at staying home for the holidays–certainly not what was expected from a team that went 8 - 4 last season and returned 7 starters on both sides of the ball .
Also considered : Dan Hawkins , Colorado ; Mike Gundy ( the MAN ) , Oklahoma State
PAC 10 Pete Carrol USC
Again , this list is based solely on the 2009 performance ( with the exception of Kragthorpe whose three - year reign of FAIL is unparalleled on this list ) and it ’s hard to not give Pete Carrol a pass for losing two games in a season for the first time since Marcus Allen was toting the rock .
Okay , not that long , but still , it seems like it .
Nevertheless , Carrol almost always reloads at SC and that was supposed to be the case this season with about a million High School All Americans on the way .
But in what ’s becoming an annual occurrence , after beating Ohio State in Columbus , the Trojans lost a classic let down game in Seattle to a plucky , but underwhelming Washington team .
Then they got smacked by the best team in the PAC 10 , Oregon Now , tied for fourth in the league , the Trojans need to run the table in order to keep PAC 10 title aspirations alive .
Again , maybe we ’re a little hard on Carrol here , but frankly , he ’s earned the right to be criticized harshly due to his incredible success at SC .
Also considered : Rick Neuheisel , UCLA –but did n’t like the odds .
SEC Houston Nutt Ole Miss
Forget for a second that he has the best name in sports ( well , maybe Dick Trickle is better ) , Nutt has taken a pre-season Top 10 team , a preseason Heisman candidate and potential first round draft pick QB ( Jevan Snead ) and guided them to a 5 - 3 mark .
They have a gimme next in Northern Arizona , but with the three remaining SEC games of Tennessee , #9 LSU and at arch rival Mississippi State ( in the Egg Bowl–look it up ! ) , it ’s not out of the question to see Ole Miss finish at 6 - 6 for the season .
If that scenario comes to pass , maybe only Kragthorpe will have done a worse coaching job on this list .
Also considered : Rich Brooks , Kentucky – decided to give ol ’ Grandpa a break since he did beat Louisville earlier this year .
Throughout the history of the NHL there have been many pure goal scorers .
From Maurice “ Rocket ” Richard to Alexander Ovechkin and everyone in between , all of these goal scorers have striking similarities that you can practice and implement on the ice .
Even players who are naturally gifted with the ability to score goals still have to practice and train to be a true great goal scorer .
Below I have listed six traits that every pure goal scorer possesses .
By learning these traits you can practice at home and hopefully score more goals !
Yes there are more than 7 traits , some common traits would be speed , power , agility , shooting the puck and accuracy which every player should strive to achieve .
This list details traits that really set goal scorers apart from others .
Quick Release
A quick release is very important if you want to score a lot of goals .
Pavel Bure and many other goal scorers were famous for having a quick release .
Many great goal scorers were able to streak down the ice and put the puck in the back of the net in the blink of an eye .
The longer you take to shoot the puck the more time the goalie has to prepare and stop your shot .
If you can hammer off a one timer , or shoot the puck from an awkward angle when the goalie is not expecting it you will definitely increase the amount of goals you score .
A great way to practice a quick release is to practice shooting the puck mid stride .
Many players break their stride , pull the puck back , and then shoot .
If you can fire a shot as you come full speed towards the net , many times the goalie will be wondering what that black streak was that went right by him into the net .
Another great skill to practice is your forehand to backhand transition .
If you can quickly move the puck from your forehand to your backhand ( faster than the goalie can move from one side of the net to the other ) you will be able to net a lot more goals .
Great Goal Scorers go to the Net I can not count how many goals I scored hustling to the net ( when a team mate had the puck ) on two on ones .
If you can come across the blue line with speed and hustle to the net , the defensemen has less time to think .
If he lets you go then your team mate can pass you the puck and you crank it in the net .
If the defensemen does cover you , it gives your team mate an open shot and you have a chance to get the rebound .
Teemu Selanne was known for going to the net hard and almost always popping in the perfect saucer pass that Paul Kariya would send his way .
If you have the time you can watch a video that I attached to the bottom of this post .
The video show ’s Selanne and Kariya highlights , and a few examples of Selanne going to the net , and Kariya setting him up .
Once you are in front of the net , stay there .
I used to love to cause mayhem in front of the net .
It would distract the goalie and keep the defensemen busy .
When you are in front of the net you can deflect shots , screen shots for your team mates , and pick up rebounds .
Tim Kerr was well known for his play in front of the net and managed to bank four 50 + goal seasons in a row in the NHL back in the 80’s
Get Open
It is going to be hard to get a pass if you are covered .
Do n’t stand still –
When you are in front of the net or anywhere on the ice do not let the defencemen tie you up , move around , try to get open .
In fact try to never stand still while you are on the ice , it is harder to get to full speed if you are stopped .
Hustle –
This is part of getting open , in hockey you have to hustle , never give up on the puck and work for every goal .
Some of the best goals ever scored are desperate acts or players that never gave up .
If you take a shot on goal , drive to the net and get your own rebound .
Hockey Sense Great Hockey players have “ hockey sense ” Hockey sense is the ability to read plays and create plays .
Do not turn your brain off when you are on the ice .
If you are always chasing the puck you will just get tired , instead you should be thinking where is the puck going .
This allows you to be one step ahead of the other team , and also in the right spot to get that sought after break away pass !
Wayne Gretzky was well known for his hockey sense , he had a feel for a game , he knew where every player was and where they were going .
This not only helps you get goals by being in the right spot to get a pass , but also makes you a great playmaker .
Pass Nobody likes a puck hog !
While great goal scorers do have great hands there are always great passing opportunities and many great goal scorers are also great play makers .
If you pass the puck to your players you are likely to get a pass back ( As long as you get open and in position )
Passing allows the game to move faster and you can create more opportunities for yourself , and your team mates to score .
If you are covered by another player , you can pass to your team mate , shake the opposition and get into position for a pass .
Give and goes are great ways to score goals , just watch some rock ’em sock ’em hockey videos and you will see all kinds of amazing give and goes and tic tac toe plays
Creativity Being creative on the ice is very important if you want to be a great goal scorer .
If you pull the same moves over and over than you will be an easy nut to crack .
The best goal scorers can beat the defense and goalies repeatedly with new moves .
Think of the first time Bure came in on the goalie from the left side , dropped the puck back to his skates , kicked it back up to his stick and then popped it in the net .
Sure he could have just shot the puck , but being creative is what makes great goal scorers score great goals .
What about the first time Jagr dropped the puck and his stick backwards between his legs and shot the puck top shelf , this is a creative move that allowed him to score in what most would think is an impossible scoring situation .
What about the first time when a Boston university player went behind the net , scooped the puck up on the blade of his stick , and then lacrosse style put the puck top shelf ( latter repeated by Crosby in the QMJHL )
These are the types of plays you can practice on the ice , maybe you will not do them in a game , but if you practice all sorts of ways to manipulate the puck than you will be that much better at stickhandling the puck normaly .
Good Goal Scorers Can Get in The Goalies Head Good goal scorers are able to predict the actions of the defense and goal tenders .
Knowing what a goalie is going to do , or how a goalie is going to react is key in scoring more goals .
Joe Sakic demonstrated this a number of times when he would be at a bad angle , move to the center , and then shoot for the post on the side he just came from .
Sakic knows that goalies must cover their angles , on a bad angle shot the goalie will hug the post so Sakic would move towards the center to pull the goalie off the post , and then shoot for the opening that was just created .
Getting in the goalies head , and knowing how goalies are trained and think is a great way to score more goals .
Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya Highlights
Bonus point – PRACTICE , nobody ever made it to the NHL or beacame a great player by wishing it would happen .
In order to score goals you must practice your shot in order to improve your power and accuracy .
I am also including a few tips from a coach on the OMHA forum that I am a member of .
Practice shooting alot , better shooters score more .
Take the puck as close to the net as possible , your odds are greater the closer you are to the goal line .
Shoot when you have high percentage ranges and angles , pass when your teammates have them .
Players who shoot from inpossible angles get the occasional goal , players who pass when at impossible angles get lots of assists ( and often more goals as their linemates will reciprocate ) .
Battle to win your position in the slot .
Rebounds are the best source of goals for those tough enough to get them .
I hope these tips will help you score more goals through out your life .
Learning tips like these helped me improve my game quite a bit and I want to help others improve as well .
If you have any tips of your own then feel free to leave them in the comments section .

Pass the Puck
Ubuntu 9.10 , codenamed Karmic Koala , climbed down from the tree last month with new features and updated software .
For five years and eleven releases , the Ubuntu Linux distribution has delivered a capable desktop operating system built largely on open source software .
The new version is another important step forward for Ubuntu and its corporate backer Canonical .
The new version offers a user experience that is incrementally better than its predecessors , but there is still a lot of room for improvement .
Some of the new software introduced in Ubuntu 9.10 feels incomplete and will need a lot more work before it can really shine .
This review will take a close look at some of the most significant new features , such as Canonical 's Ubuntu One service and the new Software Center application management tool .
We will also examine some of the upstream software from GNOME 2.28 that plays a role in defining key parts of the user experience in Ubuntu 9.10 and give you some technical insight into various architectural components of distro , such as Ubuntu 's unique CouchDB configuration .

Ubuntu is typically installed from a bootable Live CD environment .
The graphical installer , which is called Ubiquity , includes built - in partitioning tools and allows users to configure some basic system settings .
The installer is designed with a strong emphasis on simplicity and ease of use .
Ubiquity got an aesthetic overhaul for the Karmic release .
During the installation process , it will now display a slide show that highlights some of the key features and important applications that are included in Ubuntu .
The information will help introduce new users to the platform .
In previous versions , the installer only showed a progress bar .
The Ubiquity slideshow is a nice improvement that adds a little bit of extra elegance to installation .
The messages are concise and the artwork is well done .
Similar features have existed in other operating systems and Linux distributions for practically as long as graphical installers have existed , but it 's nice to see Ubuntu 's take on the concept .
The material is targeted at new users , so it obviously does n't say much that will interest Ubuntu enthusiasts .
Fortunately , the Live CD includes the GNOME games collection for those of us who would rather indulge in an exhilarating game of Solitaire during the installation .
The following images show several screens from the installer slideshow :
Everyone loves cash money and the Internet has allowed many businesses with great ideas to become filthy rich .
But among all those great thinkers there have also been a handful of people who have managed to make money with ideas that would have been described as ‘ dumb - assery ’ if they had pitched them to you .
These people did n’t just think outside the box , they also lit the box on fire and peed on it , all the way to the bank .
One famous example is the Florida couple who got caught selling tickets to heaven , which generated this epic article :
Below are six more examples of crazy internet money making ideas … that worked !
1 ) Extreme Home Trade
Kyle MacDonald was a Canadian and one day he decided he was getting tired of having to run away from polar bears and having snow dumped on his head for 360 days out of the year .
He felt the best solution was to get himself a house .
Problem was , he did n’t have things like money , lumber or tools .
However , what MacDonald did have was a paperclip and it was red and beautiful and he figured he could trade that paperclip for a house .
So in 2005 he posted an ad on Cragislist offering to trade his paperclip .
A couple of ladies saw his ad and decided they liked his brand of crazy and offered him a pen shaped like a fish .
After such a suck - tastic start things were looking grim for MacDonald because as we all know Polar Bears do n’t give a damn if you have a pen in your hands because you would still be delicious .
Yet amazingly , over the course of a year he managed to make a series of trades that eventually had him meeting Alice Cooper and Corbin Bernsen who traded a walk on role on his show for the snow globe Cooper had given MacDonald .
Finally in July , 2006 he was offered a two story home in exchange for the walk on role .
MacDonald felt like winner despite the fact that the house was located in Kipling , Saskatchewan .
2 ) High Tech Begging
Bosnak was a Gucci wearing yuppie working in New York making a six figure salary .
Gucci ai n’t cheap though and she managed to rack up a $ 20,000 credit card bill right before she lost her job .
She decided that the best thing to do was beg people for money to help her pay off her debt because finding another job and paying off the debt herself seemed like a lot of hassle .
The problem was , she did n’t want to get her nice Prada shoes dirty by standing in the urine covered streets of New York so she took to the Internet .
Setting up a site called ‘ savekaryn.com ’ she told people about her situation and asked them to send her whatever they could .
Apparently nothing moves people ’s hearts more that the thought of a young woman dressed in expensive designer clothing and , inexplicably , money began to flow in .
Screw pictures of starving children , Unicef should be holding runway shows with starving models to raise money .
Within twenty weeks she managed to raise $ 13,000 from total strangers on the Internet .
Shockingly , she did not once have to send anyone nude pictures of herself ( she claims ) .
Between the money she raised and cash she got from selling her clothes and accessories she managed to pay off her debt .
Of course some people felt that she was just another self entitled , spoiled brat .
These haters were probably even less happy when she announced that she got a book deal .
We also doubt they will be going to see the movie being made about her story .
3 ) Tiny Little Dots
Alex Tew was living in England and wanted to go to University .
Unfortunately his family could n’t afford the tuition and waiting on tables was n’t going to cut it so he turned to the Internet .
Unlike Kyle MacDonald though
Tew did n’t even have a red paperclip to sell or trade .
What he did have though was a computer and the crazy idea that companies will pay to advertise anywhere , even on a site which consisted of a million pixels on one page with ads too small to be easily readable .
He put his plan in action by creating ‘ The Million Dollar Homepage ’ selling each pixel on the page for $ 1 .
At first we are sure people just laughed at Tew , and initially he only sold to friends and family .
The turning point came when his story was picked up by the BBC and suddenly his website was gaining in popularity .
When this happened he began selling pixels by the handful , or whatever it is you use to sell pixels .
This proved that people may love ridiculing other people for their stupid ideas but they hate feeling left out even more .
In five months the web page was sold out and Tew had made over a million dollars .
This was more than enough to fund his dream of attending University , which he did … … for one semester …. before dropping out , cause you know , screw it , he had a million bucks .
4 ) Purity for Sale
Natalie Dylan ( not her real name ) was a 22 year old with dreams of making some money to pay for college .
While she did n’t have any business experience or an amazing product to sell she did have some thing even more powerful , a new vagina .
It seems that she had managed to keep her vagina wiener free for all her 22 years and decided it was time to put her asset to work .
She hit on the idea of auctioning her virginity after deciding that the alternative , giving it away to some pimply douchebag for free , pretty much sucked .
She went to Nevada and enlisted the help of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch , a legal brothel , to get the word out that her goods were for sale as going door to door was not producing results for her .
After the story broke reactions were mixed .
Some people thought the idea was a huge set back for women everywhere , perpetuating the idea that they are just a commodity .
Some felt that she was actually empowering women .
However , the overwhelming majority of people just wanted to know if she was hot .
After a few months of bidding it was determined that the price for hitting it with a hot virgin in the U.S. is $ 3.7 million , which is way above the usual four wine coolers average .
The winning bidder was from Australia , but Dylan has apparently not yet sealed the deal though because he backed out after his wife found out .
5 ) Imaginary Houses
Ailin Graef was living in Germany when she started playing ‘ Second Life ’ the Internet based game where people log on to do pretty much what they do in real life , except they can pretend they are much better looking than they really are .
She decided that running around talking to other shut ins was n’t very exciting though and hit on a plan to make money off other players .
After finding out that people would pay real money to buy pretend houses and land she set out to become the Donald Trump of geeky loners .
Graef , going by the name ‘ Anshe Chung ’ , started buying ‘ land ’ directly from Linden , the game developer .
She would then subdivide the property and selling lots to other players at a markup .
She also collected $ 20 a month in stupid land tax from each player .
Somehow she managed to convince enough grown people to shell out money for the electronic equivalent of a doll house to make herself a millionaire .
People apparently like to buy from her because she keeps tight controls on her developments , which is apparently important when you are building your imaginary house .
This is understandable because the last thing you want is someone ’s fake balcony blocking the fake light shining on your fake patio .
6 ) Dirt . Seriously , Just Dirt
Pat Burke knew that it was stupid to think you could sell ice to an Eskimo .
On the other hand selling dirt to the Irish was completely plausible and so he started a company to do just that .
It seems that Irish people around the world really love Ireland , not enough to go back and live there mind you , but enough to spend money for a bag of real Irish dirt .
The dirt is shipped from a warehouse in Long Island where it is packaged by Hispanic workers , which really gives it that authentic Irish feeling .
People are paying $ 10 for a one pound bag of the dirt which is dug up from a field in Cahir , Ireland .
We assumed that the dirt would be put to a good use like maybe for growing a patch of grass in backyards or something .
Turns out that most of the dirt ordered is being used to fill holes in the ground .
Those crazy Irish are paying good money for dirt so they can throw it into graves during funerals .
One guy even bought $ 100,000 worth of the stuff for his own funeral .
We ’re no geniuses but we figure that for that price you could probably be buried in actual fucking Ireland with real leprechauns dancing on your grave singing ‘ Danny Boy ’ .
Still , something about the Emerald Island makes people crazy for it and the company ships about $ 2 million dollars worth of the stuff to the U.S. Every year .
Meanwhile in Cahir , some Irish guy is slowing watching a giant hole being dug next to his house .
What you eat affects more than physical health .
Two new studies have added to the growing evidence linking the stomach and the brain .
In a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers studied how junk food can trigger addiction behaviors .
The brain chemical corticotropin - releasing - factor , CRF , is linked to motivation , and plays a role in drug and alcohol withdrawal and relapse .
Researchers had rats eat normal food , then binge on sugar and chocolate - flavored snacks .
When the rats went off the junk , they expressed CRF , just as do rats going through withdrawal .
The rodents also had more anxiety and were less interested in normal food .
Another study , published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , looked at human moods .
Researchers followed 106 overweight people .
Half followed a low - carb , very high - fat diet , and half ate a high - carbohydrate , low - fat diet .
After a year , both groups averaged about 30 pounds weight loss .
And though both groups ’ moods improved after two months , only the low - fat , high - carb group kept up the good feelings .
So what we eat does n’t just go to our waists — it also goes to our brains .

[ The above text is an exact transcript of the audio in the podcast . ]
OTTAWA — A year that opened on Parliament Hill with the kind of political instability rarely seen in Canada 's history closes with a remarkable degree of stability absent in the last four years .
Ever since the government of former prime minister Paul Martin lost a confidence vote in the House of Commons late in 2005 , the main narrative in Ottawa has focused on seizing or holding power .
A year ago , that story 's climax was the creation of a historic coalition between Liberals and New Democrats , supported by the Bloc Quebecois , to take over the reins of government from Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservatives after Harper badly misplayed a gambit to cut off public subsidies to all federal political parties .
But the coalition crumbled and Harper , perhaps wiser for being so chastened , not only survived but his government seems to have prospered politically in 2009 .
The Conservatives were surprise winners in a byelection in Quebec ; the government 's economic stimulus package appears to be having the intended effect ; and , in a few weeks , Harper 's party will finally have a plurality of seats in the Senate .
" Though it 's Christmas , it 's more of an Easter theme for the government — resurrection , " said Tim Powers , an Ottawa lobbyist who is often tapped by the Conservatives to articulate the government 's or party 's positions on political talk shows .
" Harper 's firmly in control of the government and in control of his party .
This time last year , people were writing the prime minister 's political obituary .
Now , they 're seemingly writing ( Liberal Leader ) Michael Ignatieff's . "
Indeed , the Liberals end 2009 still searching for answers to lift their political fortunes .
Many thought the answer was Ignatieff , a hurry - up replacement after the party dumped Stephane Dion in the wake of the botched coalition effort .
Greg MacEachern , a former aide to Liberal politicians when Martin was prime minister , remembers that when Dion resigned , Liberals acknowledged that Canadians expected that party to " work harder . "
" A year later , unfortunately , the message is still true , " MacEachern said .
" A certain direction was n't working and now we 're doing to try a different direction . "
But MacEachern , like many other Liberal insiders and politicians , is hopeful 2010 will be a better year for the red team than 2009 .
" Absolutely .
I 've seen the signs already in terms of a concentrated focus . "
Ignatieff , by his own admission , has not yet lived up to the hopes many had for him .
In a year - end interview with Canwest News Service , he conceded that Canadians did not share his ardour earlier this year for a general election and he senses no change in that condition .
" I felt and I still feel that an Opposition 's got ( to ) get up and oppose , and so we did , " Ignatieff said .
" We got beat up a bit for it .
Canadians said very quickly , . . . ' we do n't want an election . '
And that 's the message we 're still getting . "
With the Liberals unlikely to oppose the government in a confidence vote in the near future , observers on all sides say they believe it 's quite likely that , unlike any year since Harper came to power in 2006 , there will be no call in 2010 to get the election buses ready or rev up a campaign airplane .
Over the years , this co-opted ancient - future blueprint for leadership has served me and the companies I have worked with well .
While I can't say that I have followed this path 100 % of my time as a leader , I most certainly have n't , but it has been a guiding light to get me back on the path of true and simple leadership that never fails .
Show Them The Way
Mission - where are you going , what is driving you , make it crystal clear
Ethics - what are the boundaries and river banks , teach it and emulate it
Character - be a trust - worthy and peace - full person , expect it and also live it
Focus - like a laser to achieve your goals which can be multiple and varied
Tell Them The Truth
Strategy - be clear about expectations and aspirations , both present and future
Performance - what are the possibilities and how can we individually exceed them
Feedback - openly and positively communicate what is working and what is n't
Transparency - be very vocal about everything vital to everyone 's success
Give Them A Life
Culture - create an environment where every person feels and is valued
Compensation - as much as possible , take worry about money out of the equation
Benefits - as much as possible , take worry about health and well being away
Balance - care about family and self - care as much as cash flow and profits
You do n't need a full business book to take these to heart .
Put this triad of twelve points in front of your leadership team or yourself individually , work through each one with your unique mission and your own set of values .
If you need help , let me know .
Simply , Tim
With the recent unemployment rates , everybody realizes that job security is important .
The best way to keep a job is to be irreplaceable .
If no one can maintain the code you write , you have a job for life .
Writing unmaintainable code is a special skill that seems to come quite naturally to certain developers .
For the rest of you , here are some tips and tricks to get you started .
First things first
It all starts with the job posting .
You should look for the right company , where you can spread your wings and achieve your unmaintainable potential .
You do n’t necessarily need to be the PHP guru in the company , but it sure helps .
Look for job descriptions that mention migrating to PHP from something else , so you know you ’ll be calling the shots .
Or , search for misguided jobs posts that require 10 years of PHP 5 experience , plus fluency in FrontPage and Netscape Composer .
Once you land the golden opportunity , be vocal from day one .
Speak up at meetings ; let your opinion be heard .
Talk about object - oriented design architectures , enterprise , shifting paradigms , how “ good enough ” is not good enough , and , of course , your personal commitment to excellence .
Make sure everyone consults your opinion on the important initiatives .
The pillars of unmaintainability
Inspired by the most excellent unmaintainable code — a must - read for anyone interested in keeping their job — here are two important concepts you need to grasp and master :
Make it impossible for someone to easily change something without breaking something else .
The maintainer does n’t have time to understand your code .
Maintainable code means being able to quickly find something , understand how it works , and change it without breaking stuff .
You ca n’t have that .
No one should be able to simply search for something and find it where they expect .
Your code should n’t look unmaintainable , because someone will suspect something .
It just has to be unmaintainable .
The code should look normal to the poor souls maintaining it , but take them by surprise when they least expect it .
Best practices
Ban coding conventions .
Endless flamewars have been fought over coding and naming conventions .
You ca n’t have that in your fine organization .
You have awesome projects to build , and you ca n’t afford to spend countless hours in discussion of tabs versus spaces .
Plus , conventions are restrictive .
If new hires are not used to your conventions , they ’ll be miserable .
Unhappy programmers are unproductive programmers ; explain that to anyone who asks .
Let everybody write in their favorite style du jour .
As for your own code , rotate your conventions .
Go camelCase on Mondays , all_lowercase on Tuesdays , mix - and - match on Fridays , and Hungarian on every February 29th .
No comments .
Your code is beautiful ; it does n’t need comments .
If someone ca n’t understand it , maybe they are not so good after all .
If , by any chance , you ’re forced to write comments , then simply overdo it .
Elaborately describe the most obvious and trivial code , and skip the rest .
//
In the following block , // we add two variables , // variable a and variable b. //
Both of them are integers .
//
Declare variable a , // and assign it the value 1 . $ a = 1 ; // Now , declare variable b , // and assign it the value 2 . $ b = 2 ; // Add the two variables , a and b , // declared and initialized above , // and assign the result to variable c. $ c = $ a + $ b ; Standardize on Notepad .
Let the others suffer and eventually leave the team .
You do n’t need to listen to them complaining all the time .
And , if someone asks why Notepad is the standard , be ready to explain .
It comes with Windows — the only OS for today ’s productive programmer — and it does n’t cost anything .
I ’m sure you ’ll find references on the Web that explain how you can use any editor , including Word , to write code for web pages , but Notepad is for real gurus .
And , after all , your company hires only gurus .
No unit testing .
Explain to anyone who asks that you are hired to write high - quality code that does n’t have bugs , ergo it needs no testing .
( A bit of Latin always makes you sound smarter . )
Why would anyone in their right mind spend any time writing useless tests that confirm the obvious , that the code works ?
Some things in life just are — the sky is blue , the sun rises from the East , and your code works , thank you very much .
Move on .
( Like with comments , if forced to do tests , be prepared to test the obvious , and skip the rest . )
No templating .
Templating helps separate business logic from presentation .
It may make the code maintainable , and you cannot allow that .
As Rasmus Lerdorf says , “ PHP is a templating engine ” .
Even if you ’re forced to use a templating engine , find a way to misuse it , and put little pieces of business logic in the template , and a carefully crafted mix of HTML , CSS , and JavaScript in the database access layer .
In general , strive for a healthy mix of PHP , HTML , CSS , and JavaScript , possibly on the same line of code .
Write PHP that creates JavaScript that creates HTML with inline styles .
If asked , call this “ encapsulation ” — your code is responsible for itself .
No version control .
It ’s hard to avoid , but it ’s worth it .
Demonstrate how it improves communication between team members if you talk about stuff , instead of relying on cold - blooded version control software to resolve conflicts .
When you fail to convince anyone , do not despair .
You do n’t have to commit it all to version control .
Keep some code to yourself — small but deadly pieces that will break the project if someone other than you tries to build and deploy .
If caught , explain how this code was not yet finished .
After all , you only commit code that can educate junior team members on exceptional quality and clever solutions .
These boys and girls look up to you and expect nothing but the best !
Build a framework .
When you build a framework , you inevitably become “ the architect , ” and your authority is unquestionable .
Plus , it lets you add secret conventions — and lots of them , sometimes contradictory ones — that will trip up even the most experienced maintainer .
Your framework will take care of everything .
No one should bother understanding it ; they should be happy you ’re single - handedly making development easier and more productive for the whole company .
Never release the framework as open source , because the framework is an asset to the company , and the open source community will poke fun at you , and that could be the end of your bluff .
Naming stuff
Your variables should be named mysteriously , often with only one letter .
The goal is to make it impossible for anyone to find anything with a simple search .
Class names and functions should be single - character names too .
When you must use a normal name , use it all the time — sometimes the best way to hide information is to have too much of it .
When reusing the same name — for example , “ subject matter - oriented programming ” — it also helps if you place parentheses and curly braces on new lines .
Claim this improves readability ; it also forces your teammates to brush up on regular expressions if they want to find anything in your code .
Consider the following example :
$ noodles = 1 ; class noodles { var $ noodles = 2 ; function noodles ( ) { $ noodles [ ' noodles ' ] = ' noodles ' ; } } function noodles ( ) { return new noodles ; } $ noodles = noodles ( ) ; var_dump ( $ noodles ) ;
You can also use strange character sets when naming variables .
Cyrillic letters are quite appropriate , because some letters look just like Roman letters , but they are n’t .
For example , what do you think the following outputs ?
$ alert = 1 ; $ аlert = 2 ; echo $ alert ;
Did you guess
2 ?
Not if the second $ alert starts with a Cyrillic а!
( Try it . )
Referencing stuff
Even if you define something normally , that does n’t mean you ca n’t use it in interesting ways .
The weapons to master include the following :
eval ( )
variable variables
variable class names , e.g. , $ strudels = ' noodles ' ; $ noo = new $ strudels ;
call_user_func ()
Any language construct that allows you to treat code as strings is your friend .
// calling abc ( ) ; $ z = ' A ' ; call_user_func( $z .'b C ' ) ;
Capitalization
Master letter cases .
Function names are case insensitive .
Abuse this .
function abc ( ) { echo ' abc ' ; } AbC ( ) ;
On the other hand , array keys are sensitive .
Abuse this as well .
$ a[' UseConvetionsOnlyTobreakThem ' ] = 1 ; if ( isset ( $a[ ' UseConvetionsOnlyToBreakThem ' ] ) ) { //
Lots of confusing code . }
Overwrite
Overwrite globals , especially superglobals .
Overwrite elements in the $ _GET array early ; overwrite them often .
Same for $ _POST .
Sprinkle some quiet $ _REQUEST overwrites as well .
If asked , explain that you ’re filtering input to prevent XSS , injections , infections , and other diseases .
Control structures
Mix and match all of the alternative if , while , for , foreach , and switch syntaxes .
If asked , explain that you ’re training the new hires to really learn the language .
All of it .
if ( $a > 5 ) : if ( $a > 4 ) { while ( $a > 0 ) : echo -- $a ; endwhile ; } endif ;
Nest ternary operators .
Nothing beats concise code .
// Guess the output .
echo TRUE ? ' true ' : FALSE ? 't ' : 'f ' ;
Inside the body of for loops , increment the $i once again to keep everybody alert .
Alternatively , surprise folks by not using $ i for loop increment .
Ever .
Nest loops .
Deeply .
Then , suddenly break out of them .
Statements like break 2 and break 3 are a pure joy to figure out , especially when mixed with strangely - indented code .
That ’s a start !
That ’s all for today .
I hope by now you ’re convinced that you can do it .
You , too , can write unmaintainable code .
Now your future is in your hands !
Can you afford to take the chance of being replaceable by writing predictable , maintainable code ?

Dear Debian women ;
It is with great esteem and supreme pleasure that I am here tonight to inform you that I hate you , your guts , and every female on earth who shares the desire to rebel against men , to disrespect men , and / or to take the creations of men and claim them as the creation of women or a joint creation of man and woman .
From this high vantage point it seems that whenever men make something great , after a time , worthless pro-women 's rights females come to latch on to that creation and claim it as a triumph of womankind .
These whores ( an assumption , yes , though I doubt any of you were virgin wives , if wives at all ) cannot allow man to stand alone in his technical abilities above females , females who are used to having everything handed to them due to their " angelic " sex .
Now we have debian - women , a feminist group that has latched on to debian by virtue of men's guilt for not failing to achive as woman has failed to achieve ( or perhaps men not giving a damn either way , and humoring you with a mailing list ) and demands that debian take on usless husks to even out it 's male to female developer ratio .
You disrespect men who are opensource / freesoftware developers such as I by comparing your worthless selves to us , the true achivers .
You moan and drop loads of feces , we churn out code .
With this in mind I cordially invite you to have an auto accident .
I hope it does not kill you , but instead rips your digits off , aswell as cause you to be blind .
If this does happen , and I wish such to come to pass , I will visit and smile .

Riots have broken out in Athens and Salonica during the first day of A. Grigoropoulos murder anniversary with police demonstrating extreme brutality leaving two people seriously wounded by a motorised charge on the Athens march .
Police brutality during the marches to comemmorate the first anniversary of Alexandros Grigoropoulos murder surpassed any limit today , in a coordinated operation of barbarity and crude violence against protesters across greece .
Under socialist orders police violence has left dozens of people wounded .
In Athens the protest march called at 13:00 in Propylea was attacked by riot police forces before even starting .
Protesters fought back erecting flaming barricades and forcing the police to retreat with use of rocks .
Protesters also occupied the rectorial headquarters of the University of Athens in Propylea , lowering the greek flag and flying a black flag in its place .
The march continued to Omonoia square where more clashes took place and several shops were destroyed - one consumed in flames .
At Syntagma square motorised police forces ( Delta team ) charged the march from Ermou street .
After the charge the Delta - team thugs dismounted and threw rocks at the protesters .
As a cause of the police orgy in violence , an elderly member of the Worker ’s Revolutionary Party - Trotskyist ( EEK ) has been reported to be in serious condition due to head injuries :
Ms Koutsoumbou , a veteran prisoner of the anti-dictatorship struggle , was hit by a Delta force motorbike during the mounted charge on the crowd .
According to Savas Michail , leading member of EEK and major radical philosopher , Ms Koutsoumbou is in intensive care having received far worse hits than during her tortures by the colonels ' junta .
One more man has been hospitalised with serious injuries .
At the time 60 people are reported detained .
In Salonica the 3,000 strong protest march turned violent when riot police attacked it without any provocation with tear gas and blast grenades .
Clashes ensued along the main avenue of the city .
The police surrounded some 200 protesters outside the Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace , but were liberated by the rest of the march .
The previous night the police broke the university asylum in the Salonica Polytechnic arresting 8 people who the authorities claim had attacked the International Expo with molotov cocktails .
The march in Salonica has not been concluded at the time of writing and the situation is particularly tense as the protesters are returning to the main avenue to protest against police brutality .
In Larissa the protest march proceeded through the main streets of the city smashing CCTV cameras , coming under attack by riot police forces .
The protesters errected barricades and engaged the cops with stones and other projectiles .
There is little information about the course of the marches in other greek cities .
At the same time , the 21 people arrested in the anarchist social centre Resalto last night have been charged under the notorious anti-terrorist law for construction and distribution of explosives ( beer bottles and two bottles of heating oil ) .
The protest marches for the 1st anniversary of Alexandros Grigoropoulos murder by cops will continue on Monday , while at 21:00 on Sunday there will be a memorial demo at the spot of his shooting in Exarcheia .
An eyeblink glance at the economy View photos
The economy has grown for five straight quarters , but there are signs that the recovery is still fragile .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Economists are in broad agreement that the Great Recession is over .
The American public strongly disagrees .
In a poll of more than 1,000 Americans conducted late last week by CNN / Opinion Research Corporation , 84 % of those surveyed believe that the economy is still in recession .
That 's a slight improvement from the 87 % who believed there was still a recession in the September survey , but it is almost the opposite view of the nation 's economists .
An official declaration of an end to the recession that started in December 2007 wo n't be made until next year at the earliest by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
But recent economic readings and surveys of economists all point to a U.S. economy that is growing again .
The economy grew at a 2.8 % annual rate in the three months ending in September , according to the latest reading on gross domestic product , the broadest measure of the nation 's economic activity .
While the economy continues to lose jobs , the number of jobs lost in November fell to 11,000 , the smallest amount of any month since the start of 2008 , while the unemployment rate improved to 10 % from 10.2 % .
And a survey of 43 top economists by the National Association of Business Economists in October found 81 % agreed that the recession was over .
The survey was taken ahead of that latest jobs reading .
It comes as President Obama announced Tuesday that he wants Congress to redirect a certain portion of leftover Wall Street bailout funds toward new job creation measures , including building roads and bridges , " weatherizing " homes to reduce energy bills and lending to small businesses .
Recovery ' only an economist can love '
But even economists understand why the general public does n't share economists ' view of current conditions .
Mark Vitner , senior economist with Wells Fargo Securities , said this has so far been a recovery that only an economist can love , given continued job losses and tight credit conditions .
" I think the end of the recession and beginning of the recovery is very difficult for Main Street America to see , " he said .
" The bad news is n't coming out as frequently , but there really has n't been much good news .
We 're stuck in some sort of economic purgatory . "
Vitner said part of the disagreement between economists and the public view of the economy is a difference in how recession and recovery are defined .
Economists believe a recession is over and a recovery begins when the economy has hit bottom .
" If you fall into a hole , the time that you 're falling is the recession .
Once you hit the bottom , the recession is over .
But you 're still in the hole , " said Vitner .
" Most non-economists think the recovery does n't begin until you 're out of the hole . "
In fact the survey backs up that disconnect between economists ' and the public 's views .
It found 46 % of those surveyed believe that conditions have stabilized and are not getting any worse .
But that plurality also believes that means the economy is still in recession .
Economic conditions of those answering the poll also affect the results .
" The recession has hit blue - collar families the hardest , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" More than half of whites who never attended college say economic conditions are still in a downturn .
Most whites who attended college say things have stabilized or are starting to get better . "
Few gains seen , more worries ahead
Vitner said that any improvement in the economy so far has produced very modest gains for the average household , as well as the broader economic measures .
So people are likely to feel like there 's a recession for quite some time .
" The hole is a very big hole this time and the recovery is very modest so it might take us a number of years to get out of the hole , " he said .
While economists are typically getting more optimistic , the poll found evidence the public is getting more pessimistic .
The poll found only 15 % believe the economy is starting to recover from the problems it faced in the past year or so , down from 17 % who saw improvement in the previous poll in September .
And it found 39 % believe the economy is still in a downturn and conditions are continuing to worsen , up from 36 % who believed things were getting worse in September .
And many Americans are still worried things could get a lot worse .
Asked about a risk of another depression , the poll found 43 % believing that was somewhat or very likely , a bit worse than the 41 % who thought that in a survey in the middle of summer , although well below the 59 % who feared another depression when asked in early October of 2008 .
The survey described a depression as a period when roughly one out of four workers were unemployed , banks fail across the country and millions of ordinary Americans were temporarily homeless or unable to feed their families .
Asked in general terms how well things are going in the country today , the outlook is more negative than the previous reading for the first time since President Obama took office in January , with 66 % saying things are pretty or very bad , up from 63 % among those asked that question on Oct. 30 and Nov. 1 .
Still , that is better than the 79 % who believed things were pretty or very bad a year ago .

The University of Pittsburgh has too much money in their coffers , I think it is time to share the wealth .
Their latest research project has proven the illusive “ Does music encourage pot use ? ” conundrum .
In a shocking revelation , it looks like it does .
So boys and girls , before listening to that snoopy dog or that ludicrous rap music , ask yourself if you want to be a pothead too .
Teens who frequently listen to music that contains references to marijuana are more likely to use the drug than their counterparts with less exposure to such lyrics , according to a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine study online now in the journal Addiction .
Source : www.sciencedaily.com
Really ? … REALLY ????
It took how long for you to come to that conclusion ?
“ Based on an analysis of survey data from 959 ninth - graders , we found that students who listen to music with the most references to marijuana are almost twice as likely to have used the drug than their peers whose musical tastes favor songs less focused on substance use , even after controlling for confounding factors , ” said Brian Primack , M.D. , Ed.M. , M.S. , lead author of the study and assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Pitt ’s School of Medicine .
“ Interestingly , we also found that exposure to marijuana in music was not associated with other high - risk behaviors , such as excessive alcohol consumption .
This suggests that there is a real link between the marijuana lyrics and marijuana use , ” said Dr. Primack .
Source : www.sciencedaily.com
I wonder why that can be ?
Possibly because alcohol is commonly accepted and marijuana is considered taboo .
If you remove the taboo , the kids will be less likely to try it and treat it just like alcohol .
I take it rocket science was n’t your minor .
This research seems to have a flaw in it .
It directly correlates music to marijuana , while ignoring the fact that those who smoke marijuana may seek out music with references to it .
This is something that is very true , especially in my case .
The research concentrates on Ninth Graders , but even at this age I had at least tried marijuana and would gladly smoke if I could find it .
After I started smoking , personally I enjoyed Cypress Hill for their references and searched for more music in that genre .
Military Regime Hosts a Party for John Bolton

Mark Leon Goldberg reports that John Bolton , the Bush administration ’s former ambassador to the United Nations , has a new book out .
It ’s called ConUNdrum — get it ? — and apparently continues Bolton ’s quest to shave several more floors from the U.N. ’s Turtle Bay offices .
But what ’s more interesting , Goldberg reports , is who ’s throwing book parties for the guy .
Specifically , the representatives of military juntas :
Fiji ’s UN Ambassador , Berenado Vunibobo .
He hosted a book launch for Bolton and [ co - author Brett ]
Shaefer at the end of October .
This raises eyebrows , shall we say , because Fiji has been under military rule since since December 2006 , when Commodore Bainimarama toppled the government .
Since then , Human Rights Watch reports that Bainimarama has consolidated his power and detained political opponents .
Fijian troops are even barred from participating in UN Peacekeeping missions .
And , just last week , the self - appointed Bainimarama expelled top diplomats from Australia and New Zealand who criticized his regime .
Remember this the next time someone — oh , John McCain , I ’m looking to you — pretends that the Bush administration was ever genuinely interested in human rights .
In fairness to Bolton , he never bought in to that flimsy pretext for flexing American military power .

" This is not a garden - variety insider trading case , " said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on Friday about his arrest of five men and a woman for insider trading .
Yet that is precisely what it appears to be , albeit involving more money and more prominent executives than is usually the case .
The evidence released so far most closely resembles the Ivan Boesky scam of two decades ago , in which the model for Gordon Gekko profited from insider information .
This is not another Madoff fraud perpetrated on innocent and unsuspecting investors .

DETROIT 
A government report released Monday concludes that taxpayers will probably never recoup all  or even close to all  of the $ 67 billion that the Treasury Department lent to General Motors and Chrysler in the last year to prevent their collapse .
The report , by the Government Accountability Office , estimates that G.M. and Chrysler would need to be worth a combined $ 121.7 billion , or roughly 30 percent more than their values about a decade ago , for the Treasury to break even on its investments .
The report said it already was assuming that $ 6.4 billion of the money lent to the carmakers before their bankruptcies would not be repaid .
“ Treasury is unlikely to recover the entirety of its investment in Chrysler or G.M. , given that the companies ’ values would have to grow substantially above what they have been in the past , ” the report said .
The companies ’ current value and recent financial performance are unknown because neither one is publicly traded .
The report said that G.M. had agreed to file a third - quarter and 2009 full - year earnings report by March 31 , 2010 , but that there was no such agreement with Chrysler .
Both companies must file frequent financial summaries with the Treasury as long as their loans are outstanding , however .
Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , has stayed carefully on the sidelines while a major argument has broken out among and around senior policymaking circles :
Should our biggest banks be broken up , or can they be safely re-regulated into permanently good behavior ?
( See the recent competing answers from WSJ , FT , and the New Republic ) .
But the issues are too pressing and the stakes are too high for key economic policymakers to remain silent or not have an opinion .
On Cape Cod last Friday , Mr. Bernanke appeared to lean towards the banking industry status quo , arguing that regulation would allow us to keep the benefits of large complex financial institutions .
Note , however , that Bernanke ’s quote making this point in the NPR story ( at the 45 second mark ) is from his spoken remarks ; the prepared speech does not contain any such language .
And Mr. Bernanke is wise to be wary of endorsing the benefits of size in the banking sector – the evidence in this regard is shaky at best .
There are three main types of evidence : findings from academic research on the returns to size in banking ; current and likely future policy in other countries ; and actual practices in the banking industry .
First , while academic research is not always the primary driver of policy choices , it is relevant when we can readily see the costs of big banks ( in the crisis around us ) but the supporters of those banks claim they bring important benefits .
In fact , the available research indicates that in the banking sector , economies of scale exist only up to a ( relatively low ) level of total assets , while economies of scope are elusive .
The benefits from diversification across countries or lines of business are also small ; moreover over the last few months we learned that correlations among different markets and asset classes increase rapidly during a crisis – thus reducing even more the benefits of diversification .
[ See “ Consolidation and efficiency in the financial sector : A review of the international evidence , ” by Dean Amel , Colleen Barnes , Fabio Panetta , Carmelo Salleo ; Journal of Banking & Finance 28 ( 2004 ) 2493–2519 .
Note that one of the authors works at the Federal Reserve Board , and all four work in a central bank or ministry of finance . ]
Second , policy in other countries matters because some fear that breaking up big US banks would somehow put us at a competitive disadvantage vis-à - vis big European or other banks .
But on this issue the European Commission spoke loudly this week – ordering the break - up of ING , and the presumption is that they will also soon put similar pressure on big UK banks .
Interpretations of this action vary – some see it as an implementation of competition policy , while others feel the Commission is ( rightly ) concerned about the unfair subsidies implicit in government ownership and support for large banks .
The Commission itself is being somewhat enigmatic , but the exact official motivation does n’t matter – the important point is that the leading pan-European policy setting organization , which does not rush into decisions , has determined that whatever the benefits of size in banking , the public interest requires smaller banks .
Third , in terms of actual business practice , any big investment banking transaction is done with a syndicate or group of banks – there is sometimes a lead bank with a favored relationship , but that role is definitely shopped around .
Take , for example , General Electric ’s October 2008 share offering , in which there were seven lead managers .
Or look at the prominent Microsoft bond offering , which had Bank of America , Citi , JPM , Morgan Stanley as lead managers and Credit Suisse , UBS , and Wachovia as “ joint lead ” ( in this context , “ joint lead ” is the junior partner ) .
If a nonfinancial corporate entity takes out a large bank loan , this is also shopped around and syndicated – even for medium sized companies – so as to divide up the risk .
Similarly , if a company wants to do a foreign exchange transaction , it searches for offers and take the best deal .
It would be unwise to rely exclusively on one bank – they will naturally hit hard you in terms of higher fees .
One area where banks benefit from size is in terms of being able to put their balance sheet behind a transaction – e.g. , to get a merger done they may offer a bridge loan , with the real goal being to get merger fees .
Bigger banks with a large balance sheet have an advantage in this regard .
However , this kind of risk taking is also what gets banks in trouble ( e.g. , in the 1997 - 98 Asian Financial Crisis ) .
In the past , both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs did not have large balance sheets but still did well in mergers and acquisition .
Goldman is an interesting case because it had $ 217 billion in assets in 1998 ( that ’s $ 270 billion in today ’s dollars ) ; it now has around $ 1 trillion .
Goldman was considered a strong global bank in the late 1990s .
Can it really be the case that the idea size for banks has risen so dramatically over the past decade ?
( Lehman had $ 154 billion assets in 1998 and above $ 600 bn when it failed ) .
For derivatives ( and other instruments ) it ’s important to have deep markets , but not necessarily big banks .
If you want to buy and sell stock you want a liquid market , and the same is true for derivatives .
If you are a large oil company , and you want to hedge future risk , your choices are :
1 . Hedge with a “ too big to fail ” bank , because you know taxpayers will bail you out and these banks are subsidized by their government support , so they can give you a better price .
2 . Or you can hedge with several banks to minimize counter party risk .
They then sell of some of the risk – taking take less risk themselves as they are small enough to fail .
If you were hedging you ’d prefer the “ too big to fail ” system because it comes with a nifty subsidy .
But this is not what the Federal Reserve should be supporting – Mr. Bernanke may still come out in favor of markets - without - subsidies .

Hollywood actor Charlie Sheen was arrested on Friday in the Colorado ski resort of Aspen on charges of domestic violence after reportedly attacking his wife .
‘‘ Carlos Irwin Estevez , also known as the actor Charles I. Sheen , was brought to the Pitkin County Colorado Jail for booking and incarceration following his arrest by the Aspen Police Department , ’’ police spokesman Jeff Lumsden said .

The name of the victim was not immediately released , but Hollywood press reported that 44 - year - old Sheen ’s arrest followed a domestic dispute with his third wife , Brooke Mueller .
After several entanglements with the law in the 1990s in cases related to drugs , domestic violence and prostitution , Sheen is now one of the best - paid television comedians thanks to the highly popular n series .
In 1997 , the actor was tried for attacking his girlfriend at his California home .
He has also been accused of assaulting his ex-wife actress Denise Richards .
Correspondent Jeff Ray sent in this story Milking the Poor : One Family 's Fall Into Homelessness ( The Atlantic ) which is representative of the trend in local government to criminalize poverty for its own enrichment .
Here 's the deal .
Local government has grown fat in a decade of gargantuan capital gains and real rising real estate taxes .
Employees pulling down over $ 100,000 each are legion , as are public retirees pulling down over $ 100,000 a year in pension payments .
Local government has added 15 % more employees even as population grew by a meager 3 % .
( The numbers may vary in your area but the percentages wo n't . )
Now the seven fat years are over and local government is not liking the seven lean years .
Now that housing has plummeted , so have the tax rolls ; capital gains have dried up and even sales tax revenues are crashing .
Despite the usual bleatings of hope , the chances of tax revenues recovering are slightly lower than the proverbial snowball 's chance of remaining frozen in Heck .
Foreclosures : ' Worst three months of all time '
Despite signs of broader economic recovery , number of foreclosure filings hit a record high in the third quarter - a sign the plague is still spreading .
Meanwhile , a perfect storm is gutting public pension funds .
More Pain for State 's Taxpayers , Cities : CALPERS losses $ 50B .
In order for the State amd local governments of California to meet their future pension obligations ( paid by CALPERS , the massive public pension fund ) , they need to kick in hundreds of millions of dollars more in coming years , even as their revenues are falling .
The conclusion that the medical and pension benefits which were promised in the fat years are no longer payable is anathema to public unions and managerial staff alike , and so the machinery of local government has geared up to stripmine the citizens like a giant trawler stripmines the sea : parking tickets have been jacked up to $ 60 or more , traffic violations are in the hundreds of dollars , speed traps abound , and as noted in the top story , fees for " crimes " like driving without auto insurance now cost more than the insurance itself .
And gosh forbid if you do n't pay on time -- the penalties double the original fine and then go up from there .
Is there anything more pernicious , malicious and immoral that this criminalization of poverty to engorge the coffers of local government ?
If John Q. Citizen defaults on his credit card , he might have to endure harrassing phone calls from bill collectors .
But worst case , he can unplug his phone or cancel that number and get another phone number .
Fortunately , the bank cannot have him imprisoned ( yet ) .
But local government is n't quite as kind and gentle as the bankers .
Mess with their revenues ( i.e. do n't pay the hefty fines they levy ) and they 'll haul your carcass into court and then into jail ( ca n't make bail ?
Too bad .
You 're a full - blown criminal now . )
Exactly what is the difference between racking up $ 1,000 in fines off an innocuous violation and being imprisoned for lack of payment and a 19th century - era Debtors prison ?
Is n't this part of the reason why the Parisian mobs tore down the Bastille ?
Does this make any sense at all , arresting people who can't pay their nonsensically stupendous fines and penalties just so government employees do n't have to take a cut in pay and benefits ?
When did a ticket go from $ 50 to $ 300 and up ?
And why ?
Does anyone think the cost leaped up " for the public good " ?
Is getting nailed for a ticket you can't pay really a deterrent to being too poor to keep your auto insurance current ?
Let 's follow this all the way to the end .
Now that John Q. Citizen is in jail because he was nabbed driving without insurance and a big fat fine is outstanding , are n't the taxpayers throwing away $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 a year to process his tortured journey through the Kafkaesque court and jail system with those other " dangerous criminals " ?
Hey , the war - on - drugs / prison / gulag pays very well , thank you , and filling cells with Mr. Citizen is just grist for the mill .
Now when Mr. Citizen is released ( darn it , we can't get blood from a turnip ! ) , his car has been impounded and he owes the towing yard $ 1,000 which he does n't have .
So he no longer has a car to get to work , or even drive to an interview .
OK , so maybe he was irresponsible in not setting aside enough money for the car insurance .
Is that now a criminal offense ?
Is this the best use of police officers , judges , jails and the " justice " system ?
Is anyone being deterred by the ruthless criminalization of poverty ?
Please make the case for that , local politicos and bureaucrats .
Great work , local government .
You 've not only stolen the citizen 's last few dollars , you 've also deprived him of his employment opportunities and livelihood .
Here 's a thought : you need more tax revenue ?
Then make the case to the citizens at the ballot box to pay more .
Prove you 're not squandering the tax money you 're already getting by the boatload .
Show us how you 're going to spend our money as carefully as we do .
If you really want to stripmine somebody 's cash assets , why not start with your local Wal - Mart ?
I can guarantee you they wo n't leave town when you enact a new ordinance taxing all retail establishments of 50,000 square feet or more .
Or impose a tax on all homes worth more than triple the median price in your zip code .
You want to nail somebody with higher taxes ?
Then go after the top 5 % who still have assets .
Do n't trawl the streets for the folks who can least afford your rapacious imposition of authority .
Bankers are n't the only rapacious greedheads in this nation .
Look no farther than city hall , the county building and the State capitol .
Just hope it is n't you who runs low on cash and gets nailed with that $ 395 ticket which soon morphs into $ 695 and an arrest warrant .
You can't blame local government avarice on Washington or the bankers .
All this greed is homegrown , local and entirely unnecessary .
As it stands now , 10 % or maybe even 20 % of the citizenry will soon have outstanding arrest warrants for what amounts to local government Debtors Prison .
Come November 2010 , we can only pray that the citizenry " takes care of business " at the ballot box , and all the incumbent politicos who approved this evil criminalization of poverty get tossed out en masse , regardless of party affiliation .

WASHINGTON — The United States government is financing its more than trillion - dollar - a - year borrowing with i.o.u.’s on terms that seem too good to be true .
But that happy situation , aided by ultralow interest rates , may not last much longer .
Treasury officials now face a trifecta of headaches : a mountain of new debt , a balloon of short - term borrowings that come due in the months ahead , and interest rates that are sure to climb back to normal as soon as the Federal Reserve decides that the emergency has passed .
Even as Treasury officials are racing to lock in today ’s low rates by exchanging short - term borrowings for long - term bonds , the government faces a payment shock similar to those that sent legions of overstretched homeowners into default on their mortgages .
With the national debt now topping $ 12 trillion , the White House estimates that the government ’s tab for servicing the debt will exceed $ 700 billion a year in 2019 , up from $ 202 billion this year , even if annual budget deficits shrink drastically .
Other forecasters say the figure could be much higher .
Barack Obama 's trip to Oslo to pick up his Nobel peace award is in danger of being overshadowed by a row over the cancellation of a series of events normally attended by the prizewinner .
Norwegians are incensed over what they view as his shabby response to the prize by cutting short his visit .
The White House has cancelled many of the events peace prize laureates traditionally submit to , including a dinner with the Norwegian Nobel committee , a press conference , a television interview , appearances at a children 's event promoting peace and a music concert , as well as a visit to an exhibition in his honour at the Nobel peace centre .
He has also turned down a lunch invitation from the King of Norway .
According to a poll published by the daily tabloid VG , 44 % of Norwegians believe it was rude of Obama to cancel his scheduled lunch with King Harald , with only 34 % saying they believe it was acceptable .
" Of all the things he is cancelling , I think the worst is cancelling the lunch with the king , " said Siv Jensen , the leader of the largest party in opposition , the populist Progress party .
" This is a central part of our government system .
He should respect the monarchy , " she told VG .
The Norwegian Nobel committee , which awards the peace prize , dismissed the criticism .
" We always knew that there were too many events in the programme .
Obama has to govern the US and we were told early on that he could not commit to all of them , " said Geir Lundestad , secretary of the committee .
Although Obama will not lunch with King Harald , he will see him on a visit to the royal palace .
Peace activists opposed to the Afghanistan war are planning a 5,000 - strong protest in Oslo .
The visit will test Obama 's rhetorical skills as he seeks to reconcile acceptance of the Nobel peace prize with sending an extra 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan .
White House officials said that Obama , who was planning to work on the final draft of his speech on his flight from Washington to Oslo , would directly address the issue of the irony of being awarded the peace prize while escalating the war .
The Nobel peace committee has been criticised for awarding Obama the prize before he has any major accomplishments in international relations .
A White House official said that it was not necessarily an award that Obama would have given himself .
I ’ve always been a fan of WWeek ‘s Music Fest Northwest .
The fact that it ’s a smaller regional fest in an era of megafests really creates a nice opportunity to get small venue experiences with up and coming bands .
This year MFNW features two of my absolute favorite small venue bands :
Monotonix ( listen to our interview with Monotonix ) , an Israeli punk slash rock band is a show not to be missed .
Monotonix ’s shows are a tornado of energy where almost anything can happen .
Monotonix sets up on the floor of the venue ( in this case it ’ll be at the Roseland ) and then they explode .
If you ’re going to see one Music Fest NW show this year , make it Monotonix , it ’ll be an experience you ’ll never forget .
[ Monotonix plays at The Roseland Theater on Friday Septemer 18th at 10 pm followed by Bad Brains at 11 pm it ’s one of the best double bills of the fest ]
Another ‘ band ’ that is extremely fun is Girl Talk .
While not technically a ‘ band ’ , Girl Talk will completely blow your expectations of what one guy can do with a laptop .
Bringing together samples from almost every genre and era of music .
It ’s amazing what gets mixed together , think songs like Elton John ’s Tiny Dancer ca n’t collide with Kanye “ Jackass ” West ’s Gold Digger , it can and will and the result is some of the most dancable tunes you ’ll ever hear .
It is absolutely impossible to see Girl Talk and not dance and his shows are some of the most fun I ’ve seen .
[ Girl Talk plays at The Roseland Theater ( 8 NW 6th Ave ) on Thursday September 17th at 11 pm with Brother Reade and Guidance Counselor who go on starting at 9 pm ]
Other notable shows to be on the lookout for :
Arctic Monkeys – Friday Sept 18 @ 7 pm Wonder Ballroom
Modest Mouse – Sunday Sept 20 @ 10 pm Crystal Ballroom
Also I asked Trevor Solomon , the festival ’s artistic director which band he felt was the ‘ hidden gem ’ of the fest and he immediately replied Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros ( Read the Review of Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros in Portland who play at Holocene on Thursday Sept. 17 @ Midnight .
Since many of the individual concerts are sold out , the best way to get in is to buy a Music Fest NW wrist band ( $ 60 ) which gives you access to all the shows of the fest from Wednesday night through Sunday .

Spoilers for Episode 5 of Game of Thrones follow .
Proceed at your own peril .
Last night ’s episode of Game of Thrones managed to sneak in a major reveal for the hit HBO series that ’s likely to become a major game changer in the episodes to come .
During “ Eastwatch , ” Gilly ( Hannah Murray ) asked Sam ( John Bradley ) what an annulment meant ( much to his annoyance ) .
She then proceeded to say the annulment was made by a Septon for a certain Prince Rhaegar ( Targaryen ) so that he could marry another woman .
In secret .
In Dorne .
Although Sam did n’t catch on to the true significance of that revelation , since he totally ( and rudely ) interrupted Gilly before she could name the other woman in question , the audience did , sending them into a frenzy ( we 've included a few Twitter reactions below ) .
What this means is that Jon ( Kit Harington ) seems to be the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark ( something Bran already knows ) ; meaning he ’s no bastard but a true Targaryen ( if Drogon allowing Jon to pet him was n’t confirmation enough ) and the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne .
Oh , and that makes Dany ( Emila Clarke ) his aunt .
Since Jon is the direct male heir , his claim takes precedence over that of Dany ’s , who has no idea she ’s not the only Targaryen left ( neither does Jon , for that matter ) .
What did you think of last night ’s new near - confirmation that R+L=J ?
As promised , here are a few Twitter reactions :
And here ’s the one from über Game of Thrones fan Leslie Jones :

Ssangyong worker is greeted by family member at the conclusion of the occupation , August 6 , 2009 .
[ See also South Korea : Graphic photos , video -- Ssangyong sit- in workers ' appeal : ` Our lives are at stake ' . ]
By Young -su Won
August 6 , 2009 --
After days of harsh and inhumane assaults by riot police and company thugs on striking workers occupying the Ssangyong Motor plant in Pyeongtaek , near Seoul , the Korean Metal Workers Union ( KMWU ) and management reached an agreement : the union accepted part of the company ’s redundancy proposal , saving about half the strikers ’ jobs , while the rest will apply for voluntary retirement or unpaid long - term leave , or accept another job with the spin - off company .
Union leader Han Sang - gyun apologised to the striking comrades for not being able to block the Ssangyong ’s whole redundancy plan .
He solemnly said the scars of the struggle will not be easily forgotten .
The strikers , including union leaders , were arrested by the police .
More than 100 workers are expected to be put to a trial .
However , the Ssangyong workers have done their best during the 77 - day occupation .
Though a full - scale victory has not been achieved , these heroic working - class warriors deserve the homage of workers across the globe .
On August 5 , ``battle of Ssangyong ’’ entered its final stage .
That morning , thousands of riot police , along with fully - equipped police special forces , as well as pro-company thugs , began a wholesale attack on striking workers .
In the air three police helicopters are dropped tear gas - filled balloons , and on the ground riot police encircled every plant that the workers had occupied , attacking workers with water cannons laced with tear gas .
A full - scale war has been unleashed on the strikers .
It was been 76 days since the start of the strike , and 18 days since the riot police began its full - scale attacks , with a truce during negotiations on July 30 - 31 .
In that period , management and hired goons blocked the supply of water for more than two weeks , and after the breakdown of talks , the electricity was cut off .
As a result , the strikers were driven into hunger and thirst .
Background – takeover to bankruptcy
When the impact of the global financial crisis heavily hit the South Korean economy , the immediate victims were workers .
All over the country a harsh wave of redundancies swept workplaces and factories , driving many workers out of their jobs .
In response , workers began to fight for their jobs and livelihoods .
In Pyeongtaek , 50 kilometres to the south of Seoul , Ssangyong went bankrupt again , after previous bankruptcies in 1998 and 2004 .
Eventually , after the bankruptcy of Daewoo , which had taken over Ssangyong earlier , the automaker was taken over by Shanghai Motors in 2004 .
However , in early January , after years of mismanagement , the company yet again filed for bankruptcy .
Workers were furious with management , especially at Shanghai Motors because workers had opposed the takeover by an auto firm that was both smaller and more backward in its technology .
The Shanghai management did not keep its promise of large investments in Ssangyong , but instead transferred the more advanced technology to its headquarters in China .
Workers were also livid with the South Korean government because it knew the dynamics of the farcical situation and did nothing but to stand by and watch the crisis unfold .
However , all the burdens created by management ’s poor policies were transferred onto the workers .
The so - called “ solution ” held up by the management was further restructuring of the company , including mass sacking of 2656 workers from the 7500 workforce .
New militant leadership
The Ssangyong workers ’ union , under a new militant union leadership elected on December 5 , 2008 , immediately rejected management ’s plan .
Historically , the Ssangyong Motors Branch , affiliated with Korean Metal Workers Union ( KMWU ) , was one of the KMWU ’s weakest branches , compared with more militant branches in other auto companies such as Hyundai and Kia .
Though the union belonged to the militant Korean Confederation of Trade Union 's affiliated metalworkers ' union , the Ssangyong workers ’ union had been dominated by corrupt pro-management leaderships that preferred the “ dialogues ” to strikes and industrial struggles .
However , as the economic crisis approached , the rank and file united to save their jobs .
Workers felt the need for a strong leadership that could fight the hostile management and the government .
This was an important turning point of the workers ’ struggle .
From partial strike to occupation
In early April , when management proposed to dismiss 2646 workers , Ssangyong KMWU initiated the lengthy struggle .
On May 8 , the company reported its plan of dismissal to the local labour ministry office .
In protest , the union struck the company headquarters .
In this period , the union went on partial strikes on several occasions .
In the meantime , management proposed the voluntary retirement program to divide workers .
Under duress , as many as 1700 workers out of 5000 production - line workers applied for early retirement .
Among them were pro-management foremen and pro-company union delegates .
However , management insisted on the dismissal of remaining employees .
On May 9 , three union leaders began the indefinite sit-in on the top of the high - rise chimney , in the middle of the plant .
These leaders maintained the sit -in for more than two months .
Finally , on May 21 , the union declared the occupation of the plant and an indefinite strike .
Thousands of the trade unionists joined the strike and occupied the entire plant in Pyeongtaek .
In face of the sudden takeover the plant , the managers were blocked from entering the plant .
It also gained a lot of support from political groups , other unions , social movements and community groups , who joined the struggle , staying in the plant with the workers until the police blockade on began June 26 .
Family Support Committee
Early on May 13 , wives of striking workers began to organise themselves in support of workers ’ strike .
At first , wives and children were shocked at the company ’s attack on workers , and were at a loss as what to do .
Many of families were hit hard as less than half of their monthly wage was being earned as a result of the partial strikes .
Soon , as workers were ready to strike , some wives decided to join the struggle .
They distributed leaflets and joined the union rallies , not as individuals , but as an organised group .
They joined the protests with unionists , especially mobilising the community ’s support .
From the beginning of the occupation , wives and children joined evening rallies in support of the workers ’ struggle .
In the course of the activities of the Family Support Committee , these women played key role of spreading the strikers ’ message to the public .
KMWU and KCTU
Most national trade union leaders have visited the plant , expressing their support for the occupation .
On June 19 and 20 , the KMWU mobilised unionists for a demonstration in Seoul , in protest at the South Korean government ’s anti-worker policies .
However , the labour movement has been quite demobilised and fragmented in recent years .
Thus , while the KCTU interim leadership rhetorically emphasised solidarity with the Ssangyong workers , in reality the KCTU ’s capacity to lead a national struggle has been greatly weakened .
The present KCTU leadership replaced the former leadership after it was forced to resign as a result of a sexual harassment scandal involving a KCTU official .
That crisis escalated with efforts by some KCTU leaders to cover up the scandal .
Thus , the striking workers had a very low expectation of the KCTU being able to provide systematic organisational support , such as industry - wide or regional strikes , not to mention a national general strike .
Everyday routine of the occupation
The occupying workers organised like an army .
As the government and management regarded the occupation as being illegal , at any moment a police attack was highly probable .
In a seemingly peaceful but tense situation , striking workers organised in defence squads , lived together , ate together and held rallies together .
Furthermore , in preparation of a possible attack , workers trained themselves in morning and afternoon sessions .
At the same time , the workers conducted democratic discussion meetings in order to share information on the situation and the process of negotiations , on the union ’s plan for the struggle , and so on .
In daily evening rallies , labour singers , dancers and entertainers held performance to show solidarity with strikers .
Workers and their families , who also joined the rallies , and had the chance to read out letters and their own statements .
War begins
As the occupation went on , management began to implement its plan of taking back the plant by force .
Ssangyong hired so - called ``security ’’ thugs and mobilised workers who were not on the list for redundancy list , with threats that they too would lose their jobs if the did not join the attacks .
First they encircled the plant and blocked the entrance gates , with the help of thousands of riot police .
From early July , the occupation was physically isolated .
On July 22 , riot police and management thugs invaded various parts of the plants in the face of the strikers ’ resistance .
As the management took back some buildings , including the headquarters office , the plant was divided into company - controlled buildings and those under occupation by the workers .
The workers ’ control and occupation of paint shops , full of inflammable materials , was a strategic advantage for the strikers .
During late July , the battle continued each day , inside and around the plant .
Though the workers were armed with steel pipes , Molotov cocktails and slingshots , they were overwhelmed by the enormous physical force of the police and company thugs .
Everyday , police helicopters were hovering in order to pour tear gas - laced liquid on the workers who were on the roof of the plant .
The toxic chemicals injured many workers .
Company goons indiscriminately fired slingshots with large iron bolts toward the strikers .
Under such unfavourable conditions , with no power and water , the workers survived on rice balls .
In the face of brutal attack , the workers were disciplined and well organised for daily combat .
Solidarity struggle
As the full - scale attack was unleashed , the KCTU mobilised support and political groups and social movements rallied in front of the plant .
They tried to deliver water and medicine , but management blocked any kind of assistance , with the police standing by .
On July 25 and 29 , the KCTU held national workers ’ rallies in support of the Ssangyong workers .
But the solidarity marches to the Ssangyong plant were blocked by riot police , and in the course of the confrontation – including air assaults by police helicopters combined with a ground attacks with water cannons -- scores of workers were arrested and injured .
However , the encampment of the Family Support Committee and other movement groups kept attempting to deliver water and medicine , and continued to hold rallies , press conferences and candlelight vigils .
Hundreds of workers and activists spent their annual holidays at the solidarity camp in front of the plant .
On August 5 , however , company thugs forcefully cleared the sit - in tents , and violently attacked workers ’ families and other solidarity activists .
Final offensive follows deceptive `dialogue ’
Under growing pressure from the community and public opinion , Ssangyong management began a dialogue on July 30 and 31 .
However , management had just one option in mind : the union ’s unconditional surrender and acceptance of the redundancies .
It was unacceptable for the union and the talks broke down .
As soon as dialogue was stopped , the company cut the power supply for the plants on August 2 and issued a final ultimatum .
From August 3 , the company began its final offensive in cooperation with riot police .
In the course of the battles , hired goons used slingshots under the protection of riot police shields .
On August 3 and 4 , the combined police - thug attack strengthened and the massive August 5 attack took back most of the plant , except the paint - shop building .
In the course of attack , three workers fell from the roof and were seriously injured , and a dozen of workers were arrested .
The police special forces used extreme violence , including taser ( electric shock ) guns and rubber bullets .
The remaining strikers were isolated in the paint shop .
Ssangyong workers have won the struggle !
Under the dark cloud of the economic crisis , all the burdens of Ssangyong ’s managerial failure were shouldered by the workers .
Without resistance , workers -- especially casual workers , female and migrant workers are easy targets and can be victimised .
Ssangyong workers rose up to fight back against redundancies .
For more than two months , they occupied the plant , combating the combined force of the police , management and hired goons .
The broad solidarity from their families , other workers , social movement activists and religious communities demonstrated the legitimacy of their struggle .
The battles in Ssangyong Motors were a proxy war between labour and capital .
Though the Ssangyong workers might have not been able to win all their demands under the bombardment of sheer brute force , they have won a victory .
Management , refusing to recognise workers as human , wanted to prove the uselessness of workers ’ struggle , but the Ssangyong workers exposed the naked truth through their heroic struggle .
This time , we may have lost a battle , but , ultimately , the working class will win the war !

If you ’re doing cocaine , chances are this story will not make you quit .
But it may make you think twice about your supplier .
A new report by the Centers for Disease control follows 21 cases of the otherwise rare disorder known as agranulocytosis , which is hallmarked by a severe weakening of immune function .
The condition is brought on by the drug levamisole , which used to be given to colon cancer patients .
It is also widely used to deworm cattle .
ADVERTISEMENT
Citing the Drug Enforcement Agency , the CDC report claimed that 69 percent of all cocaine seized at US borders contains levamisole .
The average concentration was near 10 percent .
Tainted cocaine was also seized in New Mexico and Washington .
While only one death is known to have been caused by the substance , the report warned that other cases may have gone unnoticed since the DEA first began tracking the increasing rate of levamisole contamination in 2002 .
Cocaine users , the CDC said , may be less likely to seek medical treatment ; and even if they did , the patient may not disclose cocaine use to their doctor .
As for why the drug taints such a large portion of cocaine in the United States , the CDC does not venture a guess .
“ The reason why levamisole is added to cocaine remains unclear , ” the agency said .
It added that levamisol was found in less than three percent of heroin seizures , and it was at much lower concentrations than those typically found in cocaine .
“ Some studies suggest it intensifies the high by boosting dopamine levels in the brain , ” Bloomberg News noted .
“ Other reports say it is used to dilute , or cut , the drug . ”
The CDC said almost all of those suffering from agranulocytosis experienced “ fevers and most also had sore throats , ” MedPage added .
“ Nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , and mouth sores were common .
A few patients reported pain and / or sores elsewhere in the body .

“ CDC has begun national surveillance for agranulocytosis in association with suspected cocaine or heroin use , collecting information via medical abstraction form and patient interview , ” the CDC added .
“ As of December 15 , eight states had agreed to participate . ”
If there is a God . . .
If there is a God . . .
UU World Magazine Winter 2009 , published by the Unitarian Universalist Association

In considering the topics of Atheism , Agnosticism , Humanism , and the nature of God , it seems good to start with some general definitions .
I capitalize here the terms Atheist , Agnostic , and Humanist out of a measure of respect for them as religious or areligious systems .
That is certainly arguable , and I imagine it will be argued .
I support you who do not capitalize in your lack of capitals .
I capitalize God except when I am specifically pointing out that there are a number of different gods that have been believed in by different cultures .
It is important to recognize that Atheists do n’t believe in any god , however , not just the Judeo - Christian God .
Atheist : Someone who does not believe in God .
There are many distinctions you can make among atheists — strong , weak , implicit , explicit , practical , theological — but the two major ones are strong atheism vs. weak atheism .
A strong Atheist believes it is certain and clear that there is no God .
A weak Atheist does not believe in God , but does n’t assert the lack of God .
Non -theist : Someone who does not assert a belief in God .
I include Agnostics , Atheists , most Buddhists , and many others in this group .
I generally reserve the term “ Atheist ” for the group that is really strong Atheists , and use “ non-theists ” as the catch - all term .
Agnostic : Someone who does not know whether or not God exists .
A weak Agnostic does not know if there is a God , but may feel they are still weighing evidence or will receive more evidence .
A strong Agnostic believes it ’s ultimately unknowable whether or not God exists .
Humanist : I ’ll borrow a definition from the Continuum of Humanist Education : “ Humanism is a godless philosophy based on reason and compassion . ”
Secular Humanists assert that Humanism is a philosophy and has nothing to do with religion .
Religious Humanists can see Humanism as a religion , albeit one that does not require a belief in God .
I put myself in the category of Agnostic and would call it a meta- strong Agnosticism : I believe we ca n’t even know if the existence of God is the sort of thing that can be known .
And I ’m a Religious Humanist .
I have preached a controversial sermon called “ A Humanist ’s Search for God ” and was told by some Humanists that a Humanist ca n’t search for God .
( I would call them church - going Secular Humanists , which seems like an oxymoron , yet I ’ve encountered many in Unitarian Universalist churches . )
As an Agnostic , however , I have some very clear ideas of what kind of god is possible , and what kind is not .
I have an absolute faith in this , and it ’s definitely a faith , because it ’s based on my passion , not on reason , if you want to make a distinction between faith and reason , although I reject such distinctions .
But my faith in what kind of god is impossible is not based in reason , although I ’m sure that a reasonable argument for my atheism towards certain gods could be based in reason .
Here goes :
If there is a God . . .
God does not choose the victor in football games .
God does not choose sides in human wars .
God does not save some people from disease while letting others die .
God does not “ bless America ” or any country .
God does not send floods , hurricanes , or other natural disasters to punish people .
God does not create diseases to punish people .
God does not appear to some people and not others .
God does not damn people for their sexual orientation or gender .
God does not damn anyone .
God does not demand belief in God .
I would say I am atheistic towards those gods .
And like all Atheism , in my opinion ( here ’s the fighting words ) , this is based on a passionate belief that goes beyond reason .
My heart and soul reject the idea that there could be a God who answers some people ’s prayers for life and health and not others , because I want to believe that if there is a God , God is good , and this would not match my definition of good .
I have heard people say that I do not pray or will not pray with people .
This is not true .
I do it all the time .
I just do n’t do the “ God , please heal so - and - so ” type of prayer .
When I am asked to pray for people , which I will do , I do not pray for God to heal them .
I pray for them .
I pray ( which is to say , voice my hope , directed to a possible God ) that they find the love or the strength or the compassion they need , in themselves and in their support networks .
I voice what we are grateful for , or what our needs are .
To me that is prayer .
And that is about as far as prayer can go , in my opinion .
It can give voice to things , name things .
That ’s about it .
If you hear me give the prayer at a dinner at church , you ’ll hear something like , “ Spirit of Life , we remember . . . ( insert negative things that are relevant — poverty , hunger , etc. ) , and we are grateful for . . . ( insert food , company , program , other noteworthy positive things ) .
Blessed be and Amen . ” Pastoral prayers in situations like the hospital often take a similar structure .
Which brings me to the type of God I believe possible .
I find it impossible to rule out the possibility of any sort of God .
Yes , the world can be explained without God , but that does n’t prove the negation of the possibility , or the lack of possibility that there is something more .
The God I believe could be possible would be a God that , if God is a sentient being , cares for and loves all people equally and with a perfect love that , ultimately , saves everyone .
More likely God is something more like love , or positive energy , or the greater sum of all the parts of the universe , or something we create together in the work of love and justice .
It ’s quite possible that humans do create God , and that God is n’t fully created yet .
Those kinds of God are possible , to me .
Adapted from “ More on Atheism , Agnosticism , and Humanism , and the Nature of God , ” September 17 , 2009 , at the author ’s blog “ Rev. Cyn . ”
It starts with a need to get out of England because the ruling class was making life hard for them .
It ends up as one of those myths that anyone can insert whatever truth they want into .
The story of the Pilgrims is a worth a hard look because we have a lot in common with them right now – a kind of blind faith that is dangerous not because it comes from optimism or morality but in something even stranger .
The Puritans arrived here expecting that their faith in God would be enough to deliver them to the Promised Land .
It took a nasty winter and about half of their number to die before they realized that they were , at the least , going to have to get a little more real about the whole situation .
They even asked the natives for help , a tacit recognition that they might not actually know everything about the strange new world they found themselves in .
This may seem like a cynical read of the events that led to the First Thanksgiving , and it is .
However , it ’s also well documented that the Puritans quickly figured out that Faith was not something blind and passive .
Rather than be simply given a kind of Promised Land , they had to hope that they were given the skills to create and realize the Promised Land around them .
Let ’s take a long look at what we , as a people , appear to have put our faith in .
It ’s not something like a deity that will deliver us , but more of a faith in the systems we have built up over the years .
They delivered us a good life for a long time , after all , so what ’s not to trust ?
The alternative is to either somehow be self - sufficient or know just about everything , neither of which are all that appealing .
So the best thing to do is hold on and trust that , as surely as this is a mild November , we ’ll make it through the Winter .
Yes , but if the Winter is a lot longer and harder than many of us are used to ?
If you want to really know the nature of the situation that we are in , I urge you to take a lot of time to read this blog post by Mike Shedlock of Sitka .
Go ahead , there ’s a long holiday coming up , and it ’s better than watching the Detroit Lions , I assure you .
The long and short of it is that the various bubbles we ’ve ridden created no more than about 330 k jobs over the last entire decade .
We ’re now losing about that many each year month .
In addition , about 2,500 k more young people enter the job market every year as the Millenial Generation comes of age .
We are unlikely to fall below 8 % unemployment ( as measured by the best - case scenario numbers we us , U3 ) for another decade yet to come .
This may seem like a strange situation to relate to the buckle - hatted league that created Thanksgiving for us , but as usual I have a point .
Thanksgiving is a holiday that celebrates not just a faith in deliverance , but a long litany of sacrifices and hard choices made by people who were forced to huddle together just to survive .
If the Puritans had stayed with a narrow definition of faith in deliverance by unseen forces , they would n’t have gotten as far as the big meal .
Is the dire situation that Mike Shedlock describes absolutely , for sure , going to happen ?
The short version is that no , it does n’t have to go down exactly that way if we pay attention to what ’s going on .
It should be obvious that , without any action , what ’s described here is going to happen .
The systems that have worked for us have given us a lot of justified faith , but this is clearly something far bigger of a test than that faith has ever had before .
People who tell me that the Recession is over , or indeed anyone who tells me that there is this thing called a “ Recovery ” that arrives without a painful “ Restructuring ” , are living in the early part of the story of the Puritans .
They are the ones who are n’t going to make it through the Winter because their story is one of blind faith and little else .
I do n’t really care what kind of degrees or positions they have , either .
The real story of Thanksgiving is how much more it takes than simple faith to get to the Promised Land .
It ’s certainly worth noting that , with the right attention to detail , community , and reality that we all can make it .
Our own kind of faith , in all the systems that make up our lives , might be comforting in the depths of Winter – but we ca n’t eat it or burn it for heat .
We need a little harder sense of reality and community to get through this .
Then , we can celebrate our deliverance together , once we get through this , with a big turkey or something .
Perhaps by then the Detroit Lions will even be worth watching .
Maureen Reed has experience with education , healthcare , and the environment .
I am sure that the other candidate , Assistant Senate Majority Leader Tarryl Clark , has done good things in the Minnesota Senate , but I suspect she has a considerable amount of baggage as a result of her role in the Minnesota State Senate that will be a huge liability in a race against Bachmann .
I can see the NRCC attack ad now against Sen .
Clark lambasting her for voting for $ 2 Billion in new taxes .
Americans cannot afford to lose to Bachmann again .
She can be beaten to be sure .
During the last election , 54 % of Minnesota Sixth District voters voted against Bachmann , but 10 % went to the independent candidate .
Bachmann can be beaten however only when the anti Bachmann vote can be solidified .
This is absolutely possible , but the candidate against her must be someone who will appeal to the broad spectrum of voters regardless of party affiliation .
Maureen Reed is such a candidate .
I am confident that once people have the chance to meet Maureen and realize that she is the real deal , the good people of Minnesota 's Sixth District will elect her over Michele Bachmann .
Of course getting the message out in the Sixth District will take a lot of hard work .
I hope you will join me in wishing Maureen Reed and her dedicated staff God speed .
The fight wo n’t be easy and it will be expensive .
Maureen has proven herself to be a viable candidate who is able to raise money , but she can use all of the help she can get .
If you agree that it 's time to get rid of Bachmann in 2010 and you want to help , click here .
Ezra talks about the importance to healthcare reform overall by having the strongest possible House bill in conference .
The part of Pelosi 's approach that people have n't really picked up on is that she 's paired the stronger public option with more generous subsidies and benefit packages , rather than leaving it on its own to dramatize the potential savings .
There 's a reason for that :
If the Senate wants to weaken the public option , this gives her leverage to demand that they put money on the table to maintain the benefit levels that the strong public option made possible .
In other words , the strong public option also gives her leverage to bargain for more affordability and better subsidies .
We 've talked about that a little bit here , what robust public option in the bill gives to Pelosi to keep all the stronger aspects of House bill that makes healthcare reform work for the consumer .
But it can't be stressed enough , and makes a good argument for when you call your member of Congress to ask her or him to give their support to the robust public option .
One thing that 's emerged over the last day or two is that there 's been some flux on the whip counts .
It always happens on key votes -- people hold out on stating their position , or may change their position , to strengthen their own ability to negotiate something for their vote .
So we do n't have exact counts right now .
But , we do know that they 'll be making the decision on which version of the bill to take into conference early next week , probably on Monday .
So that gives you the weekend to fill up some voicemail inboxes in the offices of those members who are the leaning yes votes .

The House needs to pass the strongest bill possible going into negotiations with the Senate .
All of the things that House members have fought to have included in this bill , not just the public option , will be best preserved with the strongest possible bill being passed by the House .
As usual , leadership needs to hear from us , too .
Here they are .
America has built a large part of its economy on homeownership .
Owning a home is part of the ever more elusive American Dream .
Yet over time , owning a home became a larger and larger burden as new buyers were required to take on bigger debt loads merely to buy a basic home .
Incomes were n’t rising so debt was the new subsidy .
The apex of the bubble was reached in 2005 although prices did n’t start falling in drastic fashion for a couple years later .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are largely to blame for inciting the biggest housing bubble the world has come to know .
Wall Street is equally to blame for creating the structure that allowed this to happen as they championed de-regulation and completely neglected any fiscal responsibility .
In today ’s article , I will dissect the housing market from every angle .
It is easy to get caught up in the day to day data but the bigger picture is usually missed .
Let us first look at the total number of housing units in the U.S. :
129,000,000 Housing Units in U.S .
Owner - occupied , rented , and vacant units
In the United States we have approximately 129,000,000 housing units .
These are made up of owner - occupied , rented , and vacant units .
The largest of these three categories is the owner - occupied category and most of the media focuses on this number .
Yet the other categories carry as much weight in determining a housing recovery .
Let us look at the vacant housing units :
The vacancy rate for both owner - occupied and rental properties is still near all time highs .
With so many sales , how can it be that this number is so high ?
I ’ll get into this later in the article .
But part of this has to do with demographics , the makeup of current housing inventory , and years of over building .
It is also the case that we are shifting a large number of would be renters into homes and causing the rental vacancy rate to spike .
Many of these apartment projects are financed with commercial real estate loans and the Federal Reserve is essentially shifting defaults from residential loans to commercial loans .
That is why we are seeing rents fall as owners compete to fill vacant units .
So now we have the universe of housing units including vacant units .
Let us drill down and examine the number of owner - occupied homes and renter - occupied units :
75 million Americans own their home .
The homeownership rate is derived from only looking at occupied units .
That is why it is important to also keep in mind the vacant units sitting on the market .
You ’ll notice that the ownership rate does not factor in the vacant units .
The vacancy rate is at historical highs and this is another factor that will drag on the housing market for years to come .
37 million Americans rent their housing .
This can be apartments or actual detached homes .
The number of renters has recently increased as homeownership has fallen :
The chart has a few patterns worth noting .
From 1985 to 1995 the homeownership rate in the U.S. hovered around 64 percent .
The only recession during this time was in the early 1990s yet the rate remained steady .
The first spike started after 1995 .
This trend went from 1995 to 2000 and pushed the homeownership rate from 64 to above 67 percent .
Part of this had to do with the technology bubble and the growth in the economy .
But then we hit the early 2000s recession largely brought on by the burst of the technology bubble .
Instead of homeownership declining which is typical in recessions , the homeownership rate expanded upward .
Much of this was due to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dropping the Fed funds rate to record lows .
Wall Street looking for the new - new thing , went from tech IPOs to mortgage backed securities and the toxic mortgage party started .
This easy access to credit and excessive risk pushed the homeownership rate to nearly 70 percent in 2005 .
But that was it .
The bubble burst and the homeownership rate is now on a steady decline .
While the above chart is moving lower , one chart is moving higher .
The U.S. home vacancy rate :
Rental properties always have higher vacancy rates merely by the nature of their use .
Someone renting a home is more likely to move than say someone who buys a home and plans to stay in their home for many years .
Yet the above chart shows an unmistakable pattern .
The rental vacancy rate from 1968 to 1984 hovered between 5 and 6 percent .
From 1985 to 1999 , it was in a range of 6 to 8 percent .
And finally , from 2000 to our present situation it went from 8 percent to 10 percent .
This is historically as high as it has gone .
You will notice that the rental vacancy rate dipped after the peak in 2005 since many people opted for rental units instead of buying a home .
Yet the pattern is still holding steady .
Now looking at the homeowner vacancy rate shows another story .
Too much building .
From 1968 to 2004 , the rate never crossed the 2 percent mark .
Now , we are closing in on 3 percent .
That rate may not be reached now that the market is shifting gears .
But if we do have another foreclosure wave , 3 percent is possible .
What happened here ?
Too much building and ignoring demographic trends :
From 2001 to 2006 home building was off the charts .
Single - family housing starts were up to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.8 million a year even though population growth did not warrant this amount of new inventory .
From 1999 to 2001 the rate was hovering around 1.2 million .
So 600,000 properties were being added each year above the normal trend and this lasted for 6 years .
Of course , this number has collapsed at a pace not seen since the Great Depression but why did it occur ?
People ignored the trend and demographics :
The above data exemplifies the housing bubble .
Each year roughly 500,000 homes are destroyed for a variety of reasons .
This of course is n’t discussed in the mainstream media but it helps to figure out a more accurate figure of what is going on .
Most households will buy their first home in the 25 to 34 years age group creating a demand of 1.9 million homes .
We also have homes hitting the market because of the other side of the age equation .
We have 11.6 million households in the 65 to 74 age range and 9 million in the 75 to 84 age range .
Life trend dynamics ( i.e , . death and downsizing ) add 1.1 million units per year to the market .
In other words , here is the breakdown :
Now this data is using trends up to the end of 2008 .
We were burning through 350,000 excess units per year at the end of 2008 .
Of course , housing starts have now collapsed and are adding new units at an annual rate of 500,000 homes .
So a significant indicator of returning to a healthy market is more linked to the actual vacancy rate .
In fact , adding up the units we have about 3 million too many units on the market over historical trends .
Depending on our current burn rate , we have :
3 million / 350,000 = 8.5 years
3 million / 850,000 = 3.5 years
And this is the time it will take at current rates to get to a more normal market if there is such a thing .
Yet the 850,000 figure is too optimistic because we now have a new factor in the mix in the sales data .
Foreclosures :
For the past year , each month over 300,000 homes enter some stage of foreclosure .
This is either a notice of default , a scheduled auction , or a home going back to the bank as an REO .
This number actually increases the length of time before we reach a stable housing market .
As you can see from the chart above , the rate is still at a record .
Now why is this the case ?
Think of the dynamics of a healthy market .
Those in the household formation age , sell a home and in many cases will buy a move up home .
This can be a new home or an existing home .
Either way , they are clearing some of the vacant inventory off the market with typically two transactions taking place ( buy and sell ) .
With foreclosures , it is normally a one and done deal .
Someone loses their home , and the person buying that home is merely taking over inventory that has already been accounted for .
This is why looking at foreclosure figures is so important .
Even in 2006 foreclosures were elevated .
If you consider that year as normal , foreclosure starts should range around 100,000 per month .
We are solidly over 300,000 .
We still have many more foreclosures coming down the pipeline with Alt - A and option ARMs hitting significant recast dates .
This will only make it harder for us to clear that massive amount of excess inventory just sitting on the market .
With nearly one - third of homes sold nationwide as foreclosure re-sales , the excess inventory is sure to linger for a very long time .
Take a look at existing home sale data :
I ’m taking the non-seasonally adjusted rate because with historical foreclosure rates , looking at typical data really does little in answering the real question of where we are going .
In September 472,000 existing homes sold .
Add in about 40,000 new homes sold and you are looking at 512,000 total home sales .
However , in the same month 343,000 homes entered into some stage of foreclosure .
Forget the data on HAMP for the moment since the 650,000 or so pre-trial loan mods means very little , the actual cure rates are extremely low :
We ’ll be optimistic and use the 6.6 % figure .
That means , of those 343,000 foreclosure starts 321,000 units are going to be additional inventory .
So even with 512,000 homes minus the 321,000 added units , we are not burning off excess inventory in any significant number .
And that is why the vacancy rate is still jumping and homeownership rates are falling .
It also does n’t help that mortgages are delinquent at a rate never before seen ( aside from the Great Depression ) :
Over 9 percent of all mortgage holders are now delinquent on their mortgages .
Of the 75 million homeowners 51 million have mortgages .
So that means as things stand today , close to 5 million mortgage holders are delinquent on their loans .
Since we are not seeing this in the REO data , this must mean the following :
( a) 30 + days late and no notice of default
( b) 90 + days late and a notice of default ( reflects in monthly foreclosure data ) – or 90 + days late and no action at all
( c) Auction scheduled
(d) HAMP – 650,000 in pre-trial
Yet the cure rate is at 6 percent and this is for prime loans .
We know that we have Alt - A and option ARMs coming due in the next few months and none of these qualify for HAMP .
Wells Fargo announced that they are converting over $ 100 billion in Pick - A - Pay option ARMs to interest only loans but who really knows if this will even help .
Already for the option ARM universe , some 45 % of option ARM borrowers are 30 + days late .
Conclusion
What can we gather from the above data ?
Home prices are falling even though data in the short - term might state otherwise .
This is due to artificial inventory figures because of mortgage moratoriums and banks not moving on distressed homes in a typical fashion .
There is an enormous amount of overhang in the market .
Using typical measures the data does n’t show up but does show up in shadow inventory data .
The reason home sales have increased recently is because prices have collapsed :
Why are we to assume that if prices go up , people will keep on buying ?
The driving force right now is affordability brought on by :
- Large number of foreclosure re-sales ( nationwide about one - third of all sales , in California it was up to 50 percent of all sales )
- Government programs including the $ 8,000 tax credit
- Federal Reserve buying GSE MBS – no one else is buying them
- Artificially lowering mortgage rates ( hovering around 5 % while 40 year average is closer to 9 % )
With all the above , we are merely treading water .
What we can gather from the above is we have years to work through this .
Also , the growing number of baby boomers shifting into retirement will also add to the additional housing units at a higher pace since those in the 25 to 34 years of age group are no longer having families in large size .
Many may opt to rent for much longer since some are delaying having kids until later in life .
In other words , the trend is not conducive to the McMansion world .
There are many factors to consider in the current housing market and it is my hope that this article helps to show the bigger picture of what is going on .
This is how I learned to stop worrying and love the housing bubble .

Knut Haugland , the last surviving member of the 1947 Kon - Tiki raft expedition , has died in Norway .
He was 92 .
Mr Haugland was one of six crewmen who crossed the Pacific on a balsa wood raft in the Kon -Tiki expedition .
He first came to prominence as a member of the Norwegian Resistance Movement during World War II .
He was decorated by the British for his part in helping disrupt Nazi Germany 's plans to create heavy water for its nuclear weapons program .
After the war he was recruited by the anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl as a radio operator for the Kon -Tiki expedition .
The cruise was made on a raft constructed from traditional materials and traversed 8,000 kilometres across the Pacific from Peru , demonstrating that South Americans in pre-Colombian times could have settled Polynesia .
Introduction
Until this day , jQuery is still blowing me away with its simplicity and robustness .
As you can see , I have been concentrated to produce tutorials about it , and I just could n't help it !
Right , this time , we 're going to learn how to create a news slider that come with the following features :
Slideshow with Image and description / caption
previous , next , pause and play buttons
On mouse over , pause the slideshow , and play it on mouse out
Sliding effect for both gallery panel and excerpt panel
Adjustable slideshow speed
And , finally , smarter script that will calculate width and height for the slideshow
We 're going to use scrollTo jQuery plugin during the development .
A huge thumb up and big thank you to Ariel Flesler who created the plugin .

Existing Tutorials
The following is my previous version of image gallery :
Simple JQuery Image Slide Show with Semi-Transparent Caption
And also , the concept that we 'll be using for this gallery , it works about the same with the folowing posts , if you want a better illustrated explanations , you can read :
j Query Sliding Tab Menu for Sidebar Tutorial , or
Create a Vertical , Horizontal and Diagonal Sliding Content Website with jQuery
Explanation
For this slide show , we will combine two sliding panels together , and use the timer ( setInterval function ) to animate the whole thing .
The image below will able to give you more understanding of the html / css layout .
So , there are several important reminders :
The size of the #slider should be the same size with the image
The total number of excerpt items must be the same with the total number of Images
You must set the width and height for #slider , because the script uses it to calculate the width and height for other elements
Z-index / layer order is very important to make sure everything is displayed correctly
Buttons can be removed or styled , if you changed the button id , you have to change it in the script as well .
1. HTML
#mask - excerpt is being set to absolute position and z - index to highest so that it will appear on the #gallery .
It 's possible to take the excerpt out , and make it something like this : DibuSoft mmdv .
Remember , total numer of # gallery items must be the same with total number of #excerpt items .
< div id =" slider " > < div id =" mask - gallery " > < ul id =" gallery " > < li><img data- src= " images/pier1.jpg " width = " 300 " height = " 186 " alt = " " /></li> < li><img data- src= " images/pier2.jpg " width = " 300 " height = " 186 " alt = " " /></li> < li><img data- src= " images/pier3.jpg " width = " 300 " height = " 186 " alt = " " /></li> </ul > </div > < div id =" mask - excerpt " > < ul id =" excerpt " > < li > Cras dictum .
Maecenas ut turpis .
In vitae erat ac orci dignissim eleifend .
</ li > < li>Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas .
</ li > < li >Nunc quis justo .
Sed vel ipsum in purus tincidunt pharetra .
</ li > </ul > </div> </div > < div id =" buttons " > < a href= " # " id =" btn - prev " > prev < /a > < a href= " # " id =" btn- pause " > pause < /a> < a href= " # " id =" btn- play " > play < / a> < a href= " # " id =" btn- next " >
next </a> </div >
2. CSS
This time , CSS is a bit complicated , therefore , I have added line comments to further elaborate it .
Refer the to previous illustration , we have to make sure the z - index / layer order are being set correctly , and also float : left for the #gallery so that the items are arranged horizontally .
For the #excerpt , we do n't have to set the float , because we want it display vertically .
The arrangement of the items will decide the scrolling direction .
The arrangment of items are further elabrated in this tutoria - Create a Vertical , Horizontal and Diagonal Sliding Content Website with jQuery
#slider { /*
You MUST specify the width and height */ width :300 px ; height : 186 px ; position : relative ; overflow : hidden ; } #mask - gallery { overflow : hidden ; } #gallery { /*
Clear the list style */ list - style : none ; margin:0 ; padding : 0 ; z - index : 0 ; /* width = total items multiply with #mask gallery width */ width :900 px ; overflow : hidden ; } # gallery li { /* float left , so that the items are arrangged horizontally */ float : left ; } #mask - excerpt { /*
Set the position */ position : absolute ; top:0 ; left:0 ; z - index : 500 ; /* width should be lesser than # slider width */ width : 100 px ; overflow : hidden ; } #excerpt { /* Opacity setting for different browsers */ filter:alpha( opacity=60 ) ; -moz-opacity :0.6 ; - khtml- opacity : 0.6 ; opacity : 0.6 ; /* Clear the list style */ list - style : none ; margin:0 ; padding:0 ; /*
Set the position */ z - index : 10 ; position : absolute ; top:0 ; left:0 ; /*
Set the style */ width : 100 px ; background - color : #000 ; overflow : hidden ; font - family : arial ; font - size : 10 px ; color : # fff ; } #excerpt li { padding : 5 px ; } .clear { clear : both ; }
3. Javascript
We 've created a function called newsslider .
Each time you call it , it will scroll to the next / prev item .
This function accepts a parameter called " prev " , if you set it to 1 / true , it scrolls to previous item , otherwise , it will scroll to the next item .
To animate the news slider , we use a timer called setInterval function , and you can set the speed by assigning the interval value in miliseconds .
It 's that simple .
Right , the following is the script and as usual , I have put comments in every lines to assist you . :)
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { //Speed of the slideshow var speed = 5000 ; // You have to specify width and height in #slider CSS properties // After that , the following script will set the width and height accordingly $ ( ' # mask - gallery , # gallery li ' ) .
width ( $ ( '# slider ' ) .
width ( ) ) ; $ ( ' # gallery ' ) .
width ( $ ( '# slider ' ) .
width ( ) * $ ( ' # gallery li' ) . length ) ; $ ( ' # mask - gallery , # gallery li , # mask - excerpt , # excerpt li ' ) . height ( $ ( '# slider ' ) .
height ( ) ) ; // Assign a timer , so it will run periodically var run = setInterval ( ' newsslider ( 0 ) ' , speed ) ; $ ( ' # gallery li:first , # excerpt li:first ' ) .addClass ( ' selected ' ) ; // Pause the slidershow with clearInterval $ ( ' #btn- pause ' ) .click ( function ( ) { clearInterval ( run ) ; return false ; } ) ; //Continue the slideshow with setInterval $ ( ' #btn-play ' ) .click ( function ( ) { run = setInterval ( ' newsslider ( 0 ) ' , speed ) ; return false ; } ) ; // Next Slide by calling the function $ ( ' #btn-next ' ) .click ( function ( ) { newsslider ( 0 ) ; return false ; } ) ; // Previous slide by passing prev=1 $ ( ' # btn- prev ' ) .click ( function ( ) { newsslider ( 1 ) ; return false ; } ) ; // Mouse over , pause it , on mouse out , resume the slider show $ ( ' # slider ' ) .
hover ( function ( ) { clearInterval ( run ) ; } , function ( ) { run = setInterval ( ' newsslider ( 0 ) ' , speed ) ; } ) ; } ) ; function newsslider ( prev ) { // Get the current selected item ( with selected class ) , if none was found , get the first item var current_image = $ ( ' # gallery li.selected ' ) .
length ?
$ ( ' # gallery li.selected ' ) : $ ( ' # gallery li:first ' ) ; var current_excerpt = $ ( ' # excerpt li.selected ' ) .
length ? $ ( ' # excerpt li.selected ' ) : $ ( ' # excerpt li:first ' ) ; //if prev is set to 1 ( previous item ) if ( prev ) { // Get previous sibling var next_image = ( current_image.prev ( ) .length ) ? current_image.prev( ) : $ ( ' # gallery li:last ' ) ; var next_excerpt = ( current_excerpt.prev ( ) .length ) ? current_excerpt.prev( ) : $ ( ' # excerpt li:last ' ) ; // if prev is set to 0 ( next item ) } else { // Get next sibling var next_image = ( current_image.next ( ) .length ) ? current_image.next ( ) : $ ( ' # gallery li:first ' ) ; var next_excerpt = ( current_excerpt.next ( ) .length ) ? current_excerpt.next ( ) : $ ( ' # excerpt li:first ' ) ; } // clear the selected class $ ( ' # excerpt li , # gallery li').removeClass (' selected ' ) ; //reassign the selected class to current items next_image.addClass (' selected ' ) ; next_excerpt.addClass(' selected ' ) ; // Scroll the items $ ('#mask-gallery ') .scrollTo(next_image , 800 ) ; $ ('#mask-excerpt').scrollTo(next_excerpt , 800 ) ; }
4. Pagination Addon Mod
Due to popular demand , I added a function called " goto " which allow you to go to a specific item .
The following is the changes list :
Added a function called " goto "
In the html , you need to add " item class " to the image list and excerpt list .
For example , both first image and description must have the same class name called : item1 .
Added link list for the numbering .
Add two functions into the javascript :
The first one is for the link , and the second function is to navigate the slider .
// Put this inside $ ( document ) .ready ( ) // For link / number button $ ( ' # links a' ) .click ( function () { // stop the slide show clearInterval ( run ) ; // go to the item goto ( '.' + $ ( this ) . attr( 'rel ' ) ) ; //resume the slideshow run = setInterval ( ' newsscoller ( 0 ) ' , speed ) ; return false ; } ) ; // Add this function after newslider function function goto ( item ) { $ (' #mask-gallery ') .scrollTo(item , 800 ) ; $ ('#mask-excerpt ') .scrollTo(item , 800 ) ; $ ( item ) .addClass (' selected ' ) ; }
Due to time constraint , the javascript wo n't generate the Link by itself , so you will have to add the links .
This is how you should add the code :
# gallery list : the first item should call item1 , second , item2 and so on .
#excerpt list : the first item should call item1 , second , item2 and so on .
# links : the first link should have an attribute rel set to item1 , second , item2 and so on .
< div id =" slider " > < div id =" mask - gallery " > < ul id =" gallery " > < li class = " item1 " >< img data- src= " images /pier1.jpg " width = " 300 " height = " 186 " alt = " " /></li> < li class = " item2 " >< img data- src= " images /pier2.jpg " width = " 300 " height = " 186 " alt = " " /></li> < li class = " item3 " >< img data- src= " images/pier3.jpg " width = " 300 " height = " 186 " alt = " " /></li> </ul > </div > < div id =" mask - excerpt " > < ul id =" excerpt " > < li class = " item1 " >
Cras dictum .
Maecenas ut turpis .
In vitae erat ac orci dignissim eleifend .</ li > < li class = " item2 " >
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas . </ li > < li class = " item3 " >
Nunc quis justo .
Sed vel ipsum in purus tincidunt pharetra .
</ li > </ul > </div> </div > < div id =" buttons " > < a href= " # " id =" btn - prev " > prev < /a > < a href= " # " id =" btn- pause " > pause < /a> < a href= " # " id =" btn- play " > play < / a> < a href= " # " id =" btn- next " > next </a> </div > < div id =" links " > < a href= " # " rel= " item1 " > 1</a > < a href= " # " rel= " item2 " > 2</a > < a href= " # " rel= " item3 " >
3</a> </div > < div class= " clear " ></div >

Peter LaBarbera is right ;
In other news : Yes , you read prior sentence correctly
by Jeremy Hooper
Peter LaBarbera has done us all a service today .
For reals .
Because in a passionate letter that he has fired off to the entire " pro-family " community , Pete has pointed out the great divisions and abject hypocrisy that will soon dismantle the anti-gay religious right .
The same kinds of things we point out every single day , albeit from Pete 's decidedly anti-everything - we - stand - for perspective .
On the hypocrisy front :
He highlights the truth , which is that the " mainstream " anti-LGBT groups absolutely use their more rogue allies whenever it 's convenient , yet toss them aside like day - old holy water :
If churches back “ gay rights ” ( and the LDS is hardly the first ) , is there some truth to the idea that those of us who remain opposed to ALL aspects of the “ GLBT agenda ” are “ bigots ” or somehow extreme in our worldview ?
And let ’s be honest : our movement has already begun to ostracize its most principled warriors : I notice that everyone [ in the pro-family movement ] loves to use Brian Camenker ’s and Amy Contrada ’s indispensable , firsthand research but strangely some fail to credit MassResistance for their work .
( They ’re too “ homophobic , ” I guess . )
Pete 's totally right about this willingness for his movement to embrace and drop its players with opportunistic ease , something that his pal Linda Harvey also pointed out this week .
It 's just like we saw in Maine .
In February of 2009 , the " mainstream " Family Research Council and most all of the key players of what would eventually become the Stand For Marriage Maine coalition were on hand at a banquet to fete Mike Heath and his decidedly more extreme Christian Civil League / Maine Family Policy Council group .
But then when the campaign began in earnest , they could not get rid of Mike fast enough ( a point not lost on Heath himself ) .
Or just look at the aforementioned MassResistance group .
The organized anti-marriage troops have built two campaigns now around the story of Robb and Robin Wirthlin .
Well guess who discovered and brought the Wirhtlins into public light .
Yes , that 's right : MR's Brian Camenker and Amy Contrada .
But you will never see MassResistance ( which the SPLC designates as a hate group ) used in any of the fallacious education ads that the opposition uses against marriage equality advocates .
Why do you think that is ?
If they have nothing to hide , then why do they insist on hiding their most willing troops ( some of whom dedicate far more to the anti-LGBT cause than do the paycheck - collecters at groups like FRC or FOF ) ?
Or just look at Peter himself .
On the same day that he held his " yes on 1 " press conference in Maine , earning the ire and repudiation of the " official " campaign , Peter appeared on Janet Proter 's homo - hostile radio show .
And who was Pete 's fellow guest on that very same day ?
Yes , that 's right : Maggie Gallagher , the lead figurehead of the National Organization For Marriage , who we all know was the " yes on 1 " campaign 's largest donor .
How is anyone supposed to determine who is the " nice " backer of bias , and who is the " extreme " one ?!
It 's a whole host of hypocrisy that leads us to ask questions similar to one that Pete raises in his letter :
If homosexuality ( sodomy ) is truly a crime against nature ( and implicitly nature ’s God ) , as Noah Webster defined it in 1828 , and liberties truly come from God as I trust we all believe , then how can we possibly acquiesce to “ rights ” based on sin and perversion and keep our credibility as truth - tellers ?
Our adjusted questions :
Do the organized " pro-family " players truly believe that we gay folk are crimes against nature ?
Do they believe that even minor rights are out of line ?
Do they support the principles of Peter and his more - willing - to - enrage brethren ?
And the most important question of all :
When will the movement that prides itself on moral high ground have the fortitude to dance with the ones who brung 'em ?
* Peter 's full letter : Mormon Church Decision to Embrace Pro-Homosexual Laws Could Presage Split in Pro-Family Movement [ AFTAH ]
Your thoughts
The other big elephant in the room is , now that the anti-gays have " decided " that " gay is ok " , or at least that " vile LaBarBearian anti- gay hatred is not ok " , how can they continue to deny us the rights , responsibilities and protections of marriage ?
They can't sell Peter 's brand of hatred to the public , ( and increasingly , not even to their own hordes ) , so how soon will it be that they are no longer able to sell their equally vile , and unsupportable brand of bias ?
Posted by : Dick Mills | Nov 13 , 2009 4:42:09 PM
Yup .
He 's right .
His allies are moving away from The Peter 's brand of extremism .
And in the not too distant future they will be as polarizing and radical as Paul Cameron .
Because ultimately even the anti-gays who are genuinely driven by their religious beliefs wo n't want to put up with lies and hatred .
That conflicts with the way they see themselves .
Currently religious anti-gays do n't want to be associated with the rhetoric of the wing - nuts , but they still are willing to accept their claims as Christian Truth .
Just as for a while they shunned Cameron but repeated his bogus lies .
But as MASSresistence and The Peter come to be recognized as motivated by hatred , other anti-gays will be less likely to accept their claims at face value .
And when they look into the real stories of the Wirthlins and the Parkers , soon those stories will drop from the litany of horrors that marriage equality will produce .
And in time , Peter loses .
Because his entire campaign is based on dishonesty , hatred , and combative non-Christian behavior .
And in time , good people - even those who do not yet agree with us - will want nothing to do with him .

Anyone else notice LaBarbera 's connecting Homosexuality and sodomy ?
By definition they are not one and the same and LaBarbera openly contradicts that truth ... and his supporters are not only ignorant to that , but they agree with him as well !
Linking being gay to gay sex ( which many heteros - and some homos - find icky ! ) is the true issue that needs to addressed .

" Do the organized " pro-family " players truly believe that we gay folk are crimes against nature ? "
I 've have always found the " against nature " argument to be a rather foolish one .
It 's based on the premise that if something does n't occur in nature then that something goes against natural law , or as LaBarbera puts it , is a crime against nature .
Considering the fact that homosexuality has indeed been documented in some 1500 species , one only needs to compare that to the number of species in which religion has been documented in to follow that premise to it 's rather ironic conclusion ...
Posted by : Mitchell Devlin | Nov 13 , 2009 10:41:25 PM
Fuck him ... fuck him in the ear ?
Are you saying that you want him to have a prick up his ear ?

You know what else is against nature ?
Mechanical refrigeration !
And toilets !
I 'll take my human freewill over Mr. LaBarbera 's pronouncements ( likely typed - gasp - on a computer ) any day .

They may be moving away from Peter 's brand of bigotry , but that just means that they are moving into the brand of bigotry that has plagued races and nationalities since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , and it is subtle heterosexism disguised as concern for the welfare of others while stabbing them in the back legislatively with corrosive acts such as state constitutional amendments .

WASHINGTON 
In a blistering new attack , the health insurance industry said Sunday that health care legislation drafted by Senate Democrats would drive up premiums , rather than making coverage more affordable , as the White House contends .
A lobby for the industry , America ’s Health Insurance Plans , focused its criticism on a bill likely to be approved Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee .
“ The overall impact will be to increase the cost of private insurance coverage for individuals , families and businesses above what these costs would be in the absence of reform , ” said Karen M. Ignagni , president of the trade association .
Democratic aides on the Finance Committee disputed the conclusion .
They said the bill would provide tax credits to millions of people to help them afford coverage .
Moreover , they said , people could keep the coverage they now have if they wanted .
In addition , they said , some provisions of the bill would reduce the administrative costs of insurance .

Summary : New Delhi [ India ] , June 30 ( ANI ) :
Two top of the table teams in the ICC 's one - day international rankings , India and England , are set to vie each other in an ineluctable World Cup clash on Sunday .
Le renforcement de l'autonomie du pouvoir judiciaire s'avere donc le prelude ineluctable d'une telle ebauche , tout en mettant l'accent sur l'importance de la refonte de ce secteur vitale dans la vie contemporaine du royaume , en vue de recouvrer les rails de la democratisation et de la modernisation .
It is now an ineluctable fact that we have become , via our incompetent governments , the softest touch of any other country , simply squandering taxpayers ' money with this quixotic generosity to other countries , countries that look after their own people far better than we do here in the UK .
The speech vividly showed Locsin 's ineluctable abhorrence for any act aimed at disparaging not only a person 's honor but also his own country's .
They further underlined that it is ineluctable for the Arab world to press for a fair settlement to the Palestinian issue in a way that could ensure the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , it added .
Despite the ineluctable decline that followed , Egypt 's film industry remained the world 's third largest up until the 1980s .
the ineluctable relationship between action and its downstream
That is why it is so gladdening whenever I am passing by in town to hear members of the younger generation of my own community , the Luo , arguing not only with one another but also with age - mates of other ethnic communities in a kind of Kiswahili that flows as effortlessly and as poetically as the Athi , the Kuja , the Mara , the Nzoia , the Sare , the Tana and the Yala .
For that fact has ineluctable implications .
Mr Barnier said that Britain had to accept the " ineluctable consequences " of its own decision to quit the EU .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - British Airways cabin crew called a strike on Monday , hours after the airline revealed a 3.7 billion pound ( $ 6 billion ) hole in its pension fund that will require deft handling if a proposed merger with Iberia is to stay on track .

“ The strike will take place over 12 days from December 22 but we have taken the decision , which will disrupt the travel plans of thousands of people , with a heavy heart , ” a Unite spokesman told reporters .
“ Of the staff balloted 92.5 percent voted in favor of industrial action . ”
BA shares , which have fallen 9 percent in the past three months , closed down 0.1 percent at 201 pence on Monday , valuing the business at around 2.3 billion pounds .
The Unite union balloted some 13,000 cabin crew members on industrial action as part of a dispute over job losses and changes to working practices .
BA wants three quarters of its crew to accept a pay rise of between 2 and 7 percent this year , which will be frozen next year , and for 3,000 staff to switch to part - time working , along with a reduction in onboard crewing levels from 15 to 14 on long - haul flights from London Heathrow .
“ A strike is senseless and we urge Unite to draw back .
We will not be reversing our changes to onboard crew numbers .
Unite must understand that there can be no return to the old , inefficient ways if we want to ensure long - term survival , ” said BA ’s chief executive Willie Walsh .
The strike could cost BA around 50 million pounds in lost revenues and refunds , analysts say .
BA would have expected to fly around 1 million passengers over the strike dates , with the decision likely to boost ticket sales on rival airlines as passengers look for alternatives .

“ Unite ’s decision will damage BA in the short - term and could damage the future viability of the airline , ” Walsh said .
Walsh has said changes at the airline , which analysts believe is losing 1.5 million pounds a day , are essential to help repair its precarious finances .
The company last month reported a first - half pretax loss of 292 million pounds , and is expected to report a loss of 601.2 million pounds for the full year , according to a Thomson Reuters I / B / E/S poll of 19 analysts .
PENSION WOES
Earlier on Monday BA said its pension deficit more than doubled to 3.7 billion pounds at the end of March , from 1.8 billion a year earlier , at the high end of analyst expectations , but not seen as big enough to derail a merger with Spain ’s Iberia .
“ We ’re not surprised by this figure .
It falls within the expected range , ” a source at Iberia told Reuters on Monday .
BA denied that the pension funds announcement was timed to coincide with today ’s meeting , saying once it had reached an agreement with the pension trustees it had to release details to the market .
BA and Iberia announced in November that they had reached an agreement on a merger , which they hope will be concluded by the end of 2010 , after months of negotiations .
BA ’s pension deficit was the main stumbling block in the merger negotiations , and Iberia has reserved the right to back out of the deal if the funding hole turns out to be too big .
“ The company may be forced to renegotiate pension benefits with employees if it is to avoid using more shareholders cash .
Industrial unrest could therefore worsen over the next few weeks , ” Deutsche Bank said .
BA said the airline and pension trustees will work together to develop a recovery plan , a process which will involve the company consulting with employees and their trade unions and which must be completed by June 30 , 2010 .
Independent pensions consultant John Ralfe said the statement appeared to imply that the company would be talking to unions and employees about cutting benefits at a time when industrial relations are already strained .
A spokeswoman for BA said the company could not afford to make any additional contributions to the pension scheme than those already being made , but was looking at all other options for a recovery plan .

I heard this rhyme once when I was a teenager , it is common in some places but not where I grew up :
Up the close and down the stair ,
In the house with Burke and Hare .
Burke 's the butcher , Hare 's the thief .
And Knox the man who buys the beef .
And wondered about it now and then ( in the days before google ) until I stumbled across the three gentlemen it belonged to some years later .
And what a bunch !
Here we meet Burke and Hare towards the end of their killing spree , a period which may be described as " unbelievably sloppy " and also " lazy . "
Still , they had an impact on medical history , and perhaps not every harebrained criminal may lay claim to this .
If you 'd like to hear their story summed up in a jaunty but bizarre and inaccurate song ,
Now , some notes !
Guys ,
And hey hey hey !
All the shirt designs
woo !
Also there is a SURPRISE coming up , it was I have no idea why I made them talk so funny , but that is what happens sometimes in this crazy comics world .
I guess it is because it's a comic about two weirdos !

Despite promises during the campaign that he would review certain of the most intrusive portions of the PATRIOT Act , President Barack Obama ’s Justice Department today is calling for Congress to extend all three expiring provisions , though they were “ willing to consider ” civil rights protections “ as long as they do n’t weaken ” the president ’s powers under the act .
Among those provisions the administration is seeking to extend is the infamous Section 215 : the provision which allows law enforcement access to library and bookstore records , without probable cause , for “ national security ” reasons .
The American Library Association has been complaining for years that the provision was overbroad and many fear it could prove to have a chilling effect on the ability to read potentially subversive literature .
Another of the provisions the administration wants extended is the so - called “ lone wolf ” provision , which amends the FISA definition of “ agent of a foreign power ” to include people the government can’t establish as having any link to a foreign government or terrorist organization .
Finally they would extend the “ roving wiretap ” provision in Section 206 , which allows the government to wiretap a person and all devices they come into contact with , rather than having to get a warrant to wiretap a given phone or device .
Ever since Afghanistan emerged as an independent nation in 1709 , when the Ghilzai kicked out the Persians , its history has been written in the ancient hatred between these two groups .
During most of that time , the country has been ruled by Durrani , who in 1775 moved its capital from the Ghilzai stronghold of Kandahar up to Kabul in the north .
Nothing has more fired Ghilzai enmity than the many occasions when the Durrani have attempted to impose their rule from Kabul with the aid of " foreigners " , either Tajiks from the north or outsiders such as the British , who invaded Afghanistan three times between 1838 and 1919 in a bid to secure the North - west Frontier of their Indian empire against the rebellious Ghilzai .
NEW YORK -- Nebraska Cornhuskers defensive tackle Ndamukong
Suh bulled past the guys who play the glamour positions and proved you do n't have to score touchdowns or toss passes to be the player of the year .
Ndamukong
Suh is the first defensive player named the AP 's college football player of the year .
Matthew Emmons / US Presswire
Spurred by a dominant performance against Texas in the Big 12 title game , Suh became the first defensive player voted The Associated Press College Football Player of the Year on Tuesday .
Suh had already won two defensive player of the year awards -- the Nagurski and Bednarik -- and two for best lineman -- the Lombardi and Outland .
He also finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting .
" Just being recognized as player of the year is a huge accomplishment , " Suh said in a recent phone interview from Lincoln , Neb .
He received 26 of a possible 59 votes from AP college football poll voters to edge Stanford running back Toby Gerhart , who received 20 votes .
Heisman winner Mark Ingram finished tied for third with Texas quarterback Colt McCoy , each getting six votes .
Florida quarterback Tim Tebow received one vote .
Since the AP started handing out a player of the year award in 1998 , all the winners have been quarterbacks or running backs .
" It 's a great choice , " Nebraska coach Bo Pelini said . " I give ( the voters ) a lot of credit .
I 'm not taking anything away from Ingram or McCoy or any of the other guys .
I just think at his position , you would be hard - pressed to say there 's a better player than Suh .
He 's had a tremendous year . "
It 's the fourth time the AP award went to a player other than the Heisman winner and first since Iowa quarterback Brad Banks beat out USC's Carson Palmer in 2003 .
Suh finished behind Ingram , Gerhart and McCoy in the Heisman voting , though he did receive more points than any fourth - place finisher in the 75 - year history of the award .
Suh , a 6 - foot - 4 , 300 - pound senior , was already having an All - America - caliber season before the Cornhuskers played Texas on Dec. 5 at Dallas Cowboys Stadium .
He nearly led Nebraska to a stunning upset , with 12 tackles and 4 ½ sacks .
The Longhorns kicked a last - second field goal to escape with a 13 - 12 victory , but Suh was so utterly unblockable he earned a trip to New York as one of five finalists for the Heisman .
He finished the season with 12 sacks and was the pillar of the ninth - ranked defense in the country .
" I think I had a good year , " he said .
" I definitely got better in a couple of areas .
I wo n't say I 'm satisfied by any means , because we still have a big game left to play against Arizona in the Holiday Bowl . "
A new edition of the beautifully produced RadioLab has just hit the airwires with an excellent programme on the science of randomness .
The hour long science trip largely focusses on how we make sense of random or unpredictable events , from coincidences to statistical white noise .
There ’s a wonderful part where the presenters visit statistician Deborah Nolan who has a neat party trick to demonstrate the properties of random sequences to her students .
She asks one group of students to write down the results of 100 coin flips , and another to write a list of imaginary coin flips .
She then leaves the room , waits while each sequence is written down , returns , and tells the students which sequence was imaginary .
It works because humans are bad random number generators .
Nolan looks for longer runs of heads or tails which are not included in imaginary sequences because we underestimate the variation in randomness .
In fact , there ’s been quite a bit of research on how we generate ‘ random ’ number sequences , and it turns out that far from being a messy and effortless function of the brain , it requires some heavyweight intervention of the frontal lobes .
Brains are very good at stereotyped routines but it ’s breaking these learned patterns which takes the real effort .
To generate ‘ random ’ sequences , we need to check we ’re not repeating ourselves and match the sequence against a model of randomness in our heads .
In fact , asking people to generate a sequence of random numbers is a good test of frontal lobe function , the more mathematically random it is , the better functioning the frontal cortex .
And if we dampen down frontal cortex function using electromagnets , we see a drop in actual randomness of the numbers .
There are plenty more fantastic insights into the science of the unpredictable in the programme with the constantly surprising RadioLab team .

I have wondered ' how much can I borrow ? ' , but I think I 'll deal with that when it comes around .
There are a few others who have n't donated yet , and maybe we 'll get financial backing one day - who knows .
Anything could happen .
I 'm going to take each day as it comes , knowing I 'm doing my very best to keep going .
It 's an excellent job , I love what I do , and I could n't be happier .
At the end of the day , it 's just money , and I 'm 90 so it does n't really matter what I spend .

Israeli troops have killed six Palestinians - three in the Gaza Strip and three in the West Bank .
The Israeli military said three Palestinians suspected of trying to infiltrate from Gaza were killed in an air strike near the Erez crossing .
It is the largest number of deaths in a day since the Gaza conflict a year ago .
Separately , Israeli forces said they had killed three men - who were suspected of killing a Jewish settler - in the West Bank city of Nablus .
Palestinian sources in Nablus say two of those killed were militants from the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , the militant faction of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 's Fatah party .
The faction was one of two groups which said they had killed the settler , a father of seven , two days ago - the first fatal shooting of an Israeli by militants in the occupied West Bank for eight months .
Eyewitnesses said the Israeli raid began in the early hours of the morning and lasted for several hours .
They said there had not been a raid like this in Nablus for about a year and a half , the BBC's Bethany Bell reports from Jerusalem .
The violence came a day before the first anniversary of the Gaza war that killed some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .
WHILE investors have been fretting recently about Japan 's huge debt , another of the dreaded D - words has come back to haunt them .
On Friday November 20th , Japan 's Cabinet Office issued a monthly report that for the first time since 2006 acknowledged that the country was suffering from deflation .
Consumer prices have actually been falling for months , but the pace of decline accelerated over the summer .
In September prices slumped by 2.2 % compared with a year earlier .
This is partly because the country is still loaded with excess capacity after the collapse in exports during the global financial crisis , and partly because oil prices were lower in September than in the same month last year .
But there are more structural problems , too .
As Japan 's population declines , for instance , retailers are being forced to cut prices to gain market share .
It was no coincidence that the new government of Yukio Hatoyama chose the day when the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) was holding a rate - setting meeting to make a lot of noise on the issue .
Both the deputy prime minister and finance minister made concerned comments .
Their unspoken message to the BoJ was clear : remove monetary - stimulus measures at your peril .
At the end of its two - day meeting , the BoJ left its policy rate unchanged at 0.1 % , and continued to use other measures , such as buying government bonds , that it believes make monetary policy “ extremely accommodative . ”
But the BoJ does not give the impression it is particularly concerned about prices .
It believes there are not yet clear signals of a deflationary mindset in corporations or the public at large , and that a recovery in private demand will eventually pull the economy out of its slump .
Some economists think this reflects a dangerous complacency .
The BoJ 's own recent forecasts predicted that the year - on - year change in the consumer price index excluding fresh food would be negative this year , next year and in 2011 .
On Thursday , the OECD issued a strong injunction to the BoJ to fight deflation by committing to keep interest rates low and implementing quantitative - easing measures until inflation turns “ firmly positive ” .
Some advocate even more radical steps to reflate the economy , such as charging banks to deposit money at the central bank .
Proponents of these measures fear that businesses will retrench as prices fall and their debts rise , creating a vicious circle .
The government , too , is keen for the BoJ to keep doing its bit to stimulate growth , because the fiscal deficit is already projected to reach 10 % of GDP next year and it has expensive campaign promises to keep .
The government was given a dose of good news on Monday when it was reported that economic growth picked up in the third quarter , reaching 4.8 % on an annualised basis , which was better than expected .
But much of that was spurred by public spending ; domestic demand was still weak and the domestic - demand deflator ( a measure of inflation excluding effects related to import and export prices ) was at its lowest level in more than 50 years , according to Lombard Street Research , an economic consultancy .
It is not only the BoJ that needs to do more to combat deflation , however .
Mr Hatoyama 's government , in office since September , has so far failed to spell out clearly its economic policies .
It says it wants to rebalance the economy by spurring domestic demand , but has not made it clear how it intends to do that .
Meanwhile , it has suggested meddling with wages and hiring - and - firing practices that exporters say would further weaken them at a time when they are struggling to cope with a high yen .
Raising Japan 's trend growth rate would be difficult , especially as the population ages and shrinks .
But it is not impossible : productivity could be improved dramatically , especially in the services sector .
A sustained period of higher growth would have a double - barrelled effect of killing both the debt and deflation problems .
If the double - D scares of the past few weeks help to convince Mr Hatoyama 's government of this , it would be a good outcome .
Sadly , that can not be counted on .
For Day
Three of the World Atlas Of Bad Driving we focus on the Middle East , a cradle of civilization and , sadly , the site of so many of its problems .

You can put away your tired old woman driver jokes for a day , as they do n't generally drive in this region .
However , like all the other regions we 'll be covering , we 're not exactly going to show you the good side of these countries .
Whatever conclusions you want to draw from these examples , what we see here is the same old story we see everywhere - when poorly - trained people are n't paying attention , bad things happen .
Also , in the Middle East as everywhere , those rowdy youths just can't be trusted .
Click
Next to begin your tour .
Do n't forget to check out previous chapters of the World Atlas of Bad Driving !
NATION OF ORIGIN : Saudi Arabia
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
There 's an active car scene here , and like many cultures that are simultaneously very strict and very wealthy , the youth tend to blow off steam in big ways .
In this case , that includes drifting , which we suggest could be the basis for an extremely interesting if annoying youth summit .
However , in this case , drifting includes hitting a spectator , who seems to take it quite well .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Saudi Arabia
NATURE OF INCIDENT : Sandstoms , as we 've already seen today , are awesome forces of nature .
Perhaps you 'd expect Saudis to be able to handle them better , but hey , in the upper Midwest the snow catches them off guard every winter .
In any case , this is the aftermath of an accident , but still very gripping .
NATION OF ORIGIN : UAE
NATURE OF INCIDENT : What would the Atlas of Bad Driving be without a tunnel ?
This example at the Dubai airport is actually a well - lit , well - constructed tunnel with only moderate traffic density , but it only takes one scatterbrain .
NATION OF ORIGIN : UAE , Dubai
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
No idea whatsoever what could have happened here , except to say the crazy SUV driver seems to have passed his crazy on to the flatbed driver .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Iraq
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
This incident actually involves a foreign driver with a bit more steel in his vehicle than the local .
Unusual conditions apply and may or may not be present in the rest of Iraq .
Also , we 're not passing judgement , but how ?
How did that guy not see it coming ?
NATION OF ORIGIN : Iran
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
Hey , look , there 's drifting in Iran !
And oof , they 're not necessarily good at it either .
Maybe there 's more that unites the world than divides it after all .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Iran
NATURE OF INCIDENT : An intersection in Tehran .
Unlike yesterday 's Indian intersection , they possess and more or less follow traffic signals , but there the differences end .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Iran
NATURE OF INCIDENT : Car surfing is apparently pretty big in Iran , and this rather terrifying cell phone video is a stunning example .
The Cloverfield - esque low quality just adds to the impact .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Isreal
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
This famous horse - on - car incident is so unusual that you can't even classify it except to say it 's Biblically , Old Testament - weird .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Afghanistan
NATURE OF INCIDENT : A beautifully done video diary of an American serviceman 's trip along the Jalalabad highway serving Camp Phoenix .
If this guy got nothing else out of his tour of duty , we bet he 's a much safer driver now .
A child 's never - ending " why 's " are n't meant to exasperate parents , scientists say .
Rather , the kiddy queries are genuine attempts at getting at the truth , and tots respond better to some answers than others .
This new finding , based on a two - part study involving children ages 2 to 5 , also suggests they are much more active about their knowledge - gathering than previously thought .
" Even from really early on when they start asking these how and why questions , they are asking them in order to get explanations , " lead researcher Brandy Frazier of the University of Michigan told LiveScience .
When explanations came their way , the little ones probed further , they found .
" Kids are playing more of an active role in learning about the world around them than we may have expected , " Frazier said .
The new findings , which are detailed in the November / December issue of the journal Child Development , can't be generalized to all children since the sample sizes were small .
Curious chatter
Past research from the early to mid 1900s on child development had suggested that young children were only aware of temporal relationships between two events and could n't differentiate cause from effect until about 7 or 8 years of age .
More recent work has suggested otherwise , that as early as age 3 children get causality .
Lacking from such studies are kids ' reactions to the information they get to their causal questions .
To figure out kids ' responses to different questions , Frazier and her colleagues examined transcripts from everyday conversations of six kids , ages 2 to 4 , who were speaking with parents , siblings and visitors at home .
With just six kids , the researchers analyzed the transcripts , more than 580 of them , as their unit of analysis .
Overall , there were more than 3,100 causal how and why questions such as , " Why my tummy so big , mom ? "
" Why not keep a light on ? " and " How can snakes hear if they do n't have ears ? "
Results showed kids were more than twice as likely to re-ask their question after a non-explanation compared with a real answer .
And when they did get an explanation , which was about 37 percent of the time , they were more than four times as likely to reply with a follow - up inquiry as if they had received a non-explanatory response .
Preliminary results from a separate new study of Frazier 's suggest there is such a thing as too much information in a response .
" It seems like kids might have an optimal level of detail they 're interested in , " Frazier said .
Odd items
The next part of the new study was lab - based and involved 42 preschoolers , ages 3 to 5 , who chatted when prompted with toys , storybooks and videos .
The items were designed to create surprising , question - provoking situations .
For instance , kids were shown a box of all - red crayons , a puzzle with a piece that did n't fit , and a storybook describing a child who poured orange juice on his cereal .
The adults who showed kids each item had certain explanatory and non-explanatory responses .
So as expected , kids asked about the orange - juice scenario : " Why did he do that ? "
The adult would then respond with the explanation , " He thought it was milk in the pitcher , " or the non-explanation , " I like to put milk on my cereal . "
They found significant differences in types of reactions to the explanatory answers versus the non-explanatory ones .
Nearly 30 percent of the time kids would agree , nod or say " oh " after getting a true explanation , compared with just under 13 percent of the time for non-explanations .
For such non-answers , more than 20 percent of the time kids re-asked the original question .
Just 1 percent of kids receiving an explanation did the same .
The newly published study was funded , in part , by the National Science Foundation and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
The Almond in the Rice Porridge
This is an old Norwegian christmas tradition .
Just follow my directions .
Step 1 .
Make the porridge .
I have translated the recipe on the bag .
While you make the porridge you add a peeled almond .
Step 2 .
Give porridge to family or friends and top it with cinnamon , sugar and butter .
Tell everyone that whoever finds the almond gets a prize .
Step 3 . Somone finds the almond !
Yay !
And they get the marsipan - pig .
It is very simple , and something Norwegian families do every christmas .

charles darwin and otto hahn ’s alien fossils
Was Darwin interested in panspermia , the hypothesis that life on Earth was seeded by asteroid impacts ?
Just because Darwin would n’t discuss the origin of life in his work , does n’t mean he did n’t have an opinion on the matter .
And that opinion is actually pretty close to modern scientific thinking , that living things are products of chemistry rather than something requiring divine intervention .
A recent paper cataloguing Darwin ’s notes on the subject and correspondences with scientists and critics probably wo n’t be a big surprise to those familiar with his work .
However , there ’s one very interesting tidbit that caught my attention .
It seems that the naturalist may have been exposed to the concept of panspermia , the idea that living things could cross space and seed young worlds where the newly landed aliens can spring up if the conditions are just right for their survival …
In his recently published Charles Darwin , Shorter Publications 1829 – 1883 , van Wyhe ( 2009 ) has included a curious item published in 1881 in [ the journal ]
Science under the title Mr. Darwin on Dr. Hahn ’s discovery of fossil organisms in meteorites .
The note describes an exchange between Charles Darwin and Otto Hahn , an amateur geologist who claimed in 1880 that he had discovered [ the ] remains of extraterrestrial sponges , corals and plants in the Knyahinya meteorite that fell in Hungary on June 6 , 1866 ( van Wyhe 2009 ) .
Apparently , Hahn even showed Darwin the fossils in question and made quite an impression .
However , while he was generally supportive of the idea , the naturalist never outright confirmed or denied it .
Considering that he was n’t one to jump to conclusions , it ’s likely that he never quite made up his mind on the subject and only entertained the possibility as curious but in need of further review and additional confirmation .
Other scientists of the day also shared his enthusiasm , though for reasons we would find erroneous today .
Because of William Thomson ’s ( later Lord Kelvin ) claim that the Earth ’s age was too young to be compatible with Darwin ’s theory of evolution , and [ Louis ] Pasteur ’s work debunking spontaneous generation , the “ cosmozoa / panspermia ” theory was championed by many noted scientists during Darwin ’s time , although apparently he never commented on the concept .
The idea that there were fossils present in some meteorites was embraced by parts of the scientific community although others questioned the validity of these claims .
Of course Thomson ’s estimate of 20 to 400 million years was way off and theoretically , our planet was around long enough for life to slowly develop and diversify without the need for spontaneous generation or a seeding from extraterrestrial sources .
However , we also know that meteorites not only have a full collection of the kinds of amino acids life as we know it needs , they also have a bias towards left handed chirality just like all living things on Earth .
We also know that some simple animals and bacteria can survive the strain of space travel , provided they ’re put into a kind of biological stasis first .
So while the evidence for panspermia or any potential extraterrestrial involvement in our biosphere is rather tenuous , it ’s still there on the fringes and it ’s hard to rule it out completely .
Though , to be perfectly fair , I would have to say that Hahn ’s meteorite could very easily be a case of mistaken identification and its evidence is very much in the eye of the beholder , kind of like ALH 84001 and its microscopic contents that look like fossils to some panspermia enthusiasts .

MSPs called for improvements at Cornton Vale prison
The treatment of women with mental health problems by the justice system needs to be looked into by the Scottish government , MSPs have said .
Holyrood 's equal opportunities committee said ministers needed to take more action to prevent female offenders from returning to a life of crime .
The committee 's call came after it held an inquiry into the issue .
It called for more community - based sentences to be given to female offenders .
According to the committee 's report , 80 % of female inmates have mental health problems , almost all have problems with drug or alcohol addiction and many have children on the outside .
The committee said more should be done to tackle the drugs problem at Cornton Vale , Scotland 's only female prison .
However , it said prisoners caught taking substances should no longer have access to their children removed as punishment .
The report called for a more holistic approach to female offenders , community - led and positive discrimination of women which takes into account their different circumstances .
Mike Ewart , head of the Scottish Prison Service , told the committee earlier this year that too many women were being locked up .
More action needs to be taken by the Scottish government and other public bodies to prevent re-offending by female offenders
Margaret Mitchell
Convener , Holyrood equal opportunities committee
There has been about a 90 % rise in the number of women being sent to Cornton Vale over the past 10 years , compared with a 16 % rise for the male prisoner population .
Concerns were raised over " limited " quality of mental health care in the jail , and evidence that " too many " women behind bars posed only a threat to themselves .
About 80 % of women in jail have mental health problems , and about 2 % of those should be in hospital , Scottish Prisons Service director of health and care Dr Andrew Fraser told the committee .
He suggested 10 % of the women could be treated with support in the community .
Committee convener Margaret Mitchell said MSPs were " deeply concerned " over a practice where women deliberately committed crimes to gain access to the services provided at the prison .
' Alarming ' figures " The committee learned that women 's experiences of the criminal justice system are different from men's and that some of these differences may stem from , or result in , discrimination or inequality , " she said .
The Tory MSP added : " Given this , more action needs to be taken by the Scottish government and other public bodies to prevent re-offending by female offenders , by fully addressing their needs and individual circumstances . "
MSPs also said relationships between female prisoners and their children had to be supported in the wake of " alarming " figures showing about half of women inmates ' children were sent to jail as adults .
Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said : " It 's clear that more and more people , including this committee , are agreeing with the Scottish Government 's position that prison should only be for the serious offenders who commit the serious crimes .
" That 's why we have been working hard to ensure more low level offenders are given the chance to address the underlying causes of their behaviour rather than serve ineffective short jail sentences . "
But Scottish Labour 's Justice spokesman , Richard Baker , claimed Mr MacAskill was looking " to weaken the criminal justice system .
He added : " The treatment of female offenders needs to be improved but the right way forward is not the scrapping of all six month or less sentences .
" We do want to see more community sentences and in many instances this will be appropriate for female offenders with the problems the Committee identifies .
But this requires appropriate investment in community sentences in which the public can have confidence .
" Mr MacAskill is proposing a massive increase in community sentences without funding it properly , and has scrapped plans for the Community Court in Glasgow . "

I always found it strange when polemicists denounced George W. Bush for saying , after 9/11 , that Americans should go shopping .
Andrew Bacevich , who ’s emerged as possibly the premiere root - and - branch critic of American militarism , wrote an impassioned op - ed explaining the reasoning behind that critique .
“ From the very outset , the president described the ‘ war on terror ’ as a vast undertaking of paramount importance , ” Bacevich hectored in 2008 .
“ But he simultaneously urged Americans to carry on as if there were no war . ”
What in the world were we supposed to do ?
Stand in line to fill out job applications at munitions factories ?
Devote a larger percentage of the day to re-spooling footage of the Towers falling ?
Militarize our lives even further ?
George Bush could never have exploited that .
This was the anti-militarism critique , remember .
Bacevich ’s idea was that blocking off the psychic exits - entertainment , principally - to the great terror nightmare of the last decade would have awakened the country to the unbounded costs of a global war .
But that goes against the grain of American experience .
Consider the origins of Guantanamo Bay , the decade ’s trademark symbol of American descent into impunity .
Guantanamo was a solution to two legal hurdles that appear to be mutually insurmountable .
First : the longer you hold someone in detention , the likelier it is that he ’ll mount a legal challenge to his confinement , even if he ’s taken from the battlefields of Afghanistan .
So in late 2001 , a group of Bush ’s lawyers - most notably John Yoo at the Justice Department , David Addington at the White House and Jim Haynes at the Pentagon - argued that those long - term detainees needed to be held on foreign soil , outside the jurisdiction of U.S. courts .
Guantanamo Bay , a naval base in southeastern Cuba used by the U.S. for 100 years , was a compromise choice .
But .
Let ’s say you wanted to torture those detainees .
There are laws against that .
But those laws , like the federal Torture Statute , apply to government employees operating overseas , where , Congress once reasoned , torture is more likely to occur .
So to circumvent the federal Torture Statute , the lawyers wrote , Guantanamo is “ included within the definition of the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States . ”
From that deliberate absurdity - Guantanamo Bay is and is not the United States of America , depending on the law you need to flout - flowed years of descent into rogue - nationhood .
This is a sampling of what resulted :
An interrogation log of one of several people believed to be the intended 20th 9/11 hijacker records that at 10 a.m. on November 25 , 2002 at Guantanamo , Mohammed al - Qahtani ( “ Detainee # 063 ” ) urinated in his pants after his interrogators intravenously administered him fluids for three and a half hours and refused to let him use the bathroom until he told them about new al - Qaeda plots .
That was considered a humane alternative to , say , letting dogs maul detainees .
Because in the America of the Aughts , we just let detainees think we were going to let the dogs maul them .
“ Using dogs is equal to the Fear Up technique , ” a former Guantanamo commander , Major General Mike Dunlavey , explained to an investigator in 2005 , referring to a long - legal interrogation method of exploiting a detainee ’s fear of the unknown .
“ It breaks [ detainees ’ ] concentration in response to the interrogation techniques .
They would be thinking about that dog . ”
Quick : does anyone really think that avoiding an extra trip to H&M ; or another Venti Latte would have stopped this kind of depravity ?
But let ’s be fair to Bacevich .
When I visited Guantanamo Bay in the summer of 2005 - the middle of this wretched , spiritually - draining decade - the last thing I expected to find was the summit , the epitome , the apotheosis of the Bush era ’s epic union of consumerism and brutality .
Yes : Guantanamo Bay has a gift shop .
I bought this adorable plush iguana there .
I ’ll explain .
Guantanamo Bay , as we understand it today , is actually two things in one .
Ever since the U.S. took it for use as a coaling station during the Spanish - American War , it ’s been a 45 - square mile naval base and Cold War anachronism .
As a result , if you drive through it , you see all the creature comforts necessary for extended naval deployments .
Southern - style plantation houses for senior officers and their families .
Kindergartens .
A giant outdoor movie theater .
Sports leagues .
And something called a NEX , or a Naval Exchange , the Navy ’s equivalent of the Army ’s post exchanges .
Think of them like a minimally stocked mall compressed into a single store .
The NEX is where you get your toiletries , fresh batteries , new DVDs , video games , condoms , new socks and underwear , snacks , somewhat recent magazines .
And souvenirs of your tour .
Those souvenirs - more on them in a second - would be less discomfiting if a small section of Guantanamo was n’t reserved for the detention of several hundred alleged terrorists .
You heard endlessly throughout this decade they were “ the worst of the worst . ”
But they never were .
Those people , like 9/11 architect Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , were held not by the military but by the CIA , in undisclosed prisons where agency interrogators tortured the shit out of them .
( Literally .
There was a torture technique called “ prolonged diapering . ” )
These guys at Guantanamo were sort of like the middle tier : not bad enough for those so - called Black Sites , but too valuable from an intelligence perspective or too dangerous from a military perspective to be held in the U.S. ’s huge prison at Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan .
They were held in a place called Camp Delta , a complex of six prisons built in the Aughts after the old open - air mesh cages of Camp X - Ray proved to be insufficient for holding people forever .
Camp Delta is just a small slice of Guantanamo .
And it ’s only a few hundred yards from the NEX .
I was there on a Potemkin tour in the summer of 2005 .
The military used to arrange for a four - day journalists ’ tour so the press could see how great conditions in Guantanamo actually are .
Cuba is baking hot in the summer , easily over 100 degrees , and the pace of the tour is accordingly lethargic , which is appropriate , given the fact that you go there to see indefinite detention .
Over the course of touring , two right - wing radio journalists and I were given time to speak with Guantanamo ’s guards , who told us detainees threw cocktails of body fluids at them .
At night , we got drunk with our cheerful Army handlers at the officers ’ club and base ’s tiki bar , a low - key spot near a cliff on the edge of the island , as they debated whether Star Fleet in Star Trek was a Navy or Air Force outgrowth .
( It is very obviously the Navy ; Admiral Kirk , fellas . )
I bonded with one of my press handlers , an Iraq veteran named Justin Valera Behrens , over our mutual patronage of the fully - nude strip club Super - Sexe when in Montreal .
Justin would later return to his Pennsylvania home to run for Congress , unsuccessfully .
All that was to soften us up for what we saw in Camp Delta .
Camp Delta - why do n’t I just refer you to the magazine piece I wrote about this - is no joke .
The individual - detention units , Camps
One through Three , feature small metal cages painted green , barely big enough for a bed , a hole in the floor to relieve oneself , and a Qu’ran slung from a surgical mask ( to keep it off the ground ) .
An hour of exercise is allotted per day , we were told .
( I ’m not sure what , if anything , about those conditions have changed in the intervening four years . )
Camp
Four is the group - detention units , dormitory - style imprisonment for more docile detainees , who get access to board games and a small area for playing soccer in exchange for being calm .
Those detainees wear tan jumpsuits .
The orange ones are for detainees who pose a danger to the guards .
When I walked into Camp Delta , I saw a detainee in an orange jumpsuit being strapped down to the flatbed of a small motorized cart for transport to God - knows - where .
He glowered at us when he caught us looking at him .
I think back on that when I hear right - wing protesters tell me that their freedom is jeopardized by Obama ’s attempts to restore the top marginal tax rate to its 2001 level .
When we were done with our Camp Delta tour , we got into a small bus and drove the five or so minutes it took to get to the NEX for some refreshments .
Now , on your way to the NEX from Camp Delta , you encounter something that gives the lie to the idea that Guantanamo detainees are too dangerous to be held in the Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois , which is the Obama administration ’s destination for a still - undetermined number of them .
That ’s the transplanted bougainvillea of the officers ’ families residence .
This is literally a small ersatz suburban community with manufactured lawns , looking like the opening credits to Weeds , right downhill from a facility housing hundreds of alleged terrorists .
I saw a Big Wheel left out on someone ’s porch .
The NEX , however , is even more jarring .
On most U.S. military bases overseas , you can buy souvenirs of your tours , and the NEX is no exception .
It just happens that Guantanamo souvenirs commemorate service to a policy of extralegal indefinite detention that most of humanity considers barbaric .
And this puts Naval officers who are n’t part of the detention facility - and especially their children - in a shitty spot .
For instance : there ’s a rack at the NEX filled with refrigerator magnets decorated with kids ’ names .
Those magnets show a smiling dolphin bursting from some ocean spray in front of a rainbow , above your kid ’s name and the legend GUANTANAMO BAY .
I was dating a girl named Sue at the time , so I scanned the magnet rack for the S’s .
Then come the t- shirts .
There were dozens of them , hanging in rows on the wall like at a skate shop .
Again , the shirts were another unfortunate consequence of Guantanamo ’s transition into an internationally infamous detention facility .
Some of them , trying to be zany , rattled off lists of how you ’d know you ’ve spent too much time at Guantanamo , like , for instance , apathy to the pine cone - shaped shit excreted by the base ’s signature rodent , the Banana Rat .
( Of course , the shirts meant how military officers knew they ’d spent too much time at Guantanamo , not detainees , who document overlong stays through hunger strikes and habeas corpus petitions and suicide attempts . )
But a minority of the shirts for sale were targeted at the newest NEX customer : the guard .
Perhaps , you manned a guard post at the perimeter of Delta .
Maybe you ’d be interested in a silkscreened black silhouette of your post , above a legend that reads “ The Taliban Towers : Five - Star Lodging . ”
( A star for each of the military services .
Yes , they count the Coast Guard . )
Or let ’s say you were part of the military command supervising the maintenance of the prisons , officially titled the Joint Detention Operations Group .
There is a shirt for you , featuring a snarling cartoon pit bull , because — get it ? — you serve in the JDOG .
( Dunlavey : “ Using dogs is equal to the Fear Up technique … . ” )
My radio - host friends giggled and , truth be told , I giggled along with them .
I packed my arms full with $ 100 worth of shirts to take home for my friends , family and co-workers .
The only thing I kept for myself was the adorable 23 - inch green plush iguana with GUANTANAMO BAY stitched across both his sides in yellow thread .
Some explanation : Guantanamo
Bay is a safe haven for iguanas .
Cuba has become so poor under the burden of sclerotic communism and decades of U.S. trade sanctions that the populace has taken to eating the once - abundant reptiles .
The smart iguanas have migrated to Guantanamo , where U.S. environmental laws protect the endangered creatures .
Many open spaces on Guantanamo feature a lazy lizard sunning herself on a flat rock .
Naturally , young kids who spend a slice of their life growing up on the base will want a stuffed iguana doll .
The NEX is happy to serve that market , offering a snuggle - ready doll manufactured by the Fiesta company of Vernon , California and assembled in China .
I picked one up and took him back home , where my dog tried to eat him .
Ever since then he ’s guarded my desk at work .
He ’s a conversation starter .
Obama will try to close Guantanamo early next year .
There will be no reprisal for anyone who designed the policies that created the detention facility , aside from whatever their consciences impose , and if Dick Cheney ’s Politico interviews are any indication , that is n’t much of a penalty .
A report by the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Management that reportedly recommends professional sanctions against Yoo and his former DOJ boss , the federal judge Jay Bybee , has been long suppressed by both the Bush and Obama administrations .
Senate reports have exhaustively documented the torture that their work encouraged , at Guantanamo and Bagram and Abu Ghraib and elsewhere .
But Yoo still has his tenured teaching position at Berkeley ’s prestigious Boalt Hall .
His legal expenses , a consequence of defending himself against torture victims who want restitution , are paid for by you , every April 15 .
I ’d like to say that the end of this horrific decade will end the legacy of places like Guantanamo Bay .
But Americans are unique in fooling ourselves that the slate wipes clean every time a calendar year hits a multiple of ten .
There is no piece of legal architecture in place today that would prevent the opening of neo -Guantanamo , for the very good reason that the statutes against torture are really fucking clear about prohibiting torture , and they predated Guantanamo — yet still Guantanamo occurred , outside the law , with no consequence for its architects .
The Thomson prison , central to Obama ’s plans to close Guantanamo , will not allow ex-Guantanamo inmates access to any visitors besides the Red Cross and their lawyers and law enforcement .
Its inmates will be tried not in federal courts , but in military commissions that still allow for the admission of hearsay as evidence , something the U.S. Constitution does not look on keenly .
Tom Parker of Amnesty International said , on the day the Thomson plan was announced , that all Obama is doing is “ changing the Zip Code of Guantanamo . ”
The best that can be said so far is that it does n’t have a gift shop .

OpenRisc simulator runs Linux
OpenCores is an organization owned by ORSoc that invests in open source hardware .
Their site hosts many hardware projects that ship the source code ( Hardware Description Language in this case ) with the GNU Lesser General Public Licence .
This allows the adoption of free Intellectual Properties ( hardware blocks ) in any hardware design , being it proprietary ( closed - source ) or not .
One of the most exciting project is the OpenRisc , a 32 bit micro-controller that competes with professional cores .
Even in one of the most loved open source platforms , the Arduino , the core itself ( an Atmel AVR variant ) is “ closed source ” .
By extending the open source philosophy to the core itself , it is possible to :
understand “ what ’s behind ” an embedded platform
study and exploit the lower layers of the firmware
discover hardware bugs
customize the micro-controller design
In order to develop software on this particular micro-controller , a toolchain has been developed ( thanks to Means of Freedom and ORSoc ) based on the widely adopted GNU toolchain .
Using this toolchain it is possible to compile C code for the OpenRisc platform and run it inside a simulator .
The most complete example of the toolchain ’s potential is the compilation and simulation of a small Linux system .
OpenCores provides a VMWare image that contains an Ubuntu system with all the tools to start toying with OpenRisc .
More information here : http://www.opencores.org/openrisc,vmware
To use the toolchain on an existing Linux system ( Ubuntu , for example ) , there is a guide here : http://www.opencores.org/openrisc,gnu_toolchain
The steps basically involve :
installing the prerequisites ( for example build - essentials )
running a script that : downloads the version of the software that can be compiled for OpenRisc patches the source code to add OpenRisc - specific compatibility compiles the toolchain and the Linux system to simulate
running the simulator ( or32 - elf - sim ) using the Linux image and a configuration file .
connecting to the simulated Linux system ( using telnet on localhost , port 10084 )
The simulator can be launched with a configuration file that allows to change many parts of the system , like the memory and the peripherals , and the connections to the external world ; for example it redirects the serial port to a listening TCP socket on port 10084 that can be accessed with telnet .
This system shows untapped potential : it could become widely adopted by electronic enthusiasts that now are enjoying Arduino and PICs .
After that , the project could mature up to the point of being competitive against commercial cores .
Up to now , ORSoc sells development kits based on ( expensive ) FPGA , but in the near future I hope that they will sell a real OpenRisc - based chip mounted on a set of boards just like the Arduino ones .

LONDON : Tracing new links to the Mumbai carnage , a Pakistani father - son duo was today arrested from Italy for allegedly managing money transfer to finance phone communications of the attackers following leads from Indian and US investigators .
( Watch Video )
The two men , who ran a money transfer agency , were arrested in an early morning raid from the northern Italian city of Brescia , police said .
The duo has been identified by the police as Mohammad Yaqub Janjua , 60 , and Aamer Yaqub Janjua , 31 .
They have been accused of aiding and abetting international terrorism as well as illegal financial activity .
On November 25 , 2008 , a day before the attacks , they transferred USD 229 to activate an internet phone account that was used by the attackers and their accomplices , said Stefano Fonzi , the head of anti-terror police in Brescia .
The funds that enabled the terrorists to be in touch with their handlers in Pakistan were transferred under the identity of another Pakistani man who had never been to Italy and was not involved in the attacks , reports from Italy said .
The two managed a money transfer agency where it is reported to be a common practice to transfer funds using false identities .
The Italian police arrested the two men in an early morning raid in Brescia , the police said in a statement .
Italian police started their investigation the following month after being alerted by Indian authorities and the FBI that funds had been transferred from Italy , Fonzi said .
Video games are taking the place side by side to blockbuster movies .
They are the new form of mass media entertainment as the visual realism begins to match that of movies and even the real world .
What gives them an edge however is the fact that they are interactive , that not only can you passively experience them as you watch , but participate and influence exactly what you see .
This is also why there is typically more controversy over violence in games than violence in movies - you are the one actually initiating or participating in carnage and as you suspend disbelief to enjoy the game it is almost as if you 're doing it for real , especially if the game is made so realistic and so intense that there is n't much left in there to remind you that it 's not real .
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 brings this to a whole new level , most specifically , the controversial level titled " No Russian " which puts you as an undercover agent pretending to be with the terrorists .
Kyle Orland of CrispyGamer.com wrote an excellent account of what you get to experience in this level :
Quote :
The incongruity of the scene is evident from the start , as my character and a group of four Russians walk casually out of an elevator , into a busy airport waiting area , armed with heavy automatic weapons .
As the Russians arrange themselves in a semi-circle behind a ticket line , guns on their shoulders , it 's easy to deny that what I know is about to happen will be so bad .
It 's only when we actually draw our weapons on the unsuspecting crowd that the gravity of the situation begins to sink in .
This is n't the usual shoot - or - be - shot carnage of countless first - person shooters .
This is going to be a massacre .
Even though the gun in my hand is my only way of interacting with the world around me , I 'm not about to fire the first shot into the crowd .
This ends up being a non-issue , as my four companions quickly and wordlessly open fire simultaneously , spraying an indiscriminate spread of bullets into the unsuspecting travellers .
I find myself struck dumbfounded , not so much by the act , which I knew was coming , but by the incredible detail in its rendering .
The squirting blood , the collapsing , slumped piles of bodies , the panicked shrieks , the survivors congealing into a confused mass of motion as they desperately try to get away -- they all combine to give the scene a raw intesity that I was n't expecting . (...)
As we walk downstairs into that pile of bodies , I 'm already feeling a little numb .
I thought I as prepared for this , but the sheer realism of the scene is proving to be a little too much for me .
If you can stomach the scene you can watch it here :
I 'd be the last one to argue against artistic liberty and say that Infinity Ward , the producer of this game , had no right to include a scene such as this in the game .
That 's not the point I wish to convey .
I would instead like to speculatively explore the implications of this scene , its realism and the controversy that arose as a result .
What makes this scene so horrible and controversial are precisely the things which we would otherwise deem wonderful about modern games , the things that the masses want and clamor for , the things which they pay for .
It 's the superb visual and sonic realism .
It 's the intensity and intimacy with which you can experience what 's going on in the game .
What is available is directly influenced by what the market wants .
One might argue that a proper response to the outrage over this scene would thus be something along the lines of this :
You wanted realism .
You wanted an experience as close as to the real thing as possible .
And you wanted some real action .
Well , you got it ! "
What this begins to illustrate is the power of modern games to make a person actually see what it 's like .
What it 's like to be a soldier murdering people .
What it 's like to be in the middle of a terrorist attack and as perversely as it is , what it 's like to actually BE a terrorist .
This brings the gamer towards a greater understanding of what 's actually going on out there .
It brings him to a more intimate appreciation of the evils portrayed .
Typically when people hear the news about war and violence it is always so distant .
They say it 's horrible but they do n't really grasp the true horribleness of the thing .
You watch the news at one moment and the next you may be joking with your friends or family or otherwise be completely distracted by something else .
It 's just news , after all and bad news is a commodity we 're all so used to .
You do n't take a moment to appreciate what has actually happened .
Realistic gaming such as this gives you that opportunity and if you are any how inclined to ponder and think it might have an effect on you .
It might raise your awareness .
It might actually lead you to realize that the violence and war you 've been looking at so dismissively and considering as such a normal part of how the world works perhaps is n't something to take so lightly .
I do n't know , but it 's certainly a possibility , is n't it ?
Regardless of whether you suspend disbelief or not I think it can also be a sort of a psychological test .
For sure , it 's just a game , but that does n't change the fact that you 're right now experiencing a larger chunk of what people who actually were in events such as this were experiencing .
If you 're simulating an experience why not simulate entirely your response to it ?
This is why I think there 's something potentially quite wrong about people who play this scene and actually participate , quite actively , in the massacre .
What 's up with that ?
The more realistic this kind of entertainment becomes it 's possible that the more will this entertaining for fun 's sake be also the entertaining of your critical and moral thinking .
You could n't really escape it .
You can't watch and participate without experiencing some kind of a reaction to it .
Observing these reactions can tell you something about yourself .
If you actually thoroughly enjoy shooting civilians in a scene that matches the experience to that of a real world I think that would raise some serious questions as to your psychological state , would n't it ?
Finally , there is something to be said about why are these kinds of games so popular to begin with .
Why is violence in entertainment so attractive at all ?
Most fundamentally , why do our memes even deal with violence ?
What went so wrong with human society that we can't seem to stop entertaining the ideas of mutual - destruction ?
It 's an interesting question to ask .
But even more interesting would then be the question of what kind of future are we building with this kind of mentality and this kind of culture .
Little by little the evolution of our technology gives us powers we never had before .
The power to visualize and experience events you never before participated in within the real world is just one example and just a start .
But there is so much more to come .
The question is are we prepared for it .
Being outraged over a realistic massacre scene in a computer game can make you think , but it 's just a start .
The point is to make you awake , because that world you thought was just a fantasy , just a game , just a movie .
It 's what ultimately shapes our real world .

Reddeb spilled her secret to me this morning , and I told her I have n't received the SS gift yet .
And when I got home from work , I found a package from America .
She had made it !
Then I had a look , uh oh , Australian Customs had opened the box and neglected to reseal it ( WTF !!!!)
I greedily opened the box , and had a look inside .
It was absolutely hilarious .
Reddeb had stalked me well .
I am indeed an atheistic mathematician ( well , I 'm technically an economist ) .
Inside the box , there were books ( The Idiots ' Guide to Astrology , The Original Code in the Bible , Sick , Sacred Sexuality ) ; tibetan prayer flags ; tibetan incense ; a BBQ brush ( I think , I have no idea what it is ) ; some anti bug anti plant thingy ( I think this is the one that caused Customs to open it up ) ; and a button that says Choose Public Option .
The choice of books were very interesting .
I read everything , and almost all the books she sent were relevant to my interests to some extent ( except Astrology , which I think was sent as a joke )
Reddeb , you 're awesome .
Thanks for making my evening
WASHINGTON  A group of conservative Republican leaders is proposing a solution to the internecine warfare over what the party should stand for : a 10 - point checklist gauging proper adherence to core principles like opposing government financing for abortion and , more generally , President Obama ’s “ socialist agenda . ”
In what was being dubbed a purity test when it leaked out to reporters on Monday , the proposal would require the party to withhold campaign money and endorsements from candidates who do not adhere to at least eight principles on the checklist .
While it is unclear whether the test will be adopted when it is put up for consideration before the Republican National Committee early next year , its drafting is a striking example of the intensified internal debate among Republicans about how best to handle pressure from conservatives to move the party more to the right and to recapture control of Congress and the White House .
Its introduction increases pressure on the party chairman , Michael Steele , as he tries to maintain a balance between those in his party who have been saying the road to a Republican comeback is to include divergent views and appeal to the political center , and those who say the party needs to more fully embrace conservative principles .

If you think the Labour government has done the right thing in its decision to expand nuclear power in the UK by 50 % , see how you fare with this quiz .
Are the following dozen statements true or false ?
1 ) The independent French nuclear safety authority posts French nuclear incidents on its website , all 800 - a - year of them .
2 ) One of the two reactors Areva is building as forerunners for the 12 that will supposedly be built in the UK , the Olkiluoto plant in Finland , has fallen far behind schedule and over budget and the French company is locked in a legal battle over the overruns with the end user , the utility company TVO .
The second reactor , at Flamanville in France , is also way behind schedule .
3 ) The Finnish nuclear regulator has attacked Areva for fielding experts in the reactor - building programme who have a " lack of professional knowledge " .
4 ) A spate of nuclear leaks has forced the French government to address public fears by ordering drilling into , and sampling , of the groundwater under all 58 French nuclear reactors .
5 ) This July , a heatwave shut a third of French reactors , because rivers became too hot to act as coolant .
France was forced to import electricity from the UK .
6 ) Things got little better as winter approached .
With almost one third of France 's reactors out of service for maintenance and other reasons , France will have to import electricity at peak hours during the winter – for the second year running – to avoid the risk of blackouts .
7 ) French government ministers and officials had to cancel their visits to the flagship Cadarache nuclear facility after kilograms of plutonium dust were discovered on the site .
8 ) There were 1,767 leaks , breakdowns , or other safety " events " at British nuclear plants between 2001 and 2008 .
A Nuclear Installations Inspectorate ( NII ) report says about half were serious enough " to have had the potential to challenge a nuclear safety system " .
9 ) A radioactive leak , undiscovered for 14 months , was found at Sellafield just before a visit by the prime minister .
A board of inquiry concluded the leak went unnoticed because " managerial controls over the line were insufficient and there was inadequate inspection " .
Meanwhile , elsewhere on the site two containers of highly radioactive material went missing .
The operator said it was most likely that " the anomaly lies within the accounting procedures " .
10 ) Sellafield Ltd has admitted its £ 1.8 bn nuclear reprocessing plant may not be able to meet NII orders for operation , as a result of continuing technical problems .
Two of the plants have been breaking down repeatedly , and the third has been closed after a rise in radiation levels .
Work has started on a new £ 100 m evaporator , but it is behind schedule , and probably wo n't come on stream before 2013 .
Germany may sue if spent fuel is not returned reprocessed .
Closure of the plant would slow decommissioning of British nuclear plants , and remove much of the £ 70bn needed for that process , which reprocessing at Thorp was supposed to raise a good deal of , meaning another drain on the British public 's taxes .
11 ) The NII , charged with overseeing all such problems , has an acute staff shortage .
The Health and Safety Executive , for its part wants to create " exclusions " in its assessment of new reactor designs , in order to " streamline " the process .
12 ) Nuclear safety authorities from France , Finland and UK have asked Areva to modify its EPR reactor design .
They have concerns over the " independence principle " , and profess there is too high a degree of interactivity between the control and safety systems .
All these statements are true .
Do you still think the government has done the right thing ?
Here are 25 incredibly useful CSS tricks that will help you design great web interfaces .
You might be aware of some or all of these techniques , but this can be your handy resource to nifty CSS tricks that you should know .
1. Change Text Highlight Color
You might not have known this before !
With CSS you can control the colors of selected test at least for standards compliant cutting edge browsers like Safari or Firefox .
:: selection { /* Safari and Opera */ background :#c3effd ; color:#000 ; } ::-moz-selection { /* Firefox */ background :#c3effd ; color:#000 ; }
2. Prevent Firefox Scrollbar Jump
Firefox usually hides the vertical scrollbar if size of the content is less than the visible window but you can fix that using this simple CSS trick .
html{ overflow-y : scroll ; }
3. Print Page Breaks
While most of the internet users prefer to read content online but some of your users might like to print your article .
With CSS you can control the page breaks within content just add this CSS class to your stylesheet and add this class to any tag which you would like to print on next page .
. page - break{ page - break - before : always ; }
4. Using ! important
Experienced CSS programmers are usually aware of this but beginners do miss out on this ! important CSS rule .
By adding ! important to your CSS rule , you can increase its precedence over other subsequent rules .
e.g. in below code , background - color will be blue and not red due to ! important .
. page { background - color : blue ! important ; background - color: red;}
5. Replace Text With Image
This is a nice SEO trick that lets you show a nice fancy image instead of simple boring text to your visitors but search engines will see only the text .
. header { text - indent :-9999px ; background:url ( ' someimage.jpg ' ) no-repeat ; height : 100 px ; /*dimensions equal to image size */ width :500 px ; }
6. Cross Browser Minimum Height
Internet Explorer does not understand the min-height property but here ’s the CSS trick to accomplish that in IE .
# container{ height : auto ! important ;/* all browsers except ie6 will respect the ! important flag*/ min-height :500 px ; height :500 px ;/* Should have the same value as the min height above */ }
7 . Highlight links that open in a new window
This piece of CSS code will highlight links that open in a new window so that user knows before hand that link will pop open in a new tab or window .
a[ target = " _blank " ] : before , a[ target = " new " ] : before { margin:0 5px 0 0 ; padding : 1 px ; outline : 1 px solid # 333 ; color :#333 ; background : #ff9 ; font : 12 px " Zapf Dingbats " ; content : " \279 C " ; }
8. Style Your Ordered List
Style numbers of an ordered list in different way than the content of each list item .
ol { font : italic 1em Georgia , Times , serif ; color : # 999999 ; } ol p { font : normal .8 em Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; color : # 000000 ; }
9. Drop Caps Using CSS
You can create a drop caps effect like those in newspapers or magazines using the : first - letter pseudo element .
p:first - letter{ display : block ; margin :5 px 0 0 5 px ; float : left ; color : #FF3366 ; font - size : 3.0em ; font - family : Georgia ; }
10 . Cross Browser Opacity
Though CSS3 standard includes the opacity property , but not every browser supports it , here ’s the CSS trick for cross browser transparency .
.transparent_class { filter:alpha( opacity=50 ) ; -moz-opacity :0.5 ; - khtml- opacity : 0.5 ; opacity : 0.5 ; }
11 . Vertical centering with line - height
If you are using fixed height container and need to vertically center the text , use the line - height property to do that perfectly .
line - height :30 px ;
12 . Center Fixed Width layout
If you use fixed width layout , you should center the layout so that if somebody views it on larger screen , the page displays in the center of the screen and not on left side .
body { width : 1000 px ; margin: 0 auto ; }
13 . Remove vertical textarea scrollbar in IE
IE adds a vertical scrollbar to textarea input fields regardless of the height of content in it .
You can fix that with this simple CSS trick .
textarea{ overflow : auto ; }
14 . Remove active link borders
Some browsers like Firefox and IE add a dotted outline border over the link user clicked .
It is a useful accessibility feature that lets user know which link he clicked or is in focus .
But sometimes you need to get rid of this , here ’s the CSS you need to use .
a:active , a: focus{ outline : none ; }
15 . Prevent Elements from disappearing in IE
Sometimes IE behaves in a peculiar way and makes some elements disappear , which appear when you try to make a selection .
It is due to some IE issues with float elements .
This can be fixed by adding position : relative ; to elements that disappears .
16 . Attribute - Specific Icons
CSS Attribute selectors are very powerful giving you many options to control styles of different elements e.g. you can add an icon based on the href attribute of the a tag to let the user know whether link points to an image , pdf , doc file etc .
a [ href $ ='.doc ' ] { padding :0 20px 0 0 ; background : transparent url(/ graphics/icons/doc.gif ) no -repeat center right ; }
17 . CSS Pointer Cursors
This trend has caught up lately .
All user interface elements on a web page that can be clicked by user have their cursor similar to that of hyperlink .
Here ’s the CSS trick to do that .
input[ type=submit ] , label , select , .pointer { cursor : pointer ; }
18 . Capitalize Text
This trick is especially useful for displaying title of an article on a web page with all its words starting with capital letter .
text - transform : capitalize ;
19 . Small Caps Text
This is one of the lesser used but useful CSS property .
It capitalizes all the letters of text but the size of letters following the first letter of each word is smaller than the first letter .
font - variant : small - caps ;
20 . Highlight Text Input Fields
This CSS trick lets you highlight the input field currently in focus .
This trick does not work in IE though .
input [ type=text ] : focus , input[ type=password ] : focus{ border : 2 px solid # 000 ; }
21 . Remove Image Border
Image hyperlinks usually get a ugly blue border that makes your image hyperlinks look horrible .
It ’s better to remove border on all hyperlinked images and add individually to those you want using CSS classes .
a img{ border : none ; }
22 . Tableless Forms Using labels
Gone are the days when tables were used to layout Forms .
CSS lets you make accessible forms with table like layout using label tags .
Using label tags makes sure your forms are more accessible .
Here ’s sample html and css code for tableless form using labels .
< form method = " post " action= " # " > < p >< label for =" username " > Username < / label > < input type =" text " id =" username " name = " username " /> </ p> < p >< label for =" password " > Username < / label > < input type=" password " id =" password " name = " pass " /> </ p> < p >< input type=" submit " value = " Submit " /></p> </ form >
p label{ width : 100 px ; float : left ; margin - right : 10 px ; text - align : right ; }
23 . Set a Consistent Base Font Size
Setting the font - size property to 62.5 % in body tag makes 1em equal to 10 px .
This lets you use em easily as you can find out the font - size in pixels from em values .
body { font - size : 62.5 % ; }
24 . Highlight Acronym and Abbr Tags
acronym and abbr tags provide useful information to users , browsers and search engines about acronyms and abbreviations , but most of the browsers except Firefox do not highlight them .
Here ’s the CSS trick to highlight acronym and abbr tags within your web page .
acronym , abbr{ border - bottom : 1 px dotted # 333 ; cursor : help ; }
25 . CSS Reset by Eric Meyer
This piece of CSS code resets all the browser default styles preventing any browser inconsistencies in your CSS styles .
html , body , div , span , applet , object , iframe , h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 , p , blockquote , pre , a , abbr , acronym , address , big , cite , code , del , dfn , em , font , img , ins , kbd , q , s , samp , small , strike , strong , sub , sup , tt , var , b , u , i , center , dl , dt , dd , ol , ul , li , fieldset , form , label , legend , table , caption , tbody , tfoot , thead , tr , th , td { margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; border : 0 ; outline : 0 ; font - size : 100 % ; vertical - align : baseline ; background : transparent ; } body { line - height : 1 ; } ol , ul { list - style : none ; } blockquote , q { quotes : none ; } blockquote : before , blockquote : after , q:before , q: after { content : '' ; content : none ; } /* remember to define focus styles ! */ : focus { outline : 0 ; } /* remember to highlight inserts somehow ! */ ins { text - decoration : none ; } del { text - decoration : line - through ; } /* tables still need ' cellspacing= " 0 " ' in the markup */ table { border - collapse : collapse ; border - spacing : 0 ; }

A precious , innocent child ’s life came to a cruel , sudden end .
The Wall Street Journal reports that Natalie Morton , who died in England shortly following a Cervarix injection , did not die from the vaccination .
The WSJ , in fact , almost appears to be swaggering behind its words .
So you see , says the WSJ , no need to fear or stop the H1N1 vaccination program .
There are pathology reports that absolve the vaccination and its maker .
The HPV vaccinations are perfectly safe , as are the swine flu jabs .
Thank goodness — I feel better already .
The pathology report states that she had an undiagnosed condition that was “ so severe that death could have arisen at any point . ”
What was that condition ?
A “ tumour in her chest involving her heart and her lungs . ”
A tumor ( do n’t like the Brit spelling ) that just suddenly lashed out at her and attacked and killed , after producing no symptoms of a cancer tumor whatsoever ?
Is there a single person who is dumb enough to swallow this very inadequate version of her death ?
I mentioned the other day that GlaxoSmithKline is working to get approval to sell Cervarix in the U.S. to compete against Merck ’s Gardasil .
Of course they would n’t allow a truthful report of this death , caused by the vaccination , to be revealed and thus deny its approval in the U.S. , causing the loss of billions of dollars in revenue streams .
As Mike Adams says , “ This explanation is obviously a cover story to protect the vaccine industry ; and it ’s not even a convincing cover story at that . ”
Remember , this is a global vaccination program , with mandates growing and billions at stake .
This is from the Wall Street Journal piece :
That sad case is a reminder to be wary of confusing proximity in time with cause and effect — a concept public - health officials have been citing in advance of the imminent roll out of the swine ( H1N1 ) flu vaccine .
Ahh yes , coincidence !
People , you see , may now fear the massive swine flu forced vaccination program the government is trying to shove down our throats .
Ca n’t have that — declaring a worldwide pandemic and triggering hysteria means the growth of government control and a healthy , wealthy pharmaceutical industry .

The singer is interrupted onstage at the telecast by country legend Little Jimmy Dickens
This time , the joke was on Kanye .
Already a target early on at the Country Music Association Awards when co-hosts Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley poked fun at him through song , the rapper received another jab after a country legend crashed the stage during an exchange between the telecast ’s co-hosts .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ I just gotta say , “ Welcome to the Future ” was probably one of my favorite videos in a long time , ” Underwood told Paisley .
RELATED : Taylor Swift Sweeps the CMAs
But before Paisley could reply , Little Jimmy Dickens , 88 , a member of the Grand Ole Opry known for his novelty tunes , crashed the stage and launched into a ( humorous ) tirade .
“ Excuse me , sir , ” he said , cutting off Paisley .
“ I ’ll let you finish later .
I know you had a nice video and all , but Taylor Swift made the best video of all time .
Of all time !
You go , girl ! ”
And the CMAs agreed : Swift ’s “ Love Story ” won best music video of the year .
Dickens , of course , was poking fun at West ’s now - infamous stagecrashing at this year ’s MTV Music Video Awards , where the rapper interrupted Swift ’s acceptance speech .
Swift , meanwhile , seemed in on the joke , laughing modestly in her seat as the audience at Nasvhille ’s Sommet Center howled .
Samir Nasri boosts Arsenal as midfielder targets West Ham clash for comeback
On the mend : Nasri is relishing his comeback
Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri expects to be back in action this month after recovering from a broken leg .
Nasri , a £ 13 million buy from Marseille last summer , picked up the injury in pre-season .
He said : ' I 'm due to rejoin the Arsenal team this weekend , or at the start of next week .
I think I will be back in action against West Ham on the 25th . '
The 22 - year - old also hailed the Gunners ' recent displays and manager Arsene Wenger 's tactics .
' The new style of play suits us .
Cesc Fabregas has a bit more freedom in midfield , and the rest of us link up well with him , ' he added .
Nasri's fellow Frenchman William Gallas is a doubt for his country 's clash against Austria after he smashed two teeth in the 5 - 0 win over the Faroe Islands on Saturday .
Apple is " exploring an overhaul of the way it sells and stores music that is aimed at extending its influence to the Web , according to people briefed on the strategy , " according to a report in The Wall Street Journal .
Apple sure seems to move fast .
On Friday , it was rumored that the company was in talks to purchase online music site , Lala .
A couple of hours later , was reporting that the deal had been closed .
Now , according to , Apple is already looking to take advantage of that deal -- by moving iTunes online .
According to the paper , Apple is , " exploring an overhaul of the way it sells and stores music that is aimed at extending its influence to the Web , according to people briefed on the strategy . "
The article adds ,
Where Apple 's iTunes requires users to download music onto a specific computer , Lala.com lets users buy and listen to music through a Web browser , meaning its customers can access purchases from anywhere , as long as they are connected to the Internet .
Apple is considering adopting that same model for songs sold on iTunes , a change that would give consumers more ways to access and manage their iTunes purchases -- and would n't require them to download Apple 's software or their purchases .
The changes , the Journal adds , could come as early as next year .

Rick�s Picks Tuesday , December 8 , 2009 � Phenomenally accurate forecasts �
For those who have been unsettled by gold 's corrective weakness in recent days , I 've reprinted a reassuring letter below from a friend and longtime subscriber who also happens to be a U.K. - based gold - dealer and metals trader .
Andy , as he is known in the Rick�s Picks chat room , is bullish as ever on gold and sees a potential " black swan " bearing down on the financial system in the form of a Chinese derivatives - default .
This is a looming catastrophe that we 've written about here before , as some of you may recall .
The threat surfaced with an announcement by China a couple of months ago that the government would take no legal action against its own banks if they walked away from derivatives deals gone bad .
Imagine what this would mean if you were running one of those banks yourself .
In effect , it would allow you to build extremely risky derivatives positions , but with no exposure if they did n't work out .
Here 's an analogy : Picture yourself being allowed to use counterfeit money in a casino .
You make huge bets in roulette , blackjack and baccarat , and although most of these bets lose , the casino pays your winners in real money .
You bank the winnings -- buy gold bars with it , perhaps -- and continue to gamble with funny money until you 've used it up .
Heads or Tails : Who Cares ?
This , in effect , is undoubtedly what some Chinese banks are doing right now : laying highly leveraged bets all over town , knowing they wo n't have to cover them if the derivatives market starts to implode again .
Moreover , the mere fact that the Chinese government has promised legal amnesty to those who lose big at this game is probably causing the volume of such bets to explode .
We 'll find out for sure when reality comes calling once again on the banking system , which , with the help of regulators and the central banks , has done little more than sweep a $ 600 trillion derivatives problem under the rug .
Make no mistake , when the festering creature under the rug emerges one day breathing fire , we 're likely to see a panic into gold that will make bullion 's ascent so far from $ 260 to $ 1227 look relatively tame .
What will be the catalyst for this Day of Reckoning ?
Nick Guarino , a well - known seer , thinks Dubai 's troubles are about to take the global financial system down .
But he also believes the resulting panic will be into U.S. dollars rather than gold , which he says is in a bubble along with oil and stocks .
( Click here for a scary read , in Guarino�s own words . )
Opposite of Bubble Andy disagrees , and we have reprinted his letter below so that you can understand why .
Here it is : " [ Guarino ] has a lot of things right .
However I think his take on gold is wrong .
I have a completely different take on it .
There are several reasons -- for example , why would the producers buy back their hedges at these levels ?
It is because they know higher prices are coming down the pipe .
What kind of business - sense would it make , if you have Gold hedged from the $ 300's through the $ 900's on the books , to consider locking in such a massive loss if you could average down the price by selling forward production above 1000 ?
" As far as Wall Street creating a bubble in the price of gold , you only have to look at the massive concentrated short positions to see the opposite is true .
There are all the usual reasons why JP Morgan , HSBC et al. act for the Fed in keeping a leash on Gold 's rise in an attempt to prop up the U.S. dollar .
But there are several cracks in the dam .
Gold is having �up� days when the dollar is rising , and HSBC is covering while JPM is taking the load .
Physical supply is VERY tight .
We were offered 125 % premium not to take delivery of our September contracts because unallocated LBMA gold runs on a fractional - reserve basis and they simply did n't have the metal to deliver .
We are now demanding delivery of December early and are hearing the same song .
Insisting on � Physical � � My client refused , and will refuse again , to take a cash settlement and insists on physical .
They are looking longer - term and do n't care if gold is as $ 1000 or $ 1300 .
My orders are to keep buying all the dips .
We will take advantage of rollovers , option expiries , fix takedowns , NFP today etc. and keep this up until further notice .
Something big is going down here , and I am hearing China will default on their OTC obligations and Gold will become very tight .
� Personally , as a trader I will take the cash premium again if it comes up and immediately buy spot , which I will quietly convert to physical . )
I hope we do get a dip over the next few days but I am just one of many looking to convert paper to gold .
As an aside , the new futures position - limits kick in before month 's end , and it is not the long side that will be affected .
JPM has over 40 % of the silver shorts and the CFTC is under pressure to deal with it and the Gold position .
� Here is a link to my last letter to Chilton that I see popped up all over the net .
Historicals no longer apply -- there has been a major shift in the dynamics .
I look forward to coming back ' home ' to the chat board in the New Year .
Thanks for all your good work . �
And thank you ,
Andy , for your savvy insights into the bullion market .

Do n't laugh , but it 's possible that the Tories wo n't win the next general election .
Sounds silly , I know , given that the polls , the press , why , the very scent in the air , insists that David Cameron is – in the words of today 's Guardian front page – the " PM in waiting " .
Wherever he travels now , Cameron leaves audiences concluding that he looks the part : he has the manner , the confidence , that glow of imminent power .
Even Labour ministers have succumbed to this sense of inevitability .
Refer in private conversation to the Tories as the " next government " , and they do n't even blink in protest .
But they might all be wrong .
It 's still possible that even if Labour does n't win in 2010 , the Tories could lose , denied an outright victory : those expenses - fiddling MPs might escape a hanging from the voters , but still parliament could be hung .
I 'm not saying it 's likely , nor even probable .
If you 've got £ 10 to hand over to a bookmaker , find something else to bet on .
But it is definitely possible .
Start with yesterday 's Guardian poll .
The headline figures showed Cameron outstripping Gordon Brown on every measure of alpha male leadership : tougher and more decisive .
But underneath was the news that the gap between Labour and Conservative is shrinking .
Some pollsters have it at 10 points , which they declare " the bare minimum for a functional majority " .
If that lead melts into single digits , as it could under the hot lights of an election , then the Tories will be in peril .
But that 's just the beginning .
Those at Brown 's side promise that the coming contest will not be a national but a regional election , won in marginal seats that exist in roughly equal numbers in the south , north and Midlands .
They 've written off their chances in the southern marginals , but swear they 're ahead in the key northern seats and competitive in the Midlands : aided , they say , by the fact that the Tories ' appeal shrinks the further they get away from London .
Denis MacShane , the Rotherham MP , testifies that Cameron strikes even those of his constituents who now loathe Labour as irredeemably southern and metropolitan ; their response to George Osborne is even more hostile .
In a recent council byelection in Barnsley , the Conservatives came fifth behind Labour , the BNP , local independents and Ukip .
Labour 's high command contrasts this with the enthusiasm for Tony Blair – and poll numbers north of 50 % – in 1997 , and says the Tories are nowhere near where they need to be .
Pollsters do n't wholly disagree , noting the " softness " in Tory support , measured by those who say they might yet change their minds , and the scale of the mountain the Conservatives have to climb – needing to increase their number of MPs by the order of 70 % .
Look to the women , the Labour optimists say next .
Among female voters the Conservative poll lead is smaller .
That 's why the heart of today 's Queen 's speech will be a new promise on social care for the elderly , aimed specifically at the 45 - to 65 - year - old women who are , say Labour strategists , " in the crunch " on care , either worried for themselves or their parents .
The contrast will be clear , they hope , with Osborne 's austerity message , which may have won plaudits from the well - cushioned commentariat but , they insist , repels regular voters .
In this view , all that Labour canvassers have to say on the doorstep is that the Tories will have you working harder for longer : not a great vote - winner .
What else do they have up their sleeves ?
Downing Street has been studying hard the come - from - behind Conservative victory of 1992 , helped by the presence of one of the lead operatives of that offensive around the current cabinet table : Shaun Woodward .
That year the Tories hit their opponents by warning of Labour 's " tax bombshell " .
In 2010 Labour is mulling a return of the compliment , warning that the Tories will drop their own bombshell – on tax credits , many of which help people on middle incomes .
Another 1992 echo : Labour hopes to remind those in work and with a mortgage that they are , despite the recession , better off , thanks in part to ultra - low interest rates .
They plan , too , to reprise one of Brown 's favourite tunes , running 2010 as a " many , not the few " election .
That the Tories have not dropped their proposed cut in inheritance tax – which will give a £ 200,000 tax break to the 3,000 wealthiest estates – while promising to repeal the ban on foxhunting only hands Labour a bigger target .
" Government will now be of the rich , by the rich , for the rich , " says MacShane .
There 's another potential Tory weakness .
When the National Front was on the march in the late 1970s , Margaret Thatcher moved swiftly , luring rightwing voters back to the Tory camp by talking their language , warning that immigrants threatened to " swamp " Britain .
But that option is not open to the kinder , gentler David Cameron , not without fatally undermining his brand .
So a boost for Ukip and the BNP could split the right vote and see at least a few seats slipping from the Tories ' grasp .
And , despite those stellar numbers in the ICM poll , Cameron is not without vulnerabilities .
I 'm told that one political communications professional – sympathetic to the Tory leader – asks his corporate clients what kind of strategy they wish to pursue : a Blair or a Cameron ?
The former is for those who want to tackle a difficult subject , the latter is for those who want to change the subject .
The focus - group - meisters say the first story that voters tell when asked to talk about Cameron is still the one about him cycling to work – followed by a car carrying his bag .
Or it 's the Tory spinners briefing that Samantha Cameron was wearing a humble M&S off - the - peg dress – only for it to be revealed that the dress was in fact tailored especially for her on the orders of the store 's chief executive .
Labour can still try to brand Cameron as a fake .
Put it all together , close your eyes , cross your fingers and , say Labour 's most optimistic hearts , it could all come right on the night .
The problem , says the former deputy leadership candidate Jon Cruddas , is that " this perfect combination of forces all have to come into line in time for election day " .
In other words , even if some of the strategists ' hopes are realised , it 's a stretch to believe they all will be .
What 's more , plenty of those arguments wobble under scrutiny .
Take the 1992 precedent .
As an issue , tax credits lack the punch of income tax .
And , even if Gordon Brown does analogise quite well to John Major , is David Cameron really Neil Kinnock , widely derided as " unelectable " ?
No .
Labour is clinging to the belief that the race will tighten in the heat of an election campaign .
But that 's far from certain .
Is n't it just as possible that Brown might look tired and clumsy , thereby reinforcing the Tories ' time - for - a - change message ?
Even if they buy the optimistic scenario , plenty of Labour MPs are not quite sure what to do with it .
For some it only makes them more frustrated , proof that the coming election really would be winnable if only they had one last element in place : a leader who had not , apparently , been written off by the electorate .
Others take heart , believing that somehow they can stave off defeat without taking that fateful step .
But they all know that it would take a miraculous dollop of luck for everything to go the way the Brown team say it might .
And , right now , not many are feeling lucky .

When I raved about the scrambled eggs at Gottino , Chef Jody Williams saw my post and offered to give me a tutorial on her amazing Steamed Scrambled Eggs .
If that ’s not a food blogger ’s dream come true , I do n’t know what is .
Chef Jody started by showing me her tiny workspace behind the bar .
After eating here twice , I had always assumed there was another kitchen somewhere , but there is n’t .
There is some more prep space downstairs but no full kitchen .
Nearly everything you eat at Gottino 52 Greenwich Avenue , New York , NY 10011 is made right behind the bar .
Through adversity , Chef Jody has found a way to work around the limited space and limited appliances , still serving up some of the best stuff in town .
She tells me her favorite brunch item is the Crespelle Dolci , the crepes with butter , apples , and walnuts .
She uses sea salt from main , Greek olive oil , and feels strongly about very fresh ground pepper .
Then there ’s this story about how she started making a family meal / staff meal of a waffle sandwich with bacon , egg , and cheese .
The idea was something she ate on vacation in Hawaii and it became this secret menu item at Gottino .
You wo n’t see it on the menu , but if you ask for a Surfer Sandwich , they ’ll make it for you .
The staff I met , Alice Attala , Jeremy Mustakas , Max Poglia , Matt Perkins , and Jenny Robie , seem like family here and makes it feel less like a restaurant and more like a friend ’s apartment , only there ’s a full fridge with plenty to eat and drink .
So without further ado , watch this video ( my first video , so please bear with me ) for the secret to her Steamed Scrambled Eggs !
( I ’d love feedback on the video . )

The cable industry is saying that Network Neutrality would violate the First Amendment because it would prohibit them from “ expressing themselves ” by distorting the flow of information over the Internet wires they control .
Marvin Ammori has posted an interesting response .
Our view is that it boils down to this :
The telecoms play two different roles : as speakers , and access providers .
Internet service providers ( ISPs ) , including cable and telecom companies acting as such , provide information and services .
They deliver video feeds and web pages and other content of their own .
That is fine and in that regard , they absolutely do have a First Amendment right to provide whatever content they want to provide , or not provide .
But ISPs also play another role : they perform the public function of controlling the wires through and across which everyone ’s speech flows .
When they control the pipes , it is a free - speech imperative that they do that in a non-discriminatory way – just like the phone companies can't decide what calls can be made over the phone - to ensure that free speech belongs to all .
It is essential that companies not be permitted to use role number two to advance their own particular interests and viewpoints per their free speech rights under role number one .
OSHKOSH , Wis.  Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is normally a mild - mannered man , at least in public , but he unleashed a torrent on Thursday about leaks during the investigation of the Foot Hood shootings and during President Obama ’s deliberations on sending more American troops to Afghanistan .
First , on the president ’s meetings on Afghanistan : “ I have been appalled by the amount of leaking that has been going on in this process , ” Mr. Gates told reporters on his plane en route to a Wisconsin factory that is churning out thousands of armored trucks for use by American troops in Afghanistan .
He added that he thought “ a lot of different places are leaking ” and that he was “ confident that the Department of Defense is one of them . ”
Then he made a threat : “ And frankly if I found out with high confidence anybody who was leaking in the Department of Defense , who that was , that would probably be a career ender . ”
The defense secretary moved on to the investigation of Maj.
Nidal Malik Hasan , who was charged in the deaths of 13 people on Nov. 5 at Fort Hood , Tex. , and what Mr. Gates called “ unconscionable ” leaks from “ everybody out there with their own little piece of the action . ”
The first public release of CLI is now available from the project ’s web page .
There are also the CLI Language Getting Started Guide and CLI Compiler Command Line Manual .
I have created the cli-users mailing list , though I will still continue writing about the CLI design and development on this blog .
Check it all out and let me know what you think .
One interesting implementation aspect that I would like to mention is the use of the CLI compiler to handle its own command line interface .
As a result , it is always a good idea to keep an older , working build of CLI around ;-) .
Looking forward , I now realize that one of the first new features in CLI should be the automatic documentation generation .
In the next post we will start exploring various designs for this feature .

Some 30,000 people were disappeared during Argentina ’s 1976 - 1983 military dictatorship .
Kidnapped by commando groups in the middle of the night , they were taken to clandestine detention centers .
The largest and most notorious torture center , The ESMA Navy Mechanics School in Buenos Aires still stands today , but as a museum for Memory .
At the ESMA the Navy along with other police and military groups devised a complex system for the forced disappearance of individuals .
Most of the prisoners were held at the Officer ’s Quarters , where high ranking officials slept and lived while women and men were tortured in the basement and attic .
Torture survivor Victor Basterra was held at the ESMA from 1979 until the end of the dictatorship .
In the basement of the ESMA ’s Officer ’s Quarters , Basterra traversed through the same space where he and detainees underwent unimaginable terror .
“ This area was called the ‘ huevera ’ or ‘ egg cup ’ because the walls were lined with egg cartons to drown out noises . ”
More than 5,000 people were detained and disappeared at the ESMA Navy Mechanics School .
Hundreds of officers , cadets and higher ranking officials worked at concentration camp .
Prisoners were also held and tortured in the attic also known as the “ Capucha ” or “ Hood . ”
The military gave this sinister name because detainees were held handcuffed and hooded .
Many of the victims from the ESMA were drugged and dropped into the sea in the death flights .
Few bodies have been recovered .
The ESMA housed a clandestine maternity ward where pregnant women held at the ESMA were forced to give birth in captivity .
Doctors and nurses assisted in the delivery .
Shortly after birth , newborns were separated from their mothers and appropriated by marines or other members of the military forces .
It is estimated that 35 children were born while their mothers were held in illegal captivity at the ESMA .
The few torture victims which survived the ESMA provided much of the information as to what is known about how the ESMA operated .
Basterra , who will testify in the trial , took photos of officers and prisoners during his detention at the ESMA , risking his life to smuggle them out later providing evidence to try the officers .
The photos were used in the first Junta Trial in 1985 .
For more than three decades , survivors and their families anticipated the trial of officers who worked at the ESMA and now face charges of human rights abuses , torture and murder .
For 29 years the human rights group Mothers of Plaza de Mayo has held their annual March of the Resistance on International Human Rights day to demand justice and information as to the whereabouts of their children .
Marta Ocampo de Vazquez is the president of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo – Founding Line .
“ Today we are holding the 29th March of the Resistance , remembering our past .
And remembering that we still do n’t have truth and justice .
We still do n’t know the whole truth and what happened to our children . ”
Since 1977 , the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo have protested in the historic Plaza de Mayo .
Because many of the mothers are now in their 80s , some worry that they will not live to see the military held responsible for its crimes .
This year ’s march of the resistance came a day before a major human rights trial began .
At the opening day of the ESMA trial , survivors , relatives and rights activists wore T - shirts displaying the message trial and punishment .
Victoria Donda , who was born at the ESMA while her mother was in captivity attended the trial ( second from left ) .
Donda recuperated her identity in 2003 .
The ESMA trial is one of the biggest human rights trials in Latin America ’s history .
Among those on trial include Alfredo Astiz , Jorge Acosta , Ricardo Cavallo and Adolfo Donda , referred to by Human Rights groups some of the most sinister repressors among the ranks of the military .
In total , thirteen marines , two police , one coast guard , and one Army official are on trial .
The ESMA trial is a welcomed step toward justice , however much remains to be known about the whereabouts of 30,000 people who were forcefully disappeared .
The trials were made possible by the work of human rights activists who have endlessly demanded justice for the crimes committed against their loved ones .

Shanghai , China ( CNN ) --
It all started with the lure of the glitz , the glamour and the dream of being China 's next pop star .
But , as with many reality shows , Lou Jing 's instant fame came with unanticipated consequences .
Lou Jing was born 20 years ago in Shanghai to a Chinese mother and an African - American father .
According to her mother , who asked not to be identified in this report , she met Lou 's father while she was still in college .
He left China before their daughter was born .
Growing up with a single mom in central Shanghai , Lou Jing said she had good friends and lived a normal life .
" When I was young , I did n't feel any different , " she said .
But as soon as she stepped into the national spotlight on a Chinese reality television show called " Go! Oriental Angel , " Lou Jing became a national sensation -- not necessarily because of her talent , but how she looked .
" After the contest started , I often got more attention than the other girls .
It made me feel strange , " Lou said .
The reality show hosts fondly called her " chocolate girl " and " black pearl . "
The Chinese media fixated on her skin color .
Netizens flooded Web sites with comments saying she " never should have been born " and telling her to " get out of China . "
Lou Jing 's background became fodder for national gossip , sparking a vitriolic debate about race across a country that , in many respects , can be quite homogenous .
There are 56 different recognized ethnic groups in China , but more than 90 percent of the population is Han Chinese .
So people who look different stand out .
" We lived in a small circle before , " said her mother .
" But after Lou was seen nationwide , some Chinese people could n't accept her . "
It has been a shocking ordeal for someone who says she always considered herself just like every other Chinese girl .
" Sometimes people on the street would ask me , ' Why do you speak Chinese so well ? '
I 'd just say , ' Because I'm Chinese ! ' "
Lou said .
But , as any curious child would , Lou Jing certainly thought about why she looked different .
In a clip reel aired on the show , her classmates say they tried to protect her from feeling out of place .
" She used to wonder why she had black skin , " said one classmate .
" We thought about this question together and decided to tell her it's because she likes dark chocolate .
So her skin turned darker gradually . "
Another classmate weighed in , " We said it 's because she used to drink too much soy sauce . "
Even Lou Jing 's maternal grandmother admitted in a taped interview , " I told Lou Jing she was black because her mom was not very well and had to take Chinese medicine . "
But such explanations were not enough for a voracious Chinese public .
Show producers convinced Lou Jing 's mom to appear on - air and asked her to address the many unanswered questions .
" Lou Jing did not ask about her father until she was sixteen years old , " her mother told the audience .
" She said , ' Where is my dad ? '
I did n't answer , I just cried and Lou Jing never asked me this question again . "
On stage this time , it was Lou Jing who wept as she held an arm tightly around her mother , gripping the microphone in the other .
The camera zoomed in on audience members tearing up as well .
" Lou Jing would cook dinner for me before I got home , " her mother said .
" I was quite sad then .
In other families a girl her age would have a mom and a dad who loved her . "
Although her father has been absent , Lou seemed to be curious about learning more .
On the reality show , the host inquired , " Lou Jing , have you ever thought about going to find your dad , to get to know him ? "
Lou Jing pauses for a moment and softly responds , " Yes , I have thought about that before . "
In this way , the most private aspects of Lou Jing 's otherwise quiet life became painfully public .
But as the show went on , so did Lou Jing .
She stuck with her daily routine , listening to Beyonce , her favorite artist , hanging out with her friends and continuing to go to school .
" I was so angry , " said her drama teacher , Tao Yandong , of the Shanghai Drama Academy 's School for the Television Arts .
" My student had been insulted by others so of course I felt bad , too .
But she told me she was fine and was n't letting these things hurt her heart . "
Watching Lou Jing laugh and gossip with her Chinese classmates today , this appears to be true .
Back in her modest two - bedroom apartment , it is hard to imagine that Lou Jing and her mother are subjects of national scrutiny .
Instead , they are focused on her future .
Her career goals are many , spanning from hosting a television show to becoming a diplomat " to bring people together , " she said .
As a college junior , Lou Jing is thinking about graduate school applications , hoping to pursue a master 's degree in foreign policy in New York City after she graduates from college .
When asked what she will do without her mother , Lou excitedly said , " My mom is going to come with me ! "
Her mom shakes her head and smiles .
If anything , their enduring bond as mother and daughter only seems to have gotten stronger .
After all , for all their critics , there were just as many supporters .
Until the end of her run on " Go! Oriental Angel , " fans continued to vote for Lou Jing show after show .
The judges praised her confidence .
Lou Jing was eventually eliminated before the finale , but not without a powerful parting message .
" I think I 'm the same as all the girls here , except for my skin color .
We share the same stage and the same dream .
I 've tried my best , so no matter what happens , I 'll hold onto my dream . "

Introduction and translation by Kiraz Janicke
November 4 , 2009 -- The government of Peru has launched a massive attack on Indigenous peoples through a request to dissolve the Amazon Interethnic Development Association of the Peruvian Rainforest ( AIDESEP ) , Peru 's largest and most representative Indigenous organisation .
AIDESEP groups numerous regional organisations , representing 65 ethnic groups and has led the struggle against the Garcia governments neoliberal decrees ( which are part of the US Free Trade Agreement ) aimed at opening up huge swathes of the Amazon to exploitation by transnational logging , mining and oil companies .
Since the Indigneous uprising in Bagua in which an unknown number of Indigneous people were massacred by Peruvian police on June 5 , 2009 , the leaders of AIDESEP have been facing political persecution , some have been arrested and its president , Alberto Pizango , has been forced to flee and seek asylum in Nicaragua .
Below is a statement below by Andean and Amazonian peoples protesting against the government 's attempt to dissolve their organisation .
* * *
Pronouncement by the Andean and Amazonian peoples :
For our rights and in defence of organisational autonomy
Against the request by the public prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice to order the dissolution of the national organisation of Indigenous peoples that make up the Amazon Interethnic Development Association of the Peruvian Rainforest ( AIDESEP ) , the community organisations and Indigenous peoples of Peru , and various civil society organisations , express the following :
1 . That continuing with its policy of silencing the organisations representing Indigenous peoples , the government through the public prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice has requested the dissolution of the Interethnic Association for Development of the Peruvian Jungle ( AIDESEP ) , as notified October 15 , 2009 , by the 37th Criminal Court of Lima .
This act corresponds to the interests of ending the representative organisations of Iindigenous peoples and communities , and at the same time aims to sharpen social discontent promoting new mobilisations and uprisings , in order to later blame others .
2 . Once again the government implements its policy of double standards , because on one hand it announces the installation of spaces for dialogue with Indigenous organisations and the other seeks to dismantle the organisations that have spoken out against the unconsultative application of a series of public policies and legal measures that undermine our legitimate rights to self - determination , land , consultation and others .
This shows it is putting economic interests before our rights as Indigenous peoples .
3 . We denounce this practice that is not unique to the incumbent government , but habitual of the regimes in recent decades .
It seeks to silence and destroy existing organisations or generate other parallel entitites using individuals or organisations that lack representation and legitimacy .
This and other situations have led to a series of recommendations by international agencies that monitor compliance with treaties and conventions as in the case of CERD , CEACR - ILO , High Commissioner of United Nations and others .
Given this situation we declare :
We recognise AIDESEP in its condition as a territorial organisation representing the Indigenous Amazon people , with input and suggestions in defence of our rights as peoples during its years of existence .
We also support its regional and community - based organisations in the face of this attempt at dissolution by the current government .
We reaffirm that our existence as distinct peoples is not subject to the will of the state and as such our organisational autonomy and institutional force must be respected .
We reaffirm the just and legitimate defence of our rights as Indigenous peoples and communities , as are recognised by the constitution , international conventions and treaties .
We reject the discriminatory state policy , which aims to interrupt the process of dialogue between the state and the legitimately elected representatives of Amazon Indigenous peoples , which emerged after the events of Bagua .
This should express and give effect to the agreements reached in the communities of the central and northern jungle .
We demand the cessation of hostilities against the national Indigenous organisation AIDESEP and its leaders .
There must be an end of claims against it and the filing of complaints for acts that were not generated by the organisation but were generated by unwise government policy and the denial of the existence of Indigenous peoples by the current government .
We demand the establishment of a horizontal dialogue process in good faith and the suspending of operations that attack this process under construction and do not contribute to confidence building between the parties .
We demand that the situation of Indigenous peoples are addressed in general , and that this includes the Amazon , the Andes and the coast , with the aim of determining national policies and that the state does not encourage fragmentation in its treatment [ of Indigenous peoples ] .

The Vatican has come out against vampirical toothy teen book 'n ' movie series Twilight , dismissing the epic girl loves vampire , girl loses vampire , girl becomes vampire cycle as a " deviant moral vacuum " .
The Holy See 's attempt to drive a stake through the heart of the burgeoning film franchise came as it took £ 1.8 m on its opening day in Italy .
It was down to Vatican in - house mag Osservatore Romano to deliver the verdict on the movie .
According to the Daily Mail Monsignor Franco Perazzolo , of the Pontifical Council of Culture , said : " Men and women are transformed with horrible masks and it is once again that age - old trick or ideal formula of using extremes to make an impact at the box office .
" This film is nothing more than a moral vacuum with a deviant message and as such should be of concern . "
The Mail added that a spokespriest said the film gives a " mixture of excesses aimed at young people and gives a heavy esoteric element . "
The attack on the series - incidentally the creation of a Mormon - demonstrates the Vatican 's eclectic approach to film reviewing .
The Vatican had long condemned the Harry Potter series , claiming it would corrupt impressionable young children and turn them onto the occult , or at least onto the English boarding school system .
Then , it turned around and praised the film version of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince for its sharp delineation of good and evil .
Likewise , the Vatican had a long - running downer on Dan Brown and The Da Vinci Code - understandable perhaps given its rather anti-Vatican stance .
Then , earlier this year , it faint - praisedly damned Angels and Demons as " quite harmless " .
So , standby for the current condemnation of Twilight to subtly transubstanitate into polite praise for its portrayal of a young girl 's spiritual journey from vampire lover to loving vampire wife and back into the arms of the one true faith .

Forget Thanksgiving turkey , fellowship , and football ; for a lot of shoppers , Black Friday is the week 's truly notable holiday .
The unofficial start of the holiday shopping season is often referred to as the busiest shopping day of the year , but where did this tradition start and just how big is it ?
Here are the answers to a few frequently asked questions about Black Friday .
Hopefully they 'll give you some good talking points as you line up outside Best Buy at 4 a.m. on Friday .
How did Black Friday became such a big shopping day ?
It 's hard to say when the day after Thanksgiving turned into a retail behemoth , but it probably dates back to the late 19th century .
At that time , store - sponsored Thanksgiving parades were common , and once Santa Claus showed up at the end of the parade , the holiday shopping season had officially started .
In those days , most retailers adhered to an unwritten rule that holiday shopping season did n't start until after Thanksgiving , so no stores would advertise holiday sales or aggressively court customers until the Friday immediately following the holiday .
Thus , when the floodgates opened that Friday , it became a huge deal .
So retailers were always hoping for an early Thanksgiving ?
You bet .
They were n't just hoping , though ; they were being proactive about it .
In 1939 , the Retail Dry Goods Association warned Franklin Roosevelt that if the holiday season would n't begin until after Americans celebrated Thanksgiving on the traditional final Thursday in November , retail sales would go in the tank .
Ever the iconoclast , Roosevelt saw an easy solution to this problem : he moved Thanksgiving up by a week .
Instead of celebrating the holiday on its traditional day — November 30th that year — Roosevelt declared the next - to - last Thursday in November to be the new Thanksgiving , instantly tacking an extra week onto the shopping season .
Brilliant !
How did that work out ?
Not so well .
Roosevelt did n't make the announcement until late October , and by then most Americans had already made their holiday travel plans .
Many rebelled and continued to celebrate Thanksgiving on its " real "  date while derisively referring to the impostor holiday as " Franksgiving . " 
State governments did n't know which Thanksgiving to observe , so some of them took both days off .
In short , it was a bit of a mess .
By 1941 , though , the furor had died down , and Congress passed a law that made Thanksgiving the fourth Thursday in November regardless of how it affected the shopping day that would become known as Black Friday .
[ Image credit : Franklin D. Roosevelt Library . ]
Why call it Black Friday ?
If you ask most people why the day after Thanksgiving is called Black Friday , they 'll explain that the name stems from retailers using the day's huge receipts as their opportunity to " get in the black "  and become profitable for the year .
The first recorded uses of the term " Black Friday "  are a bit less rosy , though .
According to researchers , the name " Black Friday "  dates back to Philadelphia in the mid-1960s .
The Friday in question is nestled snugly between Thanksgiving and the traditional Army - Navy football game that 's played in Philadelphia on the following Saturday , so the City of Brotherly Love was always bustling with activity on that day .
All of the people were great for retailers , but they were a huge pain for police officers , cab drivers , and anyone who had to negotiate the city 's streets .
They started referring to the annual day of commercial bedlam as " Black Friday "  to reflect how irritating it was .
So where did the whole " get in the black "  story originate ?
Apparently storeowners did n't love having their biggest shopping day saddled with such a negative moniker , so in the early 1980s someone began floating the accounting angle to put a more positive spin on the big day .
Do retailers really need Black Friday to turn an annual profit ?
Major retailers do n't ; they 're generally profitable — or at least striving for profitability — throughout the entire year .
( A company that turned losses for three quarters out of every fiscal year would n't be a big hit with investors . )
Some smaller outlets may parlay big holiday season sales into annual profits , though .
Is Black Friday really the biggest shopping day of the year ?
It 's certainly the day of the year in which you 're most likely to be punched while grabbing for the latest Elmo doll , but it might not be the busiest day in terms of gross receipts .
According to Snopes.com , Black Friday is generally one of the top six or seven days of the year for stores , but it 's the days immediately before Christmas when procrastinators finally get shopping that stores make the serious loot .
Black Friday may , however , be the busiest day of the year in terms of customer traffic .
Snopes ' data shows the ten - year span from 1993 to 2002 , and in that interval Black Friday was never higher than fourth on the list of the year 's busiest shopping days by sales volume .
In 2003 and 2005 Black Friday did climb to the top of the pile for sales revenue days , but it still gets stiff competition from the week leading up to Christmas , particularly the Saturday right before the big day .
But Black Friday tells us how the holiday season will shake out , right ?
Again , not necessarily .
According to a 2007
Time story , even if Black Friday goes swimmingly for retailers , it does n't really tell analysts much about how the holiday season will look .
The National Retail Federation told the magazine that since the bulk of holiday shopping still occurs in the week leading up to Christmas , those days are far more important for retailers ' bottom lines than Black Friday is .
That week coupled with the steep discounts most retailers start offering on the day after Christmas end up determining how well the holiday season goes for retailers .
What 's the story on Cyber Monday ?
It 's obviously a bit tough for online retailers to cash in on the retail bonanza that their brick - and - mortar counterparts enjoy on Black Friday ; you can't really have a doorbuster sale when you do n't have any doors to bust .
In 2005 , though , Shop.org , the online arm of the National Retail Federation , started promoting the Monday immediately following Black Friday as " Cyber Monday , "  Black Friday 's tech - savvy cousin for online retailers .
So is Cyber Monday the biggest online shopping day of the year ?
Like Black Friday , Cyber Monday probably is n't quite the e-commerce boom that you 'd expect .
According to Snopes , the first few years of Cyber Monday looked a lot like Black Friday .
Sales were certainly higher than normal , but the biggest e-commerce days were still usually a couple of weeks before Christmas .
Basically , online shopping 's big days are governed by the same keep - putting - it - off impulse that shapes traditional retail 's best revenue days , only the online jackpots come a little earlier as procrastinators have to allow for shipping time .
Discarted a blog written by “ photographers & concerned citizens living in Los Angeles . /
With the goal to shoot photographs freely in public spaces wherever , whenever , of whoever .
/
And a desire to get the word out , educate and engage , ” has video posted of an encounter with two LA County Sheriff deputies inside the Hollywood and Western Metro Station .
MSNBC is reporting ( here ) that Shawn , the man who took the video says his constitutional rights were violated and he ’s posted phone numbers and emails on the Discarted site to rally complaints against the deputies ( here ) .
I love the idea that a group of photographer rights activists will go out and make sure the police understand the law .
These Sheriff Deputies not only fail they try to intimidate the photographer by threatening to make his life miserable if they were to place him on a FBI watch list .
They also try to review the images he ’s taken but ca n’t because he ’s shooting film .
The Sheriff initially tells the photographer what he is doing is against MTA rules ( here ) .
Photography Guidelines *
Only permissible in public areas , proof of fare required in marked fare required areas ( station platforms of all rail stations and the Metro Orange Line )

The " blue " rose required 20 years of research
by Kathryn Westcott
BBC News
The blue rose has long been referred to by horticulturalists as the " Holy Grail " of the plant breeding world .
Now what is being described as the world 's first genetically - modified blue rose is about to hit flower shops in Japan .
A Japanese firm has announced it will be the first to put the unique flower on sale to the public - at a not - to - be - sniffed - at 2,000 and 3,000 yen ( US $ 22 and US$ 33 ) per stem , about 10 times more expensive than normal .
Genetically , there is no natural blue pigmentation in the rose to allow a true blue rose to be bred by conventional methods .
ARE RED BEST ?
Blue Roses , Rudyard Kipling
Roses red and roses white
Plucked I for my love 's delight .
She would none of all my posies -
Bade me gather her blue roses .
Half the world I wandered through ,
Seeking where such flowers grew ;
Half the world unto my quest
Answered me with laugh and jest .
Home I came at wintertide ,
But my silly love had died ,
Seeking with her latest breath
Roses from the arms of Death .
It may be beyond the grave
She shall find what she would have .
Mine was but an idle quest -
Roses white and red are best .
But in 2004 , whisky distiller Suntory said it had succeeded in developing natural blue roses .
With Australian biotech company Florigene , it said it spliced into roses the gene that leads to the synthesis of the blue pigment Delphinidin in petunias .
The fruits of that 20 - year research project will be delivered to the public next month .
Talk of blue roses is not new .
Faux blue roses were traditionally created by dyeing white roses .
And nominal " blue roses " have been bred by conventional hybridisation methods .
But , according to experts , these are more accurately described as light purple in colour .
In 1847 , American nurseryman Samuel Parsons wrote in his book The Rose that progress in science and technology might , indeed , enable gardeners to cultivate blue roses .
If so , he said , they would be worth the effort .
Rosebreeder Bernard Mehring says that as far back as the 1900s there was a German variety of " blue " rose known as the Veilchenblau .
But the petals are , again , more a " mauvey - grey " , he says , and it only flowers once .
According to the Victorians , who promoted floriography - the language of flowers - blue roses signified mystery or the attempt to attain the impossible .
Since those times the colour of a rose has represented a different sentiment or feeling .
Passion and romantic love is still associated with red roses .
Pink roses apparently imply a less passionate affection - rather a more gentle or poetic one .
White roses signal sincerity and purity , while yellow roses stand for friendship .
A natural blue rose would signify something that is expensive and rare
Royal Horticultural Society Sarah Holland from the Flowers and Plants Association in the UK says she believes natural blue roses " would be hugely in demand " .
Dyed - blue roses , which are also a soft purple colour , sell well in the UK , she says .
" They do n't appeal to everyone because they are unnatural , but there is definitely a place for them .
They are , for example , popular for weddings . "
Her association receives lots of inquiries about black or blue roses every year ahead of Valentines Day , she adds .
" Roses may be ubiquitous nowadays , but they have n't lost their meaning and people are always looking for something that is unique . "
Standing out Helen Bostock , a horticulture advisor at the UK's Royal Horticultural Society , says that while a true - blue rose sounds fabulous , it could stand out like a " sore thumb " .
" A natural blue rose would signify something that is expensive and rare .
It would signify exclusivity .
" It has been the Holy Grail to rose breeders , but , personally , I think it would look odd - a bit like a plate of blue chips . "
Red roses are associated with passionate love
She is doubtful that a blue rose would be anything other than a novelty .
" A red rose signifies passion , but blue is a bit cold in my book . "
Breeder Bernard Mehring is also unimpressed by the news of the blue rose .
He has managed to breed a black rose , but says that if you tried to grow it in the garden the sunlight would cause the petals to shrivel up .
He thinks the blue rose , for different reasons , would be no good in the garden .
" I ca n't see that a natural blue rose would be easy to grow . "
Its cultivation would not be allowed in some countries , such as the UK , because of the controls imposed on genetically - modified plants .
Feeling blue Roses have been the subject of many myths , legends , poems and paintings .
Our fascination with them stretches back centuries .
The Romans loved roses .
The Emperor Nero was believed to have had an extravagant rotating banquet hall in which rose petals cascaded from the ceiling .
And Napoleon Bonaparte 's Empress Josephine instructed collectors to send her roses from around the known world , even during the Napoleonic Wars .
In Japan , where the act of present - giving is highly ritualistic , the new blue variety , Applause , will be marketed as a " luxurious gift for special occasions such as wedding anniversaries " .
There are no current plans to sell the new variety overseas , which might not be a bad thing , according to Mr Mehring .
He warns that in some countries blue is not a popular colour for flowers .
" In Italy , the blue is associated with mistrust or bereavement , " he says .
In China , however , according to one Chinese folk tale , the blue rose signifies hope against unattainable love .

But it 's not Blue , it 's Lilac ?
So it 's either back to the drawing board , or off to the Optician for you lot !
Gail Vlachakis , Chania , Crete , Greece Roses are red , roses are blue I love you and I feel blue Okay not very good , but neither is the so - called " blue " rose which looks distinctly purple in the photos .
I think I 'd ask for my money back .
Deborah Grieves , Newcastle , UK
When I was a young teenager my first " silly love had died " , I cried and I mourned .
I asked him to speak to me from beyond the grave , as I prayed that the beautiful connection between us had not been lost .
I thought that if I received a rose that day I would know it was a sign that he could hear me .
" Seeking roses from the arms of death " .
While at work later that day I received a large advertisement in the mail with large blue roses all over the page .
I felt it was a sign as only he could send me blue roses , as it was a color of rose that did not exist on earth .
I wish I had known of Kipling 's poem back then ( and thank you for sharing it with me now ) .
From this personal experience , I agree with the Italians that blue roses symbolize bereavement , as I was consumed with grief .
I was attempting to " attain the impossible " communicating with the deceased , and was obsessed with the " mystery " , of life and death , exactley as the Victorian floriographers believed the blue rose to symbolize .
Now , I am ready to believe in the Chinese folk tale symbolism of the blue rose , " hope against unattainable love " and that someday I will be with my Silly Love again .
Rita , San Diego , Ca U.S.A
The Applause seems to be soft purple .
Should be called purple rose ?
Historically , purple is religion oriented , something sacred , however , there is n't a universal religion .
I feel a " baby blue " rose will be more appealing to the public in that it denotes a nexus to babies ; the most loving creature ...
Gus , Panama Roses are a thing of beauty and scent in their natural state from the richest and deepest reds to the many gold yellow and salmon color to white .
They all evoke purity and warmth ; I can't imagine blue could do a better or more joyous job !
Imadiel Ariel , Wellesley , MA USA " Signify mystery or the attempt to attain the impossible ... "
Awesome .
That 's what I 'm always trying to do !
I 'll definitely get her some .
Andrew Evans , San Francisco , CA I think that actually having blue roses , rather than them being an impossibility , has taken out all the mystery .
One year someone will invent the last impossibility , and the world will be very boring .

" SOMERVILLE , N.J. - A New Jersey judge says a quadriplegic blocked from buying a gun to go hunting has the right to bear arms even though he will have to use a wheelchair mount to use the firearm .
Manville 's police chief had rejected James Cap 's application last year , citing safety concerns .
The borough attorney says the safety issues could only be resolved by a judge .
A judge ruled Tuesday that the 46 - year - old is eligible for a firearms ID , which is required to buy a gun .
The judge addressed the safety issues by requiring Cap to have qualified people assist him with weapons .
Cap was an avid hunter as a teenager .
He was paralyzed 30 years ago after breaking his neck in a high school football game .
He plans to mount the gun on his wheelchair and operate it with a breathing tube .

| Spain role unearthed Cesc 's hidden talent
Captain Catalan | Fabregas
Since the English and Spanish top flights began pulling away from Italy to almost establish themselves in the eyes of many as ' the big two ' , the number of La Liga talents finding their way to the Premier League has shot up considerably .
Likewise , the best of the Prem - though often not English - have found themselves floating off to Spain ; not least this summer , with Cristiano Ronaldo and Xabi Alonso heading the way .
But it 's the Spanish contingent in England who really attract all the attention .
They are among the country 's most skillful and universally admired superstars .
Fernando
Torres heads the list ; Mikel Arteta is regarded as universally underrated , some even believe Pepe Reina should keep goal for Spain ahead of Iker Casillas .
First among this new wave was Cesc Fabregas , fresh from Barcelona 's youth academy in 2003 .
Heralded as an incredible prospect , the playmaker came good season by season , while not such an important figure in the Invincibles squad of his first season , he showed tremendous promise in the FA Cup claiming season of 2004 - 05 and was pivotal in Arsenal 's Champions League near - miss in 2006 .
And on that Wednesday , May 17 , in Paris , Fabregas had only just turned 19 years of age .
The mature and full - fledged nature of his playing style bordered on the surreal , but was in fact a typical trait of many midfielders from Barcelona's .
That 's how they 're trained .
And when Arsenal 's subsequent trophy drought began , Cesc 's constant climb up the ladder of the world 's best midfielders came to something of a standstill .
He got through so much of his technical development at a young age that , during his early 20s in which the world was expecting him to kick - on , that time did n't come .
Though the honor of the captain 's armband , at just 21 years of age , improved the midfielder 's conduct and sense of responsibility , with the ball at his feet , he was still the same player .
It 's as if he was already the finished article .
As such , despite Barcelona 's bitterness at having their player poached by the Premier League , it was n't seen as too much of a loss .
With Xavi at the helm and Iniesta an emerging force , they conquered all of Europe in 2006 and again in 2009 .
Spain reached similar heights at Euro 2008 , again with Xavi at the center of it all and Cesc reduced to being a substitute - albeit a highly effective one .
Fans of Fabregas initially opposed to the supposed neglect or prejudice suffered by Cesc , as La Liga talents pipped him into the European champions ' starting XI in the build - up to , during and even since Euro 2008 .
More recently , the opposition has relented , in acknowledgment of the formidable stature of the team , even without Cesc in the starting line - up .
But every new season brings a new surprise .
The more faithful and / or astute of us would call it fate , or inevitability .
This season , it has been Cesc Fabregas .
Perhaps having had the armband from week one has made him feel more like the leader of the team , as opposed to something of a fan - favorite , token appointment in the midst of a crisis .
More significant , it would seem , is the 4 - 3 - 3 variant that has Cesc supported by not just the discipline of the more static Alexandre Song , but also the box - to - box running of Abou Diaby .
He is now the focal point of many of Arsenal 's attacks through the middle , more comparable to Kaka early on during his Milan days and Steven Gerrard in the current Liverpool setup than Paul Scholes or Xavi in the treble - winning sides of Manchester United and Barcelona .
The redefinition of his role has seen a once goal - shy Cesc now regularly run beyond the forwards with remarkable results .
Goalscoring adds an obvious gloss onto what is still a markedly more majestic midfielder within Arsenal 's new - look Gunners .
When playing for Spain , too , Fabregas was played as a second striker of sorts , donning the No.10 , but not even while seeing his team through to the Euro 2008 final did he ever look as assured and domineering as he does now .
It 's too soon to tell exactly what the future may hold , but to compare Cesc to his contemporaries is enough to make anyone think .
Kaka is n't yet in his groove at Madrid ; Frank Lampard is much closer to finding his at Chelsea , but not quite at top speed ; even before his injury , Steven Gerrard was not looking quite as relentless without Xabi Alonso 's supply ; Andrea Pirlo , screamers at the Bernabeu aside , is n't consistently at the level he was ; Xavi and Iniesta remain a class apart from most of the competition with very little effort involved , but are n't lighting up the arena from week to week .
Cesc is on his own in that department .
In possession , he has the aura of an untouchable , and what must be most promising for Arsenal fans is that he has never been a player for purple patches .
Once he reaches a level , he usually stays there .
The competition has some catching up to do .
As Cesc 's hero , Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola seems to have had some kind of Catalan intuition that told him something special was coming from Fabregas this season that the rest of us did n't know about .
Barcelona made a late but incredibly concerted push to bring home their golden boy this summer , but Cesc refused their advances , tellingexclusively at the end of the transfer window that he currently feels more relaxed in London than he does when he visits Barcelona .
However , even Arsenal fans acknowledge that at some point , whether it 's because he achieves all he can achieve , or , in complete contrast , must leave to achieve , that Fabregas will find his way home .
I guess it could be said that , just this once , Gooners will hope Fabregas follows more in the steps of Cristiano Ronaldo than Thierry Henry .
And as I predicted there ’s a lot more articles from the press event that BioWare held in November .
But instead of quoting each one of them here I ’ll just refer to Sean ’s post :
The only thing that I will put here is IGTV ’s interview video as it is the longest :
There will probably be more articles over the coming day (s ) .
And it would n’t surprise me to see Holonet pages for the new classes tomorrow , but we ’ll see .
Financial , Economic and Climate Crisis Ushering In Brave New World 2009
O wonder !
How many goodly creatures are there here !
How beauteous mankind is !
O brave new world !
That has such people in't !
- William Shakespeare – The Tempest
“ Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted .
That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history . ” -
Aldous Huxley
Aldous Huxley wrote the dystopian novel Brave New World in 1931 at the inauguration of the last Crisis period in America .
Dystopia is the often futuristic vision of a society in which conditions of life are miserable and characterized by poverty , oppression , war , violence , disease , pollution , nuclear fallout and / or the abridgement of human rights , resulting in widespread unhappiness , suffering , and other kinds of pain .
The novel was his response to the writings of H.G. Wells ( Men Like Gods ) and George Bernard Shaw which glorified socialism and a one World State .
Orwell ’s 1984 , written in 1948 , is the other famous dystopian novel of the era .
Huxley had visited America during the Roaring 20’s and his experience provided the character for the novel .
He was outraged by America ’s out of control materialistic egocentric society .
He witnessed youthful superficiality , commercialization , sexual promiscuity , and a self centered culture .
Fellow writer G.K. Chesterton explained his view of Huxley ’s novel :
“ After the Age of Utopias came what we may call the American Age , lasting as long as the Boom .
Men like Ford or Mond seemed to many to have solved the social riddle and made capitalism the common good .
But it was not native to us ; it went with a buoyant , not to say blatant optimism , which is not our negligent or negative optimism .
Much more than Victorian righteousness , or even Victorian self - righteousness , that optimism has driven people into pessimism .
For the Slump brought even more disillusionment than the War .
A new bitterness , and a new bewilderment , ran through all social life , and was reflected in all literature and art .
It was contemptuous , not only of the old Capitalism , but of the old Socialism .
Brave New World is more of a revolt against Utopia than against Victoria . ”
Using Technology to Control Society
“ Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards . ” - Aldous Huxley
Science and technology are not inherently good or bad .
They can be used or misused .
They offer promise or peril .
Ultimately , humanity can benefit from science and technology or it can be detrimental to our planet .
Huxley envisioned a horrifying future where mankind used science and technology in a self destructive manner .
He was disillusioned with the decadence of society and disgusted by the behavior of his class .
Huxley ’s outlook is a world where the vast majority of the populace is united under one World State .
The world is restricted to two billion inhabitants .
The inhabitants are strictly divided into five castes .
The world is controlled by Alphas and their subordinates , Betas .
Below them , in descending order of brainpower and physique , are Gammas , Deltas , and Epsilons .
Each caste is further subdivided into Plus and Minus ( save for Epsilons , which are regular or semi-moron ) .
Reproductive technology , referred to as the Bokanovsky Process , is used by the government ( Alphas & Betas ) to manage the number of human beings and their functions .
The process is applied to fertilized human eggs in - vitro , causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original .
The State has eliminated procreation by loving couples .
Ovaries are surgically removed from women .
The lower caste children are created in hatcheries .
At the very pinnacle of society sit Alpha Double - Pluses , who serve as the future scientists and top administrators of the world .
People in different castes are conditioned to be happy in their own way – they do not feel resentment towards other castes , but rather feel a slight contempt for people not members of their own caste .
The upper castes are intelligent , and have managerial jobs , where as the lower castes do the manual labor .
The Alpha's have what we would consider the best jobs , and it continues down until the Epsilons , who have the least skilled jobs .
The Alphas are tall and fair , while the Epsilons are dark skinned .
The novel takes place in the year 2540 in London .
The disturbing aspect is that we are now in the year 2009 and much of Huxley ’s vision has come to fruition .
At the heart of the World State ’s control of its population is its rigid control over sexual mores and reproductive rights .
Reproductive rights are controlled through an authoritarian system that sterilizes about two - thirds of women , requires the rest to use contraceptives , and surgically removes ovaries when it needs to produce new humans .
The act of sex is controlled by a system of social rewards for promiscuity and lack of commitment .
The United States has restricted population growth through a number of methods .
Abortion on demand was made the law of the land in 1973 .
Since that date 50 million abortions have been performed in the U.S. I ask myself how many Martin Luther Kings , Stephen Hawkings , and Ernest Hemingways have been among those aborted before having the chance to positively impact our world .
Source : Alan Guttmacher Institute
Over 12 million women in the U.S. use the pill ( available since 1960 ) on a daily basis in order to avoid pregnancy .
The morning after pill was introduced in 1999 .
Planned Parenthood , created in 1916 , has 850 locations in the United States offering easy access to abortions and other forms of contraception .
The net result of these government supported efforts has been to cut the birth rate in half in the last century .
" We are living now , not in the delicious intoxication induced by the early success of science , but in a rather grisly morning after , when it has become apparent that what triumphant science has done hitherto is to improve the means for achieving unimportant or actually deteriorated ends . "
- Aldous Huxley
The upper classes in the U.S. have persuaded the lower classes to restrict their reproduction .
They promote non-consequential promiscuity among the other classes while reproducing and raising the new ruling class .
American society is also segmented into castes as portrayed by Huxley .
The Alpha Double - Pluses are the Harvard MBAs running Goldman Sachs and the other mega - banks .
Others in the Alpha caste are the Bushes , Kennedys , Rockefellers , Clintons , Gores , Warren Buffet , Bill Gates , and Paul Krugman .
The Betas include Congressmen , bank executives , government bureaucrats , military leaders , and corporate executives .
The Gammas and Deltas are the working classes that do the hard work without ever advancing .
The Epsilons are the morons produced by the inner city public school system .
They fill the non-thinking manual labor jobs of society .
The Gammas , Deltas , and Epsilons are brought up in conditioning centers .
The Alphas and the Betas use technology to mould them into their predetermined roles in society .
They use operant conditioning and sleep teaching to modify the behavior of the lower castes .
Hatcheries rely on machines to condition bottled embryos to heat , sudden motion , and disease , allowing the embryos to fulfill their predestined jobs in specific climates .
The science exists today to produce whatever traits are desired in our children .
The procedure is called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and is being practiced in fertility clinics in the U.S .
Those in control of America also use conditioning and teaching to keep the lower classes in their place .
The ruling elite send their children to exclusive private schools , grooming them for Harvard , Yale and Stanford .
This guarantees they will be given the high level positions in business and government .
After decades of pumping billions of tax dollars into public schools while instituting politically correct diversity programs to dumb down the curriculum , the ruling elite have conditioned a vast swath of Americans to care more about Tiger Woods ’ driving and night putting skills than about the National Debt or the insidiousness of Federal Reserve induced inflation .
Just as in Brave New World , the ruling Alphas are White and the lowest class Epsilons are dark skinned .
Blacks and Hispanics represent 50 % of all the high school dropouts even though they only make up 25 % of the population .
This guarantees a life of blue - collar low paying jobs for these people .
Whites obtain 78 % of the advanced degrees , guaranteeing them the positions of leadership in society .
The social welfare state implemented by the ruling elite provides enough sustenance to the lower classes to keep them anesthetized , ignorant and easily manipulated .
Whites also obtain 77 % of the bachelor ’s degrees , assuring that they will fill the Beta administrator positions in society .
Another technological method of keeping the masses tranquilized and distracted in the Brave New World is through high tech sports and entertainment .
Sport is a pillar of the World State consisting of various games and activities which use high - tech equipment .
Another key aspect of entertainment is the " feelies " .
Users rest their hands on metal knobs protruding from the arms of their chair , allowing them to feel the physical sensations of the actors on - screen ( usually in sexually - themed films ) .
The mass production of HDTVs , CD players , Laptop computers , Blackberries , iPhones , iPods , luxury automobiles and other electronic toys distributed to the masses through easy credit policies has successfully distracted the populace from the pillaging of the country by the Alphas at Goldman Sachs .
The feelies of today are 24 hour cable TV with 600 stations , downloadable movies , an unlimited amount of free porn on the internet , strip joints , and prostitution .
Sports addicts can attend baseball , football , basketball , hockey , soccer , wrestling , boxing , auto racing , and Michael Vick sponsored dog fighting events year round , or watch it on TV 24 hours per day .
With mindless jobs and unlimited distractions , the preponderance of citizens are as docile as sheep .
Soma is a biological method used by the Alphas to keep the lower castes sedated .
It is a drug that provides an easy escape from the hassles of daily life and is employed by the government as a method of control through pleasure .
It is ubiquitous and ordinary among the culture of the novel and everyone is shown to use it at some point , in various situations : sex , relaxation , concentration , confidence .
It is seemingly a single - chemical combination of many of today 's drugs ' effects , giving its users the full hedonistic spectrum depending on dosage .
As a kind of “ sacrament , ” it also represents the use of religion to control society .
Huxley ’s description of soma reveals its power :
“ And if ever , by some unlucky chance , anything unpleasant should somehow happen , why , there ’s always soma to give you a holiday from the facts .
And there ’s always soma to calm your anger , to reconcile you to your enemies , to make you patient and long - suffering .
In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training .
Now , you swallow two or three half - gramme tablets , and there you are .
Anybody can be virtuous now .
You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle .
Christianity without tears — that ’s what soma is . ”
American leaders bluster about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse , but their actions speak otherwise .
Americans can sedate themselves legally with alcohol , over the counter prescriptions , and tobacco .
Almost 10 % of the entire U.S. population , or 27 million people , are taking anti-depressant pills .
Over 4 million children are being drugged with Ritalin every day to make them malleable .
The government looks the other way as the middle class uses marijuana , heroine , and cocaine .
The Epsilons ( Blacks & Hispanics ) on the other hand are prosecuted , with 2.3 million of them occupying cells in the thousands of prisons in the U.S.
There are thousands of churches in the U.S. preaching the good word and sedating the masses .
As they preach morality and sacrifice , there have been recurring instances of sexual deviation covered up church hierarchy and the bilking of congregations out of millions in contributions for the enrichment of the church leaders .
Consumer Society
“ Most of one 's life is one prolonged effort to prevent oneself from thinking .
People intoxicate themselves with work so they wo n't see how they really are . ” - Aldous Huxley
Huxley formulated his dystopian world after observing the excessiveness of Americans during the Roaring 20’s .
If he thought things were decadent and Americans were self consumed in the 1920’s , Huxley ’s head would explode at the debauchery , ignorance materialism , and shallowness of Americans today .
Our landfills contain more wealth than entire Third World countries .
We throw away over 100 billion pounds of edible food per year .
In his Brave New World Revisited , written in 1958 , Huxley clearly laid out the dangers of consumerism :
“ Consumerism re­quires the services of expert salesmen versed in all the arts ( including the more insidious arts ) of persuasion .
Under a free enterprise system commercial propa­ganda by any and every means is absolutely indis­pensable .
But the indispensable is not necessarily the desirable .
What is demonstrably good in the sphere of economics may be far from good for men and women as voters or even as human beings . ”
“ Consider a simple example .
Most cos­metics are made of lanolin , which is a mixture of purified wool fat and water beaten up into an emulsion .
This emulsion has many valuable properties : it penetrates the skin , it does not become rancid , it is mildly antiseptic and so forth .
But the commercial prop­agandists do not speak about the genuine virtues of the emulsion .
They give it some picturesquely volup­tuous name , talk ecstatically and misleadingly about feminine beauty and show pictures of gorgeous blondes nourishing their tissues with skin food .
" The cosmetic manufacturers , " one of their number has written , " are not selling lanolin , they are selling hope . "
For this hope , this fraudulent implication of a promise that they will be transfigured , women will pay ten or twenty times the value of the emulsion which the propagandists have so skilfully related , by means of misleading symbols , to a deep - seated and almost universal feminine wish -- the wish to be more attrac­tive to members of the opposite sex .
The principles underlying this kind of propaganda are extremely sim­ple .
Find some common desire , some widespread uncon­scious fear or anxiety ; think out some way to relate this wish or fear to the product you have to sell ; then build a bridge of verbal or pictorial symbols over which your customer can pass from fact to compensa­tory dream , and from the dream to the illusion that your product , when purchased , will make the dream come true . ”
Our economic advancement has been marketed to Americans as “ true happiness from consumption ” .
Every need can be realized through material gain .
Success as a society is measured by GDP growth and the facade of prosperity .
In Brave New World children are conditioned from birth to value consumption with such platitudes as " ending is better than mending , " which means buy a new one instead of fixing the old one .
America has become the definitive throwaway society .
Product waste has grown from 92 pounds per person per year in 1905 to 1,242 pounds per person per year in 2005 .
American human beings are lumped into the category of consumers by the mainstream media .
Consumerism and consumer debt have been the contaminated lifeblood of the United States for the last three decades .
Government actively promotes gambling by the poor , offering them false hope for riches .
Americans squander $ 160 billion per year on lotteries and in casinos .
Our society has become even more extreme than the Brave New World as we have outsourced our production to foreign countries , thereby gutting our economy .
Even at the dawn of television Huxley realized the immense power for propagandists :
“ Thanks to compulsory education and the rotary press , the propagandist has been able , for many years past , to convey his messages to virtually every adult in every civilized country .
Today , thanks to radio and television , he is in the happy position of being able to communicate even with unschooled adults and not yet literate children . ”
United States advertising expenditures , 1920 –2007 in constant 2007 dollars ( billions ) *
The mass media is owned and controlled by mega- corporations run by the Alphas of our society .
Colleges graduate thousands of people with the skills to manipulate the uninformed masses through advertising and propaganda .
What passes for news organizations are just propaganda machines for a particular point of view .
The public is distracted by the seemingly major differences between the two main political parties .
The reality is that both parties are controlled by banking and corporate interests who pay for the laws that benefit their interests .
Huxley ’s description of political candidates in 1958 is even truer today :
“ The methods now being used to merchan­dise the political candidate as though he were a deo­dorant positively guarantee the electorate against ever hearing the truth about anything . ”
News people must be beautiful and entertainment is indispensable .
They provide the people what they want – 24 hour coverage of Tiger Woods ’ sex life , weeks of reporting about Michael Jackson ’s death , and 10 seconds about the $ 100 trillion of unfunded liabilities we are leaving future generations .
Truth is an inconvenience in the consumer society .
Incompatibility of Happiness & Truth
“ Great is truth , but still greater , from a practical point of view , is silence about truth .
By simply not mentioning certain subjects ... totalitarian propagandists have influenced opinion much more effectively than they could have by the most eloquent denunciations . ”
- Aldous Huxley
“ Give me a McMansion ” - Americans
Mustapha Mond , World State Controller , believes that the population is better off with happiness than truth .
In the Brave New World happiness is represented by immediate gratification of every citizen ’s desire for food , sex , drugs , nice clothes , and other consumer trinkets .
If the proletariats think they are happy , they wo n’t need to think or question reality .
The World State cannot allow individuality to blossom .
Free thinking individuals seek the truth .
Spending time alone is considered an outrageous waste of time and money .
Confession to a craving for individuality is shocking , horrifying , and embarrassing .
John , the savage , grew up outside the World State and has studied Shakespeare .
Everything that Shakespeare stood for : passion , love , intensity , seeking truth , relationships , and tragic endings , are at odds with the World State foundation .
They cannot allow truth and true human happiness to exist in society or the Alphas will lose control .
The United States is the richest most powerful country in the history of the world .
Our poorest live better than the aristocracy lived 100 years ago .
We have indoor plumbing , air conditioning , heaters , clean water , automobiles , trains , jet airplanes , televisions , CD players , portable gadgets galore , free public education , fast food , gyms to work off the fast food , movies , the internet , restaurants , bars , concerts , sporting events , casinos , home improvement stores , grocery stores , discount stores , Wal - Mart , clothes stores , jewelry stores , dollar stores , churches , Disney World , Las Vegas , and Graceland .
These are the “ things ” that are supposed to make Americans happy .
Going into the woods alone , like Thoreau , to think is frowned upon .
The propagandists sell the American public happiness in the form of material goods and services .
If you do n’t feel happy , take a pill .
If you are n’t happy with your appearance have plastic surgery .
If your spouse is n’t making you happy , cheat or get a divorce and try again .
If your neighbor outdoes you by getting a $ 20,000 kitchen remodel , get yourself a $ 40,000 kitchen remodel .
Happiness is a 6,000 sq ft McMansion with 5 bathrooms , a pool , game room , and Jacuzzi for your family of three .
Having your neighbors see you driving a BMW 750 Li will surely make you happy .
Wearing a Rolex will definitely make you happy .
If you die with the most toys , you ’re still dead .
Until reading a book to your three year old at bedtime is valued more than staying at the office until 10:00 pm to complete an investment offering , our society is destined for decline .
Ours is not to reason why , but simply to do and die with a bare minimum of fuss .
In the Brave New World the policies of the State dehumanize the population .
Stability and artificially induced happiness are more imperative than humanity and truth .
Mustapha Mond explains to John that social stability has required the sacrifice of art , science , and religion .
John protests that , without these things , human life is not worth living .
After John eventually succumbs to the lure of the World State version of happiness , he hangs himself .
An ending truly worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy .
The pillars of our society are based upon the acquisition of material possessions using debt .
Our society glorifies steroid taking athletes , sex crazed sports icons , drugged out entertainment personalities , vacuous TV housewives , and moronic cosmetically enhanced movie stars .
Those who seek truth through questioning the status quo or digging for answers to questions the State does n’t want asked , risk alienation and scorn .
The Alphas ( bankers ) of our society issue the debt and convince the masses that accumulating more stuff will make them happy .
The Alphas ( media titans ) use their mass media to persuade , manipulate , and sell their message of material happiness to the masses .
The Alphas ( politicians ) use the taxes collected from the masses and the dollars printed by the bankers to distribute social welfare benefits to the lower classes , keeping them sedated and under control .
Seeking the truth through the study of literature , the questioning of authority , and pondering of our existence on this earth are rare .
Those who question and doubt the propaganda put out by those in authority are shunned and denigrated as being unpatriotic .
“ Most ignorance is vincible ignorance .
We do n't know because we do n't want to know . ” -
Aldous Huxley
Dangers of an All - Powerful State
“ Freedom is therefore a great good , tolerance a great virtue and regimentation a great misfortune .
Meanwhile there is still some freedom left in the world .
Many young people , it is true , do not seem to value freedom .
But some of us still believe that , with­out freedom , human beings cannot become fully hu­man and that freedom is therefore supremely valuable .
Perhaps the forces that now menace freedom are too strong to be resisted for very long .
It is still our duty to do whatever we can to resist them . ” - Aldous Huxley
The all powerful State in Brave New World uses technology and mind control starting before birth until death to instruct people what they want .
Power over the citizens is maintained by lulling them into a false sense of happiness and contentment to the point where personal freedom and thinking are unnecessary .
Superficiality is encouraged by the World Controllers .
The consequences of citizens rolling over to the rulers are a loss of dignity , morals , values , and emotions — in short , a loss of humanity .
Amazingly , this book was written in 1931 .
Huxley ’s vision , which seemed so outrageous in 1931 , has come to fruition in less than 70 years , versus the 600 years in the novel .
Huxley realized that technological advances which are almost universally hailed as progress are fraught with danger .
Man has built higher than he can climb ; man has unleashed power he is unable to control .
Brave New World is Huxley 's warning to make man realize that since knowledge is power , he who manages and exploits knowledge exerts the authority .
Science and technology should be the servants of man - man should not be adapted and enslaved to them .
In the novel the " Nine Years ' War " broke out in 2049 AD .
It can be deduced that the conflict broke out in Europe , affected most of the planet , and caused enormous physical damage .
It is repeatedly stated that chemical and biological weapons were broadly used during the war , particularly in mass air - raids against cities .
Following the war the global economy collapsed and created an unprecedented worldwide economic crisis .
Realizing that they could not force people to adopt the new lifestyle , the World Controllers instead united the planet into the One World State and began a nonviolent movement of change .
This campaign included the closing of museums , the suppression of almost all literature published before 2059 AD , and the destruction of the few historical world monuments that had survived the Nine Years ' War .
The type of war described in the novel is a very feasible scenario in our current environment .
It is interesting that a worldwide economic crisis was the trigger for a One World Government .
Our current worldwide economic crisis has resulted in our Federal Reserve propping up European banks with U.S. taxpayer funds and unprecedented coordination between worldwide fiscal policies .
Huxley wrote his novel in 1931 at the outset of the Great Depression .
His vision did not take long to crystallize .
FDR initiated social programs on a vast scale to satiate the masses with manual labor government created jobs and social services that encouraged reliance upon the state at the expense of freedom and liberty .
His nightmare world became more of a reality after World War II as progressives were successful in creating the United Nations , NATO , World Bank , IMF , Bretton Woods system , and GATT .
These organizations reduced the freedom of individual countries to the benefit of worldwide bureaucracies .
These organizations have gained power over time , but their total incompetence and ineffectiveness has kept them from gaining total control over world populations .
We are now at a crucial juncture as the worldwide financial crisis and the sham global warming crisis are being used by the New World Order crowd to confiscate more of our freedoms and liberties .
Socialist minded world leaders Gordon Brown and Barack Obama , along with the revered Henry Kissinger have referenced a New World Order while offering their Keynesian spending solutions to the worldwide financial crisis .
A number of Obama advisors have written they support a one world government .
The Copenhagen Conference on Global Warming has drawn thousands of one world government apostles .
They want to use the scientifically unproven environmental crisis as a way to impose worldwide taxes on sovereign nations and to compel the citizens of the world to honor their green agenda .
The use of propaganda in our school systems to scare children by telling them that polar bears are all dying , is part of their plan .
Again , the subtle use of media and propaganda to influence the thinking of the willfully ignorant public has worked .
Dystopian Nation
“ Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored . ” - Aldous Huxley
When I started this article I was unsure whether Huxley ’s nightmare would resonate in our current reality .
Sadly , much of his novel applies to our society .
Even sadder , our society now resembles an amalgamation of the two most famous dystopian novels in history : 1984 and Brave New World .
Social critic Neil Postman contrasted the two views of the future :
“ What Orwell feared were those who would ban books .
What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book , for there would be no - one who wanted to read one .
Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information .
Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism .
Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us .
Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance .
Orwell feared we would become a captive culture .
Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture , preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies , the orgy porgy , and the centrifugal bumblepuppy .
As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited , the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny " failed to take into account man 's almost infinite appetite for distractions . "
In 1984 , Orwell added , people are controlled by inflicting pain .
In Brave New World , they are controlled by inflicting pleasure .
In short , Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us .
Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us . ”
Our civilization has fused the worst of both novels .
Many people in our country are n’t capable of reading a book .
Supposedly educated people have no interest in reading a book .
The government withholds or manipulates information that is spoon fed to the public .
Trivial meaningless information floods the airwaves , keeping the public continuously diverted from seeking truth .
The truth is lost in shades of grey and purposeful misinformation .
Supposed differences between the ruling parties distract the public from realizing they are being fleeced by those in power .
Government has used fear to create agencies and departments that have taken away our liberties and freedoms through Orwellian surveillance techniques .
Our dumbed down culture of hero worship , material pleasures , and ego enhancement is the representation of triviality .
The Alphas have used our fears and desires to distract us from their plans to dominate and control every aspect of our lives .
Their success is all but assured at this point .
I ’m not optimistic that there are enough Americans who value freedom over presumed safety , security , and social welfare benefits .
The public has been duped into believing thrilling falsehoods rather than unexciting truths .
Huxley explains how the propagandists have stolen our freedom :
“ In their anti-rational propaganda the enemies of freedom systematically pervert the resources of lang­uage in order to wheedle or stampede their victims into thinking , feeling and acting as they , the mind - manipulators , want them to think , feel and act .
An education for freedom ( and for the love and intelli­gence which are at once the conditions and the results of freedom ) must be , among other things , an educa­tion in the proper uses of language . ”
I do not pretend to have the answers .
Intellectual curiosity , a skeptical nature , and not buying into our shallow culture are the best chance for change .
Reading or re-reading Orwell ’s 1984 and Huxley ’s Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited will open your eyes to our plight .
The current Fourth Turning will end in glory or tragedy .
The choices we make as a society in the next 10 to 15 years will ultimately decide our fate .
Huxley ’s advice in Brave New World Revisited is wise , pertinent , and implementable today :
As recent history has repeatedly shown , the right to vote , by itself , is no guarantee of liberty .
Therefore , if you wish to avoid dictatorship by referendum , break up modern society 's merely func­tional collectives into self - governing , voluntarily cooperating groups , capable of functioning outside the bureaucratic systems of Big Business and Big Govern­ment .
If you wish to avoid the spiritual impoverishment of individuals and whole societies , leave the metropolis and revive the small country community , or alternately humanize the me­tropolis by creating within its network of mechanical organization the urban equivalents of small country communities , in which individuals can meet and co­operate as complete persons , not as the mere embodi­ments of specialized functions .
As citizens of the American Republic we must answer the question posed by Huxley :
“ Do we really wish to act upon our knowledge ?
Does a majority of the population think it worthwhile to take a good deal of trouble , in order to halt and , if possible , reverse the current drift toward totalitarian control of everything ? ”

Why the Blasé Attitude about Torture Editor ’s Note : Former CIA analyst Ray McGovern was invited to give a series of talks about torture in the Seattle / Tacoma / Olympia area from Nov. 12 to 16 – and his inviters , the Washington State Religious Campaign Against Torture , suggested that he write an op-ed on the topic for The Seattle Times , the city ’s sole surviving daily newspaper .
However , The Seattle Times turned down the article , which was also meant to advertise that McGovern would be speaking about torture in the Pacific Northwest .
So , we are publishing the article below : “ We ’re going to talk about the policy of torture , ” the radio producer said when she called me five years ago .
“ And you ’ll have ten minutes to defend your side . ”
Email
Printer friendly “ There ’s another side ? ” I asked .
“ Of course , ” she answered , and the other person will also have ten minutes . ”
My protest that torture is not a “ policy , ” but rather a crime , made no impact .
It was then that I began to understand in a more tangible way what the post - World War II Nuremberg Tribunal meant in referring to “ the accumulated evil ” that flows inevitably from what it termed the “ supreme international crime ” — a war of aggression .
History , including recent history , has shown torture to be one of those accumulated evils .
“ But it works , ” many say , reducing what is first and foremost a moral problem to a utilitarian one .
Just for the record , no experienced intelligence professional I know will tell you it works .
Just the opposite .
For example , on Sept. 6 , 2006 , just before President George W. Bush held a press conference to extol the advantages of what he called “ an alternative set of procedures ” for interrogation , Army Intelligence chief Gen.
John Kimmons told reporters : “ No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices .
I think history tells us that .
I think the empirical evidence of the last five years , hard years , tells us that . ”
That message was among the first things drummed into me when I came on active duty as an Army infantry / intelligence officer 47 years ago this week .
My 27 - year subsequent service at the CIA reinforced that learning .
In the fall of 2005 , then - CIA Director Porter Goss heeded Vice President Dick Cheney ’s call to join him in descending on Sen.
John McCain to demand that the CIA be exempted from his amendment on torture .
For me , that was the last straw .
I decided to hand back the Intelligence Commendation Medallion given me at retirement for “ exceptionally commendable service , ” saying I did not wish to be associated , however remotely , with an agency openly engaged in torture .
This Veterans Day I am reminded that I am twice a veteran — proud to have served in uniform , but filled with a sense of shame that the agency in which so many have served honorably has been stained by the willingness of its leaders and operatives to carry out Bush / Cheney instructions for torture .
Euphemisms cannot wash torture clean .
Not “ an alternate set of procedures ; ” not “ enhanced interrogation techniques ; ” not “ extraordinary rendition ” masking kidnapping for the purpose of torture .
Sabrina de Sousa , one of the 23 CIA operatives convicted in absentia and sentenced by an Italian court last week for kidnapping Egyptian cleric Abu Omar off the streets of Milan complained on TV : “ Clearly , we broke the law , and we ’re paying for the mistakes right now of whoever authorized and approved this . ”
De Sousa recognizes that she has become one of the proverbial “ rotten apples at the bottom of the barrel ” — like the equally guilty but hapless Lynndie England of Abu Ghraib .
It is clear that those who “ authorized and approved ” the kidnapping expect to get off scot - free .
And they will , if we do not insist that our justice system hold them accountable .
It is a telling irony that the orderly procedures of the independent judiciary in Italy owe so much to the power of ( earlier ) American advocacy .
As international law attorney Scott Horton noted in Harpers on Nov. 6 , it was U.S. jurists who advanced for the first time ( in 1946 - 48 ) the view that seizing people , holding them without recourse to law , and subjecting them to torture is “ a particularly serious crime . ”
Horton adds that “ disappearings ” are now widely recognized — and not only in Italy — as a “ crime against humanity and thus not subject to statutes of limitation or capable of being ignored . ”
Why , then , the blasé public attitude toward torture ; why the lack of moral leadership in our religious institutions ?
I will be in the Seattle / Olympia area this week to discuss such questions .
At the University of Washington - Seattle on Thursday evening , Nov. 12 , I shall address “ Why Accountability for Torture is Crucial for Human Rights , Our Security and Our Souls . ”
At UW - Tacoma Sunday evening , Nov. 15 , my talk will center on : “ Does Torture Work ?
‘ Let ’s Have Both Sides of the Story . ’ ”
Both events are sponsored by the Washington State Religious Campaign Against Torture .

When the publisher sent me 2008 Libertarian Party Vice Presidential nominee Wayne Allyn Root ’s new book , “ The Conscience of a Libertarian : Empowering the Citizen Revolution with God , Guns , Gambling & Tax Cuts ” to review , I was naturally excited .
This book is a fast paced and energetic and offers many solutions , rather than just offering complaints about the current system .
Root ’s book hits the ground running , hitting high taxes , corporate welfare , bailouts , and the IRS on the opining pages of the introduction .
This early parts of this book are refreshing made me very excited about Mr. Root ’s future prospects .
In my opinion , 2009 is quite early to be publishing a 2012 campaign book .
However , it is more understandable for a “ 3rd party ” candidate to publish a campaign book this early than it would be for a Democrat or a Republican to do so .
Wayne Allyn Root offers a [ somewhat ] realistic plan for his political future .
He plans on winning around 2 - 5 million votes in 2012 , getting “ Ross Perot numbers ” in 2016 , and being elected in 2020 .
While the odds of a Libertarian Party candidate winning the Presidency any time soon are slim , Mr. Root ’s plan is at least somewhat realistic .
Conscience of a Libertarian offers numerous examples to show how broken the system really is and how inefficient the government can be .
Here is my favorite example :
“ The most famous brothel ever was the Mustang Ranch run by Joe Conforte .
Mr. Conforte made more than $ 100 million , and paid taxes on very little of his fortune .
He was indicted for income tax evasion and escaped to Brazil as a fugitive from the U.S. Government .
The IRS seized the Mustang Ranch and rather than selling it , decided to keep running it .
In less than a year , under government management , the same brothel that produced profits of more than $ 100 million went broke !
Bankrupt .
Out of business .
Can you imagine ?
The federal government can’t even run a brothel !!!
Yet we allow the same corrupt , incompetent government to run our economy and schools . ”
The book contains many similar examples of the government bungling things while the private sector is able to succeed doing similar tasks at a lower cost .
Wayne Allyn Root is angry and it shows in this book .
While this is refreshing and pumps the reader up early on , by the end of the book it seems more like angry ranting than energetic ideas .
I have major problems with quite a few of the proposals Mr. Root makes in this book .
One such proposal is to increase the number of Congressmen so that no member of the House of Representatives represents more than 100,000 Americans ( down from an average of around 700,000 today ) .
This proposal sounds good — until you realize that doing so would increase the size of the House to over 3,000 members !
This would turn our National legislature into nothing more than a circus .
Another of Root ’s proposals is a [ so - called ] two tiered flat income tax .
An income tax with two different rates based on income levels is by definition a graduated tax , not a flat tax .
But it gets worse : Mr. Root “ propose [s ] a flat tax rate of 15 percent on any and all income up to $ 500,000 per year ; then a 10 percent flat tax on any and all income above $ 500,000 . ”
I am philosophically and morally opposed to all income taxes , yet this income tax is regressive — it will tax a McDonald ’s worker at a higher rate than it would tax Bill Gates .
Regardless of whether or not this plan is even a good idea , I would argue that there is a zero percent chance of the public supporting it .
A third such plan is for the government to collect no taxes for an entire year — and still continue to function .
This would cost trillions of dollars , even if Root was able to drastically cut spending .
In his own words regarding the three plans above : “ Does it cost trillions of dollars ?
Sure it does . ”
This leads me to my next point : while I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book , I was left with one very important question : is Wayne Allyn Root a libertarian ?
My personal opinion is that he is not a libertarian , but rather a very conservative , limited - government Republican who feels betrayed by his party .
Rather than pushing for the elimination of all corporate income taxes , Mr. Root advocates cutting these taxes to “ 20 percent ( or lower ) , ” yet at the same time he advocates cutting corporate income taxes for small businesses to 10 % .
This would create a nightmare situation where mid-sized corporations would attempt to do things like move money overseas , lobby for changes in the definition of small business , or could even create disincentives for small businesses to grow into larger ones .
At times , Mr. Root even openly advocates corporate welfare .
He pushes for a plan that would create “ a $ 7,500 tax credit that goes directly to any employer who hires a new fulltime employee during the next three years , increasing to $ 10,000 if the person they hire was out of work at the time . ”
Plans like these are typical conservative Republican plans , not libertarian ones .
Libertarians are naturally very principles and are very unwilling to compromise on major issues .
If Mr. Root has already strayed so far from orthodox libertarian ideas , how much more will his views be compromised when he has to deal with a Congress that is highly unlikely to support libertarian ideas .
I guess I do recommend reading this book , however , I would recommend it more to my conservative friends than I would to my libertarian ones .
It does have a lot of great ideas in it and is a quick , energetic read .
Additionally , the first half truly was excellent .
However , as you read it , ask yourself if Wayne Allyn Root is a libertarian , or just another Conservative Republican .

Recently , the results of the UK Landscape Photographer of the Year Award were published .
BBC
News made an announcement on theirwebsite , and a very interesting thing happened .
Most of thereaders commentswere not praising the winning images but complaining about one thing : they looked like “ HDR ” .
By that , they meant overly contrasted and saturated images that appear unrealistic ( on a sidenote , I am fairly sure that only one of the eight winning photos actually was HDR ) .
The technique has indeed a very bad press , especially in the “ fine art ” community , and to be fair , much of the criticism is justified .
But the point I would like to make here is that , well used , it can be very powerful and look perfectly natural , and is sometimes the only way to capture a scene as our eyes see it .
Because there are so many widespread misconceptions about HDR , and because most online resources focus on how to achieve this overcooked effect that so many of us hate , I would like to briefly make myself its advocate .
Do not expect a detailed tutorial but rather a general presentation of the technique .
Reflections of Ben Nevis on midway Loch , Scotland
What It Is
HDR stands for High Dynamic Range , and refers to a post - processing method which allows to dramatically increase the dynamic range of a photograph ( duh ! ) by merging different exposures of a same scene .
Though the idea is not new , the technique has quickly caught on after new algorithms for the critical tone mapping operation ( cramming the increased brightness range into something that a screen or a print can display ) were developed a few years ago .
HDR is also used a lot in video games as they allow to render a same scene under a variety of lighting conditions , but we will here only discuss the applications to photography .
One way to think of HDR is as a glorified neutral density filter .
On a scene where the contrast is so intense thatbothhighlights record as pure white and shadows as pure black ( i.e. where the dynamic range of the sensor is too low to properly record the scene ) , its effect will be to darken highlights and brighten shadows so that details can be retained in each area .
Two of its advantages over tradition ND filters are that it is a post - processing technique , necessitating no additional gear at capture time , and that the border between the darkened and the brightened areas can be much more complex than a simple straight line .
To create an HDR image , one needs a set of bracketed images ( i.e. of captures of the same scene with different exposure compensations ) and dedicated software .
There are many on the market , including Photoshop since CS3 , but the current leader is undoubtedly Photomatix Pro , from HDRSoft .
In a first step , the different images will be aligned and merged into a single .hdr file .
However , this image cannot be rendered on the limited devices that screens or printers are , and the second step will be to reduce the contrast through tone mapping .
It can then be manipulated normally , for instance with photoshop .
Sunrise on the summit of Nevado Yannapaccha , 5460 m , Cordillera Blanca , Peru
Some wrong ideas
* HDR always looks fake
If you remember only one thing from this article , let it be this : HDR does n’t have to look artificial .
Let me illustrate my point .
Of the following three pictures , only one has been produced with the help of HDR .
Can you guess which one ?
Nevado Vallunaraju at sunset , Cordillera Blanca , Peru
Loch Treig , Corrour , Scotland
Sur Lipez desert , Bolivia
If you guessed the second image , from Scotland , then you are right .
But I hope that even if you found it out , you will agree with me that it is not an image that screams “ fake ” .
Light is even and contrast on the low side ( at least compared to the other two images ) .
If you are not yet convinced , I invite you to look at the other images on this page , as all are HDR .
The problem with HDR is thatby default , it looks artificial and ugly , and it takes some work to bring it back to something believable .
Though knowing how to achieve that result mostly comes with practice , there is one important trick that I should mention here : you should never try to obtain the final look of an image in the tone mapping phase , and instead just focus on bringing all the details back from shadows and highlights .
You should aim for a low contrast ( especially local contrast ) , low saturation image at this stage , and only afterward , in Photoshop and with local curves adjustments , bring back the full glory of the scene .
In the second part of this article , I describe some common traps that you want to avoid when processing an HDR image .
You need a tripod
From time to time , I hear photographers say “ I was in front of this great scene and wished that I could have shot for HDR , but I did n’t have my tripod with me “ .
Since you will be bracketing , it is true that you will want to stay as stable as possible between shots , and a tripod definitely helps with that , but as long as your camera has an auto - bracketing function and a burst mode , which I believe is , in 2009 , the case of all DSLRs and most high - end point and shoots , then you should be just fine .
All you will be doing in the small amount of time between shots is shifting or rotating the camera a little bit , and software has gotten very good at correcting those and realigning the images .
I personally use the “ auto - align layers ” functionality of photoshop , available since CS3 , and this has never been a problem .
Not a single one of the images presented here has been shot on a tripod .
Aiguille du Midi seen from Chamonix after a storm , France
Whatisa problem is elements moving in the frame independently of each other .
With careful masking and cloning ( assuming your religious beliefs are compatible with those ) , it is generally possible to fix the movement of someone walking , but vegetation in the wind is every HDR photographer ’s worst nightmare .
Unfortunately , using a tripod wo n’t be any help .
Two things to note , however , if you bracket handheld .
First , you will lose a few pixels on every side when realigning the images , so shoot a little wider than what you want to end up with and be careful not to position subjects too close to the edges .
Secondly , the way bracketing works is by modifying the shutter speed ( if it touched aperture , then it would modify depth of field , which is not what we want ) , which means that the overexposed shot will be taken with a significantly slower shutter speed than what you started with .
It is therefore essential to check the sharpness of this image as soon as you have taken it , or you could be in for a very bad surprise when you get back home .
You can use HDR in any situation
One thing to keep in mind is that the very principle of HDR is toreducethe contrast of a scene whose dynamic range exceeds that of the camera sensor .
Since by the nature of what we are photographing , the end result still usually shows a lot of contrast , it is a common misconception that you can use HDR to increase the contrast of a scene .
This is not true .
All you will manage to do if you apply HDR techniques ( in particular tone mapping ) to a scene that does n’t require it is to increase local contrast , giving it this much decried fake look .
Processing an HDR image is so time consuming that I will always try to avoid it as much as possible .
If you can nail an exposure with enough details , then processing it in HDR ( especially if you start from a single raw file , as sometimes advocated on various internet tutorials ) will bring no good .
There is always an alternative to HDR
Again , I wish it was the case , as it would save me a lot of time on the computer .
ND filters are sometimes an answer , assuming that you go through the pain of carrying them in the field , but if the transition between highlights and shadows is any more complicated than a flat horizon line , then they wo n’t be much help .
Sometimes , it is also ok to sacrifice details , especially in the shadows , but if not , then HDR will be theonlysolution to save the shot .
Abandoned truck in the Uyuni salt flat of Bolivia .
Good luck using a ND filter to expose this one properly …
HDR is automatic
Another thing I hear quite often is the idea that “ you just load your images in the software , press a button , and that ’s it “ .
While one could argue that there would actually be nothing wrong with that ( the whole craft vs art debate , which I wo n’t get into ) , it is n’t even true to start with .
If you try to process HDR images like that , keeping everything at its default settings , then you will end up with an awful artificial looking image .
Getting HDR right is as much of a technique to learn as anything else in photography .
Anyone who argues otherwise obviously never tried using the technique .
What you want to avoid
Here is a list of things to be on the lookout for when you process your images .
Avoid those and no one should bother you about whether your image is HDR or not .
Sunrise on lake Titicaca , Bolivia
Halos
A signature of any method to decrease contrast in bracketed images , those appear whenever a dark and a bright zone are very close to each other , and especially on the edges of mountains on the skyline .
They most frequently show in the bright areas but can also hide in shadows .
You will need to get those right in the tone mapping process , often by reducing micro-contrast .
If nothing else will do , then careful cloning can save the day , but it can be difficult and time consuming , and should be kept as a last resort solution .
Ghosts
Whenever some element in your composition moves between frames , there is a good chance that it will show as a ghost figure , since the tone mapping algorithm will mix a little bit of each image to reach its final result .
Software has gotten a bit better at handling those , but it is still one of the worst things that can happen .
If the ghost is simple enough , it is sometimes possible to use one of the bracketed images on another layer and clone / mask the ghost out , but be prepared for spending a lot of time looking at your image at 300 % .
Vegetation is hopeless , and I wo n’t even bother bracketing anymore if there are both leaves and wind at the same time .
HDR is mainly a technique for static subjects .
Inverted contrast
What HDR really does is reduce the brightness of highlights and increase the one of shadows .
But if you take the process too far , you can obtain a situation where two neighbouring zones have inverted which one should be brighter than the other .
This usually looks very , very ugly ( if you have n’t seen it before , open any image in photoshop and apply a strong inverted S curve on luminosity , then try not to throw up ) .
More generally , it is a good idea to try and keep track on what parts of the image should be brighter than others , and verify that your tone mapped image still respects it , as a sanity check .
If the sky is darker than the mountains , something is probably very wrong .
One of my earliest attempts at HDR , showing some defects : inverted contrast ( in the clouds ) and ghosts ( in the transition between stones and water ) .
I also sacrificed shadow details on the left hill to avoid halos in the sky .
Noise
By its very nature , HDR processing will significantly increase noise , especially in the shadows .
One way to limit it is to ask the tone mapping software to output an image slightly overexposed , but be prepared for the need of using noise reduction plugins .
Excessive saturation
The scenes we do HDR for are usually very contrasty , so they should also be very saturated , right ?
Well , not necessarily , no .
Also , for some reason , the saturation applied by the tone mapping software seems much more artificial than the one you can get via photoshop .
One rule of thumb is to fix saturation as the last step in the processing , just before final sharpening .
Excessive contrast
This is a hard one , and it can be difficult to draw the line and decide what is too much .
As said before , though , contrast should not be gained in the tone mapping stage but later , once back on a LDR image inside photoshop .
You will have to trust your eye and your memory of the scene .
Does it really correspond to your memory of what you saw ( and what you felt ) ?
If you were seeing the image for the first time , would your first reaction be “ wow , this is beautiful ” or “ wow , someone had fun with photoshop “ ?
In conclusion
My only hope that this brief article will make you want to try out HDR next time you are in front of this gorgeous sky with a hopeless histogram .
Expect a lot of frustration , but it is a journey worth taking .

We just presented a webinar on the topic of " Editing InDesign Documents Online , " and it provides a summary of why you would edit InDesign documents online , along with demonstrations of how you can do so , through an online interface with our Silicon Designer product .
Here 's the webinar :
Most of the content about the " why " was created by the great Jeff Seal , a few years ago .
It is truly timeless .
The Silicon Designer product , however , does n't sit still .
It meets the challenges of scaling collaborative design , offering ever - greater capabilities with each passing year .
In preparing the webinar , I noticed that Jeff had used the title " How to Share InDesign Files " for his presentation , and I think that 's a great way of looking at it .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the most recent unemployment numbers last week .
Things are n’t looking good for the unemployed , I ’m afraid .
I showed my younger sister the maps .
Her response : “ It looks like the country is bleeding . ”
While the recession is “ over ” the unemployment rate rose to 9.8 % in September from 9.7 % in August .
That ’s 214,000 more people who are jobless in the United States .
The last time unemployment was this high was back in June 1983 when it was 10.1 % .
Check out the more detailed view here :
From 2004 to 2007 , unemployment was actually decreasing , but things went sour in 2008 , and we ’ve been trying to bounce back ever since .
Update :
See the step - by - step tutorial on how you can make a map like this with your data .
In a recent letter , a visitor to the Biblical Studies Foundation web site asked , “ Could you help explain whether the Bible promotes drinking alcohol or whether it condemns it . ”
This is obviously a concern to many Christians — and for good reason !
With the rampant abuse of alcohol in this country , resulting in shattered lives and tens of thousands of deaths each year , any person with a conscience should be deeply concerned about this issue .
However , caution is also needed in a different direction : too often Christians have moral outrage because of abuses of one of God ’s gifts — outrage that leads to a condemnation of those who are not abusers .
Things that once were issues are often now regarded as normal activities .
For example , when my grandmother and grandfather were dating , her parents were concerned about this young man because he liked to go to football games .
That was taboo for them .
Some Christians have condemned others for wearing make - up , going to the opera , or even sending Christmas cards .
Christians , it seems , have an incredible ability to invent rules and regulations .
It ’s endemic to human nature — but it ’s also a modern , unvarnished form of Pharisaism .
Our attitude toward alcohol may well be conditioned by our culture more than we realize .
Since the days of Prohibition , many believers have simply assumed that partaking of alcoholic beverages was sinful .
What is interesting is that in many other countries God-fearing Christians see no problem with alcoholic beverages .
( When I was on sabbatical in England , for example , I heard the pastor at an evangelical church use an illustration which involved alcohol in a positive light .
He was speaking about our attitude toward little disasters — such as when one brings home the groceries and the one sack that had the Sherry in it falls to the ground and the Sherry bottle breaks !
The very casualness of this illustration put in bold relief the difference in attitude between many American Christians and many European Christians regarding alcoholic beverages .
If a pastor in the States were to use the same illustration , most churches would censure him for it if not outright sack him . )
One question we must wrestle with is this :
If there is a subcultural Christian prohibition that goes beyond scripture , are we obligated to follow it ?
Should we even endorse it ?
Ignore it ?
Fight against it ?
As we all know , there are numerous Christian taboos that go beyond scripture , depending on when and where one lives .
Perhaps this one can be seen as paradigmatic for how to treat the others .
At all points , we must seek to be biblical .
This requires resisting the temptation to go beyond what the Bible restricts .
As I began to look into this topic , I was actually quite amazed at the biblical writers ’ attitude toward alcohol .
I had expected it to be far more negative than it really was .
One lesson I have learned from this is that although I think that I am being biblical , often my tradition and Christian subculture shape my thinking more than I realize .
Preliminary Framework : Grey Areas
A word should be said about grey areas to begin with .
Some Christians view grey areas as those moral zones in which one believer has the right to brow - beat another .
Thus , if one believer thinks it is wrong for another to go to football games , the first believer has the right to exercise judgment on the second .
This ‘ sin - sniffing ’ delves into all areas , and the things that get lumped into this cauldron of evil deeds are quite numerous : attending the opera , playing cards , atttending any kind of motion pictures , owning a television , listening to rock or country - western or even Mozart , investing in the stock market , observing Christmas with a decorated tree , reading mystery novels , spouses having separate checking accounts , women wearing make - up or slacks , etc .
What all these areas have in common is that they are not discussed in scripture .
Thus , if one wants to label them as evil , he either has to do some rather ingenious interpretation of the Bible or else simply appeal to one ’s conscience as the standard by which others are to be measured .
We all can see the ludicrousness of such a stance when it comes to grey zones that are inoffensive to me .
But when there is something that I have found offensive , the natural tendency is for me to make sure everyone else around me abides by the same rules .
One of the hallmarks of modern American Christianity is its preoccupation with a ‘ formula faith . ’
Tremendously popular are conferences that address conflicts between parents and youth and how to resolve them .
One well - known such conference turns ( occasionally ) good advice into hundreds of rules that can suffocate one ’s walk with God .
We are enamored of the ‘ How to ’ books that work for others and perhaps may work for us .
All too often , once a person has found a tailor - made Bible - reading schedule , or a tailor - made pattern of prayer or diet or method of raising children or love - making technique , he writes a book about it and proclaims its universal applicability and even its normativeness .
The reason such sells ?
Because legalism is endemic to human nature .
We can package such as ‘ practical Christianity ’ or ‘ a wise and godly lifestyle ’ or ‘ principles to live by , ’ but at bottom when such advice goes beyond the scriptures and turns into more than advice , it is legalism .
Such a preoccupation with legalism is seen in church membership requirements , missionary and pastoral ordination bodies , and Bible college / seminary codes of conduct .
Take a look at a catalog of almost any evangelical institute of higher learning .
You will notice that all too often the code of conduct section will spend an inordinate amount of space making grey areas taboo while spending almost no space articulating what the Bible declares to be sinful behavior .
Church historian M. James
Sawyer recently spoke at the western regional meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society on Sola Scriptura in the Protestant tradition .
In his lecture he noted the irony of the modern milieu :
Among contemporary denominations we find statements such as that of the [ denomination ’s name withheld ] , who in their licensing and ordination questionnaire asks candidates if they agree that the Bible is the ‘ only and infallible rule of faith and practice ’ for the believer .
( The questionnaire on the very next line asks the candidate if he agrees to abstain from the use of alcohol in all forms . )
The point we are trying to make here is twofold : ( 1 ) Christians tend to compile rules and regulations that go beyond what is written ; and ( 2 ) when such grey zones are considered evil , those who do not abide by such rules are often viewed as ‘ the weaker brother . ’
In reality , the weaker brother in scripture is the one who has too many scruples , not too few ( cf. Romans 14 ) !
It is a tragic irony that as one matures in the faith , all too often his life collects more and more oppressive chains of legalism .
As much as there may well be good reasons for one to personally hold to certain convictions , 2 we must be very careful about extending such beyond ourselves .

The Biblical Data :
Wine and other Alcoholic Beverages in the Bible
The following are some roughly random notes on wine and other alcoholic beverages in the Bible .
Even a casual look at the scriptures reveals a much different perspective than what most modern American Christians have about this topic .
In general , we can say that the Bible neither condemns drinking per se nor promotes it .
Drinking alcoholic beverages is one of those grey areas that is a matter of one ’s personal conscience .
But there is more in scripture than just this individualistic approach .
Is n’t it Really Grape Juice ?
Some take the words for wine to mean ‘ grape juice . ’
If this were so , then why would there be prohibitions against drunkenness ?
One can not get drunk on grape juice .
Further , Jesus ’ first miracle was changing the water into wine at the wedding of Cana in Galilee .
He made between 120 and 180 gallons of wine !
Even if this had been grape juice , it would soon turn to wine because the fermentation process would immediately begin .
But it most certainly was not grape juice : the head waiter in John 2:10 said , “ Every man sets out the good wine first , then after the guests have drunk freely , the poor wine .
But you have kept the good wine until now . ”
The verb translated ‘ drunk freely ’ is almost always used of getting drunk ( and is so translated in the NRSV here ) .
In the least , the people at this wedding feast , if not drunk , would certainly be drinking alcohol fairly freely ( if not , this verb means something here that is nowhere else attested4 ) .
And this makes perfect sense in the context :
The reason why a man brings out the poorer wine later is because the good wine has numbed the senses a bit .
Grape juice would hardly mask anything .
Note also Acts 2:13 — ” they are full of sweet wine ” — an inaccurate comment made about the apostles when they began speaking in tongues , as though this explained their unusual behavior .
The point is :
If they were full of grape juice would this comment even have made any sense at all ?
That would be like saying , “ Well , they ’re all acting strange and silly because they have had too much orange juice this morning ! ”
There are other references to alcoholic beverages in the Bible : Several times in the first books of the Bible , wine and strong drink are prohibited to those who take a Nazarite vow ( cf. Num 6 , Judges 13 ) .
Even grape juice and fresh and dried grapes ( i.e. , raisins , as the NIV renders the word ) are prohibited to the Nazarite ( Numbers 6:3 ) !5
But that restriction is only for those who make this vow .
If someone today wants to claim that believers do not have the right to drink alcohol on the analogy of a Nazarite vow ( as some today are fond of doing ) , they also should say that believers ought not to eat Raisin Bran !
Negative Statements about Wine Indicate that it is not Grape Juice
Further , the Bible at times speaks very harshly about becoming enslaved to drink or allowing it to control a person , especially to the point of drunkenness .
Proverbs 20:1 — “ Wine is a mocker , strong drink a brawler , And whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise ” ( NASB ) .
Cf. also Prov 21:17 ( where heavy drinking and gluttony are equally condemned ) ; 1 Sam 1:14 ; Isa 5:11 , 22 ; 28:1 ( drunkenness is condemned ) ; 28:7 ; 29:9 ; 56:12 ; Jer 23:9 ; 51:7 ; Joel 3:3 .
In the New Testament notice : Eph 5:18 ( “ do not get drunk with wine ” ) ; 1 Tim 3:3 , 8 ; Titus 1:7 ( [ elders and deacons ought not be ] “ addicted to wine or strong drink ” ) ; Titus 2:3 ( older women , who would serve as role models to the younger ones , must not be addicted to wine ) .
As well , numerous passages use wine or drunkenness in an analogy about God ’s wrath , immorality , etc. ( cf. Rev. 14:8 , 10 ; 16:19 ; 17:2 ; 18:3 ) .
The significance of these negative statements is just this :
If this were only grape juice , why would excess in drinking it be condemned ?
If this were only grape juice , why are certain mental effects attributed to it ( cf. , e.g. , Psalm 60:3 ) ?
One ca n’t have it both ways .
You ca n’t say that wine is always grape juice , for then the negative statements in scripture make no sense ; those who say that it is only grape juice tend to focus just on the neutral and positive passages , conveniently allowing them to condemn the drinking of real wine at all times .
But even this position is not logical :
If the Bible only speaks of grape juice , then it makes no comment about alcoholic wine .
And if so , then it does not directly prohibit it .
And if we are going to prohibit something that the Bible does not address , why stop at wine ?
Why do n’t we include the ballet , opera , football games , country - western music ( actually , I might be in favor of banning this one ! ) , salt water fishing , zippers on clothes , etc .
Once legalism infests the soul it does n’t know where to quit .
In sum , is wine the same as grape juice ?
No , for if it were , the Bible would hardly condemn the abuse of such .
Those who argue that the two are identical simply cannot handle the passages that speak about excess .
Neutral and Positive References to Alcoholic Beverages in the Bible
At the same time , there are several neutral , almost casual references to alcoholic beverages .
Genesis 14:18 refers to Melchizedek , a type of Christ , as offering wine to Abram ; Nehemiah 2:1 refers to the king drinking wine ( Nehemiah was required to taste it first to make sure it was not poisoned ) ; Esther 5:6 ; 7:1 - 2 speaks of wine that Esther ( the godly Jewess ) drank with the king ; Job 1:13 refers to righteous Job ’s family drinking wine ; Daniel 10:3 speaks of drinking wine as a blessing after a time of fasting .
Some of Jesus ’ parables are about wine , wineskins , vineyards ( cf. Matt 9:17 ; 21:33 ; even John 15 speaks of God the Father as the vinedresser ! ) .
Paul tells
Timothy to drink some wine for his stomach ’s sake and not just water ( 1 Tim 5:23 ) .
The same Greek and Hebrew terms that were used to speak of the abuses of wine are used in these passages .
One cannot argue , therefore , that alcoholic beverages are in themselves proscribed , while grape juice is permitted .
The lexical data can not be so twisted .
There are , as well , positive statements about alcoholic beverages :
Deut 14:26 implies that it is a good thing to drink wine and strong drink to the Lord : “ And you may spend the money for whatever your heart desires , for oxen , or sheep , or wine , or strong drink , or whatever your heart desires ; and there you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice , you and your household ” ( NASB ) .
Psalm 4:7 compares joy in the Lord to the abundance of wine ; Psalm 104:14 - 15 credits
God as the creator of wine that “ makes a man ’s heart glad ” ( cf. also Hos 2:8 ) ; honoring the Lord with one ’s wealth is rewarded with the blessings of abundant stores of wine ( Prov 3:10 ) ; love is compared to wine repeatedly in the Song of Songs , as though good wine were similarly sweet ( 1:2 , 4 ; 4:10 ; 7:9 ) .
The Lord prepares a banquet with “ well - aged wines ... and fine , well - aged wines ” for his people ( Isa 25:6 ) [ obviously this cannot be grape juice , for aging does nothing but ferment it ! ] .
The lack of wine is viewed as a judgment from God ( Jer 48:33 ; Lam 2:12 ; Hos 2:9 ; Joel 1:10 ; Hag 2:16 ) ; and , conversely , its provision is viewed as a blessing from the Lord ( cf. Gen 27:28 ; Deut 7:13 ; 11:14 ; Joel 2:19 , 24 ; 3:18 ; Amos 9:13 - 14 ) .
Cf. also Isa 55:1 ; Jer 31:12 ; Zech 9:17 .
Indeed , there was even the Passover tradition that went beyond the biblical teaching : by the time of the first century , every adult was obliged to have four glasses of wine during the Passover celebration .
Jesus and his disciples did this in the Last Supper .6
The fact that the wine of the Passover was a symbol the Lord used for his blood and for the new covenant implicitly shows that our Lord ’s view of wine was quite different from that of many modern Christians .
What is truly remarkable here are the many positive statements made about wine and alcoholic beverages in the Bible .
7
Wine is so often connected with the blessings of God that we are hard - pressed to figure out why so many modern Christians view drink as the worst of all evils .
Why , if one did n’t know better , he might think that God actually wanted us to enjoy life !
Unfortunately , the only Bible most of our pagan friends will read is the one written on our lives and spoken from our lips .
The Bible they know is a book of ‘ Thou shalt nots , ’ and the God they know is a cosmic killjoy .
I think the best balance on this issue can be see in Luke 7:33 - 34 : John the Baptist abstained from drinking wine ; Jesus did not abstain [ indeed , people called him a drunkard !
Although certainly not true , it would be difficult for this charge to have been made had Jesus only drunk grape juice ] .
Both respected one another and both recognized that their individual lifestyles were not universal principles .
One man may choose not to drink ; another may choose to drink .
We ought not condemn another servant of the Lord for his choice .
As well , Romans 14 is a key passage for gleaning principles about how we ought to conduct ourselves in relation to one another on this issue : weaker brothers ought not to judge those whose freedom in Christ allows them to enjoy alcoholic beverages ; stronger brothers ought not to disdain weaker brothers for their stance .
Whether we drink or not , let us do all things to the glory of God .
Conclusion
There is much more that could be said about this issue ; no doubt many readers will respond critically for what was left out .
In later essays I hope to address some questions that arise because of this piece .
This brief essay really has no conclusion ; rather , this is the first volley in an ongoing discussion .
The general contours of biblical teaching are that wine is a blessing from the Lord , something to be enjoyed .
But like any good gift from God , it can be abused : in this case , abuse involves addiction and drunkenness .
But whenever we condemn others who are able to enjoy God ’s good gifts in moderation as though they were abusers , we misrepresent biblical Christianity .
At bottom , it seems that biblical Christianity has a much different face than what much of modern Christianity wears .
In many respects , we resemble more the ancient Pharisees than the Lord ’s disciples .

Rockets fired from Gaza usually cause limited damage in Israel
Hamas says it has agreed with other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza to stop firing rockets into Israel .
Fathi Hammad , who acts as Hamas interior minister , said the ceasefire aimed to prevent retaliatory attacks by Israel and build stability .
But he said rockets would continue to be fired from the Gaza Strip in the event of any Israeli incursions .
Hamas has observed a ceasefire for months , but other groups have carried out sporadic cross - border attacks .
The rockets usually cause limited damage and few if any casualties .
Operation Cast Lead , the Israeli military offensive in Gaza last December and January , was intended to put a stop to the attacks , some of which have reached up to 46 km ( 28 miles ) into Israel .
About 1,300 Palestinians and 10 Israeli soldiers were killed in the three weeks of fighting .
Three Israeli citizens also died in rocket attacks during the operation .
Mr Hammad said ending the firing of rockets would bring greater stability to the lives of people in Gaza , enabling them to continue repairing the damage caused by the conflict .
Dubai debt crisis : Now British banks face fresh crisis after investing billions
Barclays , RBS and HSBC face losing billions
Wall Street plummets by 2 per cent after late opening
FTSE falls by 1.5 per cent before stabilising
Banks see £ 14 billion wiped off market value in one day
Dubai may consider selling QE2 to tackle debt
British banks were teetering on the brink of a fresh meltdown today after it emerged they had invested heavily in crisis - hit Dubai .
An $ 80 billion debt default in the emirate has already reawakened the spectre of a global ' double dip ' - that the first shoots of recovery could be wiped out by a second wave of recession .
But the level of exposure that the crippled British banking sector faces is now under renewed scrutiny .
The crisis was prompted by Dubai World , the development company behind three palm shaped islands as well as an off - shore replica of the globe , defaulting on its debt .
Today it emerged that :
Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) was Dubai World 's biggest loan arranger since January 2007 , according to JP Morgan
HSBC has an estimated £ 9.6 billion in loans and advances to UAE customers
Barclays has an exposure of around £ 3billion
Another bailout ?
Gordon Brown ( right ) meets Dubai 's ruler Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum at Downing Street earlier this week
The figures are particularly alarming as the sector has had to be bailed - out by the tax payer on a number of occasions over the last year - and - a- half
Earlier this month , RBS and Lloyds Banking group received another £ 50 billion to keep them afloat
RBS - which has received the biggest state rescue anywhere in the world - is now effectively owned by the taxpayer .
As the money markets continued to falter , Gordon Brown moved to dispel investors ' panic , claiming that he believed British banks were ' well - capitalised ' .
Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Trinidad , Mr Brown said : ' I think we will find this is not on the scale of the previous problems we have dealt with . '
Asked if the Dubai situation could spark a ' double - dip ' recession , he said : ' You are obviously going to have setbacks with a bank here or an organisation there which has had problems , but I do believe the world has a better way of monitoring what is happening , so we can be sure that - despite setbacks - we will continue to go forward . '
Under construction :
While the world 's tallest tower the Burj Dubai nears completion , many ambitious building projects have come to a standstill
Abandoned : A filthy car left behind at Dubai airport after its owner became one of many ex-pats who fleeing the country after the bubble burst
Stock markets around the world have endured another turbulent 24 hours .
Wall Street plummeted 2 per cent when it opened at 2.30 pm GMT this afternoon .
In London , the FTSE fell around 1.5 per cent first thing after a 3 per cent fall yesterday wiped almost £ 44 billion from blue - chip stocks .
The index recovered its poise to stand 0.5 per cent lower after the first hour of trading .
It was at 5188.73 at 12.45 pm , down from 5194.13 at start of trading this morning .
In Frankfurt , the Dax index fell 1.32 per cent to 5,540.34 while in France , the CAC lost 1 per cent to 3,639.66 .
Asian markets were also under pressure overnight as Hong Kong 's Hang Seng fell more than 5 per cent and Japan 's Nikkei was 3 per cent lower .
Banks worldwide saw £ 14 billion wiped off their market value yesterday .
Dubai 's rulers have done their best to calm fears , claiming the situation was under control .
Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum , the uncle of Dubai 's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum , said : '' Our intervention in Dubai World was carefully planned and reflects its specific financial position .
' The government is spearheading the restructuring of this commercial operation in the full knowledge of how the markets would react .
' We understand the concerns of the market and the creditors in particular .
' However , we have had to intervene because of the need to take decisive action to address its particular debt burden . '
There were reports today that the emirate may consider selling the QE2 , bought for $ 100 million in 2007 , to tackle some of its debt.l
Emirati traders react as they monitor data on screens at the Dubai Financial Market yesterday

Much of the debt default falls on Dubai World , which owns property developer Nakhell .
As of August , the conglomerate had $ 59 billion of liabilities which it now hopes to avoid redeeming for six months .
Analysts had expected that the Dubai 's oil - rich neighbour Abu Dhabi would offer financial support .
But Dubai may have to abandon an economic model that focused on developing swathes of desert with foreign money and labour .
Even the prospect of an Abu - Dhabi - backed bailout did little to allay concerns among investors , already worried the global economy may not be recovering quickly enough to justify a near doubling of prices for emerging market stocks and many commodities since March .
Tokyo traders have already dubbed the development Financial Crisis Part II .
' The panic button 's been hit again , ' said Francis Lun , general manager of Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong .
' The biggest worry I have is whether this will trigger a repricing in the overall emerging market , ' said Arthur Lau , a fund manager in Hong Kong with JF Asset Management .
' This an important reminder that the credit crisis is forgotten but not gone , ' Robert Rennie , strategist at Westpac Global Markets Group , said in a note .
Asian banks , like their European peers , scrambled to distance themselves from Dubai , a desert emirate that emerged from dusty obscurity to invest in global lenders such as Standard Chartered and lure fund managers with the promise of a tax - free lifestyle .
Bursting the bubble :
The launch of Atlantis hotel ( above ) , on one of the palm islands ( below ) last November was an extravagant celebration of Dubai 's ambitions
The nerves showed in credit markets , at the centre of the financial storm triggered by the Lehman Brothers ' bankruptcy last year .
Asian credit default swaps , used to insure against default , were at their widest in a month , with the Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment - grade index touching 124/129 basis points .
Dubai 's credit default swaps were being quoted as high as 500 - 550 basis points , some traders said on Thursday .
Dubai 's debt problems are a hangover from a property bubble that imploded after the financial crisis derailed its plans to become a magnet for tourists and a regional hub for everything from shipping to entertainment .
Banks ' exposure to a Dubai default pales in comparison to the $ 2.8 trillion in writedowns the International Monetary Fund estimates U.S. and European lenders will have to make between 2007 and 2010 as a result of the credit crisis .
' Similar stories to the one in Dubai are likely to come out , leading risk money to pull out from assets such as commodities and stocks , ' said Takahiko Murai , general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities in Japan .
Japan 's biggest bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell as Japan 's Nikkei average struck a four - month closing low .
It also came under pressure from weak exporters after the dollar hit a fresh 14 - year low against the yen .
The Australian and New Zealand dollars retreated .
Shares in HSBC Holdings , one of the bookrunners on an outstanding $ 5.5 billion Dubai World loan , dropped more than 7 per cent and Standard Chartered losses topped 6 per cent .
The London listed shares of the two lenders led the biggest tumble in European bank stocks in six months on Thursday .
Remember that zany Irish company Steorn , who claimed to have built a working perpetual motion machine that could produce clean , free energy out of a few magnets and some plastic discs ?
Well , they 're back again .
Undeterred by the fact that their own hand - picked jury of scientific judges unanimously agreed that the technology did n't work , Steorn has put its
Orbo perpetual motion machine out for public display , and set up web feeds through which you can watch the thing in motion .
But the demonstration has failed to impress critics , and for good reasons .
Perpetual motion , over - unity , whatever you want to call it , Steorn 's Orbo is the latest in a long line of wondrous devices that claim to produce energy out of nothing , in direct violation of one of the best - understood and best - proven laws of physics , the second law of thermodynamics .
So many inventors have claimed they 've built such devices over the years that the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris got sick of wasting time evaluating them and has refused even to read proposals dealing with perpetual motion machines for more than 230 years .
And yet , in the enlightened noughties , Irishman Sean McCarthy has still managed to convince enough marks to manage to keep a company running for more than six years based on the promise of limitless free energy .
The Orbo device claims to use time variance in magnetic fields to keep a disc circling in a little stand , and Steorn says that once it 's going , it can continue indefinitely without drawing energy from its surroundings or degrading its components - in fact , if you add up the work done by the Orbo " motor " and the heat put out by its magnetic coils , it 's said to generate as much as three times the energy of the initial input .
To demonstrate this ( after one previous public demo failed ) , Steorn has put the Orbo on display in Dublin 's Waterways center .
Rather than using the all - magnetic version of the device , the company has chosen to use one that 's connected to a D - cell battery .
The sort of D - cell battery that could probably power a similar low - friction electromagnetic device for days at a time with no magic free energy required .
The machine is operating under no visible load - it 's just charging its own battery , if you believe McCarthy - and there 's no devices attached to prove that it 's making any sort of output at all .
The Orbo has even stopped spinning on a few occasions , according to folks who have been watching the technology demonstration through one of three live webcasts at the Steorn website .
An electromagnetic motor that spins for hours at a time - riveting , and not the most convincing thing in the world .
If it 's a hoax , as most people suggest , you have to wonder why people bother with this sort of thing - is it the attention ?
Is there some sort of significant financial gain to be made from stringing gullible private investors along with a series of developments and tests that all fail for reasons entirely separate from the fact that the device contravenes the laws of physics ?
Then again , we'd all love to believe that there 's a magic solution for the looming energy crisis that will save the world using the power of unicorn farts and rainbows , so who are we to tell Steorn 's investors that there 's no Santa , this close to Christmas ?
The demonstration is open to the public between 10 am and 7 pm from December 15 - 23 this year , and January 5 - 31 2010 at the Waterways center in Dublin .
Pop in and see the future , folks .

Momofuku - 1.jpg
A couple of reasons to buy David Chang 's new Momofuku cookbook : ( 1 ) Lots of awesome , bacony , no - bullshit recipes like the one after the jump .
( 2 ) You can actually read the thing .
Like an actual book .
Writer Peter Meehan captures
Chang 's voice remarkably well .
You'd think you were sitting there with the famously grumpy - enthusiastic - reluctant - passionate chef ripping through a case of OB beer while you learn how Momofuku became more than just " a shitty little noodle bar " and the 32 - year - old Chang became ( despite his resistance ) the most celebrated chef in New York .
— Adam Rapoport
And check back tomorrow for the debut installment of Eat a Peach ! , a series of dispatches by David Chang and Peter Meehan from the Momofuku book tour — exclusively on GQ.com .
David Chang talks about Brussels sprouts the way he talks about pretty much everything — with blunt force .
" Basically , you can't fuck them up , " he says , a pan of sprouts sizzling and sputtering in front of him .
" Cook the shit out of them ; just do n't turn them to charcoal . "
Chang makes it sound easier than it is , but he 's not exaggerating by much .
When cooked properly , Brussels sprouts take on a crispy , caramelized quality that makes them all but addictive .
At Noodle Bar — the first of his three Momofuku - stamped restaurants in New York 's East Village — the sprouts became so popular he eventually took them off the menu .
" Every single table ordered them , " he says .
" It was ridiculous .
I would 've had to dedicate one of my cooks to doing nothing but cooking sprouts all night . "
At the time , Chang pan-roasted the sprouts with crispy chunks of bacon and then tossed them in pureed kimchi .
At Ssäm Bar , his second restaurant , he started deep - frying them and tossing them in fish sauce .
When I visited him recently at Ko , his twelve - seat high - end eatery , he browned them in a skillet , added a touch of butter , and then tossed them in sriracha , the Asian hot sauce , with a squirt of lime juice .
" They 're really resilient to strong flavors , " he explains .
" They 're incredibly forgiving . "
What 's essential , though , is not how you flavor the sprouts but how you cook them .
Do it right and you can give them any type of spin you want .
The key is to achieve an evenly browned finish .
It 's one that 's best achieved by slicing the sprouts lengthwise , then cooking them cut - side down .
Chang likes bacon fat , but olive oil works just as well .
He also prefers a skillet on the stovetop to get the caramelization going .
But if you 're cooking for a large group — say , at Thanksgiving — you can easily lay a few dozen down on a baking sheet or two and roast them in a hot oven .
( CNN ) --
A militant Islamist group associated with al Qaeda has for the first time threatened to attack Israel , far from its normal base of operations in Somalia .
Al - Shabab , which is fighting to control the east African country , accused Israel of " starting to destroy " the Al Aqsa mosque , where standoffs have taken place recently between Israeli police and Palestinians .
The mosque is part of the complex that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call Haram al - Sharif .
" The Jews started to destroy parts of the holy mosque of Al Aqsa and they routinely kill our Palestinian brothers , so we are committed to defend our Palestinian brothers , " said Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur , a prominent Al - Shabab commander .
His threat was part of a series of fiery sermons delivered after Friday prayers in Baidoa in southwest Somalia .
Al - Shabab controls the region , which is part of a country that has been without an effective national government for nearly 20 years .
Other leaders of the group also threatened Israel , the first time the group is known to have done so .
" We will transfer and expand our fighting in the Middle East so we can defend Al Aqsa mosque from the Israelis , " Al - Shabab commander Abdifatah Aweys Abu Hamza said in Mogadishu , the Somali capital .
He is apparently the leader of a new Al - Shabab armed group calling themselves " Mujahedin Al Aqsa , " or " Al Aqsa Holy Warriors , " which they said is assigned to attack Israel .
It is not clear whether Al - Shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against Israel .
But Rashid Abdi of the International Crisis Group , speaking last week before al - Shabab issued its threats against Israel , warned that the group should be taken seriously .
" We should not underestimate the capacity of Al - Shabab , " he said .
" This is a deadly organization , a formidable foe . "
Abdi said the group had been mutating from a nationalist group into a terrorist organization more like al Qaeda , which was behind the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States .
" If you look at the rhetoric and language and if you look at the Web sites , if you hear their preachers or their scholars speak , it is completely indistinguishable from al Qaeda leaders , " Abdi said .
The group has also become more vicious in Somalia , a local human rights expert said .
" The most gruesome and gross violations of human rights are committed by Al - Shabab , " activist Hassan Shire Sheikh said .
" They have also instilled fear .
They just shoot , they kill , they maim and they lash . "
The group also threatened African neighbors on Friday , including Ethiopia , Djibouti , Kenya , Eritrea , Ghana , Sudan and Uganda .
They have in the past threatened African nations that provide peacekeeping troops to the war - torn country .
The U.S. State Department Country Reports on Terrorism from April lists Al - Shabab as a terrorist organization and blames it for shootings and suicide bombings inside Somalia .
It does not list the group as having carried out violence outside Somalia , but says some members of the group have trained and fought alongside al Qaeda in Afghanistan .
Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting .
The transitional government has struggled to establish authority , challenged by Islamist groups like Al - Shabab that have seized control of Mogadishu and much of the south .
CNN 's David McKenzie in Nairobi , Kenya , contributed to this report .
How the Moon produces its own water

( click to enlarge )
The Moon is a big sponge that absorbs electrically charged particles given out by the Sun .
These particles interact with the oxygen present in some dust grains on the lunar surface , producing water .
This discovery , made by the ESA - ISRO instrument SARA onboard the Indian Chandrayaan - 1 lunar orbiter , confirms how water is likely being created on the lunar surface .
It also gives scientists an ingenious new way to take images of the Moon and any other airless body in the Solar System .
The lunar surface is a loose collection of irregular dust grains , known as regolith .
Incoming particles should be trapped in the spaces between the grains and absorbed .
When this happens to protons they are expected to interact with the oxygen in the lunar regolith to produce hydroxyl and water .
The signature for these molecules was recently found and reported by Chandrayaan - 1's Moon Mineralogy Mapper ( M3 ) instrument team .
The SARA results confirm that solar hydrogen nuclei are indeed being absorbed by the lunar regolith but also highlight a mystery : not every proton is absorbed .
One out of every five rebounds into space .
In the process , the proton joins with an electron to become an atom of hydrogen .
" We did n't expect to see this at all , " says Stas Barabash , Swedish Institute of Space Physics , who is the European Principal Investigator for the Sub - keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer ( SARA ) instrument , which made the discovery .
Although Barabash and his colleagues do not know what is causing the reflections , the discovery paves the way for a new type of image to be made .
The hydrogen shoots off with speeds of around 200 km/s and escapes without being deflected by the Moon 's weak gravity .
Hydrogen is also electrically neutral , and is not diverted by the magnetic fields in space .
So the atoms fly in straight lines , just like photons of light .
In principle , each atom can be traced back to its origin and an image of the surface can be made .
The areas that emit most hydrogen will show up the brightest .
Whilst the Moon does not generate a global magnetic field , some lunar rocks are magnetised .
Barabash and his team are currently making images , to look for such ' magnetic anomalies ' in lunar rocks .
These generate magnetic bubbles that deflect incoming protons away into surrounding regions making magnetic rocks appear dark in a hydrogen image .
The incoming protons are part of the solar wind , a constant stream of particles given off by the Sun .
They collide with every celestial object in the Solar System but are usually stopped by the body 's atmosphere .
On bodies without such a natural shield , for example asteroids or the planet Mercury , the solar wind reaches the ground .
The SARA team expects that these objects too will reflect many of the incoming protons back into space as hydrogen atoms .
This knowledge provides timely advice for the scientists and engineers who are readying ESA 's BepiColombo mission to Mercury .
The spacecraft will be carrying two similar instruments to SARA and may find that the inner-most planet is reflecting more hydrogen than the Moon because the solar wind is more concentrated closer to the Sun .
FRANKFURT 
The electric car is at the starting line , and the gun is about to sound .
Now automakers must prove that the technology , and the market , are ready .
After years of talk and prototypes , some automobile makers believe the electric vehicle is about to become more than just a science experiment .
The French company Renault will unveil a lineup at the Frankfurt motor show this week that includes a purely electric sedan , without a backup internal combustion engine .
Renault says the vehicle will be in showrooms by 2011 .
General Motors , which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection , is offering the Chevrolet Volt as one of its comeback cars .
The Volt is an electric vehicle with a backup gasoline - run generator for longer trips .

The active ingredient , as you can see , is Lambda expressions :
It can be difficult to give to charity when you are n't making much yourself .
Many people simply can't afford to share their earnings without jeopardizing their own living situation .
Others are understandably reluctant to harm their own standard of living to help others .
It is n't necessary to donate money to help people less fortunate .
Instead , you can donate time , connections , knowledge , and skills to homeless people .
While these things cost time , labor , and thought they do n't take away from your paycheck .
In fact , they look great on your resume and are a great way to fill in gaps in your employment record .
So take a trip with me down this page and find out how you can help homeless people without touching your hard earned cash .
Share yourself and make a big difference in the lives of people living without homes .

Generating S5 based presentations from an Org Mode file is something I 've considered for a while .
I 've just published some working code to do so : http://github.com/sigma/org-s5
The README file should give the basic steps to make it work .
Constraints I wanted to respect :
no modification needed on Org-mode or S5
easy to reuse the glue across multiple presentations
adaptable enough to survive multiple S5 themes
This is probably far from being complete , but at least it 's usable enough for me to do presentations at work .
Hope it can be useful for someone else .
I got a hilarious message on the official Dollhouse forum titled " One Last Stand .
" Sorry , but no show with such low , pathetic ratings has ever been renewed .
Not even close .
This season the ratings started bad and only got worse .
If you 're going to go all out and " crash their whole system , " just kidnap a couple of Nielsen families and turn their sets to Dollhouse .
That way , Fox will actually see progress in the ratings and wo n't be pissed off that the fans forced them to spend more money on tech support .
The simple fact is that successful fan campaigns are 1 in 100 , and nonexistent for shows like Dollhouse with genuinely bad ratings .
Jericho got renewed .
but it had almost twice the viewers of Dollhouse , and Chuck had many more viewers on a struggling network .
Dollhouse on the other hand is on Fox where its measly ratings are n't needed .
The repeats of House and Bones during November sweeps did substantially better than new episodes of Dollhouse .
There is always a time to lay down and give up -- unless of course you take my suggestion and commit some crimes .
Dubai World 's property businesses are heavily indebted Dubai World has met creditors , including executives from HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland , to discuss its debt repayment plan .
A Dubai World spokesman said the meeting was an overview of its plans and it would continue to work with financial creditors in an orderly way .
It was the first face - to - face meeting since the firm asked for an extension on its debt repayments in November .
News of the delay prompted big falls on stock markets around the world .
Abu Dhabi subsequently provided Dubai with a $ 10 bn loan to stop it from defaulting on a repayment .
Clarity needed
In a statement , Dubai World also said : " As long as a [ debt repayment ] standstill is successfully implemented , Dubai World has assurances that the Government of Dubai , through the Dubai Financial Support Fund , will provide financial support to cover working capital and interest expenses to ensure the continuity of key projects " .
The BBC's Jeremy Howell in Dubai said it was in the bankers ' interests to come to an agreement over the debt repayments .
" The last thing they want is for Nakheel [ Dubai World 's property business ] to be driven into liquidation when they would get birdseed ... it is in their interest to prop up the company in the hope that they might get their money back eventually " he said .
Analysts said it was important for Dubai World to provide clarity on how it plans to pay back the loans .
" Obviously a standstill is not ideal , " said Raj Madha , banking analyst at EFG - Hermes .
" But a standstill with visibility of when payments will be received or the extent of these payments would be sufficient to call it a result " .

Advertisement " Chatbot " technology is being used in an attempt to solve one of " the last uncracked problems " in games design .
221b , released in the run-up to the new Sherlock Holmes movie , harnesses the software to allow conversations between players and in - game characters .
Gamers , who assume the character of either Sherlock Holmes or Dr Watson , must interrogate virtual witnesses and suspects to progress in the game .
Success depends upon getting the right answers from these characters .
" It 's our role to predict what you might know at that point in the game and the questions you might ask , " said Rollo Carpenter of Existor , which provided the technology .
" The ways that you might say things to them are almost unlimited . "
' Drama manager '
Mr Carpenter is a two - time winner of the Loebner Prize , a competition that challenges computer scientists to build programmes capable of convincingly human conversations .
When a player interrogates a game character in 221b , Carpenter 's technology is used to analyse the question and to provide a relevant response .
Players must interrogate witnesses and suspects Rather than attempting to create an exhaustive list of possible questions and the appropriate response , the characters in the game are capable of making a " fuzzy interpretation " of what is said to them .
Pattern matching is then used to identify the appropriate answer for any given input by a player .
The intention is to remove the frustration , familiar to any who played the old text - based adventure games , of having to guess the right way of asking a question or giving an instruction .
While the technology allows the system to cope with the many different ways a player might attempt to elicit information from a suspect - the responses are limited .
It is not the first game to have explored innovative approaches to language .
Alex Champandard , a programmer who has worked on artificial intelligence for Rockstar Games and Guerrilla Games , believes one of the most creative approaches was used in the interactive story Facade .
Players must interact with two characters , Grace and Trip , whose relationship is experiencing difficulties .
" Since the AI characters are completely interactive , each time you play the outcome depends on your actions , said Mr Champandard .
" Yet in the background there 's a drama manager that makes sure the story keeps going . "
Voice triggers Dr Mike Reddy , who teaches games development and artificial intelligence at the University of Wales , highlights techniques used in the Nintendo DS puzzle game Scribblenauts .
" In this game , the player evokes objects and characters by typing or writing their name , " he explained .
Scribblenauts allows players to summon objects using words
For example , the player can write " helicopter " to summon the vehicle onscreen and use it to collect objects .
Multiple objects can be " chained together " to solve problems .
" The clever semantic implementation is to know what would happen when a Dog meets a Lion , " said Dr Reddy .
" The game has 22,000 plus words and has attempted to implement all the possible interactions .
Put Death up against God , for example , and you get an interesting surprise . "
For big budget games , creating hi-quality voice acting and animation " on the fly " is a significant technical challenge .
However , some games are attempting to move beyond rigidly scripted dialogue .
Mr Champanard highlights the approach of the 2008 release Left4 Dead " Each of the characters has a set of voice samples which can trigger based on events , situations and other dialog lines " , he said .
" This results in completely emergent short conversations depending on the situation . "
Completely convincing language based interaction with non-player characters remains one of the " last uncracked problems " , according to Dr Reddy .
But , he said , the games industry is making progress .
" We have come a long way from ' All your base are belong to us ' and ' TAKE AXE .
THROW AXE AT DWARF ' "

Feminism turned women into miserable ' wage slaves ' just like men , says Fay Weldon
Anti-feminist : Fay Weldon has been accused of losing touch with the aspirations of women
Women have been turned into unhappy ' wage - slaves ' by the march of feminism , according to one of the movement 's pioneers , the author Fay Weldon .
The novelist , 78 , believes only the better - off are able to cope with the exhausing nature of modern life .
Weldon told a literature festival that while the sexual revolution of the Sixties had ended the requirement for women to provide ' sexual , childcare and cooking services ' , the ' downside ' of feminism was a new breed of women .
These women , she claimed , are like their male office colleagues and intent only on scaling the salary ladder .
She said : ' The downside of feminism is that women are now expected to go out to work , which some women would rather do than looking after the children anyway .
' Once it was only the men who were wage - slaves , and now it 's the men and the women too .
You know , I 'd really rather blame capitalism .
' Probably 20 per cent of women are worse off and the enormous number are better off .
' You do feel some qualms for these women who actually have to shove their children 's arms into clothes at five o'clock in the morning and get them off to the nursery . '
But Weldon , who has four grown up sons and has been married three times , insisted that feminism was the ' least worst ' option for women .
Role model : Katie Price 'empowers women by looking good and making money '
' If you 're an intelligent , competent and healthy person it's the most wonderful thing , ' she said .
' If you have no aspirations and do n't want to do anything except exist , than perhaps the pre-feminist world was better .
There 's never a perfect solution .
There 's just the least worst .
' And least worst is feminist society , which is more or less what we 're getting now .
And people are on the whole happier than they were before Although everybody 's much more tired . '
The author , best known for The Lives and Loves of a She - Devil , was speaking at the Richmond Book Now Festival over the weekend , where she was promoting her 29th novel , Chalcot Crescent .
She also said Katie Price , the former glamour model also known as Jordan , was a positive role model according to certain people 's expectations about how women should ' function ' .
Weldon said of the celebrity : ' If it 's to look good , then she 's fine .
If it 's to make a lot of money , then she 's fine .
' So I suppose she must be empowering for women because one wants them to be prosperous and they like to look good .
' She drinks too much and sleeps with too many people and talks about it too much for common decency , but who of us is perfect ? '
It is not the first time Weldon has described modern women as wage - slaves .
In an interview ten years ago , she said capitalism crept in ' under the cloak of feminism ' and ' cunningly turned women as well as men into wage slaves , so that ' the employer ' not ' the man ' is woman 's new enemy ' .
In 2004 , in an essay on the newly - released Briget Jones film The Edge of Reason , she described the main character as a ' wage slave ' for whom the feminist revolution had passed by .
Give the Environmental Protection Agency credit :
At least it practices equal opportunity censorship of its employees .
Dr. Alan Carlin , a 37 - year agency veteran , was muzzled earlier this spring .
Dr. Carlin offered a report poking holes in the science underlying the theory of manmade global warming .
His superior , Al McGartland , complained the paper did " not help the legal or policy case " for Team Obama 's decision to regulate carbon , told him to " move on to other issues , " and forbade him from discussing it outside the office ....
Briton Ged Galvin survived that vicious car wreck that nearly took his life .
Unfortunately , the accident crushed some of his organs and left him needing a colostomy bag to go to the bathroom .
That was until his doctors created his cyborg sphincter .
Yes , you read that correctly .
Doctors removed muscle from above Galvin 's knee , wrapped it around his damaged sphincter , and attached electrodes to the nerves .
Now , when Galvin goes to the bathroom he simply presses a button on a remote control .
From The Telegraph :
Mr Galvin , who had previously endured the indignity of carrying a colostomy bag , added : “ I thought that in these days of modern medicine surely there was something they could do .
They 'd mended everything else - why not this ?
Anything was better than a colostomy bag .
“ The operation changed my life and gave me back my pride and confidence .
Because of the remote control I can lead a normal life again . ”
Outstanding .
Though hopefully Galvin 's remote has a lock that prevents him from accidentally triggering it while it's in his pocket .

The two lessons we take away as standouts from the credit crisis are probably somewhat unconventional , but we think they are of great import .
First of all , " big " has a way of changing to " trivial " overnight when one is talking about government spending .
Second , the " biggest of the big " is n't summed up by large , complex models .
Instead , it gets added up on scratch paper .
Or via the calculator feature of a Blackberry .
Or scrawled on a cocktail napkin with a leaky pen .
Today , drawing from these lessons , we think that five simple lines portend something , well , big .
Section .
1118 .
Access to the Discount Window .
A financial holding company subject to stricter stand -
ards shall have the same access to the discount window
lending of an appropriate Federal Reserve bank as is
available to a member bank of such Federal Reserve bank .
What would this text be doing as an amendment to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 ?
That is , after all , a bill intended :
To provide for financial regulatory reform , to protect consumers and investors , to enhance Federal understanding of insurance issues , to regulate the over - the - counter derivatives markets , and for other purposes .
What exactly does Mr. Miller of North California ( no legislative slouch , really ) have in mind here ?
Whatever it is , you can be pretty sure it is not likely to please any of the 18 primary dealers who hithertofore have enjoyed exclusive discount window access and to which they are able to pledge radioactive solids of just about any toxicity or half - life in exchange for loans of sweet , short term liquid elixir ( read : cash ) at vanishingly small interest rates .
Or if you prefer :
The Discount Window functions as a safety valve in relieving pressures in reserve markets ; extensions of credit can help alleviate liquidity strains in a depository institution and in the banking system as a whole .
It also helps ensure the basic stability of the payment system by supplying liquidity during times of systemic stress .
Right now that means just under $ 20 billion outstanding .
Expect that to change if this amendment becomes law .
The phrase " financial holding company subject to stricter standards " is n't defined in the single - sheet amendment text , but insofar as the discount window is primarily a tool for what might safely be called " emergency liquidity , " one wonders why it would be necessary to grant access to this facility to even a moderately large fraction of the 565 Financial Holding Companies already in existence .
Further , in the paperwork of corporate formation , becoming a financial holding corporation ranks in difficulty somewhere between creating a Delaware limited liability company and getting a canine breeder 's license in Nebraska .
What benefit , exactly , is there to , say , the taxpayers , in giving Poca Valley Bancshares , Inc. ( or the Royal Bank of Scotland Group , plc- no we are n't kidding - for that matter ) unbridled access to this kind of emergency capital .
Or , perhaps , the Distinguished Gentleman from North Carolina knows something about the emergency liquidity needs of a large fraction of the financial institutions in the country that is n't quite public knowledge yet ?
Is it the regionals that are an issue ?
Or perhaps this is aimed at shoring up heretofore well concealed problems among insurance giants ?
A D.C. police detective is under fire today after he allegedly pulled his service weapon after kids hit his Hummer with snowballs .
In addition , the head of internal investigations for D.C. Assistant Chief Peter Newsham is being criticized for telling the public that the detective never pulled his weapon and only had a cellphone in his hand .
However , on the videotape below the detective admits that he pulled his weapon .
The officer in the video identifies himself as Detective “ Baylor ” ( spelling ? ) and , when confronted with the claim that he pulled his gun , says “ yes I did because I was hit with snowballs . ”
The truth of the story was broken by Jason Cherkis of the CityPaper , who found witnesses and pictures that disprove Newsham ’s statements .
According to witnesses , the detective was driving around in his personal Hummer when it was hit by snowballs at the corner of 14th and U NW .
He allegedly got out of his car and pulled his gun in front of the crowd — prompting people to call 911 .
The officer who is shown on the video speaking with the crowd appears professional and measured .
The detective in the video on the other hand is still yelling and admits to pulling his gun as justified because he “ got his with snowballs . ”
It appears in Washington snowballs constitute the basis for justified use of lethal force under Tennessee v. Garner .
Here is how the witnesses found by Cherkis described the event to him :
“ An hour ago , we showed up to see a snowball fight already in progress .
Two factions along 14th Street along the intersection .
It was pretty friendly , mostly OK .
At one point , there was one interaction with the police that I saw .
A cop got stuck in the snow .
People stopped and helped him out .
A couple moments later , at the intersection , heading west along U was this big maroon Hummer .
A small faction of people decided to target it with snowballs .
They ’re throwing snowballs at the Hummer .
It turns out the driver of the Hummer is a detective .
He gets out .
He ’s waving a walkie talkie .
It ’s not going well .
Then he starts waving a gun .
He had n’t identified himself at this point .
There was a point where things cooled off a bit , more police showed up , and he identified himself at that point .
The name was Det. Baylor .
My guess was B - A - Y - L - O - R . ”
Witnesses say that Baylor went into the crowd and grabbed the man that he thought threw one of the snowballs .
It is not clear what forensic tests might be done since it is not like finding residue powder on a gun suspect .
Assistant Chief Peter Newsham went public to say that the investigation showed that ( once again ) citizens were mistaken about an officer ’s conduct : “ There was no police pulling guns on snowball people . ”
Here is how Newsham explained the scene to the Washington Post :
At some point , Newsham said , the detective approached the group of snowball fighters and had “ some kind of interaction ” with them .
He said the detective holstered a cellphone , and someone from the crowd called to report a man with a gun .
“ He was armed but never pulls his weapon , ” Newsham said of the detective .
“ I think what probably happens is somebody probably saw his gun and called the police . ”
Newsham is one of the defendants in the Chang case ( World Bank protests ) in which I am lead co-counsel ( with Daniel Schwartz of the law firm of Bryan Cave ) .
Newsham testified that he gave the order to arrest hundreds of people without probable cause or warnings in Washington .
They were later hogtied and left for as much as 19 hours .
The case has already cost the city in excess of $ 15 million in costs and damages .
However , Newsham was promoted after the incident and is now in charge of allegations of abuse by other officials .
Newsham ’s latest controversy raises the question of whether the detective told him this story and whether Newsham failed to investigate ( as in actually speaking with witnesses ) before publicly clearing the detective .
We are pressing forward for a trial with Newsham , former chief of police Charles Ramsey and other defendants , here and here .
Due to a settlement in another case , we are the only case now proceeding to trial , here .
The city , however , is trying to bar any reforms that could be ordered by the court and is accused of destroying critical pieces of evidence .
The bystanders in the most recent snowball fight can file complaints in the case , which they most certainly should do .

The Census Bureau reports :
The ... total September exports of $ 132.0 billion and imports of $ 168.4 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $ 36.5 billion , up from $ 30.8 billion in August , revised .
September exports were $ 3.7 billion more than August exports of $ 128.3 billion .
September imports were $ 9.3 billion more than August imports of $ 159.1 billion .
Click on graph for larger image .
The first graph shows the monthly U.S. exports and imports in dollars through September 2009 .
Imports and exports increased in September .
On a year - over - year basis , exports are off 13 % and imports are off 21 % .
The second graph shows the U.S. trade deficit , with and without petroleum , through September .
The blue line is the total deficit , and the black line is the petroleum deficit , and the red line is the trade deficit ex-petroleum products .
Import oil prices increased to $ 68.17 in September - up more than 50 % from the prices in February ( at $ 39.22 ) - and the seventh monthly increase in a row .
Import oil prices will probably rise further in October .
The major contributors to the increase in the trade deficit were the increase in oil prices , and more imports from China .
Also - the deficit is higher than expected , suggesting a downward revision to Q3 GDP .
A speaker at an anti-immigration rally in St. Paul , Minnesota , this past weekend got the crowd to support more than just the deportation of all illegal immigrants — he got them cheering for the eviction of all European - descended immigrants to America who “ stole this land through genocide and ethnic cleansing . ”
A crowd of some 40 people showed up to the steps of the Minnesota State Capitol on Saturday to protest proposed reform of US immigration law .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Friday that the Obama administration was pushing for immigration reform that would create a pathway for the legalization of undocumented immigrants .
ADVERTISEMENT
Napolitano said she would like to see a “ tough , fair ” plan that would allow illegal migrants to gain legal status if they pay a fine , pass a criminal background check , pay all back taxes and learn English .
That idea brought 40 anti-immigration protesters to Saturday ’s protest , as well as 30 pro-immigration reform counter - protesters , according to FightBackNews in Minneapolis .
One of those protesters , going by the alias “ Robert Erickson , ” got a speaking spot at the rally and used it to argue for the eviction of all descendants of European immigrants — in other words , that contingent of white Americans who these days see themselves as “ real ” Americans .
But some of the demonstrators did n’t seem to notice that the angry speech was targeted at them .
“ In Minneapolis where I ’m from , we have a huge immigrant population that has been causing a number of problems , ” Erickson began .
“ With the economy in recession and so many people laid off and unable to find work , immigrants should not be competing for the few jobs that are open .
It ’s just not fair to the folks who have a claim to this country and have a right to be here . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
That was met with with applause , but soon it became clear that “ Erickson ” had a different notion from the Tea - partiers as to who actually has “ a claim to this country . ”
“ Let ’s send these European immigrants back where they came from , ” he said to wild cheers .
“ We need to send every one of them back home . …
They stole this land through genocide and ethnic cleansing . ”
Even after that comment , some of the anti-immigration protesters did n’t seem to notice that “ Erickson ” was standing up for the right of Native Americans to reclaim their land from the Caucasian population — even though , as FightBackNews noted , the pro-immigration reform crowd had joined in the cheering .

“ Erickson ” walked off the stage leading the crowd in a loud chant of “ Columbus go home !
Columbus go home ! ”
Political mockery has been gaining steam as a tactic of progressive activists .
Last month , the Yes Men held a phony press conference pretending to be representatives of the US Chamber of Commerce , and tricked major media outlets into reporting that the group had relented and now supported climate change legislation .

In August , a farcical group calling itself Billionaires for WealthCare mocked opponents of health care reform with slogans such as “ “ If God loved the poor people , he would n’t let them get sick , ” and “ Healthcare rationing , that ’s our job ! ”
The following video was filmed Saturday , November 14 , 2009 , and uploaded to YouTube by FightBackNews .
We turned onto a washboard gravel road and 12 minutes later came to a small parking area , 49 road miles inside the base ’s main gate at the edge of Ridgecrest .
On this November day the thermometer read 43 degrees , but the air was still and the sun felt warm .
We shouldered our lunches and camera gear and walked out along a path made of interlocking plastic tiles laid down in recent years so that Shoshone tribal elders could reach the site without having to struggle in the soft sand .
Almost immediately we were in what is known as Little Petroglyph Canyon .
Everywhere we looked , for a mile or so down canyon , there were images pecked or scratched into the rock faces : stylized human figures in a variety of headgear , stick figures with bows and arrows , dogs or coyotes , bear paws with extra digits , all manner of abstract geometric patterns , zigzags and circles and dots , and hundreds upon hundreds of what looked like bighorn sheep , some small , some larger than life size .

Theories abound as to what the images might mean  all but the most recent , that is  or why they were put there .
Some archaeologists believe that the images are evidence of simple hunting rituals .
Mr. Whitley sees in them nothing less than the origins of human creativity and religion .
He theorizes , based on his research , that the petroglyphs are the work of generations of shamans , or medicine men , who traveled here ( from all over what is now the southwestern United States ) to fast and smoke native tobacco , to hallucinate or have visions , and to render their hallucinations on the rock .
Perhaps the goal was to make rain .
Perhaps it was to impress upon their followers a sense of the supernatural .
Either way , where some might see a dearth of material wealth and technology , Mr. Whitley sees evidence of cognitive sophistication .
“ We think of intelligence as expressed in iPods and the latest iPhone , ” he said .
But technology is often a poor substitute for knowledge : “ Drop any of us in Death Valley and unless we had an RV fully stocked with all sorts of supplies we ’d be dead in a week , ” he said .
The people who came before us , on the other hand , were adapted to this environment , so they could survive with nothing but what they could find or make , in a way that , he said , “ runs counter to our technological materialistic view , is probably more admirable , and certainly more sustainable . ”
For a time , after 9/11 , civilian visits to the petroglyphs were suspended .
“ There ’s always a risk when you let civilians into a secured area , ” Ms. Shoaf said .
But she said she felt the place was too precious for the public not to have access .
So she rewrote the protocol to show the commanding officer how it might be possible to allow tours and still protect the base ’s security .
He agreed .
More than 1,100 civilians visit the site every year , either on tours available to the public or as part of private tours with command - approved escorts arranged through Ms. Shoaf ’s office .

Last night I took my family to go see James Cameron ’s new movie Avatar .
It ’s set on a moon called Pandora in distant space .
As we saw more and more of it I found myself thinking that it was a Roger Dean painting come to life .
While I do n’t believe he had direct involvement in the movie , his influence is immediately obvious .
What ’s so strange is that I ’d already planned to do an analysis of one of his paintings before I ’d seen the movie .
So , before I go any further , here are a few links that those who have seen the movie should check out :
Floating Jungle
Arches
Floating Islands
Sea of Light
And , of course , the subject of this week ’s analysis : Tales From Topographic Oceans .
“ Tales ” was the front and back cover art for Yes ’ album Tales From Topographic Oceans .
Since the album cover opened out , Dean faced an interesting problem .
The right half of the painting is all that would be visible to most customers in a record store , so that had to work as an image all on its own .
But , since it wrapped around to the back side the entire thing had to work as a coherent image as well .
Basically , he had to construct two halves that add to a greater sum that the parts .
To solve this problem Dean came up with a picture that has one focus when you ’re seeing the right half and a different focus when you see the whole thing .
In addition to all of that , band members and others suggested different objects to include in the cover art .
From the book Views :
The final collection of landmarks was more complex than he had intended because it seemed appropriate to the nature of the project that everyone who wanted to contribute should do so .
The landscape comprised amongst other things , some famous English rocks taken from Dominy Hamilton ’s postcard collection .
These are , specifically : Brimham Rocks , the last rocks at Lands End , the Logan rock at Treen and single stones from Avebury and Stonehenge .
Jon Anderson wanted the Mayan temple at Chichen Itza with the sun behind it , and Alan White suggested using markings from the plains of Nazca .
The result is a somewhat incongruous mixture , but effective nonetheless .
The Concept
Let ’s start with the title .
I ’ve been a Yes fan since the middle ’ 80’s , and I ’ll be the first to admit that their lyrics are cryptic at best .
I mean , how could the line , “ Shining flying purple wolfhounds show me where you are ” not be chemically inspired ?
So I do n’t tend to look for a whole lot of meaning in the phrases .
As weird as they are , though , they offer striking images and a title like “ Tales from Topographic Oceans ” gives an illustrator lots of room to play .
Let ’s look at the right half of the picture .
Right .
Oceans , eh ?
It ’s hard to get much further removed from an ocean than a desert scene .
Right off the bat we ’re given this puzzle .
We decide that it ’s not an ocean after all .
So then , let ’s look at the left side .
Well , this seems to be an underwater scene what with the fish and all .
Kind of weird that we can see stars in the sky , and that branch would n’t normally be underwater , but because of the fish we initially read the scene as being underwater .
Only when we open up the record cover to see the full image do we get that same kind of mental rearrangement Magritte was so fond of .
Now , I have n’t studied a lot about Topology , but I know enough about it to understand the spatial paradoxes it presents .
Dean did n’t use a literal topographic trick in the artwork , but he certainly delivered that same sense of the space warp .
The Right
Now that we ’ve looked at the halves , let ’s focus in on the right half .
It ’s the most critical part since its job is to catch the casual record browser ’s eye .
The focus here is the pyramid in the background .
We can tell because Dean leads our eye to it with the rock formations and even some of the stars .
He ’s also put the pyramid at the intersection of two of the golden section lines .
There ’s a fairly high contrast between the moon and the pyramid ’s edge .
The Whole
When we look at the whole thing , the focus shifts to the rock formation in general and the waterfall in particular .
( A waterfall with no source and no outlet . )
We see some of the same lines from before guiding the eye again .
Others are new , though , such as the stars on the right side of the sky and the fish .
The waterfall itself is close to the right vertical section line but not quite on it .
If Dean was using the golden sections deliberately , he probably did n’t want to crowd the pyramid on the right half since that is the most important part of the picture .
Let ’s digress for a second .
That question of “ if ” comes up regularly .
We can note that certain things line up with the golden section , but did the artist do that deliberately or did it come from an innate sense of design ?
It depends on the picture and artist of course , but regardless of whether it ’s intentional or not I wholeheartedly agree with Dean when he says he “ would like technique to be invisible . ”
If the first thing a viewer thinks when looking at an illustration is “ Wow , nice use of the golden section ” then the artist has probably failed .
All of the techniques I cover in these analyses should generally be transparent .
Why spend so much time on them then ?
Personally , I think it ’s like learning to execute a good forehand in racquetball ( my own personal frame of reference ) .
Before muscle memory sets in you have to pay attention to lots of details – angle of the racket , speed of the ball , force of the swing , balance of the body , etc .
Eventually , though , it all merges together into a single thing – a forehand swing .
After that it can be instinctive .
Until then , though , you ’ve got to pay attention and try controlling the different parts on purpose .
The “ different parts ” in the context of art are all the techniques at our disposal to create an experience in the viewer ’s head .
The Style
What is it about a Roger Dean painting that makes it so instantly identifiable ?
He ’s got a unique , distinct style that ’s sharpened over the years but is definitely his .
Choice of subject is one part of it – beautiful and surreal landscapes dominate his work .
Even when animals and people appear in the paintings , it ’s the landscape that seems the most realistic .
For example , in Blue Desert look how Dean uses light and value to give mass to the rock formations .
Then look at the eagle in the foreground – it ’s quite flat by comparison and clearly not the focus of the picture .
Let ’s look at a few details from Tales to get an idea of how Dean renders his pictures .
Here are the fish .
Their scales are just suggested and in places just loose scribbles .
The shape and anatomy is realistic , and the lighting gives them form and depth .
Dean uses moderately saturated greens and yellows with highly saturated reds serving as accents .
We ’ve got a mixture of accurate form and anatomy with punched up colors .
When it comes to the rocks , Dean does n’t render every last detail .
He uses color and value to give us the general shape of the rock and then uses a few lines and textures to get us to fill in the rest .
Dean does the same thing with the water and foliage .
The shapes and forms are realistic , but he does n’t render every last detail .
Here is the pyramid , which is the focus of the right half of the image .
It ’s in the background , so the colors are less saturated and Dean has dropped the linework .
He communicates space effectively by using these techniques , plus having other objects clearly in the foreground and midground .
Again with the pyramid , it ’s basic shapes and colors to define the mass , and relatively few rendered details .
Finally here ’s a detail of a rock in the lower left part of the picture .
You can get a good look at how Dean uses linework not just for outlines but also for texture .
And the cool fossil is just fun .
The Elements
To wrap up we ’ll go through Lee Moyer ’s Elements of a Successful Illustration .
Focus :
Dean gives us a dual focus depending on whether we ’re looking at the front cover only ( the right half ) or the full image .
The left half of the image is less clearly defined , but I ’d say the focus is on the fish due to their saturated red accents .
Composition and Design : Dean guides our eye to the pyramid in the right half and to the waterfall in the full version .
When viewing only the right half , the rock formation with the waterfall acts as a frame for the pyramid .
Palette :
This painting is quite saturated overall .
I have a theory that illustrations from the ’ 70 ’s were more saturated overall , but I ’ll need to check that out .
Also , if you ’re a Yes geek like I am you may notice that the horizon itself uses a green gradient similar to Yes ’ previous album , Close To The Edge .
Value :
The sky is dark and the foreground generally bright .
Values define the rock formations and the fish , giving them solidity and mass .
Mass : Dean gives us a mixture of flat and more three dimensional objects .
The pyramid , for example , is quite flat since it ’s in the distance , and it ’s less saturated .
Texture : Views does n’t comment on the specific techniques Dean used for this painting , but he often used a variety of media to get his effects .
Some of the linework looks like it could be ink , there are some watercolor textures , and what is likely layers of airbrush .
Each adds its own kind of texture .
Symbolism : Dean supports the notion of a topographic ocean by placing stones , pyramids , and plains markings that would n’t normally be seen together in a single image .
Couple that with fish seemingly swimming through mid-air and we have a surreal mix that fits the albums name nicely .
As for what a topographic ocean symbolizes … I ’ve no clue .
Micro / Macro : Looking at the details above , I note that Dean is pretty conservative with his rendering of detail in the objects of focus .
The lines , when present , serve more as outline and texture than detailed rendering .
The fossil , though , has plenty of detail , though the lines he uses to execute it do n’t contrast sharply with the rock surface so it does n’t distract us .
Ornament :
The band ’s logo and the album title do n’t appear in this version , and they certainly count .
I also consider the simplified stars to be ornament as well .
Narrative : Dean ’s focus on landscapes means that narrative usually takes a back seat in his illustrations .
His pictures for Yes ’ earlier albums Fragile , Close to the Edge , and Yessongs did use a narrative thread , but it ’s not carried over to this album .
Juxtaposition :
The two halves of the picture read fairly normally on their own , but together they reveal a new level that makes us do a double - take .
There ’s also the juxtaposition of the stones , markings , and pyramid to reinforce the theme of a folding of space .
Stylization : Dean has his own unique style that focuses on landscapes , saturated palettes , and unusual logic .
It ’s common to see little paradoxes like the waterfall with no source and no outlet .
One of my favorite paintings of his is the cover for The Steve Howe Album .
At first you think that you ’re looking at a pond that reflects the rocks around it until you notice that the reflections do n’t match the rocks above .
Only then do you realize that the island is floating and that we ’re looking through the pond to the sky below .
Character : Character is n’t a strong element of the painting .
At least , not in the sense of presenting a sentient character .
Tension :
The tension here is mostly perceptual .
It ’s a tension of logic , not plot .
Line : Dean uses lines for outline and for texture .
The fish and fossil show him using it to add detail as well .
Research / Reference :
See the description at the beginning for the various things Dean included in the image .
He used postcards for many of the rock formations , and I imagine that he also used reference for the fish and the fossils .
Vignette :
There ’s a clear separation of planes of depth , but there ’s not a central figure in the illustration that I ’d call a classic vignette .
Perspective :
The sense of depth and space comes from those planes of depth and some atmospheric perspective .
That ’s it for this time .
I ’ll be taking next week off for Christmas related traveling , so I ’ll begin the new year with a look at Gabriel Rodríguez ’ cover for the comic Locke & Key .

SALT LAKE CITY --
One by one , at least six train cars went off a track and crashed into each other in Salt Lake City Thursday morning .
Union Pacific officials did not say what caused the cars to derail , but said the cars were empty and no one was hurt .
" You can see our crews are actively on the ground right now trying to get this track up and running as soon as we possibly can , " said Dan Harbeke , Union Pacific 's director of public affairs .
The derailment happened around 6:30 a.m. at a railroad crossing located near 1700 South and 500 West .
The Union Pacific train was headed south carrying several empty auto racks , likely out of the Union Pacific roper yard located at 2100 South and 900 West .
" This train in particular was not on our main line , it was on a side track , likely engaged in switching operations in what we call a manifest train , " said Harbeke .
" That 's a train made up of empties , or typically in this case , empties and having a variety of different commodities . "
Harbeke said they were investigating what caused the cars to derail .
He said Union Pacific maintenance managers scan the track several times a week looking for irregularities , and nothing had been reported .
He said the train has a track image recorder on it , which should help them figure out what happened .
" Over 90 percent of our locomotives have what we call a track image recorder , so we can see visually what happened , " said Harbeke .
" We will look and see the signals , we 'll talk to our dispatchers back at our Herriman dispatching center to really bring all the pieces together to determine what was the cause and then how fast we can get this back up and running . "
When the train cars derailed , wheels and other debris came off the cars -- prompting Salt Lake City police to shut down 1700 South at 500 West .
The train cars also ripped up some of road in the crossing , but overall Harbeke said the damage looked a lot worse than it really was .
Several employees who work in the building next to the tracks where the cars ended up told KSL the crash was so loud they thought something had exploded .
They also said when they saw the cars coming off the track they started to run .
They said it looked like something from a movie .

It is the time of day you light up which seems important Smokers who light up on waking display higher levels of nicotine than those who wait , regardless of the number of cigarettes smoked , US research shows .
Scientists measured smokers ' levels of cotinine , a by - product of nicotine which has been shown to reflect the risk of developing lung cancer .
Waiting until you had eaten breakfast reduced the amount of this chemical .
The Penn State College of Medicine study suggests the earlier smokers may need more help to give up .
The reasons for the differing levels were unclear , but are thought likely to reflect a more intense way of smoking among those who light up first thing - as their need may be greater than those who can wait .
More than 250 healthy people who smoked every day were included in the study , which was published in Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers and Prevention .
Waking desire Among smokers who consumed 20 cigarettes each day , cotinine levels varied dramatically - with the top levels nearly 75 times higher than the lowest levels .
Not all smokers are the same and approaches to smoking reduction may need to account for individual smoking behaviours such as the intensity and frequency of puffing , cravings , and physiological symptoms
Joshua Muscat
Report author
The highest levels were seen among those who lit up within 30 minutes of waking - categorised as high dependency .
" These people may require a more intensive intervention than other smokers to help them quit smoking on a sustained or permanent basis , " said report author Joshua Muscat , professor of public health at Penn State College of Medicine .
" Not all smokers are the same and approaches to smoking reduction may need to account for individual smoking behaviours such as the intensity and frequency of puffing , cravings , and physiological symptoms . "
A spokesperson for the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation welcomed the research , which it said would help further understanding of smoking habits and addiction to tobacco .
" It is however a small study ( 252 participants ) , and therefore the findings should be taken with caution , and we are not entirely sure that any major conclusions on the future of smoking cessation can be made from this .
" We concur with the authors that more research is needed in this area . "

Seeing the See Clearly Method for What It Is
Scammers become more and more technologically advanced with each passing day , or so it seems .
Starting today , in fact , the Federal Trade Commission is holding a series of public hearings on " Protecting Consumers in the Next Tech Age . "
It 's billed as a glimpse into the not - too - distant future , with panels devoted to how changes in products , marketing , and data security are likely to affect consumers .
No matter how sophisticated we become as consumers , however , some scams survive all manner of technological change and find new victims generation after generation .
A case in point : eye exercises to help correct impaired vision .
Eight - six years after this scam first surfaced , a judge in Iowa last week put the kibosh on the " See Clearly Method , " promoted in national ads claiming it could save four eyes like myself from having to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses .
The court ordered Vision Improvement Technologies Inc. to stop all sales of " natural vision improvement kits " sold as the " See Clearly Method " as of Nov. 1 , and to cease business altogether by Dec. 22 .
The Fairfield , Iowa , company , which shipped as many as 10,000 kits a month , at a cost to consumers of $ 350 a piece , was also required to pay $ 200,000 in restitution .
The kits consisted of manuals , charts , video and audiotapes describing eye exercises .
The ads featured testimonials by consumers who claimed to be success stories .
However , Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller discovered that VIT kept airing the ads after those very same customers had given up on the See Clearly Method and gone back to wearing corrective lens .
Miller filed a lawsuit against VIT in August 2005 , which led to last week 's court action .
In addition to exaggerated claims of effectiveness , VIT stuck consumers with kits by offering them a " risk - free " 30 - day trial period that turned out to be not so risk - free .
Consumers who realized their folly and tried to return the kits were n't able to and ended up paying hundreds of dollars .
The See Clearly Method is just the latest incarnation of a scam pioneered in the early 20th century by William Horatio Bates , an M.D. who , in 1920 , published The Cure of Imperfect Eyesight by Treatment Without Glasses .
According to quackwatch.org , Bates a few years earlier had partnered with Bernarr Macfadden , " a well known food faddist , " to offer a course in the Bates System of Eye Exercises , which included shifting one 's gaze from one object to another .
But Bates ' real legacy was his book , which fueled imitators who recommended people " throw away " their glasses .
Vision problems such as near sightedness , Bates claimed , were caused by eye strain and could be fixed by relaxing the eyes .
Eyeglasses were not only a crutch but also made people 's vision worse .
Bates ' method , he claimed , could cure farsightedness , astigmatism , and even cataracts and glaucoma .
The Federal Trade Commission , founded in 1914 , filed a complaint against Bates in 1929 for false and misleading advertising .

The comments to this entry are closed .
His office has also opened 65 cases to investigate potential fraud in various bailout programs .
“ When I first took office , I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’d be having a sit - down and warning about potential fraud in the program and I would hear a response basically saying , ‘ Oh , they ’re bankers , and they would n’t put their reputations at risk by committing fraud , ’ ” Mr. Barofsky told Bloomberg News a little over a week ago , adding : “ I think we ’ve done a good job of instilling a greater degree of skepticism that what comes from Wall Street is n’t necessarily the holy grail . ”
Mr. Barofsky says the Fed failed to strong - arm the banks when it was negotiating payouts on the A.I.G. contracts .
Rather than forcing the banks to accept a steep discount , or “ haircut , ” the Fed gave the banks $ 27 billion in taxpayer cash and allowed them to keep an additional $ 35 billion in collateral already posted by A.I.G .
That amounted to about $ 62 billion for the contracts , which the report describes as “ far above their market value at the time . ”
Mr. Geithner , who oversaw those negotiations , said in an interview on Friday that the terms of the A.I.G. deal were the best he could get for taxpayers .
He considered bailing out A.I.G. to be “ offensive , ’ he said , but deemed it necessary because a collapse would have undermined the financial system .
“ We prevented A.I.G. from defaulting because our judgment was that the damage caused by failure would have been much more costly for the economy and the taxpayer , ” Mr. Geithner said .
“ To most Americans , this looked like a deeply unfair outcome and they find it hard to see any direct benefit .
But in fact , their savings are more valuable and secure today . ”
The report said that while bailing out Goldman and other investment banks might not have been the intent behind the Fed ’s A.I.G. rescue , it certainly was its effect .
“ By providing A.I.G. with the capital to make these payments , Federal Reserve officials provided A.I.G.’s counterparties with tens of billions of dollars they likely would have not otherwise received had A.I.G. gone into bankruptcy , ” the report stated .
As Goldman prepares to pay out nearly $ 17 billion in bonuses to its employees in one of its most profitable years ever , it is important that an authoritative , independent voice like Mr. Barofsky ’s reminds us how the taxpayer bailout of A.I.G. benefited Goldman .
A Goldman spokesman , Lucas van Praag , said that Goldman believed “ that a collapse of A.I.G. would have had a very disruptive effect on the financial system and that everyone benefited from the rescue of A.I.G. ”
Regarding his firm ’s own dealings with A.I.G. , Mr. van Praag said that Goldman believed that its “ exposure was close to zero ” because it insulated itself from a downturn in A.I.G. ’s fortunes through hedges and collateral it had already received .
( Goldman ’s complete response is here . )
Two stars of a British celebrity reality TV show filmed in Australia have been charged with animal cruelty by New South Wales police .
Celebrity chef Gino D'Acampo , who won the I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here TV contest , and soap star Stuart Manning were arrested and charged after cooking a rat and serving it with rice as a meal for fellow contestants .
D'Acampo , 33 , and Manning , 30 , were confronted by RSPCA officers after filming ended late last week on the TV show 's set near Dungay in north - eastern NSW .
The News Of The World newspaper and the BBC say that the pair were charged with animal cruelty offences by Murwillumbah police .
They have been ordered to appear in court on February 3 .
If found guilty , the pair face up to three years in jail .
The ITV network , which broadcasts the reality TV show in Britain , could also face charges .

The Wall Street Journal 's cowardly liar and " voter fraud " fraudster John Fund appears to be running out of fresh " voter fraud " lies to feed to Fox " News " viewers .
According to Media Matters today , in advance of tomorrow 's gubernatorial election in New Jersey , expected to be a very close race , Fund appeared on Fox 's Glenn Beck show and related an anecdote of supposed fraud now going on in the Hispanic community in Camden .
" People are going door to door in parts of Camden with Hispanics that do n't have very much knowledge of English , and they 're saying , ' We have a new way for you to vote , la nueva forma de votar ; just fill out these papers . ' "
Trouble is , the incident that Fund claims is going on right now actually happened in Philadelphia 16 years ago , as even Fund himself admitted in his own WSJ column published just hours before his appearance on Fox today ...
In one infamous case , a key 1993 race that determined which party would control the Pennsylvania state senate was thrown out by a federal judge after massive evidence that hundreds of voters had been pressured into casting improper absentee ballots .
Voters were told by " bearers " that it was all part of " la nueva forma de votar " --- the new way to vote .
The rest of his column , as usual , goes on to offer various anecdotal reports of various forms of fraud , sometimes real , sometimes imagined , from throughout the years , and raises the specter of " Groups associated with Acorn in neighboring Pennsylvania and New York [ who ] appear to have moved into the state . "
The usual John Fund / wingnut / Fox " News " fare we now hear predictably every time there is an expected close race in any state .
To be clear , " voter fraud " does exist , usually via absentee ballot fraud , though fraud at the polling place --- the type Republicans claim is rampant in order to further their push for disenfranchising polling place Photo ID restrictions that adversely affect the right to vote of millions of largely - Democratic leaning minorities , elderly , and students --- is extremely rare .
The far more menacing threat to elections is the ability for a single insider to tamper electronically with results on election tabulators , and / or old - school voter disenfranchisement by selectively keeping as many voters from the polls as possible , and tossing out as many absentee ballots as possible on usually rather flimsy grounds .
Even out - and - out voting machine failure , particularly in New Jersey , can result in massive disenfranchisement , as in 2008 when Gov. John Corzine himself --- up for re-election tomorrow --- was kept from voting for 45 minutes as the wholly unverifiable touch - screen voting machines used in the state , made by Sequoia Voting Systems , failed to boot up at all at the start of polling on Super Tuesday in Hoboken .
At this point , however , it 's become de rigueur for the wingnuts --- and Fund is usually their point man on this --- to seed the airwaves with all sorts of muddied doubt and shadowy ACORN straw - men nonsense in advance of close elections , to be used , as needed , to rile up the easily confused Fox " News " tea bag crowd after the election , should the race be close and their favored candidate comes up short .
I 'd expect nothing less of them , and Fund will no doubt be making the rounds on Fox tomorrow to pitch the same bag of bullshit all day .
For the record , when Fund 's feet are actually held to the fire by anybody who knows his game , his allegations --- almost always of Democratic " voter fraud " --- fail to hold up .
In the month prior to the 2008 Presidential election he was a guest , along with me , on Peter B. Collins ' syndicated live radio show .
After both PBC and myself offered tough questions to Fund , some 15 minutes into the hour - long show , he simply hung up rather than answering them , as I reported at the time .
The audio of that 10/3/08 broadcast , ( 40 minutes with commercials removed , though Fund is gone in the first 15 ) may be downloaded here [ MP3 ] , or you can listen to it below ...
Two weeks later , both Fund and I were guests on Fox " News " wherein I was delighted to offer a " Fox News Alert " concerning the arrest of the head of the CA GOP 's voter registration firm on charges of fraud and perjury ( earlier this summer Young Political Major 's Mark Anthony Jacoby pleaded guilty ) , amidst all the phony sturm and drang that Fox and Fund had been on about in regard to ACORN .
Fund did not hold up particularly well .
Here 's that video once again ...

Interesting TRUTH
Prime - Minister Berlusconi in Italy , Consul Nuica in Moldova : is sex a good political tool ?
Added by ArmanGhertu on Aug 01 , 2009 | Visited by 5101 | Voted by 29 persons
If you expect me to uncover the Truth in this review , you wo n’t get it , as the scope of placing this topic is slightly different .
For centuries adulteries have been a common practice among people , and if one thinks this happens only with men , he would be surprised to know that women are not less prone to cheating and , according to some estimates , about 20 - 25 % of fathers are raising not their own children .
Emperors , kings , other royal persons , presidents , member of parliaments , and many other politicians from time to time fall into the trap of either a short affair or a longer love adventure .
Sometimes it is just about pure sexual attraction , sometimes it is caused by boredom in life , often it is caused by routine and disappeared attraction in the family - you know the stuff .
Love is Life and , according to Freud , is a most potent driver on Earth - God has created us like that .
However , God also commanded us not to cheat .
That is why humanity for ages is still arguing about the morality of not being faithful .
It is not my goal to plunge into this endless story - in the end , the God will judge everyone for his sins .
My thoughts are about something else : is it moral and is it really helpful to use sex in politics ?
What is ultimately the effect of disclosing Berlusconi ’s personal love affairs , especially if he is getting divorced ?
Who benefited in the long run from filming the sexual intercourse of the Romanian Consul in Moldova with a Moldovan employee ( a colleague , later nicknamed Moldovan Mata - Hari ) , and exposing this on Internet ?
If a politician is doing well and he is a good leader and people support him , I guess only the God has the right to judge him for his own love affairs , and not the public ( obviously if it is not something against the law like pedophilia , etc. ) .
If a responsible government employee is doing well his job and not disclosing any state secrets , why setting up and leaking such intimate information ?
In most cases there is no true effect , but it definitely leads to personal reputation damaged for life , destroyed families , ashamed kids .
Is this more moral than just one man ’s short love affair ?!
I am placing this topic mostly for the sake of a linked poll , which I hope will show people ’s attitude to such matters .
His response to the substitute teacher who demanded Will recite the pledge :
Though the substitute tried to make him stand up , he respectfully refused .
He did it again the next day , and the next day .
Each day , the substitute got a little more cross with him .
On Thursday , it finally came to a head .
The teacher , Will said , told him that she knew his mother and grandmother , and they would want him to stand and say the pledge .
" She got a lot more angry and raised her voice and brought my mom and my grandma up , " Will said .
" I was fuming and was too furious to really pay attention to what she was saying .
After a few minutes , I said , ‘ With all due respect , ma'am , you can go jump off a bridge . ' "
Will was sent to the office , where he was given an assignment to look up information about the flag and what it represents .
How do his classmates show respect for the American ideal of free speech ?
Given that his protest is over the rights of gays and lesbians , the taunts have taken a predictable bent .
" In the lunchroom and in the hallway , they 've been making comments and doing pranks , and calling me gay , " he said .
" It 's always the same people , walking up and calling me a gaywad . "
That 's the reactionary right , calling those who stand up for real freedom a slur .
Wonder where those kids learned that ?
Will actually has an understanding of America that we could reasonably say 50 % of his fellow citizens will never grasp .
He does n't sound like he needs it , but Will and his family have my full support and gratitude for standing in the face of fire .

I spent two days working on a comic that I ended up not liking .
Maybe I will fix it later and post it sometime , it happens !
Expect another update soon .
But for now , not wanting to wait any more days to update , I just made a comic about frustration .
Poor little self , I do n't always treat her well !
And I felt so bad about the broken telescope , I kept it until I was in university .

Linux owns 32 percent of netbook market , says study Nov. 05 , 2009
ABI Research is projecting that in 2009 Linux will represent 32 percent of netbook sales , far higher than the seven percent figure claimed by Microsoft , says a report .
ABI estimates that Linux will overtake Windows on netbooks by 2013 , largely due to sales in less - developed countries .
In its most recent report based on its UMDs ( Ultra- mobile Devices ) study , which covers netbooks , MIDs , and UMPCs , ABI Research says that almost 35 million netbooks will be shipped by manufacturers in 2009 .
ABI did not publicly break out sales by specific segment or operating system , but a ComputerWorld story by Eric Lai quotes ABI analyst Jeff Orr as saying that the study shows that 32 percent ( about 11 million netbooks ) of this year 's netbook shipments will be used with a Linux - based operating system .
Since Apple has yet to release a netbook , the remaining 68 percent belongs to Microsoft Windows , projects ABI .
As Lai points out , despite the two to one edge for Windows , this is a far cry from the 96 percent advantage Microsoft claimed to have enjoyed in April .
Microsoft has now updated its projection by telling Lai that " over 93 percent of worldwide small notebook PCs run Windows today . "
This would suggest that even Microsoft agrees that Linux netbook sales have rebounded , at least slightly .

According to the story , Orr says that while Windows enjoys a higher percentage of U.S. sales , the picture is different overseas .
" Just because you live in the United States , do n't assume that everything is on Windows , " Orr was quoted as saying .
Non-U.S. consumers have less experience with Windows , and therefore do n't have to overcome the fear of switching to something new , Orr was said to have told Lai .
According to ABI , the largest share of netbook sales belongs to the Asia - Pacific region , including Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .
Beyond that ,
Orr did not mention other Linux netbook trends except to say that " Ubuntu is a popular choice on netbooks . "
He did tell Lai , however , that going forward Moblin , Android , and Google 's Chrome OS will also lead the way on Linux netbook distributions .
Although
Orr does n't note where these distros stack up for 2009 , Android and Moblin are only just now appearing on netbooks , with Moblin being repackaged and combined with desktop brands like Ubuntu and OpenSUSE , so they are not likely to rate more than a blip in the 2009 numbers .
Chrome OS , meanwhile , is not due out until next year .
Orr was also said to have predicted that increasing sales of ARM - based netbooks will continue to push up Linux netbook share , especially in less developed countries where overall netbook growth will increase at the highest rate .
As a result , ABI projects that Linux will overtake Windows on netbooks by 2013 .
To address the ARM challenge , Orr told Lai that Microsoft should do what it did with Windows XP on netbooks , and slash prices on its ARM - ready Windows CE or Windows Mobile .
Further publicly revealed findings in ABI 's UMD study include the projection that UMDs , including netbooks , MIDs , and UMPCs , will top 124 million systems shipped in 2011 .
Meanwhile , the separate " mobile consumer electronics " category , which includes personal navigation devices ( PNDs ) and eBook readers .
is expected to move from two million device shipments this year to 50 million in 2014 .
As for netbooks , the research firm noted that while in 2008 , 74 percent of netbook shipments came from Acer , Asus , and Samsung , the 2009 market is far more diverse .
Major PC vendors selling Linux - ready netbooks include Dell and HP , which offers models such as the Linux - ready HP Mini 110 , pictured above , at left .
Revisiting the Linux netbook question
The lack of reliable figures on OS share has led to considerable speculation about the respective netbook shares of Windows XP vs. Linux , where the former appears to have dominated over the last year after a fast 2008 start by Linux .
Signs of trouble in the Linux netbook world emerged last fall after a promising start in which some analysts figured that Linux had captured as much as 30 percent of the market , compared to one percent in the desktop market in general .
Much of the growth came with the groundbreaking Asus Eee PC ( pictured below , at right ) and subsequent Acer Aspire .
An MSI executive then claimed that returns of its Linux - based MSI Wind netbooks were more than four times higher than those of Windows XP netbooks .
In early April , a Microsoft executive announced that an NPD Retail Tracking Service study showed that Microsoft owned 96 percent of the netbook market , and he agreed with MSI Wind that Linux netbook returns were four times higher than with Windows .
A Canonical ( Ubuntu ) executive disputed the MSI and Microsoft claims , while others noted that the NPD story only looked at brick - and - mortar retail instead of online sales , and did not cover international sales .
Yet , a study by Ovum did indeed suggest a slippage in Linux netbook market share .
Ovum did not publicly report percentages , but said that the Linux netbook share had dropped considerably in late 2008 and early 2009 .
Many believe the major cause for the gap has been Microsoft dropping the price of Windows XP and applying other channel and vendor pressures .
This summer , the issue resurfaced when Microsoft 's COO Kevin Turner gave a speech claiming that Linux netbook returns were four or five times higher than with Windows .
In August , a Dell executive reportedly answered this by saying that his company 's Linux netbook returns were roughly equivalent to those for Windows - based netbooks .
Lenovo gung - ho on Windows 7 netbooks
While some may question ABI 's 32 percent claim , others believe that Windows 7 will halt any possible swing back to Linux on netbooks .
An EETimes story by Rick Merritt quotes Howard Locker , director of new technology for Lenovo , as saying that Windows 7 will make it less likely that notebook makers will adopt Linux - based netbooks .
Locker was quoted as saying , " Our S9 and S10 model netbooks had Linux loads , but they did n't do well so we stopped selling them . "
Here , Locker was referring to systems launched in October 2008 for the education market , according to the story .
Since then it's been pretty much all Windows on Lenovo netbooks , however .
One problem that Lenovo 's customers have had with Linux is its lack of support for Apple 's iTunes , Locker was said to have noted .
Meanwhile , Windows 7 improvements such as a claimed ten second boot time and one second resume , will fend off Linux - based alternatives , Locker told Merritt .
Other touted Windows 7 features include a better suspend mode , lower power consumption , and UI enhancements like multi- touch support .
Despite its upbeat take on Windows 7 , the notebook giant is evaluating alternatives , including Google 's Linux - based Chrome OS , Locker was said to have noted , although he added , " It 's too early to tell because they do n't even have alpha code to test . "
Locker also had some interesting things to say about wireless technologies , calling ultra-wideband ( UWB ) " a DOA dead technology , " and predicting that Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) 4G networks would someday supplant WiFi .

The Galactic CushionThe Hubble Space Telescope recently beamed back pictures of 29 dwarf galaxies in the Perseus Cluster that , by all appearances , should have been torn to shreds by the gravitational tidal forces of their giant neighbors .
Instead , like islands of calm in a stormy sea , the little galaxies remain stable and intact .
A team of European astronomers says the secret to their cohesion is a cushion of dark matter that protects them from the gravitational tug - of - war outside .
Dark matter , believed to be particularly abundant in dwarf galaxies like these , counteracts the pull of the nearby giants , leaving the smaller galaxies in peace .
Hubble ’s findings mark the next step in a major research effort aimed at understanding some of the strangest stuff in the cosmos .
Dark matter neither emits nor reflects light and cannot be observed directly , posing a challenge for scientists .
Although dark matter is thought to be five times as abundant as “ normal ” matter , finding enough to study has proven difficult .
Despite more than 75 years of research , the nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest open questions in astronomy .
Cosmologists believe dark matter interacts with regular matter — familiar protons , neutrons , and other particles — only through gravity .
If dark matter hobnobs with normal matter through other forces , science has so far failed to turn up any evidence of it .
All the data are indirect , therefore : Astronomers can see how this invisible material pulls and twists galaxies , but they cannot explain its workings .
Its Own OppositeWhile some researchers parse the motions of galaxies in their search for dark matter , others are hunting for evidence in the form of telltale particles .
In April , an international team using a satellite - borne detector called PAMELA ( Payload for Antimatter Exploration and Light - nuclei Astrophysics ) found a glut of high - energy particles called positrons , which may be a product of dark matter .
According to one theory , dark matter particles are their own antiparticles — meaning that , if one smashes into another , both are obliterated .
These high - energy collisions should produce electrons and positrons , which may be the source of the positron abundance turned up by PAMELA .
An Ether - Like WindPhysicist Jocelyn Monroe at MIT is working on a detector designed to measure the dark matter “ wind . ”
As Earth moves around the sun and the sun moves around the galactic center , our planet passes through dark matter .
The motion , Monroe explains , should create a detectable breeze of dark matter particles , like holding your hand out of a moving car .
Fins on a RocketAt the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , astronomer Warren Brown employs yet another tactic in the hunt for this invisible target .
“ There are interesting observations to be done with the objects you can see , ” Brown says .
For the last few years , he has studied a gaggle of extremely fast - moving stars , stellar runaways that were long ago flung out of the Milky Way by the massive black hole at its center .
Brown says that the movements of these stars could reveal the shape of the dark matter halo around our galaxy .
The stars started in the center and passed through much of the Milky Way ’s dark matter as they moved outward — which means their paths were shaped by the dark stuff ’s gravitational pull .
By tracing the stars ’ trajectories backward , Brown ’s team hopes to understand our galaxy ’s gravitational profile .
Meanwhile , particle physicists are building experiments designed to find the elusive particle or particles of dark matter right here on Earth .
Though such particles might be ubiquitous , the effort to find them faces an uphill battle .
“ Billions of them may go through your head every second , ” says astrophysicist Ed Shaya at the University of Maryland , adding , “ The question is , what is the particle , and where does it fit in our models ? ”
Mining for Dark Matter , Seeing
It in Crystals , and Actually Producing the StuffCurrently , the strongest candidates to be dark matter particles are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles , or WIMPs .
In abandoned mines in Minnesota and Ontario , researchers have built WIMP detectors designed to pick up the weak response when a dark particle strikes an ordinary atom .
In Italy , the DAMA / LIBRA experiment , designed to detect dark matter particles hitting atomic nuclei in large crystals , recently picked up strong signals that may be the first blip of dark matter , but the results have yet to be verified .
The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) near Geneva , Switzerland , aims to re-create conditions of the early universe when it comes back online later this year .
If dark matter was born right after the big bang , it may resurface in the LHC — and physicists might get a glimpse .
Scientists have struggled to investigate dark matter since 1933 , when astronomer Fritz Zwicky observed a cluster of galaxies moving so fast that , like Hubble ’s dwarves , they should have been ripping apart .
He surmised that invisible matter must be holding them together .
In 1980 , astronomers Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford found that stars account for just one - tenth of the mass required to hold a galaxy together ; if not for dark matter , galaxies would not exist .
But even today , we have only indirect traces of its presence .
Doubting Dark Matter
It may turn out that the hunt for dark matter is a wild goose chase .
A few scientists are exploring alternative theories such as TeVeS that try to explain gravitational puzzles without invoking dark matter at all .
Even Brown , who aims to map dark matter in our own galaxy , has doubts .
“ Is it really there ?
We certainly see evidence of something that cannot be explained by our understanding of gravity , ” he says , “ but the more time goes on , the more I worry that we have the wrong theory . ”

In 1999 , my research group published a study that examined whether there are seasonable variations in cardiac mortality in a location where winter weather is mild — Los Angeles County , Calif .
1
During a 12 - year period , there were consistently more deaths from ischemic heart disease during the winter than there were during the summer .
About one third more deaths from ischemic heart disease were recorded in December and January than from June through September in Los Angeles County .
We initially thought that this phenomenon might be explained by colder temperatures .
Colder temperatures have been associated with an increase in vascular resistance , coronary vasospasm , blood pressure , and hemostasis , as reviewed by Spencer et al.2 Temperatures in Los Angeles during the winter , although colder than they are during the summer , are still mild as compared with other climates .
When we plotted daily rates of death from ischemic heart disease in Los Angeles County during November , December , and January , we were struck by an increase in deaths starting around Thanksgiving , climbing through Christmas , peaking on New Year ’s Day , and then falling , whereas daily minimum temperatures remained relatively flat during December and January .
We postulated that this peak in cardiac deaths during the holidays might result from other factors , including the emotional stress of the holidays , overindulgence during the holiday season , or both .
1
See p 3781
The study by Phillips and coworkers3 in this issue of Circulation is an important contribution that extends our initial observation of an increase in cardiac deaths during the holiday season .
They have done this by widening the investigation to the entire United States , extending the number of years examined , and examining both cardiac and noncardiac causes of death .
Their analysis not only confirms our observation of an increase in cardiac deaths during the holiday season , 1 but they also describe 2 discrete peaks in cardiac death — one for Christmas and one for New Year ’s .3
They observed this holiday peak nationwide , and it seems to be worsening , especially in the last several years studied .
Interestingly , the phenomenon is slightly less pronounced in northern compared with southern border states .
Perhaps residents of northern states become better acclimated to stress in a colder climate .
Both Phillips ’ group3 and our group proposed a number of mechanisms for the observation of the increase in cardiac deaths during the holiday season .
1,4 Some proposed mechanisms are listed in the Table .
Although Phillips et al have dismissed several of them , 2 the exact mechanisms remain to be determined .
I believe that changes in diet and alcohol consumption should still be considered a potential mechanism in that it could explain some of the observed peak in cardiac deaths in outpatients .
In addition , the degree of regulation of diet in inpatients may be variable because inpatients ’ relatives and friends tend to bring gifts of food to them .
People tend to gain weight during the holiday season and take in more salt , which can put additional stress on a weakened heart .
Furthermore , fatty meals can have acute adverse effects on endothelial function .
Excess use of alcohol during the holidays is unlikely to appear on medical records or death certificate data ( the main data source for the study of Phillips et al ) and should not be dismissed .
Potential Mechanisms for the “ Merry Christmas Coronary ” and “ Happy New Year Heart Attack ” Phenomenon 1 .
Inappropriate delay in seeking medical attention 2 .
Reduced levels of healthcare staffing or fewer staff members who are familiar with individual patients during holiday on - call schedules 3 . Increased emotional stress 4 .
Overindulgence ( eg , increased intake of food , salt , fats , alcohol ) 5 . Increased respiratory problems ( eg , upper respiratory infection , influenza , particulate matter generated from wood - burning fireplaces ) 6 . Colder weather , leading to increased vascular resistance , coronary spasm , hemostasis and thrombus formation , O 2 demand 7 .
Decreased hours of daylight 8 . “ Postponement of death ” concept
Emotional stress is another factor that still may be important .
During the holiday season , patients may feel stress from having to interact with relatives whom they may or may not want to encounter ; having to absorb financial pressures such as purchasing gifts , traveling expenses , entertaining , and decorating ; and having to travel , especially in the post–September 11 , 2001 , era .
Even people with Alzheimer disease may be forced into a more unfamiliar environment or become stressed by the increased commotion or interaction with visitors during the holiday period .
Respiratory issues still may be important .
Burning wood in fireplaces , which tends to be a popular activity during the winter holidays , releases toxic particulate material into the air .
Particulate airborne pollutants have been associated with an increase in cardiac events and an increase in blood pressure .
5–7
Inappropriate delay in seeking medical care is an intriguing concept that Phillips and colleagues describe , and this may be important .
3
Of equal concern are the possibilities that staffing levels at hospitals and other healthcare facilities may be reduced during the holiday season or that holiday on - call scheduling may result in staff caring for patients with whom they are less familiar .
Clearly , more research is needed to nail down the exact mechanism ( s ) 3 for the “ Merry Christmas Coronary ” and “ Happy New Year Heart Attack . ”
If the mechanism (s ) can be identified and appropriate therapies developed , then significant numbers of cardiac deaths can be avoided .
Recently , our research group observed an increase in ischemic heart disease deaths that was associated with another celebration , New Year ’s 2000 , as compared with New Year ’s celebrations before or after the beginning of the “ new millennium . ”
8
It is possible that intensified celebrations for this event , along with overindulgence , may have contributed to this increase .
Emotional stress from concern about terrorist attacks or the “ Y2 K millennium bug ” also may have contributed .
With the knowledge that the holiday season is associated with an increase in cardiac deaths , what approach should the physician take in advising his or her patients ?
Until the exact mechanism or mechanisms for the “ Merry Christmas Coronary ” and “ Happy New Year Heart Attack ” are known , there are a number of commonsense and prudent tactics that the physician should consider , especially for patients with established cardiac disease or for those with known risk factors for cardiac disease :
Instruct patients to avoid delay in seeking medical attention , should cardiac symptoms occur .
Examine patients himself or herself , if possible , rather than relying upon healthcare providers not familiar with the patients .
Coronary care units and emergency departments should be adequately staffed , and the staff should be aware that they may notice an increase in cardiac cases during the holiday season .
Instruct patients to avoid the known triggers for acute myocardial infarction , as described by Muller et al, 9 Mittleman et al,10 and Verrier and Mittleman , 11 including excess physical exertion ( especially shoveling show ) , overeating , lack of sleep , emotional stress , illegal drugs , and anger .
Avoid excess salt and alcohol intake .
( Alcohol can also precipitate arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation [ the “ holiday heart syndrome ” 12 ] and can depress cardiac contractility .
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate can precipitate ischemia in a patient with coronary artery disease . )
Modify and treat known cardiovascular risk factors ( eg , hypertension , smoking , diabetes , dyslipidemia ) .
Consider aspirin or β- blockers , or both , if appropriate .
Instruct patients to avoid exposure to severely cold temperatures .
Instruct patients to avoid participating in outdoor activities on days when air pollution alerts are issued and to avoid inhaling smoke from wood - burning fireplaces .
Consider flu shots where appropriate .
Our study1 and the fine study of Phillips et al2 clearly suggest that the winter holiday season is associated with a significant increase in cardiac deaths .
Physicians should be aware of this “ Merry Christmas Coronary , ” and “ Happy New Year Heart Attack ” phenomenon and help their patients to minimize coronary risk factors and factors that will trigger acute myocardial infarction , especially during the winter holiday season .

( CNN ) --
More than 200 indigenous people who refused to vacate their land in eastern Paraguay were sprayed late last week with what some believe was pesticide , sending seven to the hospital , a government cabinet member said this week .
The 217 members of the Ava Guarani community in the Itakyry district suffered vomiting , diarrhea , headaches and nausea , said Esperanza Martinez , Paraguay 's minister of health .
Although one person was in serious condition , she said Monday , the rest are improving .
" For us , it 's very clear that this is an acute community - wide intoxication caused in a premeditated manner by an unknown substance , " Martinez said on her ministry 's Web site .
" But it is very clear because all of the similar symptoms occurred after this incident . "
The Amnesty International human rights organization said Tuesday it " condemned the use of apparently toxic pesticides to intimidate an indigenous community after they resisted being forcibly evicted from their ancestral lands . "
The tension in Paraguay is identical to that found in other parts of Latin America , where the rights of indigenous communities collide with the business interests upon which nations ' economies depend .
The traditional ancestral homes of indigenous communities are sought for use by mining , oil , logging , agricultural and ranching businesses .
Some in Paraguay say that legal protections often are not enough .
" A new constitution recognizes indigenous rights , but political reality is proving to be quite different from the constitutional ideal ; the problems facing Paraguay 's indigenous people are not likely to go away anytime soon , " the University of Maryland 's Center for International Development and Conflict Management said in a 2006 study .
" The economics and politics of Paraguay make sustained improvement unlikely . "
Government critics say not much has changed in three years .
" Indigenous peoples ' lives are being put in jeopardy by those who should protect them , " said Louise Finer , Paraguay researcher at Amnesty International .
" The risk faced by the Itakyry communities was predictable .
Insufficient action was taken to protect them from the threats they faced from this renewed attempt to evict them from their ancestral lands . "
The latest incident occurred Friday near the border with Brazil , when more than 200 Ava Guarani community members refused to leave land local soy growers say belongs to them .
An eviction order against the indigenous people was supposed to be carried out Friday , but a district prosecutor canceled the mandate right before it was to be executed .
" And , according to what the indigenous said , that apparently angered the soy growers , who went there to try to remove them , " Paraguayan Health Minister Martinez said .
" They went in trucks to try to forcefully remove them . "
Amnesty International said the Ava Guarani fought back against the 50 men who tried to evict them .
" The indigenous peoples resisted using bows and arrows , " the rights group said in a release Tuesday .
Police were present , which limited the fight , Martinez said .
" Afterward , " she said , " came a low - level flight by airplanes where the people were working in their fields , in their community orchards , with the spraying of a liquid over the people who were there , who later presented with massive symptoms . "
Officials are investigating who may have been responsible , she said .
Amnesty International urged Paraguayan officials to step up their efforts to protect the indigenous communities .
" The Paraguayan authorities -- the executive , congress and the judiciary -- must work together to address the immediate needs of the communities after this attack , but also to ensure that it does not happen again . "
Finer said .
The native populations have been losing ground since the 1700s .
" As agriculture and grazing came to occupy larger and larger tracts of land , the traditional subsistence foraging and hunting of most of the groups could not support their numbers , and they were forced to take extremely low - wage jobs , " the University of Maryland 's conflict and development group says .
" Indigenous peoples throughout Paraguay are among the very poorest of society . "
Indigenous communities also were legally disenfranchised , the study said .
" Until the 1960s , only one law addressed the future of indigenous groups in Paraguay , and well into the 1970s it was not a crime to kill ' Indians , ' " the university study said .
Some recent government efforts to help indigenous communities have been tied up in courts .
" In 1996 and 1997 the Paraguayan Indigenous Institute , the state body that advises on protecting indigenous peoples ' rights and processing land claims , acquired 2,638 hectares ( 6,518 acres ) of the indigenous communities ' ancestral land on their behalf , " Amnesty International said in a recent release .
" However , landowners have taken legal action against the five communities . "
More recently , the Inter - American Court of Human Rights ordered Paraguay in 2005 and 2006 to return ancestral lands to two indigenous communities .
It was not clear Tuesday whether that order had been carried out .
The University of Maryland study points out that the indigenous population of Paraguay consists of 17 ethnic communities divided into five linguistic groups : the Mascoi , Mataco , Zamuco , Guarani and the Guaykuru .
These communities live on either side of the Paraguayan River , in the sparsely populated Chaco region to the west , and along the Brazilian border to the east .
Less than half of the indigenous population remaining in Paraguay lives in the Chaco ; fewer groups , related to the Guarani , remain in the east .
About 95 percent of Paraguayans are mestizo , of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry , the CIA World Factbook says .
The official language of Paraguay is Spanish .
However , the university report said , the majority of Paraguay 's 7 million residents speak Guarani better than they speak Spanish .
Spanish is used mainly in public speech , while Guarani is used in everyday speech .
The 1992 constitution stipulated that all government documents be published in Spanish and Guarani .
But despite the general population 's fluency with Guarani , the study said , Paraguayans do not consider themselves of Indian descent and their culture is thoroughly Hispanicized .
Overview on Toxoplasmosis | The Cost of Apicomplexan Parasitic Diseases | Prevention
Toxoplasma gondii causes the disease toxoplasmosis .
T. gondii is a small parasite and very commonly infects humans .
It is acquired from stages of the parasite that persist in a latent encysted form in meat and when a stage of the parasite that is excreted by members of the cat family contaminates the environment and humans or other animals ingest them .
An acutely infected cat excretes 20 million oocyst forms of the parasite over about two weeks , even one is infectious and the oocyst can remain infectious in warm moist soil for up to a year and in water for up to six months .
The parasite causes eye and brain damage in a baby , if untreated , when a mother is infected for the first time while pregnant and passes the parasite to her child .
The incidence of such congenital infection varies with locale and is not well - defined .
For example , congenital infection is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 5000 babies born in the US , 1 in 3000 born in France , and 1 in 300 born in Panama .
The acute infection in older children and adults may be without symptoms , cause flu like illness or enlarged lymph glands .
Eye disease or other destruction of other tissues by the parasite such as infection and inflammation of heart or brain occurs in some older children and adults who acquire the infection but these manifestations are not frequent .
This latent parasite occurs very commonly in people infecting approximately a third to a half of all humans , or approximately 2 billion people worldwide .
This latent parasite can cause active disease if a person becomes immune compromised from conditions such as malignancies , autoimmune diseases , or transplantation and their treatments or AIDS .
It also can recrudesce and cause later eye disease in congenitally infected children and in some older children and adults who acquired the parasite after birth .
Treatment can prevent transmission of the parasite from mother to child as well as treat and prevent adverse consequences of the infection if diagnosed and treated early .
Toxoplasmosis refers to the disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii .
The organism Toxoplasma gondii is related to parasites that cause malaria , cryptosporidial diarrhea and babesiosis .
The parasite is 3 - 5 micron in length and visible with a microscope .
In the acute infection the parasite is in a form that multiplies rapidly called a " tachyzoite . "
If the immune response to the parasite is normal , the parasite then forms a cyst that contains slowly replicating " bradyzoites . "
Bradyzoites persist for the remainder of an infected individual 's / animal 's life .
If a member of the cat family eats meat containing bradyzoites in cysts , or oocysts excreted by other cats , male and female parasite gametes form in the cat intestine .
These gametes created highly infectious oocysts which are excreted for several weeks .
Oocysts then are present in materials contaminated by cat feces ( e.g. , cat ltter , garden soil , sandboxes , or fruits and vegetables that come into contact with cat feces and then are not thoroughly washed ) .
Only members of the cat family excrete oocysts .
All animals can be infected by bradyzoites and oocysts .
The Parasite The medicines available for treatment of active infection have toxicities .
No medicines currently available can eliminate the latent form of the organism which results in risk for recurrent disease .
Better medicines to treat the active and chronic latent infection are needed .
A chronically infected mother ‘s immune response ( if she is not immune compromised ) prevents transmission of the parasite to her baby .
This observation provides support for the development of vaccines which will elicit a similar protective immune response for humans .
The effect of a chronic brain infection in 2 billion people , or some of them who might be genetically susceptible to a more extensive inflammatory process on subsequent neurodegenerative diseases , is unknown .
Oocysts Bradyzoites in a Cyst Tachyzoites in a Cell How Can I Get It ?
Toxoplasma gondii is acquired from meat not cooked to well done or oocysts in materials contaminated with cat feces .
A woman who is infected for the first time while pregnant may transmit the infection to her baby while she is pregnant .
Immunocompromised individuals may develop serious medical problems from acute or chronic Toxoplasma infection .
Incidence Currently 30 % to 50 % of people throughout the world , 2 to 3 billion people in 2006 , are infected with Toxoplasma gondii .
The infection is most commonly passed from mother to fetus during pregnancy .
Congenital infection occurs in between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 15,000 live births in the US .
Immunologicaly compromised persons , such as those with autoimmune disorders , organ and bone marrow transplants and AIDS , are also at risk of developing the disease .

Diagnosis
This infection can be diagnosed through the use of blood tests , amniocentesis , isolation of the parasite , and characteristic microscopic appearance of tissues .
Reference laboratories for assistance with diagnostic tests can be found on our Links page .
Overview on Toxoplasmosis | The Cost of Apicomplexan Parasitic Diseases | Prevention
The estimated costs for care of children born with toxoplasmosis in one year in the US are between one half and eight billion dollars .
Disease caused by this infection in immune compromised individuals is costly and frequent .
There are more than 4000 species of apicomplexan parasites .
The apicomplexan parasites that cause diseases in humans include Toxoplasma gondii ( top ) that infects two billion people worldwide and can harm the brain and eye of a baby or those who are immunocompromised .
Malaria ( middle ) kills one million children a year .
Cryptosporidium parvum ( bottom ) causes diarrheal disease and dehydration .
Overview on Toxoplasmosis | The Cost of Apicomplexan Parasitic Diseases | Prevention
There are practical ways you can avoid infection .
If a woman becomes infected with Toxoplasma for the first time while she is pregnant , her unborn baby may also be infected .
Infection of a baby while in utero may result in damage to the baby 's brain , eyes , ears , or in the baby 's death .
Infection is acquired mainly by eating foods or handling materials such as sand in a sandbox or garden soil contaminated with cat feces or from eating undercooked meats that contain Toxoplasma .
If you are acutely infected with Toxoplasma while you are pregnant , although you may have symptoms or signs such as a flu - like illness or enlarged lymph nodes , chances are your infection will be so mild that you may never realize you have been infected .
While you feel fine , your unborn child is at risk of acquiring the disease from you and the results can be tragic .
Nearly 9 out of 10 pregnant women in the United States are at risk of being infected with Toxoplasma during pregnancy .
the other 10 % are immune due to infection acquired before the pregnancy .
To know whether you are immune , your doctor must have your blood tested for antibody to Toxoplasma .
Every woman should know if her unborn child is protected against toxoplasmosa .
If you are tested by your doctor and are found to be non-immune , you should be sure to follow the precautions listed below : Avoid contact with materials potentially contaminated with cat excrement .

Megpróbált ellopni egy rendőrautót egy fiatalember a VIII .
kerületi Népszínház utcában , de nem látta , hogy a sötétített ablaküveg ű kisbusz hátsó ülésén két rendőr ül - írta a Népszabadság .
A rendőrautó sofőrje kiszállt a járműből , de a slusszkulcsot nem vitte magával - ismertette a kedden történt eset részleteit a Népszabadság .
Mindezt meglátta a fiatalember , aki a sötétített ablakon keresztül megpróbálta kifürkészni mit vihet el a kocsiból , majd beült a járműbe .
Ekkor szólaltak meg a háta mögött ülő rendőrök és azt mondták : " mi nem tennénk ! " .
A tolvaj megpróbált elmenekülni , de elfogták és előállították .
A fiatalember az első , aki Magyarországon a benne ülő rendőrökkel együtt próbált ellopni egy rendőrautót .
There ’s definitely a ton of stress in my life , but it ’s rarely physical …
My work comes with a lot of thinking , negotiating and making decisions on the spot .
Recently I had the pleasure of speaking with Andre , my good friend from Richmond , Virginia who now operates Towing Richmond , a local towing company in the area .
He reminded me why It ’s so important to keep active .
Little did I know , but exercising actually saved his life , after his first hear attack at the age of 37 .
I immediately sat down and felt like writing about my life and what part sport has in it .
This one is straight from the heart :
Athletics will always be a big part of … Read the rest
I do n’t care if you ’re not a chef or a foodie or even moderately handy around the kitchen , you are going to thank me later for this .
You have got to try making your own butter at least once : no , it does n’t save money , but it tastes so much better than anything you can buy in the store .
It ’s extraordinarily simple , cheap ( you need heavy
whipping cream , that ’s all that ’s absolutely necessary ) , you can do all sorts of different flavors ( I ’ve got some awesome recipes for you : garlic butter , cultured butter , pesto Parmesan butter , honey butter , Italian butter , and Mediterranean butter ) .
First , I ’m going to show you how to make plain old butter with a short video , as well as cultured butter which has a lovely yogurt - ey aftertaste to it because , of course , we ’re using yogurt culture ; note : if you do n’t have cultured yogurt where you live you can just buy some live yogurt culture yourself instead ( many grocery stores carry it , and Amazon has it for less than 5 bucks ) .
He uses a food processor , but if you do n’t have one you can just stir or shake it yourself for approximately the same amount of time ( you could try a blender set on low , but I doubt that will work well ) ; a stand mixer like what you would use to make whipped cream will also work .
Here we go , stick around for the recipes and additional stuff I ’ve got afterwards :
Wicked cool flavored butter recipes
* Note : you combine these ingredients with the butter after you ’ve made it .
Good quality sea salt is recommended whenever salt is called for .

If you do n’t have a food processor and want to mix your butter by hand , instructables.com has got you covered with these simple instructions , and they ’ve also got some on how to do it with a mixer .
Google 's
Wave tool suffers from a " just another inbox " problem .
So it 's great to see Wave running inside a tab in Thunderbird , right next to your email inbox , with a single JavaScript line .

Among Thunderbird 3's new features is Content Tabs , a way to monitor other web sites and web - based messaging from inside Thunderbird .
The Quetzalcoatal blog hacked together a little code that opens
Wave cleanly and conveniently inside one of these tabs , and even keeps it open after you restart Thunderbird .
To load it up , head to the Tools menu , select Error Console , and enter this line ( be sure to select all of it ) :
Components.classes['@mozilla.org /appshell/window-mediator;1'].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator).getMostRecentWindow(" mail:3pane" ).document.getElementById(" tabmail " ) .openTab(" contentTab " , {contentPage : " https://wave.google.com/wave/?nouacheck "} ) ;
Hit the " Evaluate " button when you 're done , and you 'll see a new tab asking for your Wave login .
Log in , click " Remember " to have Thunderbird remember your password , and now it 's just like having a little browser tab opened on Wave .

Interesting Things to Know about MySQL Mike Chirico ( mchirico@users.sourceforge.net )
Copyright ( c ) 2004 ( GNU Free Documentation License ) Last Updated : Sun Jan 21 09:44:21 EST
2007
The latest version of this document can be found at : http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/readme_mysql.htm
TIP 1 : Find out who is doing what , and kill the process if needed .
This example kills Id 657. mysql > show processlist ; show processlist ; +-----+------+-----------+---------+---------+-------+-------+------------------+ |
Id | User | Host | db | Command | Time | State | Info |
+-----+------+-----------+---------+---------+-------+-------+------------------+ | 657 | prog | localhost | weather | Sleep | 28619 | | NULL | | 782 | prog | localhost | weather | Sleep | 853 | | NULL | | 785 | prog | localhost | NULL | Query | 0 | NULL | show processlist |
+-----+------+-----------+---------+---------+-------+-------+------------------+
3 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) mysql> kill 657
Or , from the command line , to kill process 782 [ root@third - fl - 71 mysql ] # mysqladmin processlist +-----+------+-----------+---------+---------+------+-------+------------------+ |
Id | User | Host | db | Command | Time | State | Info |
+-----+------+-----------+---------+---------+------+-------+------------------+ | 782 | prog | localhost | weather | Sleep | 2676 | | | | 785 | prog | localhost | | Sleep | 1823 | | | | 793 | root | localhost | | Query | 0 | | show processlist |
+-----+------+-----------+---------+---------+------+-------+------------------+ [ root@third - fl-71 mysql ] # [ root@third - fl-71 mysql ] # mysqladmin kill 782 Note , the following can also be helpful mysql > show status ; or mysql > show status \G also mysql > show innodb status ; or mysql > show table status like '% ';
The above gives you create time and other information .
TIP 2 : Clean up binary log files .
For a default install they may be in / usr / local / var / or / var / lib / mysql / with names ending in - bin.000001 , - bin.000002 , ..
The following command may help find out where the logs are located .
mysql > show variables like ' % home % ' ; +---------------------------+-----------------+
| Variable_name | Value | +---------------------------+-----------------+
| bdb_home | /var/lib/mysql/ | | innodb_data_home_dir | | | innodb_log_group_home_dir | ./ | +---------------------------+-----------------+ mysql > reset master ; reset master ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.02 sec ) See ( Tip 24 : ) details working with binary log files and ( Tip 25 : ) explains how to setup logging .
( Tip 37 : ) shows have to setup MASTER and SLAVE replication .
TIP 3 : Can the order of the columns in a create statement make a difference ?
YES create table t ( a int , b int , timeUpdate timestamp , timeEnter timestamp ) ;
The first timestamp will always be the " automatically generated " time .
So if the record is updated , or inserted , this time gets changed .
If the order is changed , " timeEnter " is before " timeUpdate " , then , " timeEnter " would get updated .
First timestamp column updates automatically .
Note , in the table above timeEnter will only get updated if passed a null value .
insert into t ( a , b, timeEnter ) values ( 1,2, NULL ) ;
Hints :
Need mm - dd - yyyy hh : mm:ss format ?
select a , b, DATE_FORMAT( timeUpdate , '%m-%d-%Y %T ') , DATE_FORMAT( timeEnter , '%m-%d-%Y %T ' ) from t ; +------+------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | a | b | DATE_FORMAT ( timeUpdate , '%m-%d-%Y %T ') | DATE_FORMAT ( timeEnter , '%m-%d-%Y %T ') |
+------+------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | 3 | 2 | 04-15-2004 19:14:36 | 04-15-2004 19:15:07 | | 3 | 2 | 04-15-2004 19:14:39 | 04-15-2004 19:15:07 | | 5 | 5 | 00-00-0000 00:00:00 | 04-15-2004 19:15:53 | | 1 | 2 | 00-00-0000 00:00:00 | 04-15-2004 19:20:15 | +------+------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
4 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) TIP 4 : Connect , create table and select with Perl ( Linux ) .
First the DBI module is needed , which can be installed from the system prompt as follows : # perl - MCPAN -e shell cpan > install DBI cpan > install DBD :: mysql
The following is an example program : #!
/usr/bin/perl -w # Copyright ( GPL ) Mike Chirico mchirico@users.sourceforge.net
# # Program does the following : # o connects to mysql # o creates perlTest if it does n't exist # o inserts records # o selects and displays records # #
This program assumes DBI # # perl - MCPAN -e shell # cpan > install DBI # cpan > install DBD :: mysql # # # # # use strict ; use DBI ; #
You will need to change the following : # o database # o user # o password my $ database = " yourdatabase " ; my $ user = " user1 " ; my $ passwd = " hidden " ; my $ count = 0 ; my $ tblcreate= " CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS perlTest ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , a int , b int , c int , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) " ; my $ insert= " insert into perlTest ( a , b , c ) values ( 1,2,3 ) , ( 4,5,6 ) , ( 7,8,9 ) " ; my $ select= " select a , b , c from perlTest " ; my $ dsn = " DBI : mysql:host=localhost;database=${database} " ; my $ dbh = DBI -> connect ( $dsn , $user , $ passwd ) or die " Cannot connect to server
" ; my $s = $ dbh - > prepare ( $ tblcreate ) ; $ s ->execute ( ) ; $s = $ dbh - > prepare ( $ insert ) ; $ s ->execute ( ) ; $s = $ dbh - > prepare ( $ select ) ; $ s ->execute ( ) ; while ( my @val = $ s-> fetchrow_array ( ) ) { print " $ val [ 0 ] $ val [ 1 ] $ val [ 2 ]
" ; ++$ count ; } $s -> finish ( ) ; $ dbh -> disconnect ( ) ; exit ( 0 ) ; TIP 5 : Remove duplicate entries .
Assume the following table and data .
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dupTest ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , a int , b int , c int , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) ; insert into dupTest ( a , b , c ) values ( 1,2,3 ) , ( 1,2,3 ) , ( 1,5,4 ) , ( 1,6,4 ) ; mysql > select * from dupTest ; select * from dupTest ; +------+------+------+------+---------------------+
| pkey | a | b | c | timeEnter | +------+------+------+------+---------------------+ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2004-04-16 10:55:35 | | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2004-04-16 10:55:35 | | 3 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 2004-04-16 10:55:35 | | 4 | 1 | 6 | 4 | 2004-04-16 10:55:35 | +------+------+------+------+---------------------+
4 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) mysql >
Note , the first two rows contains duplicates in columns a and b .
It contains other duplicates ; but , leaves the other duplicates alone .
mysql > ALTER IGNORE TABLE dupTest ADD UNIQUE INDEX ( a , b ) ; mysql > select * from dupTest ; select * from dupTest ; +------+------+------+------+---------------------+
| pkey | a | b | c | timeEnter | +------+------+------+------+---------------------+ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2004-04-16 11:11:42 | | 3 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 2004-04-16 11:11:42 | | 4 | 1 | 6 | 4 | 2004-04-16 11:11:42 | +------+------+------+------+---------------------+
3 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) TIP 6 : Show status information on a table .
Note , if the database was started with -- safe - show - database or -- skip - show - database some of these commands may not work .
Note the " \G " option may provide a nicer format .
Show the create statement : mysql > show create table dupTest \G show create table dupTest \G ***************************
1 . row ***************************
Table : dupTest Create Table : CREATE TABLE `dupTest` ( `pkey` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , `a` int ( 11 ) default NULL , `b` int ( 11 ) default NULL , `c` int ( 11 ) default NULL , `timeEnter` timestamp NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `pkey` ) , UNIQUE KEY `a` ( `a` , `b` ) ) TYPE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 1 row in set ( 0.00 sec ) TIP 7 : Transactions :
Not all table types support transactions .
BDB and INNODB type do support transactions .
Assuming the server has NOT been started with -- skip - bdb or -- skip - innodb the following should work : mysql > create table tran_test ( a int , b int ) type = InnoDB ; mysql > begin ; mysql > insert into tran_test ( a , b ) values ( 1,2 ) ; mysql > select * from tran_test ; select * from tran_test ; +------+------+ | a | b | +------+------+ | 1 | 2 | +------+------+ 1 row in set ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > rollback ; mysql > select * from tran_test ; select * from tran_test ; Empty set ( 0.00 sec )
Summary : rollback undoes everything and commit will save .
TIP 8 : MERGE : Several tables can be merged into one .
CREATE TABLE log_01 ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , a int , b varchar ( 12 ) , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) type=MyISAM ; CREATE TABLE log_02 ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , a int , b varchar ( 12 ) , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) type=MyISAM ; CREATE TABLE log_summary ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , a int , b varchar ( 12 ) , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) type=MERGE UNION ( log_01,log_02 ) INSERT_METHOD=LAST
; mysql > insert into log_01 ( a , b ) values ( 1 , 'log1 ' ) ; mysql > insert into log_02 ( a , b ) values ( 1 , 'log2 ' ) ; mysql > select * from log_summary ; select * from log_summary ; +------+------+------+---------------------+
| pkey | a | b | timeEnter | +------+------+------+---------------------+ | 1 | 1 | log1 | 2004-04-16 11:59:55 | | 1 | 1 | log2 | 2004-04-16 12:00:08 | +------+------+------+---------------------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) Reference : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/MERGE.html
TIP 9 : Updating foreign keys in a multiuser environment .
Using LAST_INSERT_ID ( ) .
Also see ( TIP 29 ) after reading this .
The LAST_INSERT_ID ( ) is unique to the login session .
This allows updating of foreign keys .
CREATE TABLE keytest ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , ptext text , ptype int ( 11 ) , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) ; CREATE TABLE foreignkeytest ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , pkeykeytest int ( 11 ) NOT NULL , ptext text , ptype int ( 11 ) , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) ; mysql > insert into keytest ( ptext , ptype ) values ( ' one ' , 1 ) ; mysql > select LAST_INSERT_ID ( ) from keytest ;
+------------------+ | last_insert_id( ) |
+------------------+ | 1 | +------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.03 sec ) mysql > insert into foreignkeytest ( ptext , pkeykeytest ) values ( ' one ' , LAST_INSERT_ID ( ) ) ;
Note :
If your session did n't update any records , LAST_INSERT_ID ( ) will be zero .
Never assume LAST_INSERT_ID ( ) +1 will be the next record .
If another session inserts a record , this value may be taken .
You are assured that this value will be unique to the " session " .
** SPECIAL NOTE : MySQL 4.1.2. supports UUID. mysql > select uuid ( ) ; +--------------------------------------+ | uuid () |
+--------------------------------------+
| 167c1afe-0a0f-1027-891e-0004e222b485 | +--------------------------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec ) " A UUID is designed as a number that is globally unique in space and time .
Two calls to UUID ( ) are expected to generate two different values , even if these calls are performed on two separate computers that are not connected to each other . "
So in the future , UUID ( ) could be used as a better primary key .
The advantage being tables from a one server could be up - loaded to a second server without worrying about duplicate keys .
TIP 10 : Monitor port 3306 : tcpdump - i eth0 - nN - vvv - xX -s 1500 port 3306 and host not 192.168.1.102
The -s is length of each packet .

To clean things up ( Note in 4.1 you can't do subquery on same table in a delete so it has to be done in 2 steps ) : select @t_sid:=b.s_id from bookreport b left outer join student s on b.s_id=s .
s_id where s.s_id is null ; delete from student where s_id=@t_sid ;
But , functions do work in delete .
For instance the following is possible : delete from student where s_id=max ( s_id ) ;
It just a problem when joining the table where the delete will occur with another table .
Another option is two create a second temp table and locking the first one .
TIP 17 : Getting a random roll of the dice : CREATE TABLE dice ( d_id int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , roll int , PRIMARY KEY ( d_id ) ) ; insert into dice ( roll ) values ( 1 ) ; insert into dice ( roll ) values ( 2 ) ; insert into dice ( roll ) values ( 3 ) ; insert into dice ( roll ) values ( 4 ) ; insert into dice ( roll ) values ( 5 ) ; insert into dice ( roll ) values ( 6 ) ; select roll from dice order by rand ( ) limit 1 ; TIP 18 : Creating and using your own password file .

7 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Note the bad passwords in the file ( ' secret ' , ' password ' , and password is the same as the id .
The following update statement will fill in the value for valid : update password set valid = COALESCE ( concat ( substring ( 'y ' , 1 , 1 - sign ( abs ( find_in_set ( lcase ( des_decrypt ( password , 'somekey ' ) ) , concat ( ' password , secret , simple , ', lcase ( id ) , ', test ' ) ) ) ) ) , substring ( 'n ' , 1 , sign ( abs ( find_in_set ( lcase ( des_decrypt ( password , 'somekey ' ) ) , concat ( ' password , secret , simple , ', lcase ( id ) , ', test ' ) ) ) ) ) ) , 'n ' ) ;
Which gives the following : mysql > select id , valid from password ; select id , valid from password ; +--------+-------+ | id | valid | +--------+-------+ | bob | n | | tom | n | | kate | y | | tim | n | | sue | y | | john | y | | randal | n | +--------+-------+

Deleting any blank users or passwords , and creating a valid user is shown below .
STEP 1 : First , connect to the mysql database with the connect command : mysql > connect mysql ; STEP 2 : Next , delete all blank accounts and / or global host listing : mysql > DELETE FROM user WHERE User = '' ; mysql > DELETE FROM db WHERE Host = '%'; STEP 3 : Delete any accounts with blank passwords : mysql > DELETE FROM user where password= ''; STEP 4 : Create a valid admin account .
The example here creates admin1 . mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO admin1@localhost IDENTIFIED BY ' s3cr3tpass45 ' WITH GRANT OPTION ; or if you want the account to get access from any host .
mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO admin1@ " % " IDENTIFIED BY ' s3cr3tpass45 '

What commands were executed ?
Reading the log files .
( By default on 4.1.2 is should be setup , but , see TIP 25 to check . )
The following is an example of the " show binlog events " which will show all the inserted and deleted commands .
See " TIP 2 : " which shows how to clean up or reset with the " reset master " .
mysql > show binlog events ; show binlog events ;

5 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Note that the logfiles by default are located in " /usr/local / var " ( see TIP 25 : ) or execute " mysql > show variables " and look for the entry under the datadir .
It 's possible to query specific logfiles if they exist : mysql > show binlog events in ' third - fl-71-bin.000001 ' ;
It 's also possible to specify the start position and limit the number of records as follows : mysql > show binlog events from 201 limit 2 ; show binlog events from 201 limit 2 ; +------------------------+-----+------------+-----------+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Log_name | Pos | Event_type | Server_id | Orig_log_pos | Info |
+------------------------+-----+------------+-----------+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| third - fl-71-bin.000001 | 201 | Query | 1 | 201 | use `test` ; insert into j2 ( a ) values ( 9 ) | | third - fl-71- bin.000001 | 265 | Query | 1 | 265 | use `test` ; delete from j2 where a=3 | +------------------------+-----+------------+-----------+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Or , from the command line : $ mysqlbinlog < logfile >
Another option is writing a C api .
For a complete example of this ( selectbinlog . c ) download the following : http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/mysql_select-0.0.1.tar.gz?download or take a peek at http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/code/selectbinlog.c.html
This sample " selectbinlog.c " selects only the " Query " events .
The code is pretty simple .
FYI : If you do a lot of tracking , you may want to write the information to a Berkeley DB .
Contrary to the name Berkeley DB is not a database but a hash , or there is an option for b- tree format .
MySQL can use Berkeley DB for the underlying table structure .
It 's very fast , and you wo n't get logs of your logs .
If you 're using Linux , Berkeley DB is already installed on your system .
Ok , so how does one use Berkeley DB ?
Samples can be found at the following link .
Look for berkeleydb_0.x.x.tar.gz at the following link http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=79066&package_id=80379
The newer version of Berkeley DB also supports encryption .
Berkeley DB is open source and can be downloaded from the following : http://www.sleepycat.com/
NOTE : MySQL uses Berkeley DB if configured for it ./ configure --with- berkeley-db
And tables are created with the " ENGINE " or " TYPE " option : CREATE TABLE b ( i INT ) ENGINE = BDB ; or CREATE TABLE b ( i INT ) TYPE = BDB ; TIP 25 : Setting the binary log file .
This can be configured in /etc/my.cnf #
The MySQL server [ mysqld ] port = 3306 socket =
/tmp/mysql.sock log-bin = /usr/local/var/mysqlLOGb.log log = /usr/local/var/mysqlLOG.log or for the default hostname just log - bin [ mysqld ] port = 3306 socket =
/tmp/mysql.sock log-bin IMPORTANT :
The default my.cnf has a " log - bin " entry .
Make sure it is not listed twice .
It 's also possible to set the text log file .
Note both " log- bin " and " log " are set here : [ mysqld ] port = 3306 socket =
/tmp/mysql.sock log-bin = /usr/local/var/mysqlLOGb.log log = /usr / local/var/mysqlLOG.log
Note , ( see TIP 24 : ) the binary log file works with the " show binlog events command " and shows , updates , creates , deletes , and drops , but no select statements .
In contrast , the text log- file " /usr/local/var/mysqlLOG.log " shows the user , and the select statement , all of the above , but it 's in a text file .
I believe the text format is going away with version 5.0 .
The following command " DOES NOT " give information about these log files : mysql > show logs ;
This is only for Berkeley DB type databases before commit on this type of table .
It 's not what you want !

TIP 27 : Adding and Compiling a User - Defined function .
Here are some examples that can be compiled and used with MySQL 4.1 .
See below for how to install .
First , just a taste of what they look like : mysql > select lookup ( " www.yahoo.com " ) ; select lookup ( " www.yahoo.com " ) ;
+-------------------------+ | lookup ( " www.yahoo.com " )
|
+-------------------------+
| 216.109.118.71 | +-------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0.02 sec ) and mysql > select reverse_lookup ( " 216.109.118 select reverse_lookup ( " 216.109.118.79 " ) ; +----------------------------------+ | reverse_lookup ( " 216.109.118.79 " ) | +----------------------------------+

An example of an aggregate function : mysql > create table cost ( inum int , cost double ) ; create table cost ( inum int , cost double ) ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > insert into cost ( inum , cost ) values ( 3,4.5 ) ; insert into cost ( inum , cost ) values ( 3,4.5 ) ; Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > insert into cost ( inum , cost ) values ( 10,21.3 ) ; insert into cost ( inum , cost ) values ( 10,21.3 ) ; Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > select avgcost ( inum , cost ) from cost ; select avgcost ( inum , cost ) from cost ; +--------------------+ | avgcost ( inum , cost ) |
+--------------------+
| 17.4231 | +--------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec ) OK , HOW TO COMPILE : For best results mysql - 4.1.2 - alpha or above configured with the following option : --with-mysqld-ldflags=-rdynamic
The full line of my configure is as follows since I use openssl as well .
STEP A : ./ configure --with- openssl --enable - thread-safe-client --with-mysqld-ldflags=-rdynamic make make install /etc/init.d/ mysql restart ( Note : if " /etc/init.d/ mysql " does not exist see ( TIP 20 : ) ) STEP B : Under " mysql-4.1.2-alpha/sql " issue the following command .
# make udf_example .so STEP C : As root copy the file to a directory where mysql can find it .
# cp udf_example .so /usr/lib/udf_example.so
STEP D : Load mysql .
You may want to look at udf_example.cc , since it as instructions as well .
From here issue the following commands : mysql > CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME " udf_example.so " ; mysql > CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_double RETURNS REAL SONAME " udf_example.so " ; mysql > CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_int RETURNS INTEGER SONAME " udf_example.so " ; mysql > CREATE FUNCTION sequence RETURNS INTEGER SONAME " udf_example.so " ; mysql > CREATE FUNCTION lookup RETURNS STRING SONAME " udf_example.so " ; mysql > CREATE FUNCTION reverse_lookup RETURNS STRING SONAME " udf_example.so " ; mysql > CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION avgcost RETURNS REAL SONAME " udf_example.so " ;
And the functions can be deleted by the following : mysql > DROP FUNCTION metaphon ; mysql > DROP FUNCTION myfunc_double ; mysql > DROP FUNCTION myfunc_int ; mysql > DROP FUNCTION lookup ; mysql > DROP FUNCTION reverse_lookup ; mysql > DROP FUNCTION avgcost ;
That 's it .
Just run the functions above .
These can serve as templates for writing your own .
TIP 28 : Loading Data into Tables from Text Files .
Assume you have the following table .
CREATE TABLE loadtest ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , name varchar ( 20 ) , exam int , score int , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) ;
And you have the following formatted text file as shown below with the unix " tail " command : $ tail /tmp/out.txt ' name22999990 ',2,94 ' name22999991 ',3,93 ' name22999992',0,91 ' name22999993 ',1,93 ' name22999994 ',2,90 ' name22999995',3,93 ' name22999996',0,93 ' name22999997 ',1,89 ' name22999998',2,85 ' name22999999 ',3,88 NOTE : loadtest contains the " pkey " and " timeEnter " fields which are not present in the " /tmp/out.txt " file .
Therefore , to successfully load the specific fields issue the following : mysql > load data infile '/tmp/out.txt ' into table loadtest fields terminated by ' , ' ( name , exam , score ) ; TIP 29 : Referential Integrity with InnoDB tables .
STEP 1 ( First create the tables as InnoDB ) CREATE TABLE agents ( akey INTEGER NOT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY , ln varchar ( 30 ) , fn varchar ( 25 ) , phone varchar ( 20 ) , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) ) ENGINE = InnoDB ; CREATE TABLE clients ( ckey INTEGER NOT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY , f_akey INTEGER NOT NULL , ln varchar ( 30 ) , fn varchar ( 25 ) , phone varchar ( 20 ) , FOREIGN KEY ( f_akey ) REFERENCES agents ( akey ) ) ENGINE = InnoDB ; STEP 2 ( Insert entries -- successful way ) .
mysql > insert into agents ( ln , fn , phone ) values ( ' Anderson ' , ' Bob ' , '215-782-2134 ' ) ; mysql > select @ckey:=last_insert_id( ) ; mysql > insert into clients ( f_akey , ln , fn , phone ) values ( @ckey , ' Chirico ' , ' Abby ' , '215-782-2353 ' ) ; myslq > insert into clients ( f_akey , ln , fn , phone ) values ( @ckey , ' Payne ' , 'Zoe ' , '215-782-2352 ' ) ;
The " last_insert_id ( ) " must be assigned to a variable , because the client entries for the two client keys have the same agent .
After the first insert into the client table " last_insert_id ( ) " is incremented , reflecting the new add to the client table .
STEP 3 ( Try to insert a client record without a matching agent -- unsuccessful way ) mysql > insert into agents ( ln , fn , phone ) values ( ' Splat ' , 'Sporkey ' , '215-782-9987 ' ) ;
Above is ok myslq > insert into clients ( f_akey , ln , fn , phone ) values ( last_insert_id ( ) , ' Landis ' , 'Susan ' , '215-782-5222 ' ) ; Above
Ok for the first record , but , below last_insert_id( ) has been incremented and the insert will be incorrect .
And probably fail , if there is no matching " akey " in agents .
myslq > insert into clients ( f_akey , ln , fn , phone ) values ( last_insert_id ( ) , ' Landis ' , ' Brian ' , '215-782-5222 ' ) ; SPECIAL NOTE
( The " clients " table must be dropped before the " agents " table ) TIP 30 : Is it Possible to do Incremental Backups ?
And is it possible to restore changes for only one user ?
See TIP 24 and TIP 25 for setting up and using " binlog " and the text log .

With grep , awk , or sed it 's possible to weed out unwanted queries .
This assumes you have a base , or a " full restore " starting point .
Compare above to the actual commands listed here : CREATE TABLE exams ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , name varchar ( 15 ) default NULL , exam int ( 11 ) default NULL , score int ( 11 ) default NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 1,75 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 2,77 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 3,78 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 4,80 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 1,90 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 2,97 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 3,98 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 4,99 ) ; mysql > load data infile '/tmp/out.txt ' into table exams fields terminated by ' , ' ( name , exam , score ) ; TIP 31 : Getting XML and HTML output .
Assume you have the table " exams " in the database " test " .
Then , the following will give you XML output if executed from the shell prompt with the " - X " option .
For html output use the " - H " option .
$ mysql - X -e " select * from exams " test < ?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
< resultset statement = " select * from exams " > < row > < pkey >1</ pkey > < name > Bob</name > < exam>1</exam > < score>75</score > </row > < row > < pkey >2</pkey > < name > Bob</name > < exam>2</exam > < score>77</score > </row > < row > < pkey >3</ pkey > < name > Bob</name > < exam>3</exam > < score>78</score > </row > < row > < pkey >4</ pkey > < name > Bob</name > < exam>4</exam > < score>80</score > </row > < row > < pkey >5</ pkey > < name > Sue</name > < exam>1</exam > < score>90</score > </row > </resultset >
Or , ( - N is depreciated so use -- skip - column - names ) for no heading : $ mysql -- skip - column - names -e " select * from exams " test +---+------+------+------+ | 1 | Bob | 1 | 75 | | 2 | Bob | 2 | 77 | | 3 | Bob | 3 | 78 | | 4 | Bob | 4 | 80 | | 5 | Sue | 1 | 90 | | 6 | Sue | 2 | 97 | | 7 | Sue | 3 | 98 | | 8 | Sue | 4 | 99 | +---+------+------+------+
And , add the " - s " silent option to get the following : $ mysql --skip-column-names -s -e " select * from exams " test 1 Bob 1 75 2 Bob 2 77 3 Bob 3 78 4 Bob 4 80 5 Sue 1 90 6 Sue 2 97 7 Sue 3 98 8 Sue 4 99
To prevent being prompted for a password .
Create " /home/chirico/.my.cnf " with password and user .
An example is shown below .
Unless a user is entered " piggy " it will default to " chirico " , this user . [ client ] user=piggy password=p1ggyp1ssw6r5
Use this method .
It will not show up when doing " ps - aux " TIP 32 : Views ?
Can you do a " create view " in MySQL ?
No .
Not until version 5 . TIP 33 : Spatial Extensions - MySQL 4.1 supports spatial extensions .

TIP 34 : Creating Tables for Spatial Extensions .
mysql > CREATE TABLE spat ( p POINT , g POLYGON , l LINESTRING , geo GEOMETRY ) ;
Note , GEOMETRY is general and will take the following values : - POINT - POLYGON - LINESTRING - MULTIPOINT - MULTILINESTRING
- MULTIPOLYGON - GEOMETRYCOLLECTION
Inserting values .
mysql > INSERT INTO spat ( p ) VALUES ( GeomFromText ( ' POINT ( 1 2 ) ' ) ) ;
Displaying values : mysql > select X ( p ) , Y( p ) from spat ; +------+------+ | X( p ) | Y( p ) | +------+------+ | 1 | 2 | +------+------+
Note with " geo " it 's possible to insert combinations mysql > insert into spat ( geo ) values ( GeomFromText ( ' MULTIPOLYGON ( ( ( 0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0 ) ) , ( ( 5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7 , 5 5 ) ) ) ' ) ) ;

2 rows in set ( 0.02 sec ) TIP 35 : Working with Spatial Relationship Functions .
... example will follow TIP 36 : Difficult Column Names , Like `DATE` -- use backtick .
If using " date " as a column name , enclose it in backticks ` as follows : CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , `date` date , ticker varchar ( 5 ) , open float , high float , low float , close float , volume int , timeEnter timestamp ( 14 ) , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) ;
To get 1 day old data reference : http://biz.swcp.com/stocks/#Daily update Statement to load data : mysql > load data infile '/tmp/sp500hst.txt ' into table stocks fields terminated by ' , ' ( date , ticker , open , high , low , close , volume ) ; TIP 37 : Setting up MASTER and SLAVE replication .
The master will need to have binary logging turned on .
MASTER ( These steps are performed on the mysql installation that you have designated as the MASTER ) .
Binary logging needs to be turned on .
Under the [ mysqld ] section in the my.cnf file add log - bin .
You can assign this value to a file .
If you assign it to a file , make sure the directory exists .
My master IP address is 192.168.1.12 with hostname big.squeezel.com .
Step 1 .
Turn on binary logging .
Create the necessary directories .
$ mkdir -p /var / mysql /etc/my.cnf [ mysqld ] log- bin=/var/mysql/mysqlLOGM.log
Step 2 . Restart mysql . $ /etc/init.d/ mysqld restart Step 3 . Create an account on the master that has access to the tables that will be replicated .
mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO admin1@ " % " IDENTIFIED BY ' s3cr3tpass45 '
WITH GRANT OPTION ; Step 4 .
Login to mysql and run the " show master status " command .
mysql > show master status ; +------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+ |
File | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB
| +------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| mysqlLOGb.000021 | 270 | | | +------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
Note the name of the file .
In my case it is " mysqlLOGb.000021 " and the position .
In my case the position is 270 .
This position will update with changes to you database .
You want a quit master to setup master slave replication .
SLAVE ( These steps are performed on the mysql installation that you have designated as the SLAVE ) .
Binary logging does not have to be turned on ; however , it does n't hurt .
If you want all updates logged on the slave , including the ones from the master .
Then , use log - slave - updates .
Step 1 .
Turn on binary logging , including the log - slave - updates .
Create necessary directories , and assign a unique server - id .
$ mkdir -p /var / mysql
The following changes are made in the my.cnf file .
By default this is located in /etc/ my.cnf /etc/my.cnf [ mysqld ] log- bin=/var/mysql/mysqlLOGS30.log log - slave - updates server-id=30 Step 2 . From mysql , in the slave , put in the IP of the Master or the hostname .
mysql > CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='big.squeezel.com ' , MASTER_USER='admin1 ' , MASTER_PASSWORD='s3cr3tpass45 ' , MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysqlLOGb.000021 ' , MASTER_LOG_POS=270 ; START SLAVE ; show slave status ;
This will only log future changes from the point that you implemented the change above .
If you want to get all past changes , execute the following command .
mysql > LOAD DATA FROM MASTER ; Problems : 1 . Make sure the slave can get access to the master .
The account must allow outside access .
Note the grant command above admin1@ " % " .
2 . Sometimes the slave will not catch the changes .
You must stop the slave .
mysql > stop slave ;
Then , run the CHANGE MASTER command above with the correct file name and position .

TIP 38 : Setting up ssl connections .
Step 1 . Create your own CA .
This example is done on Fedora Core 6 as root .
Note , I 'm using password : " password123 " , and filling in the request for Country Name " US " , State " Pennsylvania " respectively .
However , the extra challenge password is not filled out .
Instead , I have just hit return on this option .
It 's very important to record the responses to the questions .
Do it in an emacs session , since you 'll need this information when signing and generating certificates .
[ root@livingroom ~ ] # cd [ root@livingroom ~ ] # mkdir -p /root / certs/mysql/CA [ root@livingroom CA ] # /etc/pki/tls/misc/CA -newca

Enter PEM pass phrase : password123 Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase : password123 -----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request .
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN .
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value , If you enter '.' , the field will be left blank .
----- Country Name ( 2 letter code ) [ GB ] : US US State or Province Name ( full name ) [ Berkshire ] : Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Locality Name ( eg , city ) [ Newbury ] : Elkins Park Elkins Park Organization Name ( eg , company ) [ My Company Ltd]:chirico_Widgets chirico_Widgets Organizational Unit Name ( eg , section ) [] :chirico_Widgets chirico_Widgets Common Name ( eg , your name or your server 's hostname ) [] :livingroom.squeezel.com livingroom.squeezel.com

Certificate is to be certified until Jan 15 16:21:25 2010 GMT ( 1095 days )
Write out database with 1 new entries Data Base Updated [ root@livingroom CA ] #
Step 2 .
Adjust CA expiration , if desired .
Change the number of days the certificate is good for .
Note above , this certificate is good for 1095 days .
Which is fine , but if you needed to extend this , you can do it with the following command .
[ root@livingroom mysql ] # openssl x509 - in ../CA/cacert.pem - days 3650 - out cacert.pem - signkey ../CA/ private/cakey.pem
Getting Private key Enter pass phrase for ../CA / private/cakey.pem:password123
Step 3 . Create Server Certificates .
Here I 'm generating two certificates .
One for the computer livingroom , and one for the computer big.squeezel.com .
Generate a unique certificate for each of your servers .
# mkdir server_certs # openssl req - new - nodes \ - subj '/ CN=livingroom.squeezel.com/O=chirico_Widgets/C=US/ST=Pennsylvania/L=Elkins
Park/emailAddress=chirico@livingroom.mchirico.org '\
- keyout livingroomFOO - key.pem - out livingroomFOO - req.pem - days 3650 # openssl req - new - nodes \ - subj '/CN=big.squeezel.com/O=chirico_Widgets/C=US/ST=Pennsylvania/L=Elkins
Park/emailAddress=chirico@livingroom.mchirico.org '\
- keyout bigFOO - key.pem - out bigFOO - req.pem - days 3650 Step 4 . Sign the certificates .
You 'll be asked for the password during this step .
# openssl ca - days 3650 - out livingroomFOO - cert.pem - infiles livingroomFOO - req.pem # openssl ca - days 3650 - out bigFOO - cert.pem - infiles bigFOO - req.pem Step 5 .
Create a directory for the certs " / etc/ mysql " and copy the files .
# mkdir -p /etc/mysql # cp /root / certs/CA/cacert.pem
/etc/mysql/. # cp /root / certs/mysql/server_certs/*.pem
/etc/mysql/. Step 6 . Edit mysql my.cnf file .
In may case it is " /etc/my.cnf " [ mysqld ] ssl-ca=/etc/mysql/cacert.pem
ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/livingroomFOO-cert.pem
ssl-key=/etc/mysql/livingroomFOO-key.pem
Step 7 . Restart mysql # /etc/init.d/ mysqld restart Step 8 . Create a user that requires ssl .
This is done in mysql .
Do this for each client that will need to connect .
mysql > grant all privileges on *.* to ' admin'@' localhost ' identified by ' pass32rD ' require ssl ; mysql > grant all privileges on *.* to ' admin'@'big.squeezel.com ' identified by ' pass32rD ' require ssl ; Step 9 .
Create the user 's " .my.cnf " file .
For example , for user chirico , the following file is created .
Note how the two servers differ .
This is done of server livingroom for user chirico .
[ chirico@livingroom ~ ] $ cat /home / chirico/.my.cnf [ client ] user=admin password=pass32rD ssl-ca=/etc/mysql/cacert.pem
ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/livingroomFOO-cert.pem
ssl-key=/etc/mysql/livingroomFOO-key.pem [ chirico@big ~ ] $ cat /home/zchirico/.my.cnf [ client ] user=admin password=pass32rD ssl-ca=/etc/mysql/cacert.pem
ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/bigFOO-cert.pem
ssl-key=/etc/mysql/bigFOO-key.pem
Step 10 .
Connect to the server .
[ chirico@big ~ ] $ mysql --host=livingroom.squeezel.com
If you can a value for the Ssl_cipher after you connected , then , your connection is secure .

Yes , there is use for this ... " if " statements sometimes cause problems when used in combination .
The simple secret , and it's also why they work in almost all databases , is the following functions : o sign ( x ) returns - 1,0 , +1 for values x < 0 , x = 0 , x > 0 respectively o abs ( sign ( x ) ) returns 0 if x = 0 else , 1 if x > 0 or x < 0 o 1 - abs ( sign( x ) ) complement of the above , since this returns 1 only if x = 0 Quick example : sign ( - 1 ) = - 1 , abs ( sign ( - 1 ) ) = 1 , 1 - abs ( sign ( - 1 ) ) = 0 Data for full example : CREATE TABLE exams ( pkey int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , name varchar ( 15 ) , exam int , score int , PRIMARY KEY ( pkey ) ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 1,75 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 2,77 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 3,78 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Bob ' , 4,80 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 1,90 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 2,97 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 3,98 ) ; insert into exams ( name , exam , score ) values ( ' Sue ' , 4,99 ) ; mysql > select * from exams ; +------+------+------+-------+ | pkey | name | exam | score |

You may think IF 's would be cleaner .
NO , WATCH OUT !

2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Note the above gives indeterminate results .
Paul DuBois [ paul at snake .
net ] showed me the correct way to perform this select statement .
According to him
When you include a GROUP BY clause in a query , the only values you can select are the grouped columns or summary values calculated from the groups .
If you display additional columns , they 're not tied to the grouped columns and the values displayed for them are indeterminate .
If you rewrite the query like this , you get the correct result : select name , sum ( if ( exam=1 , score , null ) ) as exam1 , sum ( if ( exam=2 , score , null ) ) as exam2 , sum ( if ( exam=3 , score , null ) ) as exam3 , sum ( if ( exam=4 , score , null ) ) as exam4 from exams group by name ; +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 | +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | Bob | 75 | 77 | 78 | 80 | | Sue | 90 | 97 | 98 | 99 | +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ mysql > select name , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 1 ) ) ) ) as exam1 , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 2 ) ) ) ) as exam2 , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 3 ) ) ) ) as exam3 , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 4 ) ) ) ) as exam4 , sum ( score *( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 2 ) ) ) ) - sum ( score *( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 1 ) ) ) ) as delta_1 _2 , sum ( score *( 1- abs ( sign ( exam - 3 ) ) ) ) - sum ( score *( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 2 ) ) ) ) as delta_2_3 , sum ( score *( 1- abs ( sign ( exam - 4 ) ) ) ) - sum ( score *( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 3 ) ) ) ) as delta_3 _4 from exams group by name ; +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+ | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 | delta_1_2 | delta_2_3 | delta_3_4 | +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+ | Bob | 75 | 77 | 78 | 80 | 2 | 1 | 2 | | Sue | 90 | 97 | 98 | 99 | 7 | 1 | 1 | +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

Above delta_1 _2 shows the difference between the first and second exams , with the numbers being positive because both Bob and Sue improved their score with each exam .
Calculating the deltas here shows it 's possible to compare two rows , not columns which is easily done with the standard SQL statements but rows in the original table .

It 's possible to combine Total Increasing Point TotalIncPoints with AVG .
In fact , it 's possible to combine all of the example cuts of the data into one SQL statement , which provides additional options for displaying data on your page select name , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 1 ) ) ) ) as exam1 , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 2 ) ) ) ) as exam2 , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 3 ) ) ) ) as exam3 , sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 4 ) ) ) ) as exam4 , ( sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 1 ) ) ) ) + sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 2 ) ) ) ) ) / 2 as AVG1_2 , ( sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 2 ) ) ) ) + sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 3 ) ) ) ) ) / 2 as AVG2_3 , ( sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 3 ) ) ) ) + sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 4 ) ) ) ) ) / 2 as AVG3_4 , ( sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 1 ) ) ) ) + sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 2 ) ) ) ) + sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 3 ) ) ) ) + sum ( score * ( 1 - abs ( sign ( exam - 4 ) ) ) ) ) / 4 as AVG from exams group by name ; +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------+ | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 | AVG1_2 | AVG2_3 | AVG3_4 | AVG | +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------+ |

Other Tutorials Breaking Firewalls with OpenSSH and PuTTY :
If the system administrator deliberately filters out all traffic except port 22 ( ssh ) , to a single server , it is very likely that you can still gain access other computers behind the firewall .
This article shows how remote Linux and Windows users can gain access to firewalled samba , mail , and http servers .
In essence , it shows how openSSH and Putty can be used as a VPN solution for your home or workplace .
Create a Live Linux CD - BusyBox and OpenSSH Included :
These steps will show you how to create a functioning Linux system , with the latest 2.6 kernel compiled from source , and how to integrate the BusyBox utilities including the installation of DHCP .
Plus , how to compile in the OpenSSH package on this CD based system .
On system boot - up a filesystem will be created and the contents from the CD will be uncompressed and completely loaded into RAM -- the CD could be removed at this point for boot - up on a second computer .
The remaining functioning system will have full ssh capabilities .
You can take over any PC assuming , of course , you have configured the kernel with the appropriate drivers and the PC can boot from a CD .
This tutorial steps you through the whole processes .

At the height of Iran 's bloody civil unrest this year , a young doctor named Ramin Pourandarjani defied his superiors .
He refused to sign death certificates at a Tehran prison that he said were falsified to cover up murder .
He testified to a parliamentary committee that jailers were torturing and raping protesters , his family says .
He told friends and family he feared for his life .
And on Nov. 10 , the 26 - year - old doctor was found dead in the military clinic where he lived and worked .
The family of Dr. Pourandarjani , who occasionally treated prisoners in fulfillment of Iran 's obligatory military service , says he was killed for his refusal to participate in a coverup at the notorious Kahrizak detention center , widely criticized for its unsanitary conditions .
In a series of interviews over three weeks , Dr. Pourandarjani 's family spoke in detail for the first time about their son 's mysterious death .
New York Times headline : “ U.S. Limits Tarmac Waits for Passengers to 3 Hours . ”
Just imagine …
***
Representatives of industry associations reacted negatively to the government action , warning that over - regulation would stifle innovation and harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms .
“ Requiring each plane to stock up on 0.5 - ounce bags of pretzels and peanuts will only hurt passengers , ” said Sam Tapscott of the Airline Roundtable .
“ Airlines will have no choice but to pass the higher costs on to consumers , who will see the price of excessive government intervention in every ticket they buy . ”
More worryingly , some industry analysts warned of dire consequences for the U.S. economy .
“ Forcing airplanes to return to the terminal after three hours will reduce the efficiency of the entire air travel system , ” said David Dell’amore , professor of flight operations at Harvard University .
“ Modern flight management algorithms minimize aggregate wait times and ensure the perfect balance of customer comfort and economic value - added . ”
The problem , experts say , is that the government rushed to create new regulations without considering how market forces could solve the problem .
“ Clearly , if consumers placed a value on a maximum runway wait time , they would have negotiated it with their airlines already , ” said Petra Waterman of the American Enterprise Institute .
“ Since no airline offers such a contract term , we can assume that consumers place no value on it .
Besides , if consumers were not happy with the service they receive from airlines , then a new airline would have already entered the market offering shorter wait times . ”
Ella Ringding of the U.S. Airlines Association agreed that extended tarmac wait times are a problem , but said that the solution should be left to the industry .
“ The U.S. Airlines Association takes very seriously any issues that reduce the satisfaction of our customers , ” she said .
“ We have drafted a model code of conduct for all of our members to address this problem .
According to the model code , airlines should notify passengers whenever they happen to be on a flight that has been waiting on the tarmac for more than three hours , and should repeat that notification every hour .
We believe that by providing sufficient disclosure to our customers , they will be able to make the air travel choices that best suit their individual needs . ”
The airlines have succeeded in convincing major non-airline companies to take their side .
Buddy Banker , a managing director in Citigroup ’s investment banking division , opposed additional government regulation in recent testimony before Congress .
“ Efficient air travel is the foundation on which the health of the U.S. economy rests , ” he said .
“ If American companies cannot rely on an air transport system that is free of meddling from the government , we will be at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies in Europe , where airlines are free to strand their passengers for over three hours .
We can just wave millions of jobs good - bye , and soon we ’ll all be speaking Chinese . ”
Muffy McDonnell , Senate minority leader , promised a bitter fight in Congress .
“ This is just the latest step by the jackbooted thugs in the Obama Administration in their plan to bring socialism to the United States , and we ’re going not going to take it lying down , ” she said at a press conference .
“ The next thing you know , people wo n’t be able to bring guns onto planes . ”
However , not everyone is upset with the new regulation .
One Goldman Sachs derivatives trader , who asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak about company strategy , said that the firm is planning to create a market for derivatives that airlines can use to hedge against the risk of having to return planes to the terminal or having to pay fines to the FAA .
Goldman is thinking of creating “ collateralized delay obligations , ” or CDOs , which will diversify wait - time risk by including flights from across the entire country .
Update : Q points out the opportunity for a carry trade : “ wall street would charge large fees for flying people across the country and then buy them cheap tickets home on greyhound . ”
Update 2 : I did n’t think this was initially necessary , but since a few people may have been confused , I ’d like to point out that this post is a joke .

A Cute Baby Photo
Is the Key to Getting a Lost Wallet Back
If you lose your wallet , how can you make sure someone will return it ?
Include a cute baby photo .
If you lose your wallet , how often do you think someone will be kind enough to return it to you , complete with cash and credit cards intact ?
Some people may be greedy , and others are simply too lazy to bother with the trip to the post office to send back a wallet to a stranger .
But according to a recent psychology study by Dr. Richard Wiseman ( author of the fascinating book Quirkology ) , there ’s one thing that ’ll greatly increase your odds of being reunited with a lost wallet : a photograph of a cute baby .
In last year ’s study , hundreds of wallets were scattered around the streets of Edinburgh , Scotland .
The psychologists wanted to see how many strangers would take the trouble to return them to the addresses listed on the drivers ’ licenses inside — but more than that , they wanted to find out what would make a person more likely to help out a stranger .
To accomplish this , they included personal touches in most of the wallets : some included a photo of a happy elderly couple , some contained a cute puppy , some contained a family portrait , and some held a photo of an adorable baby .
Others had receipts showing that the wallet ’s owner had recently donated to a charity .
Some , as a control group , contained no personal details .
As the psychologists soon discovered , the sight of a smiling baby is enough to warm nearly any heart : only one in 10 of the strangers who retrieved such wallets neglected to return them .
In contrast , the second - most successful image , the puppy , boasted only a 53 percent return rate .
When the wallet included no photograph , it stood only a one in seven chance of being returned to the owner .
The success of the baby photograph speaks to a human compassion for the young that ’s been passed down through the ages , according to Dr. Wiseman .
“ The baby kicked off a caring feeling in people , which is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective , ” he told The Times .
To ensure our species ’ survival , scientists claim that we must feel empathy and compassion for our young .
Scientists say that this study supports the argument that we wo n’t feel compassion only for our own babies , but for any that we see — hence , the overwhelming desire a stranger would feel to return a wallet to the baby ’s parent .
On a more basic level , the study also provides a great tip to help ensure that if your wallet is ever lost , you ’re more than likely to get it back .
“ If you want to increase the chances of your wallet being returned if lost , obtain a photograph of the cutest baby you can find , and ensure that it is prominently displayed , ” said Dr. Wiseman .
Many readers have expressed their incredulity , frustration and , at times , outright anger , with what can be classified simply as a mutual circle jerk among Wall Street 's financial analysts , rushing to upgrade each others ' stocks with impunity .
These analysts have been operating with an S&P and Moody 's like tendency to ignore any and all pitfalls associated with skyrocketing loan losses , coupled with tepid increases by the banks ' taking on necessary reserves to account for what will likely be a collapse in the CRE market , which we at Zero Hedge have been documenting for the past nine months .
Hereby we demonstrate the circular nature of all these activities : the attached graphic shows just how prevalent the ponzi upgrade game has become - among the top 7 banks which have staggering ( and in many cases taxpayer subsidized ) balance sheets and hold all the keys for the next major leg down , there is just one sell rating ( and even that is simply between a European analyst and a European firm ) .
Which begs a new spin on an old question : if a ponzi scheme develops before our eyes and everyone is blissfully ignoring it , has a ponzi ever occurred ( we refer you to the SEC for the answer ) ?
And please do n't be fooled by the red lines : virtually all of them emanate out of CLSA iconoclast Mike Mayo , who has not only always been a lone voice of sanity on Wall Street , but with his harsh language ( he has a sell rating on all major US banks except Goldman ) , Mike has become the defacto new Meredith Whitney .
Whether or not he is proven right will be determined by the outcome of the generational confrontation currently in play between the printing presses of the Federal Reserve ( and China 's desire to assimilate the US middle class as its latest vassal extention ) and the rest of the formerly free markets .
For a good summary of Mike Mayo's contrarian approach to Wall Street we recommend the following WSJ article .
WASHINGTON  A day after Senate Democrats said that they had clinched an agreement on a far - reaching overhaul of the nation ’s health care system , Republicans vowed on Sunday to continue their fight while acknowledging that their chances of stopping Senate passage had faded .
Asked whether he and his fellow Republicans could yet block the bill , John McCain of Arizona seemed resigned to its passage .
“ Probably not , ” he replied on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ We ’ll fight the good fight , we‘ll fight until the last vote . ”
If the Senate bill passed , it would have to be reconciled in conference with the earlier House version .
The two differ substantially ; and a key senator said Sunday that it would be difficult for his chamber to pass anything that varies much from the Senate version .
- Huh ? . . .
Windows in Assembler ?
First off , Assembly Language can be beautiful and legible .
Here are two GIF images of my own code .
This is what I see when I am writing 100 % pure Assembly Language for Windows : Sample # 1 Sample # 2 .
Am I sick ?
Perhaps .
Am I a dinosaur destined for early extinction ?
Yeah , probably .
But I truly love programming .
It 's what I do .
It fulfills me and sustains me . . . and I 'm never in a hurry to " just be done with it . "
I can't stand sloppiness in my work , so for me that means writing the smallest , tightest , fastest , most economical computer programs possible .
And THAT means authoring Windows applications in Assembly Language .
Though the rest of the world may argue that they 're more " productive " ( when measured by hard disk space consumed per second ) , I stand by the principle that : " Small Is Beautiful " .
Small Is Beautiful ?
Sure , I think so .
Do n't you ?
When I began the development of the first Windows application I 'd ever created , ChromaZone , I was determined not to let the fact that I was writing for Windows keep me from creating really great software .
And frankly , I just do n't consider a utility program that 's 4 megabytes big , and contains all sorts of files that the author did n't create , to be " really great software " .
Do you ?
So I needed to figure out how to write Windows Applications in Assembly Language .
( Just as I had created SpinRite and all prior products in my life . )
Well , I did that , and ChromaZone became a testament to what one guy who really cares about quality can produce .
Please allow me to urge you to download and check out the FREE ChromaZone Demo ( 177k ) .
It 's a rather amazing Windows Screen Saver Construction
Set that I wrote in 100 % pure assembly language .
There 's NOTHING TO INSTALL since the ZIP file contains a single executable program that just runs .
The demo program contains 100 separate , customizable , amazing screen savers .
ChromaZone demonstrates , far better than any words could , what one determined guy working alone can produce .
ChromaZone is pretty much the last word in " display hardware palette animation " , so it will require you to temporarily drop your system down into 256 - color mode ... but if you will give it a whirl I know you 'll be quite amazed .
I am not trying to sell you a copy of ChromaZone .
Really , I 'm not .
It 's just a piece of work that I 'm so very proud of , that I 'd really like to share the demo with you if you 'll take a moment to check it out .
It runs on any Windows platform ( Win3/95/98 ) , except NT , since it depends upon the virtual timer vxd ( VTD ) that 's not present in NT .
Anyway ... ChromaZone is 16 - bit Windows Assembly Language Technology .
But before I had it completed the world had ( pretty much unnecessarily ) moved over to the " bigger must be better " 32 - bit world of Windows 95 . << sigh >>
So the next thing I did was to develop the technology to create modern state of the art 32 - bit Windows Applications in the same 100 % pure assembly language .
That 's where I am today .
Every scrap of code I 've written and offer on this web site was written in small , tight , lean and mean assembly language .
You really can feel the difference .
Here 's another example ...
The new ASPI_ME Title Page App :
This 13,824 byte Windows app sports a few good tricks !
For one thing , it 's only 13,824 bytes ! . . . which for any Windows app is a trick in itself !
Next , the " sliding block puzzle " which it presents and solves right before your eyes is generated on the fly and starts out with a different puzzle every time it runs .
And finally , the coolest thing is that ALL of the sound effects are synthesized in realtime , on the fly !
There are NO attached bloated .
WAV files !
That " grande finale " sound  reministent of the THX sound  is generated by a 36 - operator , 18 - voice , polyphonic , frequency modulation ( FM ) sound effects synthesizer that I created in software just for the purpose .
My plan is that future products will be " sound effect enabled " where they user can customize the " amount " of sound effects and the program will " re-synthesize " all of the effects , on the fly , to suit individual taste .
So , this little title page was my excuse for developing the technology . . .
It 's only 13,824 bytes so check it out !
Many visitors to this site have asked if I could provide them with some help getting started authoring 32 - bit Windows Applications in Assembly Language .
So I created the " Small Is Beautiful " Starter Kit containing everything you 'd need to assemble a full - function , state of the art 32 - bit Windows Application in assembly language . . .
The Small Is Beautiful Starter Kit :
The file is 20 k . . .
Sorry it 's so big , but I included all of the source code and header files , as well as a copy of the finished SIB.EXE so you could see the result even if you did n't have the other required assembly tools !
SIB.ZIP ( 20 k ) --
This zip file contains all of the files necessary to assemble a state of the art 32 - bit Windows Application ... written in nothing but assembly language ( it also contains the executable SIB.EXE app so that you can see what it looks like and browse the files even if you do n't own a copy of Microsoft's Macro Assembler , MASM , or Linker ) .
The App includes a toolbar with standard icons , tool tips , a status bar and common dialogs .
And ... of course ... full source code for the entire project .
Assembly Language Resources on the Web . . .
Even though Assembly Language programming seems to be a lost and dying art , the Web is chock full of interesting and useful resources .
Here are some of the better goodies I 've uncovered in my travels :
Hutch 's MASM pages
This site contains a wealth of information and great source code examples .
Be SURE to also check out Hutch 's links to other resources .
They 're great too !
Assembly Programming Journal ( WARNING !
This " freeservers " site will probably pop -up annoying browser windows ! )
This is a terrific resource for articles relating to assembly language programming .
Softpanorama University Assembler Links
This page describes Softpanorama as the : " Slightly Skeptical " Open Source Software Educational Society .
But no matter WHAT they call themselves , this is a page LOADED with great links to terrific resources .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
The 37Kb V2 Operating System .
The world has a new Intel - compatible operating system written in 10015d4d58ure assembly language .
It 's cool and fun .
Check it out !
The Art of Assembly Language .
( Online HTML & Offline PDF )
An INCREDIBLE resource for assembly language beginners , or those needing to know how to use the free copy of MASM and LINK they downloaded from Microsoft 's site .
" The Art of Assembly Language Programming " is a textbook on machine organization and assembly language programming developed and written by Randall Hyde for his CS264 ( Assembly Language Programming ) course at Cal Poly Pomona and US Riverside .
The Netwide Assembler Project .
NASM is the Netwide Assembler , a free portable assembler for the Intel 80x86 microprocessor series , which uses the traditional Intel instruction mnemonics and syntax .
It 's multiplatform , running under MS - DOS , Win9x & NT , OS /2 , Linux and other Unixes on 8086 / Alpha / SPARC /etc .
It 's written in ANSI C and the source is available .
See Also : The NASM - IDE site .
A free Integrated Development Environment for NASM .
The SERIOUSLY cool Intel Secrets Site .
If you like the idea of " undocumented " instructions and unauthorized info , you 'll get a kick out of this site !
One of my favorites is the Pentium " RDTSC "
Adam Stanislav's " Whiz Kid Technomagic " site .
Adam 's enthusiasm for Windows programming with assembler shows .
He provides lots of sample source code on a wide variety of topics .
